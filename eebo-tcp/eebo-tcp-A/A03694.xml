            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There are great infirmities in our best works, yet if we striue against our <hi>imperfections,</hi> and labour to <hi>perfection,</hi> the euill that we doe shall not bee remembred, the good that wee would doe, shall bee taken as done: for we are by <hi>imputation,</hi> what we are in affection; and hee is no sinner, who for the loue that he beareth to <hi>righteousnesse</hi> desireth to be none. If (then) we would be <hi>perfect</hi> in Gods account and by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and bee meanes to make others so, wee must <hi>attend to reading,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>weare the Booke of God in our hands, hauing it alway with vs, Deut.</hi> 17.19. The practise of this we reade, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.97; <hi>Oh how loue I thy law, it is my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation continually!</hi> Where the <hi>Prophet</hi> sheweth that the loue of God is the loue of his word, and that so much as we loue him, so much wee loue his truth.

                           <hi>King</hi> must exercise it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. and God be thanked that our <hi>King</hi> is so well exercised in it. Now is it necesssary for the <hi>King</hi> often to reade in the word, to teach him to rule? and is it not as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for common persons, and all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours</hi> (that haue more time) to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in it, that they may learne to obay? Is it necessarie for him to grow learned by reading, and by meditation to bee made wise in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that he may not by the <hi>swelling of the heart</hi> (a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous disease in <hi>Kings</hi>) commaund things vnlawfull and intolerable? and is it not as necessary for these, with like diligence, to exercise themselues in the word, that in too great a basenesse of minde they yeeld not themselues (seruilely) to <hi>obay man rather then God</hi>? That we may giue our selues (thus) to the studie of the word, we must pray that we may loue it: for where loue is, there is delight; and what we loue to doe, that we delight to doe. The <hi>rich man</hi> loueth to be rich, and therefore meditateth of <hi>riches.</hi> The <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious</hi> person loueth <hi>prayse,</hi> and therfore casteth to be <hi>praysed.</hi> The <hi>Naturall man</hi>

loueth <hi>naturally,</hi> and therefore liueth <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>: and so, if we had no greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, wealth, or glorie, then to meditate in the word, our loue (this way) would constraine vs continually to reade and meditate in the same.</p>

                        <head>The Reasons.</head>
                        <p>It is our calling and dutie (as vve are Christians) to please God in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement; and therefore it is against our Christian dutie and vocation to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, by sinne, in any. What <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> will allow a <hi>Seruant,</hi> who in some things shall serue him carefully, &amp; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some be carelesse of his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements? and vvill our <hi>Master in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>

commend vs, or discharge vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vve haue done some things vvell, hauing offended and done vvickedly in many? What though thou be no <hi>Thiefe,</hi> nor <hi>Murtherer,</hi> nor <hi>Fornicator,</hi> nor <hi>Swearer,</hi> nor <hi>Drunkard</hi>; if thou <hi>breake the Sabbath,</hi> thou hast grieuously offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for as one disease may bring death as well as many: so this one sinne (<hi>vnput off,</hi> and vnrepented of) may damne thee as well as many sinnes may. Secondly, euery sinne is a dishonour to God: but vve Christians are bound, not onely to <hi>honour God,</hi> but to abstaine from his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour; as it is the dutie of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, not onely to doe the King reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but to do nothing to his reproach. Thirdly, <hi>God is of pure eyes, and cannot see euill</hi>; so saith the Prophet <hi>Habaccuk, Chap.</hi> 1.13. where he saith (simply) <hi>euill,</hi> and not (definitely) <hi>this, or that euill</hi>: as if he had sayd, <hi>God can see no euill</hi>; and therefore he must abstaine from <hi>all euill,</hi> that vvill see God. No <hi>Lazar</hi> is more loathsome to Man, then sinne is to him. A sore eye offends a sound eye; and much more an <hi>euill eye,</hi> Gods <hi>pure eyes.</hi> It is a
<pb facs="tcp:21855:60"/>
true doctrine (therefore) that <hi>Christians</hi> must not thinke it enough to auoyde <hi>some sinnes,</hi> except they abstaine from <hi>all iniquitie.</hi>

which hee cannot abide, that is his griefe. The same must vexe vs (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that grieueth him, and we must be so moued with offences, as, in the meane while, we be troubled that a Brother hath so offended: and as the good Phisitian may loue his Patient, and yet minister sharply to his disease: so hee that is his Brothers Christian <hi>Phisitian,</hi> may, in loue to his Brother, spare his Brother that hath offended, and yet deale roughly with the offenders sinne. Secondly, the person in his substance, is Gods creature. Now all that <hi>God maketh is good, Gen.</hi> 1.31. and nothing is to bee hated that good is.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21855:78"/>
of sinne is in the corruption of the soule, which wee call the <hi>heart that is euill from our youth, Gen.</hi> 8.21. For the heart is not heere taken for that fleshly part that is in the middle of the body, which wee call the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of vitall bloud, but for the soule in the corruption of it, or faculties corrupted. And so our Sauiour is to be vnderstood, when he sayth, that <hi>out of the heart,</hi> that is, out of the powers of the heart corrupted, <hi>proceede euill thoughts, murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders, Mat.</hi> 15.19. for all these <hi>spawne</hi> in the heart. <hi>Lust</hi> in the heart <hi>begetteth</hi>; and the heart by <hi>lust beareth,</hi> and bringeth to forme and shape all these filthy sinnes.

actions of life</hi>; to wit, by good regard, but of death by negligence without regard, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23. Other things may occasion sinne, but our hearts cause it. <hi>Ioseph</hi> saw as well as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and with more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, but <hi>Ioseph</hi> looked to his heart: <hi>Dauid</hi> (in part regenerate) neglected it: therefore <hi>Ioseph,</hi> though tempted by the <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>eare,</hi> had a good issue of his temptation; <hi>Dauid,</hi> in a like temptation, not considering his weaknes, and careles of his heart, was foiled, and did yeeld.

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Reasons.</head>
                        <p>First, if we speake of actuall sinne, the roote of it is in the soule, as the branches of it are in the outward parts: for there is no sinne actuall, but the will is in it. Now the body is not the seat of our will, but our reasonable soule, which is sayd to haue in it two principall faculties, the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>vnderstanding.</hi> Secondly, the heart doth carry with it, euery way, all our outward senses, and (as the Heathen man could say) it is not the <hi>eye</hi> that seeth, but the <hi>heart</hi>; nor the <hi>eare</hi> that heareth, but the <hi>heart</hi>: and so of the other senses; which doth further appeare: For let there be great sounds and much noyse in a place, yet if our heart be earnestly set vpon some other matter, our eares that attend the heart, neither heare the sound, nor listen to the noyse: yea, sometime we stumble in the playne ground, and our feete fayle vs in faire places, because our feet are carryed with our hearts that minde some other matter. Thirdly, it is the heart that maketh or marreth all our actions; which proueth that the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:21855:80"/>
of goodnesse or vice is in the heart, and the <hi>streame</hi> of them in the outward senses: for as the heart is in an action, so it is accepted both of God and man. Giue a small thing with a good heart, and it is well taken; but offer a better thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and it is not regarded: and wherefore not regarded? but because, not the gift, but the minde of the giuer is wont to be considered. So a man may leaue a sinne, and not be innocent: for example; he may refrayne Adulterie, and yet be an Adulterer; and forbeare to steale, and yet be a Thiefe: for the heart may loue Adulterie, though the body be cleane; and a Thiefe (without the hatred of theft) not dare to robbe, lest the lawe proceede against him. Shame, or want of opportunitie may make an Adulterer in heart, no Adulterer in act; and feare of the law may keepe a Thiefe true, when his <hi>heart,</hi> before God, and by the <hi>verdict</hi> of his owne <hi>conscience,</hi> is a shamelesse Thiefe.</p>

actions that depend vpon vs, and be in our power, there is small difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the doing of them, and suffering them to be done, saue that (sometimes) he may haue more fault that permitteth euill, then he that doth it: for hee that doth it, may be mooued to it by some temptation of benefit or sudden desire; but he that suffereth it (when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it) if hee be a great Commaunder, receiueth discredit by it in his place of <hi>Honour,</hi> and hurt in the people which he gouerneth, who from the <hi>bad ayre</hi> of so corrupt an example, may draw in a very dangerous <hi>infection.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> doth it with intended profit, the <hi>other</hi> suffereth it with apparent hurt; and who hath the greater sinne?

                        <p>But, the Prophet mentioneth here, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other vvicked sinners, whom <hi>hee</hi> would put from his <hi>court</hi> &amp; <hi>presence, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of lies.</hi> What <hi>he</hi> meaneth by such vve haue heard, &amp; <hi>they</hi> are contrary to those <hi>who speake the truth from the heart, Psal.</hi> 15.2. A <hi>lyar</hi> is <hi>hee</hi> vvho speaketh an vntruth weetingly, or the truth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then he thinketh. And, a <hi>lye</hi> is a false speech, vented willingly, and with a minde to deceiue. Where, vvee are to put a difference between a <hi>lye</hi> and an <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,</hi> and him that is a <hi>lyar,</hi> and that speaketh <hi>vntruly.</hi> For, <hi>hee</hi> may be said to speake an <hi>vntruth,</hi> who rashly spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, thinking it to be true: and <hi>he</hi> may bee called a <hi>lyar,</hi> who eyther speaketh
<pb facs="tcp:21855:131"/>
that which <hi>hee</hi> knoweth to be false, or speaketh the <hi>truth,</hi> but <hi>falsely,</hi> that is, with a minde to deceiue. The one hath no truth in <hi>his mouth,</hi> and the other hath much deceipt in <hi>his heart.</hi> The one, <hi>speaking a lye</hi> (as it is sayd of the Deuill) <hi>speaketh of his owne, Iohn</hi> 8.44. the other, <hi>speaking a truth,</hi> resembleth the Deuill, who, euen vvhen <hi>hee speaketh the truth,</hi> is a <hi>lyar, Matth.</hi> 4.6. Therefore, there are two sorts of <hi>lyes:</hi> the first, when a man speaketh not as the thing is; the second, vvhen <hi>hee</hi> speaketh as the thing is, but deceitfully. The first, which is a reall <hi>lye,</hi> is likewise of two sorts: the first, when a man speaketh an <hi>vntruth</hi> against his minde and knowledge, and this is the chiefe kinde of <hi>lying,</hi> from vvhence in the Latine it hath the name. For, <hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiri,</hi> is, <hi>contra mentem ire.</hi> The second, when a man (<hi>inconsiderately</hi>) vttereth an <hi>vntruth,</hi> thinking <hi>he</hi> speaketh true. And this, though it be a <hi>lye,</hi> in the generall terme, yet <hi>hee</hi> vvho vttereth it, cannot be called a <hi>lyar,</hi> because his vvords agree vvith his minde, though <hi>they</hi> agree not vvith the thing. Therefore, here by a
<pb facs="tcp:21855:131"/>
                           <hi>teller of lyes,</hi> vvee must vnderstand, one that speaketh eyther an vntruth against his minde, or the truth with an ill minde: and this is <hi>hee,</hi> who knowing that which <hi>hee</hi> speaketh to be true, coueteth to be vnderstood otherwaies then <hi>he</hi> speaketh, that is, otherwayes then the truth is. As (therefore) a man may vtter an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and yet be no <hi>lyar,</hi> so <hi>hee</hi> may be a <hi>lyar</hi> in speaking the truth, vvhen <hi>he</hi> doth not speake it with a simple heart. Which proueth, that to the speaking of the truth, that is in a mans heart, a double agreement is required; the one, of the tongue with the minde; the other, of the minde with the things themselues. And to this is opposed the double falsehood that was spoken of: as when a man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which is false, or the truth, but falsely. So we haue heard of <hi>lying,</hi> and the kindes thereof. From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a teller of <hi>lyes,</hi> (such an one as the Prophet here meaneth to put out of <hi>his house</hi> and <hi>sight,</hi>) is <hi>he</hi> that speaketh that as true, which <hi>hee</hi> knoweth to bee <hi>false,</hi> and that which is true falsely, and not with a simple heart.

It pleased, that your Religious and (truly) godly Father, to seeke Mee out in a darke skie, or night of distresse, to doe me good:
<pb facs="tcp:21855:159"/>
which he spared not to doe while he liued; For, as another <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed mee, <hi>2 Tim. 1.16.</hi> the Lord giue mercy to his House, and Posteritie for it.

                  <p>But what neede I to embalme him (being dead) with my report, who (liuing) had so good report of all who knew him, and the grace in him: and dying sweetly in the peace of his Master, and his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, like that boxe of oyntment, which (being very precious) the woman powred on Christs head, in his breaking by death, cast forth that name, that is better then the best oyntment, <hi>Eccles. 7.3.

For you that now liue, the Heire of his House, and (I trust)
<pb facs="tcp:21855:159"/>
of his good minde in good things. You are to remember (as I hope you forget not) that your life is in that age and time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may, as in the morning, sow your seed, <hi>Eccles. 11.6.</hi> the good seed of the doctrine of saluation, in the field of your owne heart, and furrowes of those that are of your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and proper charge.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you, let not your hand rest, and bee diligent to take heed to your selfe, and them, for all necessarie instruction in the way of life: so tilling them, spiritually, for GOD, and his true feare, that your whole House may bee as the field of the righteous, which the Lord will blesse, and the name of it may be, <hi>The Lord is there, Ezek. 48.35.</hi> So did your good Father in the middes of <hi>You,</hi> whiles he liued: and so (good Sir) doe you constantly in the mids of your owne House, by his example, who (now is gone. Hee learned of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who commaunded his householde after him in such matters, <hi>Genes. 18.19.</hi> and learne <hi>You</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> that the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> may follow <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Yours.</hi> I write not doubtingly, and I haue good confidence in the Lord, that you are so minded. In which
<pb facs="tcp:21855:160"/>
good meaning, and intention of yours, to a worke so full of spiritual consolation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, you must looke for aduersaries. The more truelie you feare God, the more you shall finde what enmitie is against it. Looke for this in euery good purpose vnder the Sunne. The world that is not of the fashion of Heauen, <hi>Rom. 12.2.</hi> will be against you. The flesh, that is all for it selfe, <hi>Rom. 13.14.</hi> will lust against the Spirit, and the good motions of the Spirit in you, <hi>Galat. 5.17.</hi> and the Deuill (the Centurion of the band) will pursue you with his armies of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on your right hand, and on your left, <hi>Ephes. 6.12.</hi> But <hi>Hee</hi> that is with you is stronger then all these, and, as long as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> is your leader, and his Angels your fellow-Souldiours, what can doe you hurt? if God be on your side, what matter who be against you? <hi>Rom. 8.31.</hi> If you loue the loue of Christ with all your heart; who, or what shall separate you from it? who, or what shall make you to forsake it? <hi>vers. 35.</hi> Neither the worlds iniuries, nor the fleshes allurements, nor all the mallice of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ouer all which you are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, through him that hath loued you,

                  </p>
                  <p>Striue (therefore) forward (cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) in this narrow way of life: fight the good fight of Faith to the end: whet your heart vpon the Word, and make the Statutes of <hi>IEHOVA,</hi> your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Counsellours: pray in your holy Faith: holde that you haue with increase<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

meditations that follow, concerning the sinne and punishment of the prodigall sonne: perswading my selfe that of Him you haue nothing in you but his repentance, and grace to come home to your heauenly Father, where you haue with Him (young and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly) in anything; (and who hath not in <note n="b" place="margin">

Gate, which he wrought so fearefully, and so lately among vs? And, is it euer too late and vnseasonable, to shew to the world how graciously, and how strangely, the Lords late mercies got the better hand of his other fearefull workes, by taking his frownes from the skie, and by putting a more louing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon it, in the blessed weather that ensued? I call it the Lords mercie, or not the least of those mercies that are ouer all his workes, <hi>Psal. 145.9.</hi> For, did our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or any worke of ours seeke and finde that comfortable alteration at Gods hands? Or, did not the greatest number desire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more kindely season, and complaine of a season so (generally) hurtfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate with sinne in their right hand? was one Sabbath for all that power of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that so cracked about our eares, and pouring Raine that so fell vpon the Earth, that is, in such abundance, that it made Brookes and Riuers to rise, and the water to stand in the Furrowes, lesse prophaned in Towne and Countrie?

<pb facs="tcp:21855:164"/>
downe three parables. The first, of the <hi>lost Sheepe,</hi> vers. 4.5. the second, of the <hi>lost Groat,</hi> vers. 8.9.10. and the third, of the <hi>prodigall and lost Sonne,</hi> vers. 11.12.13. &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter. The occasion is to be seen in the first, and second verses, which was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of many Publicans and sinners to Christ, and for it, the murmuring of the Scribes and Pharisies against Christ.</p>
                     <p>In this parable of the Prodigall and lost sonne, two things are spoken of principally, as the Father and his two sonnes in the literall sence: and God the father, and his children, of different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and wayes, in the mysticall. For, by the elder, or bragging sonne, are meant the Scribes and Pharisies, and by the yonger, and prodigall, Publicans and sinners. The first sort seemed to liue in the bosome of God, the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to liue in the botom of the wrath of God. The one kinde were (seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) righteous, the other (apparantly) prophane. The one in the Church, and vnder the Law, the other not in the Church, nor vnder a law, but out of it,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:164"/>
and without law, in their farre country of sinne.</p>
                     <p>And so by the lost Sonne, wee may vnderstand such sinners as are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the broad way of their sinnes to the path of life, and yet are (secretly) marked to saluation, and shall be (mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully) called to repentance in the Lords good time, as the lost sonne here. Of him my purpose is to speake now, and but of some of the Parable concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him; as of his sinne, and entry-dore to Repentance. His sinne is, that that which was before, <hi>hee receaued his portion</hi>; or, after <hi>he had receaued it.</hi> His sinne before <hi>he receaued his portion,</hi> was his greedinesse to haue it, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in calling for it: His sinne after <hi>he receaued it,</hi> was his leauing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Fathers house: and, after hee had depriued him of the comfort of a Sonne, and (vniustly) of that portion that belonged not to such a Sonne, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of his goods with a riotous life. And this is spoken of in this 13. verse. where we haue that, that was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his sinne, and the sin it selfe. The
<pb facs="tcp:21855:165"/>
occasion was his gathering together of his goods, and that substance which his Father had giuen him. And heere our Sauiour, by the Euangelist, sheweth how dangerous a thing <hi>fulnesse</hi> is, euen to Gods owne children, by abuse. For, it is said, <hi>when hee had gathered all together, &amp;c.</hi> the meaning is, when hee was left to <hi>himselfe,</hi> and to his owne <hi>caruing,</hi> in these outward things, hauing Mony in his purse, and the <hi>raines</hi> of <hi>himselfe</hi> in his owne hand, he would endure his Fathers house and seruice no longer, but hasted out of it, as out of some <hi>close Prison,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the <hi>open Aire</hi> of Liberty, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part farre enough from his <hi>Fathers</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and feare, that nothing might stop his way to the dissolute life hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to passe with sinners, out of Gods Church, in a strange land. So long as hee was at his fathers finding, stinted by him, it doth not appeare that <hi>hee poured out</hi> himselfe to any such riot: but after his portion came to his owne hands, <hi>hee went into a farre Countrie</hi> with it, and <hi>wasted it with riotous liuing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The point here taught, is: Men had

                        </gap> that <hi>they might be sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to destruction in it</hi>: and <hi>their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, their ruine</hi>: that is that that <hi>wall</hi> of a prosperous and wealthy estate, to which <hi>they so leaned,</hi> in their contempt of God, and rage against his people, might <hi>fall vpon them,</hi> and in that great <hi>fall,</hi> send them from a peaceable life to <hi>perdition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this he prayeth for, with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the spirit of <hi>prophesie</hi> that was in him, of their reprobate estate, and that they were the enemies <hi>whom the Lord would destroy.</hi> But, what furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their sinne, and hastened their end more or sooner, then vnsanctified ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that <hi>hill</hi> which they supposed to be so <hi>strong</hi> in their vnmoueable <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie?

<pb facs="tcp:21855:166"/>
and well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.2.21. But, hauing a kingdome, and being King, he left <hi>the Lord,</hi> and did much wickednesse. Sathan would haue <hi>set vp Christ</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, as <hi>vpon an hill,</hi> thinking that if any estate could, a full estate would make him <hi>fall from God, and fall downe to him.</hi> But Satan could <hi>finde nothing in Christ, Iohn</hi> 14.30. that is, nothing for his purpose in any temptation, though hee found corruption enough in others, euen the best, after they were tempted in such manner: for, when <hi>Dauid</hi> had <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>ease,</hi> by such <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>ease,</hi> he faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the point of this naile in him, and droue it to the head in his adulterie, and bloody sinne, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Peter,</hi> feeling the fire of a warme estate, denied his Master by feare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.18.25.27.</p>
                     <p>And (therefore) as the milde and gentle beames of the Sunne haue more force vpon a wayfaring man, then the strongest gale of winde that bloweth in the skie: for, the Sunne, by his warme beames, maketh him to cast off his Cloake, and to put off his Coate, as a burthen too heauie to be borne, where
<pb facs="tcp:21855:166"/>
the vvinde, with his loude and colde blasts maketh him both faster to holde, and more closely to wrap about him, both Cloake and Coate: so the vvarme Sunne of prosperitie can make vs more naked to God by sinne, then the colde winde of times, blustering with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Therefore hath a Christian more neede in prosperitie to watch sinne, then in dayes of aduersitie and trouble: which may further be proued by these reasons following.</p>

                        <list>
                           <item>First, Satan hath more cords to binde vs, in those temptations which are on our right hand, fet from profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and honour, then in those which are on our left, drawne from aduersitie, want, and basenesse. Which made him to reserue his temptation, taken from prosperitie, to the last place, in which he reposed all, as in his best weapon, or vveapon of proofe.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, prosperitie is a slipperie path: a man may soone fall in such a vvay: but aduersitie is a more rugged and sure way, not so apt to faile vs.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, in a full life, we haue more
<pb facs="tcp:21855:167"/>
meanes of sinning, then in a bare estate. For what will not wealth doe to the help of riot, that pouertie cannot? A poore man cannot offend by drunkennesse, by whoredome, by oppression, by fulnesse of bread, by garish apparell, as a rich man may.</item>

Meane while, whose Martyrs bee such? Gods? or the Deuils? vvhose day keepe they?

The reasons.</p>
                        <p>The first, may bee taken from the contrarietie that is betweene such lusting ones, and Gods faithfull ones. For, as the true Christian giues all to God, so the carnal man giues all to his lusts, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 23.5.6.11.12. <hi>&amp;c.

                        <p>Secondly, they that are lusts seruants, will doe any thing at lusts bidding: and, what did this lost Sonne with-hold from his lusts which he serued? They that are taken with the net of the <hi>whorish woman,</hi> will they not, for her sake, <hi>bring all to a morsell of bread? Prou.</hi> 6.26.

owne Land so full of whoredomes, so poore by vvhoredome, and other lusts, on which so many haue consumed all, their soules and all, giue too plentifull vvitnesse to this truth?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, all things are vile to that a man doth most affect: for, if wee loue God best, what will vvee not doe for him? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. and, if we loue the world best, vvhat vvill vve not take from God to giue to it?

must (first) <hi>mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.13. Now, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>flesh,</hi> is so to keepe downe the soule in that part vvhich is <hi>fleshly,</hi> that it shall command vs in nothing: or, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; is to doe nothing for it, in nothing to gratifie it, and to take all life from it.

                        <p>But the sickenesse of desire being vvithin, how can things vvithout vs bee the cure of it? Is the dropsie cured vvith a parcell of Land, with a portion

                        <p>Lust is a dropsie of the minde; and will things helpe it, that belong onely to the bodie, and can (properly) satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the minde in nothing? therefore, by thy spirit the deeds of the flesh must be mortified; that is, by following the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; not by lusting after carnall things.

                        </p>
                        <p>A third good meane to subdue lust, is to consider that wee are out of our

                        <hi>For, the man and his wife hid themselues from the presence of the Lord God among the Trees of the Garden, Gen.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                     <p>And (here) behold (in this lost Sonne) the old <hi>Adam</hi> of disobedience to God, <hi>hiding himselfe among</hi> one of <hi>the Trees of the garden,</hi> rather then hee will come backe to his Father, who, in the voyce of affliction, calleth to him, saying; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, where art thou? Gen.</hi> 3.9. But, this appeareth in kinde, considered in <hi>Cain,</hi> who being a vagabond from God, and runne-a-gate in the earth, did neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, because neuer brought backe by him that turneth his Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Dauid,</hi> Gods deare Childe, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by his Adultery and bloudy sinne, from his Fathers house, with this lost Sonne, thought not of returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by sound conuersion, till after three quarters of a yeeres absence or more, God sent <hi>Nathan</hi> his Prophet with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to bring him by the words of his Parable, and by the interpretation of them, saying vnto him; <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1.2.7. Hee that saith, <hi>Returne yee Sonnes of Adam,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:191"/>
Psal.</hi> 90.3. knoweth that the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot returne, till hee turne them, who (onely) ordereth the goings of man. So that stray-sheepe of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, with whom CHRIST had confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, wandered further and further, in her taunting speeches, from her direct saluation, and from God her Sauiour, till CHRIST stopped her, by telling her what shee had done, and how nought shee had beene, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.11.15.17. for, hee said, <hi>Thou hast well said, I haue no Husband: for, hee whom thou now hast, is not thy Husband, verse</hi> 17.18. Thus it is cleare that man stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, cannot returne till God turne him.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons are. Man departeth not from God but by sinne, nor retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but by Repentance, but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is Gods gift, and none can turne to God, except hee be first turned of him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.19. And (therefore) our comming backe, when we wander from him, is his worke.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for this, lost man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a stray and lost sheepe, vvhich
<pb facs="tcp:21855:192"/>
will wander further and further from his Pasture till his Shepheard seeke him, and bring him home, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. For, so the wandering sinner will stray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or returne till God haue mercy vpon him.</p>

And if we consider our first birth: are wee not borne of fornication? but doe Children of fornication any thing that can please God? doe they, or can they, in any thing helpe forward their second and new birth? or, are they not desperate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to it?

But how long had hee peace in his dayes, that had such peace in his wealth? Hee fell into a pleasant dreame of many yeers to come, who had not the respite of one whole night to prouide for his end so neare.

Some neuer suspect their eyes, till they haue taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session (as did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.1.16.) where they haue no title: and some, in a couetous heart inclose that, as with a quicke-hedge, or stone-wall, that should lie open in their goodnesse to the Saints, as common prouision. But let vs not straiten in a time of shewing mercie, the bowles of mercy, that should be enlarged: and let vs (betimes) resist the world, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the couetous desire, before it come to couetousnes indeed; bringing it to shame, before it make vs ashamed, and casting it off, before it make God to cast vs off, as hard-harted and mercilesse to his poore.</p>

<list>
                           <item>First, it is profitable for the children of God to feele want where they haue made waste; that, schooled with the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a lower estate, they may learne hereafter to follow temperance, and to flie excesse. And, it is necessary for the children of destruction to be brought by the paine of want, to a sence of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:208"/>
that they may see (for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation) in what they haue sinned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.41.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, it is iust that the abuse of a good thing should be punished with the absence and losse of that good thing which is so abused: but this our being (all) for the belly, to pamper it, what is it but to abuse vnto sin those good things, which, for such abuse, may iustly be taken from vs! <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.5. compared with <hi>Am.</hi> 6.4.6.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, of such curious and daintie feeders, it is true that we read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Their table is a snare vnto them, and their prosperitie their ruine.</hi> There is a table that deceaueth others. Of this it is said, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.3. <hi>their daintie meates are deceitfull meate.</hi> But this table, running ouer with excesse, <hi>deceaueth those who prepare it</hi> (not for strength and honest delight) but for <hi>laughter and drunkennesse, Eccl.</hi> 10.17.19. for, it bringeth those by a secret waste and iust punishment, to vnrecouerable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that maintaine it.</item>

                        <p>And therefore the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> when hee would stirre vp to attention the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest hearers, and furthest from hearing, doth direct his speech to Drunkards,

                     <p>Thus he came to himselfe; and after, by opening, with this key, the Closet of his heart where his Bookes of account lay, came to his Father.

trying it by the <hi>touch</hi> of Gods Words, when they haue met with it, that they may come to amendment.

Thus, nothing shall be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them that serue God: the reasons are: First, God hath promised to feed al his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.3. Now, God will doe what he promiseth to doe; for, <hi>he is faithfull:</hi> and can doe what he will; for, <hi>he is Almightie.</hi> Secondly, Gods seruants depend on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:219"/>
and take his word for their vvhole estate: <hi>their eyes are vnto him, Psal.</hi> 123.1.2. and their repose is in his <hi>prouidence:</hi> and vvill he cause their <hi>eyes to faile? Iob</hi> 31.16. Thirdly, if it be a iust thing that the Master of a Familie should prouide for all he hath in his familie, vvhether the children of the house, or seruants in the house: will not the iust God count it as iust and fitting for him to doe as much for his Familie and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: <hi>to wit,</hi> for the familie of his Saints, and the household of Faith.</p>
