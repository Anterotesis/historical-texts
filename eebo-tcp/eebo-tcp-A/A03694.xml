            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There are great infirmities in our best works, yet if we striue against our <hi>imperfections,</hi> and labour to <hi>perfection,</hi> the euill that we doe shall not bee remembred, the good that wee would doe, shall bee taken as done: for we are by <hi>imputation,</hi> what we are in affection; and hee is no sinner, who for the loue that he beareth to <hi>righteousnesse</hi> desireth to be none. If (then) we would be <hi>perfect</hi> in Gods account and by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and bee meanes to make others so, wee must <hi>attend to reading,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>weare the Booke of God in our hands, hauing it alway with vs, Deut.</hi> 17.19. The practise of this we reade, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.97; <hi>Oh how loue I thy law, it is my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation continually!</hi> Where the <hi>Prophet</hi> sheweth that the loue of God is the loue of his word, and that so much as we loue him, so much wee loue his truth.

                           <hi>King</hi> must exercise it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. and God be thanked that our <hi>King</hi> is so well exercised in it. Now is it necesssary for the <hi>King</hi> often to reade in the word, to teach him to rule? and is it not as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for common persons, and all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours</hi> (that haue more time) to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in it, that they may learne to obay? Is it necessarie for him to grow learned by reading, and by meditation to bee made wise in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that he may not by the <hi>swelling of the heart</hi> (a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous disease in <hi>Kings</hi>) commaund things vnlawfull and intolerable? and is it not as necessary for these, with like diligence, to exercise themselues in the word, that in too great a basenesse of minde they yeeld not themselues (seruilely) to <hi>obay man rather then God</hi>? That we may giue our selues (thus) to the studie of the word, we must pray that we may loue it: for where loue is, there is delight; and what we loue to doe, that we delight to doe. The <hi>rich man</hi> loueth to be rich, and therefore meditateth of <hi>riches.</hi> The <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious</hi> person loueth <hi>prayse,</hi> and therfore casteth to be <hi>praysed.</hi> The <hi>Naturall man</hi>

loueth <hi>naturally,</hi> and therefore liueth <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>: and so, if we had no greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, wealth, or glorie, then to meditate in the word, our loue (this way) would constraine vs continually to reade and meditate in the same.</p>

                        <p>It is our calling and dutie (as vve are Christians) to please God in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement; and therefore it is against our Christian dutie and vocation to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, by sinne, in any.

Secondly, euery sinne is a dishonour to God: but vve Christians are bound, not onely to <hi>honour God,</hi> but to abstaine from his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour; as it is the dutie of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, not onely to doe the King reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but to do nothing to his reproach.

Now if an vnregenerate heart in one tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie renued, did so soone and dangerously yeeld to euill, what may the best iudge of his heart at this day? and how will it riot, if he doe not set a <hi>guard</hi> of diligence about it, and keepe it vnder many <hi>tutor?</hi> But not to speake of a <hi>froward heart,</hi> in which sinne is Crowned King, and ruleth by sundry <hi>lusts</hi>; what shall wee say of a heart, such as <hi>Dauid</hi> had, how quickly may (euen that) for the corruption dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it, be allured to wickednes, in the best, if it be not <hi>watched?</hi> And then how true is it, that though the occasion of euill may come from others, yet the

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Reasons.</head>
                        <p>First, if we speake of actuall sinne, the roote of it is in the soule, as the branches of it are in the outward parts: for there is no sinne actuall, but the will is in it. Now the body is not the seat of our will, but our reasonable soule, which is sayd to haue in it two principall faculties, the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>vnderstanding.</hi> Secondly, the heart doth carry with it, euery way, all our outward senses, and (as the Heathen man could say) it is not the <hi>eye</hi> that seeth, but the <hi>heart</hi>; nor the <hi>eare</hi> that heareth, but the <hi>heart</hi>: and so of the other senses; which doth further appeare: For let there be great sounds and much noyse in a place, yet if our heart be earnestly set vpon some other matter, our eares that attend the heart, neither heare the sound, nor listen to the noyse: yea, sometime we stumble in the playne ground, and our feete fayle vs in faire places, because our feet are carryed with our hearts that minde some other matter. Thirdly, it is the heart that maketh or marreth all our actions; which proueth that the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:21855:80"/>
of goodnesse or vice is in the heart, and the <hi>streame</hi> of them in the outward senses: for as the heart is in an action, so it is accepted both of God and man. Giue a small thing with a good heart, and it is well taken; but offer a better thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and it is not regarded: and wherefore not regarded? but because, not the gift, but the minde of the giuer is wont to be considered. So a man may leaue a sinne, and not be innocent: for example; he may refrayne Adulterie, and yet be an Adulterer; and forbeare to steale, and yet be a Thiefe: for the heart may loue Adulterie, though the body be cleane; and a Thiefe (without the hatred of theft) not dare to robbe, lest the lawe proceede against him. Shame, or want of opportunitie may make an Adulterer in heart, no Adulterer in act; and feare of the law may keepe a Thiefe true, when his <hi>heart,</hi> before God, and by the <hi>verdict</hi> of his owne <hi>conscience,</hi> is a shamelesse Thiefe.</p>

wherein God hath placed vs, as men that haue moe then our selues to answer for.

                        <p>The reasons of the doctrine are: Magistrates are to see to <hi>themselues,</hi> and to looke to <hi>others</hi>: they must haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to order themselues, and they haue the <hi>Sword</hi> to pull in others: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not enough that they liue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly and religiously<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that vseth not his authoritie to restraine from euill, giueth leaue by it, and power with it, to doe euill: for hee assisteth the wicked man, lending him his <hi>hand,</hi> and doth the wicked deede, because his power doth it. Secondly, in
<pb facs="tcp:21855:83"/>
actions that depend vpon vs, and be in our power, there is small difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the doing of them, and suffering them to be done, saue that (sometimes) he may haue more fault that permitteth euill, then he that doth it: for hee that doth it, may be mooued to it by some temptation of benefit or sudden desire; but he that suffereth it (when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it) if hee be a great Commaunder, receiueth discredit by it in his place of <hi>Honour,</hi> and hurt in the people which he gouerneth, who from the <hi>bad ayre</hi> of so corrupt an example, may draw in a very dangerous <hi>infection.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> doth it with intended profit, the <hi>other</hi> suffereth it with apparent hurt; and who hath the greater sinne?

Thirdly, the veryest hypocrite may (outwardly) leaue that sinne, which in heart he is commanded of: and there is nothing more ordinary (what if I had sayd generall?) then to seeme religious, and to be a worldling, and to professe <hi>Religion,</hi> and to minde <hi>earthly things.</hi>

                              <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> in leauing of sinne, not onely to take the <hi>euill</hi> of it out of our hands, but the loue of it out of our hearts: for what wee loue not to doe, that we will doe vnwillingly, though we doe it necessarily. If we loue goodnesse, we will doe good gladly, and euill against our willes: but if we loue to doe euill, we may forbeare it for purposes, but vvill not forgoe it for any thing. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God finde such a <hi>strife</hi> in them betweene regeneration and vnregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as was betweene <hi>Iacob and Esau in their Mothers wombe, Gen.</hi> 25.22. And why such a <hi>strife?</hi> but <hi>because the good
<pb facs="tcp:21855:87"/>
which they would doe, they cannot doe, and because they doe the euill which they would not, Rom.</hi> 7.19. For they commit euill vnwillingly, and though, when it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, they bring it forth necessarily,</hi> yet they beare such an enemies heart vnto it, that they would <hi>smoother</hi> it if they could, while it is yet <hi>young</hi> in thought and <hi>conception</hi>; or, because they cannot so doe, destroy it in the <hi>birth,</hi> and before it be <hi>growne</hi> by custome of sinning, to a <hi>habite</hi> of wickednes. The cause is, the will, so farre forth as it is regenerate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth and draweth backe: yea, when the naturall man is thrust forward vnto euill by the <hi>sinne dwelling in him,</hi> the spirituall man, reuiued by the holy Ghost in part, meetes with diuers contrary windes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that <hi>Barke</hi> of his, vnder <hi>sayle,</hi> stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him to destroy the good worke of regenerate conscience. And from hence commeth that <hi>warre of lust</hi> that the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. which hee calleth the <hi>lusting of the flesh against the spirit,</hi> and the like <hi>lusting of the spirit against it.</hi> They that meete with no such spirituall throwes in the trauell of new

And, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to sinne greedily and willingly, or of infirmitie, and partly against our will? Gods children mislike sinne, as it is sinne, yea, though by nature they be inclined to it: and because sinne displeaseth God, it displeaseth them, though it be their owne sinne, and not any sinne in a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or enemie. But the wicked mislike some sinne, eyther because they are past it by course of yeeres, or because they feare punishment, or because accusing conscience doth affright them from it, as in the example of <hi>Pilate, Mat.</hi> 27.19. 24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.12. Gods best children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their whole will is partly <hi>flesh,</hi> and partly <hi>spirit,</hi> as the whole aire in the <hi>daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the day, is partly light, and partly
<pb facs="tcp:21855:88"/>
darke throughout, therefore they partly sinne, and partly worke righteousnes; or, are partly sinners, and partly righteous: but the wicked are <hi>flesh</hi> and not <hi>spirit,</hi> wholy carnall and no way spirituall: euil they doe, and will doe it, good they doe not, nor vvill doe: vvhere the godly (contrarily) doe euill, but vvould not doe it, and doe not good, but vvould doe it.

Thirdly, <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is to be giuen in respect of <hi>matter, without respect of persons, Deuter.</hi> 1.17.

But the <hi>dissembler</hi> corrupteth this vse of speech and end of talke by a <hi>deceitful</hi> tongue; nay, ouer-turneth all humane societie and dealings betweene man and man, by vttering with the tongue what was neuer conceiued by the heart.

Which proueth, that to the speaking of the truth, that is in a mans heart, a double agreement is required; the one, of the tongue with the minde; the other, of the minde with the things themselues. And to this is opposed the double falsehood that was spoken of: as when a man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which is false, or the truth, but falsely. So we haue heard of <hi>lying,</hi> and the kindes thereof. From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a teller of <hi>lyes,</hi> (such an one as the Prophet here meaneth to put out of <hi>his house</hi> and <hi>sight,</hi>) is <hi>he</hi> that speaketh that as true, which <hi>hee</hi> knoweth to bee <hi>false,</hi> and that which is true falsely, and not with a simple heart.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our bountie (Worshipfull Sir) besides my obligation to your <note n="a" place="margin">Richard Atkins, <hi>Esquire, Iustice in one of the</hi> Welsh <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, and one of his Maiesties Councell in the Marches of</hi> Wales.</note> 
                     <hi>Fathers name,</hi> after his blessed death, hath deserued a better oblation then the tender of this small <hi>Booke;</hi> which, by way of thankefulnesse to you, and remembrance of Him, in all thankefulnesse, I send to you, and abroad into the world vnder your Name. It pleased, that your Religious and (truly) godly Father, to seeke Mee out in a darke skie, or night of distresse, to doe me good:
<pb facs="tcp:21855:159"/>
which he spared not to doe while he liued; For, as another <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed mee, <hi>2 Tim. 1.16.</hi> the Lord giue mercy to his House, and Posteritie for it. Also, I know few like-minded, who will faithfully care for our matters, as he did: and, where men (earthly minded) seeke their owne, that is, seeke that, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is nothing worth when they haue it; he sought in his life, and found in his death that which is Iesus Christ, <hi>Phil. 2.20.21.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what neede I to embalme him (being dead) with my report, who (liuing) had so good report of all who knew him, and the grace in him: and dying sweetly in the peace of his Master, and his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, like that boxe of oyntment, which (being very precious) the woman powred on Christs head, in his breaking by death, cast forth that name, that is better then the best oyntment, <hi>Eccles. 7.3. Mark. 14.3.</hi> A name of a right good sauour, such as hath filled the house; and may be an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and crowne of reioycing to the House and Stocke hee came of? For you that now liue, the Heire of his House, and (I trust)
<pb facs="tcp:21855:159"/>
of his good minde in good things. You are to remember (as I hope you forget not) that your life is in that age and time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may, as in the morning, sow your seed, <hi>Eccles. 11.6.</hi> the good seed of the doctrine of saluation, in the field of your owne heart, and furrowes of those that are of your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and proper charge.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you, let not your hand rest, and bee diligent to take heed to your selfe, and them, for all necessarie instruction in the way of life: so tilling them, spiritually, for GOD, and his true feare, that your whole House may bee as the field of the righteous, which the Lord will blesse, and the name of it may be, <hi>The Lord is there, Ezek. 48.35.</hi> So did your good Father in the middes of <hi>You,</hi> whiles he liued: and so (good Sir) doe you constantly in the mids of your owne House, by his example, who (now is gone. Hee learned of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who commaunded his householde after him in such matters, <hi>Genes. 18.19.</hi> and learne <hi>You</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> that the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> may follow <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Yours.</hi> I write not doubtingly, and I haue good confidence in the Lord, that you are so minded. In which
<pb facs="tcp:21855:160"/>
good meaning, and intention of yours, to a worke so full of spiritual consolation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, you must looke for aduersaries. The more truelie you feare God, the more you shall finde what enmitie is against it. Looke for this in euery good purpose vnder the Sunne. The world that is not of the fashion of Heauen, <hi>Rom. 12.2.</hi> will be against you. The flesh, that is all for it selfe, <hi>Rom. 13.14.</hi> will lust against the Spirit, and the good motions of the Spirit in you, <hi>Galat. 5.17.</hi> and the Deuill (the Centurion of the band) will pursue you with his armies of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on your right hand, and on your left, <hi>Ephes. 6.12.</hi> But <hi>Hee</hi> that is with you is stronger then all these, and, as long as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> is your leader, and his Angels your fellow-Souldiours, what can doe you hurt? if God be on your side, what matter who be against you? <hi>Rom. 8.31.</hi> If you loue the loue of Christ with all your heart; who, or what shall separate you from it? who, or what shall make you to forsake it? <hi>vers. 35.</hi> Neither the worlds iniuries, nor the fleshes allurements, nor all the mallice of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ouer all which you are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, through him that hath loued you,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:160"/>
                     <hi>verse 37.</hi> shall be able to take Christ from you, or the holy Spirit of Christ out of you; by whom you are sealed to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Ephes. 4.30.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Striue (therefore) forward (cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) in this narrow way of life: fight the good fight of Faith to the end: whet your heart vpon the Word, and make the Statutes of <hi>IEHOVA,</hi> your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Counsellours: pray in your holy Faith: holde that you haue with increase<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> get ground of the commune enemie daily; and that by doing well, while you haue time. This matter requireth your earnest medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deepest thoughts: and, therefore, against all incumbrances and impediments of spirituall life, already remembred, or further spoke of by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, and pride of life, <hi>1 Iohn 2.16.</hi> put forth your selfe couragiously in the name of the Lord of Hostes, who will order the whole battell for you, and finish it to your euerlasting victory, and ioyfull triumph ouer all powers, earthly and infernall.</p>
                  <p>How ill they proceede, that doe not so striue, I haue endeuoured to shewe in the
<pb facs="tcp:21855:161"/>
meditations that follow, concerning the sinne and punishment of the prodigall sonne: perswading my selfe that of Him you haue nothing in you but his repentance, and grace to come home to your heauenly Father, where you haue with Him (young and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly) in anything; (and who hath not in <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam 3.2.</hi>
                     </note> many things) declined from obedience to God, or the wayes of his truth. These I tooke to taske the beginning of this last Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at what time the Lords storme fell, that caused so generall a feare: I would it had effected a like generall amendement in vs. For the now comming forth of them, the Apostle, who saith, <hi>Be instant in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and out of season, 2 Timoth. 4.2.</hi> shall answere for me, if any shall thinke them vnseasonable.</p>
                  <p>Besides, how can that bee, or be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, with any colour of soundnesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, that teacheth vs to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what GOD would not haue forgotten: namely, his wonderfull workes, which hee made, the last two moneths of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune,</hi> to be remembred? <hi>Psal. 111.4.</hi> Or, if all his workes must praise him, <hi>Psal. 145.10,</hi> why should not those praise him in the
<pb facs="tcp:21855:161"/>
Gate, which he wrought so fearefully, and so lately among vs? And, is it euer too late and vnseasonable, to shew to the world how graciously, and how strangely, the Lords late mercies got the better hand of his other fearefull workes, by taking his frownes from the skie, and by putting a more louing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon it, in the blessed weather that ensued? I call it the Lords mercie, or not the least of those mercies that are ouer all his workes, <hi>Psal. 145.9.</hi> For, did our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or any worke of ours seeke and finde that comfortable alteration at Gods hands? Or, did not the greatest number desire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more kindely season, and complaine of a season so (generally) hurtfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate with sinne in their right hand? was one Sabbath for all that power of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that so cracked about our eares, and pouring Raine that so fell vpon the Earth, that is, in such abundance, that it made Brookes and Riuers to rise, and the water to stand in the Furrowes, lesse prophaned in Towne and Countrie? I doubt not, but some stood, as <hi>Aaron</hi> in that breach and gappe with their Censer of seruent Supplication to the Lord, by whom (in all likelihood) hee
<pb facs="tcp:21855:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was entreated, and who sought and found him in due time, <hi>Psal. 32.6.</hi> Yet what was that to the generall inconformitie that still beareth sway? And heere who can but prophecie? for seeing that neither Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor mercie can preuaile, what can wee looke for, but destruction vpon destruction? <hi>Esai. 1.5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last Winter, which was in the yeere <hi>1612,</hi> what mercie did GOD shew, to make it so milde in so great want of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> then that sharpest Winter which about foure yeres since, destroyed all our Flowers: for, it tooke away our most beautifull Rose and Flower: our Carnation-Flower, the fairest in the Garden of Christendome, which the LORD pluckt vp for himselfe, to plant in the Garden of his owne presence: I meane, the beloued of GOD and Men, <hi>HENRY,</hi> our late Prince, the Flower of our Age, whom the Lord tooke from vs by death in the Flower of his Age, that was so

louely. But, who is more turned to GOD for it?</p>
                  <p>This last Sommer begunne roughly, and in stormes, which caused weedes to come vp abundantly: which weedes GOD sent, as Lions, vpon the standing Corne, to pull it downe. The latter ende of it, was with great mixture of fauour, and in a fruitfull calme: and GOD in mercie, hath giuen vs, but with great abatement, those fruits that some despaired off, yet haue wee not turned to him that hath smitten vs, <hi>Esai. 9.13. Amos 4.6.8.9.10.11.</hi> And now, if neither the sweet loue of GOD can stirre vs, nor his smart wrath rowse vs, what will doe vs good? But I will end: praying the Almightie God of the spirits of all flesh, to inspire Your heart more and more with all grace and gracious parts, needfull for soule and body; for the wayes of this life, and for Your sure way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life hereafter. So I commend this poore testimonie and Mite of my thankefull heart, to your Worships kinde and fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; and You, and Your Christian Yoke-fellow, to the speciall grace and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of your, and our, most mercifull GOD

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter, or part of Scripture, being a Chapter which bringeth much true and sound comfort to tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and mourning sinners, are set
<pb facs="tcp:21855:164"/>
downe three parables. The first, of the <hi>lost Sheepe,</hi> vers. 4.5. the second, of the <hi>lost Groat,</hi> vers. 8.9.10. and the third, of the <hi>prodigall and lost Sonne,</hi> vers. 11.12.13. &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter. The occasion is to be seen in the first, and second verses, which was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of many Publicans and sinners to Christ, and for it, the murmuring of the Scribes and Pharisies against Christ.</p>
                     <p>In this parable of the Prodigall and lost sonne, two things are spoken of principally, as the Father and his two sonnes in the literall sence: and God the father, and his children, of different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and wayes, in the mysticall. For, by the elder, or bragging sonne, are meant the Scribes and Pharisies, and by the yonger, and prodigall, Publicans and sinners. The first sort seemed to liue in the bosome of God, the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to liue in the botom of the wrath of God. The one kinde were (seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) righteous, the other (apparantly) prophane. The one in the Church, and vnder the Law, the other not in the Church, nor vnder a law, but out of it,
<pb facs="tcp:21855:164"/>
and without law, in their farre country of sinne.</p>
                     <p>And so by the lost Sonne, wee may vnderstand such sinners as are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the broad way of their sinnes to the path of life, and yet are (secretly) marked to saluation, and shall be (mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully) called to repentance in the Lords good time, as the lost sonne here. Of him my purpose is to speake now, and but of some of the Parable concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him; as of his sinne, and entry-dore to Repentance. His sinne is, that that which was before, <hi>hee receaued his portion</hi>; or, after <hi>he had receaued it.</hi> His sinne before <hi>he receaued his portion,</hi> was his greedinesse to haue it, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in calling for it: His sinne after <hi>he receaued it,</hi> was his leauing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Fathers house: and, after hee had depriued him of the comfort of a Sonne, and (vniustly) of that portion that belonged not to such a Sonne, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of his goods with a riotous life. And this is spoken of in this 13. verse. where we haue that, that was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his sinne, and the sin it selfe. The
<pb facs="tcp:21855:165"/>
occasion was his gathering together of his goods, and that substance which his Father had giuen him. And heere our Sauiour, by the Euangelist, sheweth how dangerous a thing <hi>fulnesse</hi> is, euen to Gods owne children, by abuse. For, it is said, <hi>when hee had gathered all together, &amp;c.</hi> the meaning is, when hee was left to <hi>himselfe,</hi> and to his owne <hi>caruing,</hi> in these outward things, hauing Mony in his purse, and the <hi>raines</hi> of <hi>himselfe</hi> in his owne hand, he would endure his Fathers house and seruice no longer, but hasted out of it, as out of some <hi>close Prison,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the <hi>open Aire</hi> of Liberty, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part farre enough from his <hi>Fathers</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and feare, that nothing might stop his way to the dissolute life hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to passe with sinners, out of Gods Church, in a strange land. So long as hee was at his fathers finding, stinted by him, it doth not appeare that <hi>hee poured out</hi> himselfe to any such riot: but after his portion came to his owne hands, <hi>hee went into a farre Countrie</hi> with it, and <hi>wasted it with riotous liuing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The point here taught, is: Men had

                        </note> then in a poore life. In the 69. Psalme, verse 22. the Prophet speaking of the <hi>full table</hi> of those desperate sinners that had dealt wickedly with God, and ill with him: wisheth (and that with a Prophets spirit) that their <hi>table might bee a snare vnto them,</hi> that is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And this he prayeth for, with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the spirit of <hi>prophesie</hi> that was in him, of their reprobate estate, and that they were the enemies <hi>whom the Lord would destroy.</hi> But, what furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their sinne, and hastened their end more or sooner, then vnsanctified ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that <hi>hill</hi> which they supposed to be so <hi>strong</hi> in their vnmoueable <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie?

and well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.2.21. But, hauing a kingdome, and being King, he left <hi>the Lord,</hi> and did much wickednesse. Sathan would haue <hi>set vp Christ</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, as <hi>vpon an hill,</hi> thinking that if any estate could, a full estate would make him <hi>fall from God, and fall downe to him.</hi> But Satan could <hi>finde nothing in Christ, Iohn</hi> 14.30. that is, nothing for his purpose in any temptation, though hee found corruption enough in others, euen the best, after they were tempted in such manner: for, when <hi>Dauid</hi> had <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>ease,</hi> by such <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>ease,</hi> he faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the point of this naile in him, and droue it to the head in his adulterie, and bloody sinne, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Peter,</hi> feeling the fire of a warme estate, denied his Master by feare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.18.25.27.</p>
                     <p>And (therefore) as the milde and gentle beames of the Sunne haue more force vpon a wayfaring man, then the strongest gale of winde that bloweth in the skie: for, the Sunne, by his warme beames, maketh him to cast off his Cloake, and to put off his Coate, as a burthen too heauie to be borne, where
<pb facs="tcp:21855:166"/>
the vvinde, with his loude and colde blasts maketh him both faster to holde, and more closely to wrap about him, both Cloake and Coate: so the vvarme Sunne of prosperitie can make vs more naked to God by sinne, then the colde winde of times, blustering with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Therefore hath a Christian more neede in prosperitie to watch sinne, then in dayes of aduersitie and trouble: which may further be proued by these reasons following.</p>

                           <item>First, Satan hath more cords to binde vs, in those temptations which are on our right hand, fet from profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and honour, then in those which are on our left, drawne from aduersitie, want, and basenesse. Which made him to reserue his temptation, taken from prosperitie, to the last place, in which he reposed all, as in his best weapon, or vveapon of proofe.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, prosperitie is a slipperie path: a man may soone fall in such a vvay: but aduersitie is a more rugged and sure way, not so apt to faile vs.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, in a full life, we haue more

meanes of sinning, then in a bare estate. For what will not wealth doe to the help of riot, that pouertie cannot? A poore man cannot offend by drunkennesse, by whoredome, by oppression, by fulnesse of bread, by garish apparell, as a rich man may.</item>

In <hi>Luke</hi> Chap 12. ver. 19. <hi>He</hi> that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night had his vvarme Sunne, in much goods laid vp for many yeeres: that is, vvhich hee supposed should continue long, and were (presently) gone; was in the colde shaddow before the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or rather in the armes and shadow of colde and sencelesse death.

                        <p>Consider (therefore) when thou goest from Gods house that thou goest from God: and that, departing from his word, thou goest, as it were, into a farre Countrie from him.

His meaning was, that in that familie (which was the Church then) Gods face was seene in his worship: and therefore hee tooke it for a great part of his punishment, that hee was so cast out, or rather, had so cast himselfe out by his sinne. And, shall <hi>Cains</hi> mouth condemne you, who (so ordinarily) by your inordinate wayes, depart from God, and, in contempt, from his house? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, consider your wayes, your straying wayes, <hi>and turne your feet vnto Gods testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Psal.</hi> 119.59.</p>
                        <p>To turne to God, is to turne from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse;
<pb facs="tcp:21855:171"/>
and to returne to his house &amp; presence, from Recusancie, and other prophane absences, is to begin to be vertuous. Wouldest thou (then) be thought and accounted one that is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to leaue sinne? set God in place, and his great power before thee: or, though thou hast long put off, wouldst thou, at last, enter the way of grace?

<pb facs="tcp:21855:174"/>
Meane while, whose Martyrs bee such? Gods? or the Deuils? vvhose day keepe they? Gods? or the Deuils day? and, to whom do they dedicate their Sabbaths? to God? or to the Deuill? making them dayes, not of <hi>holinesse,</hi> but of <hi>their lusts?</hi> Thus it appeareth, that the wicked, in their life of lusts, make no spare of Gods blessings, and may further appeare by these reasons. The reasons.</p>
                        <p>The first, may bee taken from the contrarietie that is betweene such lusting ones, and Gods faithfull ones. For, as the true Christian giues all to God, so the carnal man giues all to his lusts, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 23.5.6.11.12. <hi>&amp;c.

                        <p>Secondly, they that are lusts seruants, will doe any thing at lusts bidding: and, what did this lost Sonne with-hold from his lusts which he serued? They that are taken with the net of the <hi>whorish woman,</hi> will they not, for her sake, <hi>bring all to a morsell of bread? Prou.</hi> 6.26. This yong man, in a like matter, brought all to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Shall I need to goe into a farre Countrie for examples? doth not our
<pb facs="tcp:21855:174"/>
owne Land so full of whoredomes, so poore by vvhoredome, and other lusts, on which so many haue consumed all, their soules and all, giue too plentifull vvitnesse to this truth?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, all things are vile to that a man doth most affect: for, if wee loue God best, what will vvee not doe for him? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. and, if we loue the world best, vvhat vvill vve not take from God to giue to it? Parents loue their owne children best; and therefore they lay vp for them, and not for strangers.

<pb facs="tcp:21855:175"/>
must (first) <hi>mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.13. Now, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>flesh,</hi> is so to keepe downe the soule in that part vvhich is <hi>fleshly,</hi> that it shall command vs in nothing: or, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; is to doe nothing for it, in nothing to gratifie it, and to take all life from it.

                           <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 20.6.

                        <p>But the sickenesse of desire being vvithin, how can things vvithout vs bee the cure of it? Is the dropsie cured vvith a parcell of Land, with a portion

                        </p>
                        <p>A third good meane to subdue lust, is to consider that wee are out of our
<pb facs="tcp:21855:176"/>
Country, &amp; strangers here in a Pilgrimes life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11.

                        <p>Finally, the best meane to mortifie our flesh, that is, the corruption which is in vs, and to master our lusts, is to be girt alwayes with our armour of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

                              <item>Thirdly, God doth, and euer will, put difference betweene Sonnes &amp; Bastards.

                     <p>In respect of himselfe, the rod of hunger did so driue him, and with such sharpe teeth bite him, that hee refused no condition of life wherein hee might get any thing to put into his belly, by it to asswage that paine of necessitie which
<pb facs="tcp:21855:190"/>
hee endured. And this made him to <hi>ioyne himselfe to a certaine</hi> miserable and churlish <hi>Citizen,</hi> vvho imployed him basely, and not according to his Gentry and breeding: for, he did not command him about his more honest and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous seruices in the Citie: but, being (as it is like) some rich Townesman, or as one of those wealthy Citizens, that haue houses in the Citie, and Farmes in the Country, <hi>sent him to his Farme.</hi> And there, not to looke vnto his better cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, which (yet) had beene a place of better respect; but <hi>to feede his Swine.</hi> And so hee that (not long before) was impatient to be a naturall Sonne, and younger brother in his Fathers house, was brought to that low ebbe of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie in his poore life, and the house of a stranger, that hee could not be in any office, but the meanest, nor doe any worke, but the most contemptible. So wee see the best preferment, that they get by the Diuels Seruice, who put their neckes into his yoake to be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him. And yet this stray-Sonne had rather submit to this, then (till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

So it fareth, and hath fared with all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> since; in him they were strangers from God, in this farre country of their exile from heauenly life. For, how vnwilling are they to come home to their heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father by the Grace of Repentance, from whom they depart daily by the Errour of Sinne?

                     <p>And (here) behold (in this lost Sonne) the old <hi>Adam</hi> of disobedience to God, <hi>hiding himselfe among</hi> one of <hi>the Trees of the garden,</hi> rather then hee will come backe to his Father, who, in the voyce of affliction, calleth to him, saying; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, where art thou?

But, this appeareth in kinde, considered in <hi>Cain,</hi> who being a vagabond from God, and runne-a-gate in the earth, did neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, because neuer brought backe by him that turneth his Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Dauid,</hi> Gods deare Childe, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by his Adultery and bloudy sinne, from his Fathers house, with this lost Sonne, thought not of returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by sound conuersion, till after three quarters of a yeeres absence or more, God sent <hi>Nathan</hi> his Prophet with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to bring him by the words of his Parable, and by the interpretation of them, saying vnto him; <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1.2.7. Hee that saith, <hi>Returne yee Sonnes of Adam,

Psal.</hi> 90.3. knoweth that the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot returne, till hee turne them, who (onely) ordereth the goings of man. So that stray-sheepe of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, with whom CHRIST had confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, wandered further and further, in her taunting speeches, from her direct saluation, and from God her Sauiour, till CHRIST stopped her, by telling her what shee had done, and how nought shee had beene, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.11.15.17. for, hee said, <hi>Thou hast well said, I haue no Husband: for, hee whom thou now hast, is not thy Husband, verse</hi> 17.18. Thus it is cleare that man stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, cannot returne till God turne him.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons are. Man departeth not from God but by sinne, nor retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but by Repentance, but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is Gods gift, and none can turne to God, except hee be first turned of him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.19. And (therefore) our comming backe, when we wander from him, is his worke.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for this, lost man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a stray and lost sheepe, vvhich

will wander further and further from his Pasture till his Shepheard seeke him, and bring him home, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. For, so the wandering sinner will stray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or returne till God haue mercy vpon him.</p>

For, besides that shee gaue no gentle answere to the Sauiour of her soule, by her mal-apart talke, she gaue him to vnderstand plainely, that a light-Huswife was in place. And if we consider our first birth: are wee not borne of fornication? but doe Children of fornication any thing that can please God? doe they, or can they, in any thing helpe forward their second and new birth? or, are they not desperate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to it?

What shall I say of our Corne-masters?

                        <p>Such a Corne-monger was that Rich man spoken of, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.18.19. he would pull downe his lesser, and build greater Barnes, that hee might into them gather all his fruits and his goods, not against a dearth, as did <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but rather to cause it, as they, who with that cursed rich man, feede and make merry with that which is taken from the life of the poore. But how long had hee peace in his dayes, that had such peace in his wealth? Hee fell into a pleasant dreame of many yeers to come, who had not the respite of one whole night to prouide for his end so neare. For, the Text saith, <hi>O foole, this night they will fetch away thy soule, Luk.</hi> 12.20. <hi>they,</hi> that is, the Diuell and his Angels shall fetch it, as God and his good Angels fetch the soules of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. And surely, if the Diuell of couetousnesse be gone into any, it is into these, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.<hi>5.</hi> It may be they may looke toward Religion, but it is a-skew, and with an heart espoused to that Couetousnes which is Idolatrie.

so long they will walke with the Gospell, as they may not with-draw their foote from the world: but if the world beginne to goe, then farewell Religion. <hi>Demas</hi> must be gone, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is plaine, as vpon Tables, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.2. that where the world is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, there Compassion, Gentlenesse, Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Mercy, Bowels of mercy, Brotherly Loue, and such fruits of the Spirit, are made vnderlings; and where it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nothing shal beare sway but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greedinesse.

                           <item>First, it is profitable for the children of God to feele want where they haue made waste; that, schooled with the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a lower estate, they may learne hereafter to follow temperance, and to flie excesse.

<pb facs="tcp:21855:208"/>
that they may see (for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation) in what they haue sinned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.41.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, it is iust that the abuse of a good thing should be punished with the absence and losse of that good thing which is so abused: but this our being (all) for the belly, to pamper it, what is it but to abuse vnto sin those good things, which, for such abuse, may iustly be taken from vs! <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.5. compared with <hi>Am.</hi> 6.4.6.</item>

<pb facs="tcp:21855:212"/>
himselfe; and remembred himselfe, vvho had so and so much forgotten himselfe. Now he began to thinke, and in such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with himselfe, to say; <hi>How many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Seruants of my Fathers haue bread enough?</hi> or, how many are kept there at the full racke, in all plentie, and with all sufficiencie and fulnesse, hauing <hi>bread enough</hi> and to spare, and <hi>I perish with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> As if hee had said; They are Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I am the Sonne; they haue abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I haue nothing, they liue in plenty, I dye for hunger; they are many, I am but one; hee is their Master, but my pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, whom I haue offended, and who, being so good to hyred Seruants, will not be vnmercifull to a penitent Son.</p>

                        </note>But that which I purpose, with the help of God to obserue, is; that our first step to repentance is to take our selues aside for our former impenitencie and straying wayes.

                     <p>I might be large in this field: but it is euident that who will truely disclaime and amend their euill wayes, must take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues aside for them by this blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of thinking what they haue done.</p>
