         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I am altogether a ſtranger to that Honourable Perſon, to whom
your Letter is dedicated, I would not preſume to write my Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
to his Lordſhip, but thought it more proper for me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
this to your ſelf.</p>
            <p>What I put down in a <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> in relation to your <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
hath, I perceive, given you no little diſturbance. I do not wonder at it,
ſince few men are content or able to bear the juſteſt cenſure that can be
paſt upon them.</p>
            <p>But tho' I do not wonder at your diſpleaſure, yet I do very much at
your attempt to vindicate your ſelf in a matter that is not capable of any
defence, as I ſhall quickly ſhew you.</p>
            <p>I intend <hi>this Letter</hi> for a Vindication of my ſelf to the world, as well
as to you, and therefore will take leave to repeat what <hi>you</hi> ſaid in <hi>that
Sermon,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> it was that I animadverted upon in my <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to the
<hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> ſecond page <hi>of your</hi> Sermon <hi>you have theſe words;</hi> If I preſume
not to preſent them, <hi>[yours and your Auditours Prayers]</hi> without taking along
the joynt Interceſſion of the Mother of God, I follow therein the Advice of
St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> which I addreſs to you in his words; Let us by the moſt tender
Application of our whole heart, recommend our ſelves, to the moſt Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin's
Interceſſion; let us all, with the greateſt eagerneſs, ſtrive to obtain her
Protection; that whilſt with Aſſiduity we pay her our Devotions on Earth, ſhe
may intreat for us in Heaven by her earneſt Prayers; for undoubtedly ſhe who
brought forth the Price of Redemption, hath the greateſt Right to intercede for
thoſe who are redeemed.</p>
            <p>This <hi>was the</hi> paſſage <hi>that I reflected upon there, ſince with a very little
pains I found that</hi> that Sermon <hi>out of which you quoted</hi> theſe expreſſions,
<hi>was not St.</hi> Auſtins, <hi>and therefore I ſaid in that</hi> Poſtſcript <hi>that</hi> I could not
but conclude you guilty either of great Ignorance, or of notorious diſingenuity, who
would aſcribe to the venerable St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> this Notorious Forgery.</p>
            <p>Theſe Expreſſions of my <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> I do ſtill own notwithſtanding your
<hi>Vindication,</hi> and intend <hi>this Letter</hi> for a Defence of <hi>them,</hi> and a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of what you have ſo weakly and ſo unwarily offered towards
the clearing of your ſelf.</p>
            <p>You have prefaced <hi>your Letter</hi> to that Honourable Lord with ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61801:3"/>
hard words againſt the <hi>Church of England</hi> about her Reformation <hi>by meer
Lay-Authority,</hi> about her want of <hi>Succeſſion, Miſſion,</hi> and about her <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
one third part of the Apoſtles Creed.</hi> I am ſo very deſirous to come
to the <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt us, that I will only tell you here, that every
word of what you have ſaid there againſt the <hi>Church of England</hi> is very
falſe, and very abſurd.</p>
            <p>You next make <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Reflections</hi> upon my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Compiler</hi>
of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium;</hi> I will paſs over theſe at preſent alſo, ſince I am
not at leiſure here to defend <hi>that Book,</hi> and which is more, I need not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
what <hi>you</hi> have ſaid there.</p>
            <p>You next come to the Dividing of my <hi>Accuſation</hi> againſt you, and tell
the World, I accuſe you <hi>firſt of Ignorance in ſaying, you followed the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>when you recommended your ſelf to the Moſt Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Interceſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which I muſt tell <hi>you,</hi> Sir, that <hi>you</hi> abuſe words in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
them-into the charge of <hi>Ignorance</hi> about Uſing the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of
the Bleſſed Virgin, and <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> about quoting the <hi>Sermon</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins.</hi>
Your deſign I eaſily foreſee, which is to draw me into a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
about <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> that ſo the heavy charge laid againſt
<hi>you</hi> may be either dropt, or buried in a multitude of words about other
things.</p>
            <p>But to be plain with you, Sir, now you have drawn me into the field,
I am reſolved not to be diverted with the throwing in of other matter
about <hi>Invocation,</hi> which I have ſufficiently anſwered once already in my
<hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium:</hi> I am reſolved to finiſh this
diſpute about the <hi>Sermon</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> before I begin any other with
<hi>you;</hi> When <hi>you</hi> have either cleared your ſelf, or owned your <hi>obſtinate
Miſtake,</hi> then I ſhall be at your ſervice either in the <hi>DEFENCE</hi> of <hi>my
Book,</hi> or of my <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolical Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt not be angry therefore if I throw aſide as nothing to the
purpoſe of the <hi>preſent Controverſy</hi> what <hi>you</hi> have ſet down out of the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi>
from your <hi>third</hi> to your <hi>ſixth</hi> page, where I was glad to find that <hi>you</hi>
did recollect with your ſelf that our diſpute was about <hi>thoſe words</hi> as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the <hi>thirty fifth Sermon</hi> de Sanctis: <hi>Which</hi> I ſaid <hi>could</hi> not be
St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> but <hi>you</hi> are now reſolved to defend that <hi>it</hi> may.</p>
            <p>As for my <hi>Arguments;</hi> you tell his Lordſhip that I borrow <hi>ſome Proofs,
of this Confident Aſſertion</hi> [I ſuppoſe you mean of the <hi>Sermons not being
St.</hi> Auſtins] <hi>of</hi> Alexandre Natalis, <hi>and add one of my own contrivance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since I am not acquainted with that <hi>Honourable Lord,</hi> I am afraid you
will not do me the favour to tell that Lord from <hi>me,</hi> that what you ſay
here is very falſe. I deſigned and drew up that Poſtſcript, and had it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61801:3"/>
Printed in half a day; I had not lookt into <hi>Natalis Alexandre</hi> of five
weeks before, and which is more, neither looked for, or ever ſaw <hi>one
ſyllable</hi> in <hi>him</hi> about <hi>that,</hi> or any other <hi>Sermon</hi> attributed to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
that I remember. I muſt own that I have been acquainted with <hi>Natalis
Alexandre,</hi> but it was meerly to find out the ſtealings of your <hi>Pious</hi> and
<hi>Learned Author</hi> of the <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> who as I have thewn in my <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
did not only ſteal his <hi>whole Book,</hi> (excepting a ſmall paſſage or two) out
of that <hi>French Hiſtorian,</hi> but ſtands excommunicated by this <hi>preſent Pope</hi>
for his pains,</p>
            <p>After your falſe account whence I had <hi>my Proofs,</hi> you come next to
examine <hi>them</hi> ſingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My firſt was</hi> that <hi>the Title, a Sermon on</hi> [not <hi>in</hi> as you tranſlate the
words] <hi>the Feaſt of the Aſſumption does not at all agree to any thing that is
near St.</hi> Auſtins <hi>time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwer that there is <hi>no conſequence</hi> can be drawn from the <hi>Title,</hi>
ſince the Title (as I ſuppoſe your meaning is) might have been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
added. But why, Sir, can there be no conſequence drawn hence;
my deſign was not only from there being <hi>no Feaſt of Aſſumption</hi> then
(which you grant) and therefore <hi>no Sermon</hi> could be Preached on that
Solemnity, but from there being <hi>no belief</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Aſſumption</hi> then,
and therefore a <hi>Sermon</hi> on <hi>that ſubject,</hi> which <hi>this</hi> evidently <hi>is,</hi> cannot
be either St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> or near <hi>his time,</hi> ſince there was <hi>then</hi> and <hi>long after</hi>
not only <hi>no Feaſt,</hi> but <hi>no belief</hi> of any ſuch thing as the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin.</hi> But you endeavour to illuſtrate this ſhadow, or rather
phantome of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> by an Inſtance. You tell his Lordſhip <hi>St.</hi> Auſtins
<hi>fourteenth Sermon</hi> de Sanctis <hi>is allowed by all to be his genuine work, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
whereof, is in the Feaſt of all Saints; yet</hi> that <hi>the Inſtitution of that Feaſt
was much later than that Sermon, which was made for, and preach'd in the
Solemnity of a Virgin and Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely Sir, you thought your putting <hi>your name</hi> and <hi>your ſociety</hi> to <hi>your
Letter</hi> would fright <hi>the nameleſs Author,</hi> from daring to give one word
of <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>that Letter,</hi> and therefore that you might take the Liberty
to ſay what you pleaſed in <hi>it.</hi> Without ſuch a ſuppoſition, I am not able
to reſcue you from a more <hi>odious Character,</hi> than I am willing to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For this is one of the falſeſt paſſages I have met with in ſo few
words. <hi>You</hi> ſay St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> 14<hi>th Sermon de Sanstis is allowed by all to be his
genuine work:</hi> This is (give me leave to ſpeak out) very falſe: For the
<hi>Benedictines</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (not to mention <hi>our Authors,</hi> whom I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
on to prove againſt your ALL,) have thrown <hi>this Sermon</hi> into their
<note n="a" place="margin">Appendix ad Tom. 5. i.) Auguſt. p. 316. Edit. Paris 1683.</note> 
               <hi>Appendix</hi> as <hi>Spurious,</hi> and ſhew that it is a <hi>meer Cento,</hi> made up of
<hi>pieces</hi> of <hi>Sermons,</hi> borrowed here and there. <hi>You</hi> tell his Lordſhip next,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61801:4"/>
that the <hi>Title of the Sermon, is in the Feaſt of all Saints.</hi> This is as falſe
as the other; for not onely in the <hi>Louvain,</hi> but in the <hi>Benedictine,</hi> as well
as in <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s <hi>Edition,</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>this fourteenth Sermon,</hi> is <hi>in Feſto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſionis
Sancti Pauli,</hi> a Sermon <hi>on the Feaſt of the Converſion</hi> of <hi>St. Paul.</hi> I
muſt confeſs Sir, that I was wholly aſtoniſhed at your aſſerting theſe things
with ſo <hi>much aſſurance</hi> to a <hi>Peer,</hi> and to a <hi>Peer</hi> alſo of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>without any truth:</hi> I lookt again and again at <hi>it,</hi> and leſt it
might be an errour of the Preſs, I lookt into the <hi>fourth,</hi> into the <hi>twenty
fourth,</hi> into the <hi>thirty fourth,</hi> into the <hi>forty firſt;</hi> I lookt alſo into the
<hi>two next Sermons</hi> before and after this <hi>fourteenth Sermon</hi> de Sanctis, but
no news could I find of <hi>your Title</hi> in any <hi>one</hi> of <hi>thoſe Sermons,</hi> and therefore
muſt lay <hi>this miſtake</hi> to your <hi>own charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You laſtly tell his Lordſhip, that this <hi>fourteenth Sermon was made ſon,
and preach'd in the ſolemnity of a Virgin and Martyr;</hi> which is as <hi>falſe</hi> as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the other, ſince <hi>it</hi> certainly was <hi>made for,</hi> and <hi>preach't</hi> upon St.
<hi>Pauls Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You next tell his Lordſhip of a</hi> far greater miſtake in this my Objection,
much to be wondered at in ſo great a pretender to reading, as if <hi>(ſay you)</hi> Feaſt,
<hi>or</hi> day of Aſſumption in the Writings of Antients, did almoſt ever ſignify any
thing elſe but the Day of a Saints Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But pray, Sir, what is</hi> that <hi>to</hi> this Sermon, <hi>if the</hi> day <hi>of</hi> Aſſumption <hi>do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſignify the</hi> day <hi>of a</hi> Saints Death, <hi>why may not</hi> this <hi>be the</hi> exception? <hi>but
to paſs that; you know very well that</hi> that <hi>cannot be the meaning here,
ſince</hi> this Sermon <hi>ſpeaks of</hi> Aſſumption <hi>of the</hi> Bleſſed Virgin; <hi>and that it
was the</hi> Churches Cuſtom to believe that the Virgin Mary was on the day of
that ſolemnity aſſumed into Heaven.</p>
            <p>But all this is but to raiſe a duſt about nothing, for were the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the <hi>Title</hi> as weak as you could deſire, yet what follows in my
<hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> is more than ſtrong enough to convince all reaſonable men
that <hi>that Sermon</hi> could not be St. <hi>Auſtins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I next urged againſt</hi> this Sermon, <hi>that the</hi> Benedictines <hi>of</hi> Paris in their
<hi>late</hi> Edition <hi>of St.</hi> Auſtin had caſt it into their Appendix as ſpurious, and
that they told us that in their MSS. it wanted the name of any Author; but
that the Divines of <hi>Louvain</hi> told us that in ſeveral Manuſcripts, which they uſed
in their Edition of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> this Sermon <hi>de Sanctis</hi> was intituled to <hi>Fulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Carnotenſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument you were affraid to take together and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying a word to the <hi>Benedictine Manuſcripts,</hi> which name <hi>no Author</hi>
for <hi>that Sermon,</hi> you think you anſwer the <hi>Louvain</hi> MSS. about its
being intituled to <hi>Fulbertus,</hi> by ſaying St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Chryſologus's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
have appeared in MSS. under other Authors names.</hi> But pray, Sir,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61801:4"/>
what would you prove from hence, becauſe ſuch a thing hath happened
to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> therefore <hi>this Sermon</hi> muſt be St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> becauſe print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among <hi>his works,</hi> tho' <hi>it</hi> bears not <hi>his name</hi> either in the MSS. uſed
by the <hi>Louvain Divines,</hi> or by the <hi>Benedictines.</hi> How is it that we know
one man's <hi>Sermon's</hi> from another's, is it not either from <hi>his ſtyle,</hi> or from
its being attributed to ſuch a perſon by the <hi>moſt</hi> and <hi>beſt Manuſcripts?</hi>
from one of theſe ways it is that St. <hi>Ambroſe's</hi> or any <hi>other Father's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
are vindicated to their <hi>true Authors.</hi> But both <hi>theſe Arguments</hi> are
directly againſt this <hi>Sermon's</hi> being St. <hi>Auſtins;</hi> the <hi>ſtyle</hi> is <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>heavy,</hi>
hath not any thing <hi>like</hi> or <hi>near</hi> the <hi>briskneſs, wit,</hi> and <hi>great ſenſe</hi> of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin;</hi>
and further the MSS. uſed by <hi>them,</hi> give it againſt <hi>you,</hi> they
either intitle it to <hi>no Author,</hi> or to <hi>Fulbertus Carnetenſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' my Arguments were not very weighty, yet what I next urged I
thought would fully ſatisfy any ones ſcruples; I mean the <hi>inſtance</hi> of <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores</hi>
being quoted in <hi>it,</hi> by which I ſaid <hi>it was certain that this Sermon muſt
be written after his time who lived in the beginning</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Century.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I ſay is <hi>certain</hi> here <hi>you</hi> tell his Lordſhip is <hi>unprobable.</hi> You give
<hi>this</hi> as <hi>one reaſon,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>that Sermon</hi> ſays <hi>no Author among
the Latins could be found, who</hi> treating of our <hi>bleſſed Ladies Death had been
poſitive, and expreſs;</hi> whereas <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> in the <hi>Sixth Age hath a
moſt full account of our bleſſed Ladies Aſſumption,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Author</hi>
of this <hi>Sermon</hi> muſt have lived before <hi>Gregory,</hi> and conſequently long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Fulbertus,</hi> or <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil.</hi> But I do not ſee <hi>this Conſequence,</hi> it is no
errour to ſuppoſe the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Sermon</hi> had never ſeen <hi>Gregory</hi> of
<hi>Tours Book,</hi> and therefore might have <hi>that expreſſion concerning</hi> no <hi>Latin
Author treating</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Maryes Aſſumption:</hi> Or we may very well
ſuppoſe that if <hi>he</hi> had, <hi>he</hi> reckons <hi>his ſtory</hi> among <hi>thoſe Apocryphal ones</hi>
which were <hi>then writ,</hi> but <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Church of God:</hi> And I cannot
ſee how it ſhould be a fault in <hi>Fulbertus</hi> to reject <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> (if
<hi>he</hi> knew of <hi>him)</hi> as an <hi>Apocryphal Author,</hi> and not in St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who ſo
very long after either <hi>doubted</hi> or <hi>disbelieved</hi> (as you own in the <hi>page</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>this)</hi> the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>moſt full account
of it</hi> in <hi>Gregory; whom</hi> (with the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>this Sermon) he</hi> either did not
<hi>know,</hi> or did not regard.</p>
            <p>Your Anſwer about St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> is very ſtrange, ſince tho' there were
never ſo many <hi>Iſidores</hi> before St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> yet can you, or dare you offer
to ſhew that <hi>any</hi> of <hi>them</hi> were <hi>Writers?</hi> But to drive you from this <hi>weak
hold, we</hi> are certain that the <hi>Iſidore</hi> quoted here is <hi>he</hi> that lived in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Century.</hi> If <hi>you</hi> did look into the <hi>Louvain Edition</hi> when you wrote
<hi>your Letter, you</hi> could not have miſt ſeeing <hi>what book</hi> of <hi>his</hi> the <hi>paſſage</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>from.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61801:5"/>
But I am affraid, Sir, I have to do with <hi>one,</hi> who is reſolved to carry
things by his own wild gueſſes more than by examining things fairly. The
paſſage in the <hi>Sermon</hi> is in <hi>Iſidor's Book de Vita &amp; Morte Sanctorum.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iſidor. de Vita &amp; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te SS. n. 68. p. 168. Edit. Paris 158<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> So
that all your dreams are vaniſhed; and this <hi>one paſſage</hi> enough to have
anſwered your <hi>whole Letter.</hi> I ſhall therefore be ſhorter with the <hi>reſt,</hi> and
tell you that your ſleighting the Judgment of the <hi>Louvain Divines,</hi> and
the <hi>preſent Learned Benedictines</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially when invincibly
ſtrengthened by <hi>this paſſage</hi> from <hi>Iſidore,</hi> and your believing <hi>this Sermon</hi> to
be St <hi>Auſtins,</hi> becauſe <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> believed it to be <hi>his,</hi> diſcovers
(pardon the expreſſion) a very unbecoming obſtinacy; You cannot but
have heard how little a <hi>Critick Monſieur Launoy</hi> hath ſhewn <hi>Aquinas</hi> was,
what <hi>forged Authorities</hi> he uſed and urged as from S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria;</hi>
whereas there was no <hi>ſuch things</hi> in <hi>his works.</hi> This <hi>inſtance,</hi> which you
make uſe of for <hi>your defence,</hi> is an <hi>evidence</hi> as well againſt <hi>him</hi> as <hi>you,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
far more excuſable in <hi>him</hi> than in <hi>you,</hi> ſince <hi>he</hi> lived in ſuch times of
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> and you in times ſo learned; I am very confident that had <hi>he</hi>
ſeen how much is now ſaid againſt <hi>this Sermon, he</hi> would have been far
from acting like <hi>you,</hi> or have been obſtinate in the <hi>defence</hi> of ſuch a noted
forgery.</p>
            <p>I have but room left to tell you that the <hi>Louvain Divines</hi> are of <hi>no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
with <hi>me</hi> except where <hi>their reaſons</hi> are apparently good; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould <hi>they</hi> have <hi>aſſerted</hi> the 18th <hi>Sermon de Sanctis</hi> to have been
St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> as you ſay <hi>they</hi> do) I ſhould not upon good reaſons aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; but that what you ſay here is falſe, is evident from <hi>that note</hi> ſet
by <hi>them</hi> before <hi>this Sermon, that ſome attribute this Sermon to Fulgentius:</hi> and
the <hi>Benedictines</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> are ſo far from <hi>your words,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> ſay the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain
Divines leave it as</hi> DUBIOUS: And <hi>they</hi> for their parts have eaſt it
into the <hi>Appendix</hi> as <hi>Spurious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">*Append. a Tom. 5 p. 321.</note> and give this reaſon for <hi>it</hi> among others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that <hi>it is the work</hi> of <hi>ſome ignorant botcher,</hi> who hath patched it up out of
<hi>ſtolen Sentences:</hi> So that <hi>your quotation</hi> for <hi>Invocation</hi> thence ought to be
ſleighted by that <hi>honourable Lord</hi> as much as your <hi>other</hi> in the <hi>Sermon</hi> before
the <hi>Court</hi> at <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you the trouble of a <hi>Letter;</hi> if you intend a <hi>further Vindication</hi> of your ſelf, pray oblige me ſo far as to haſten it out,
that ſo! may ſtay no longer for <hi>it,</hi> than you have done for <hi>this.</hi> One thing
you may oblige me in further, and that is not onely to <hi>quote,</hi> but to <hi>look</hi>
into thoſe Authors you make uſe of. This will prevent the <hi>multiplying</hi> of
