            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my self in such sort, as to meddle with the exposition of so hard and knotty a Scripture, as here they find the subject matter of this little <hi>Book;</hi> yet do thou remember <hi>that God hath chosen the foolish things of this World to confound the wise, and things that</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I tell you that the operation of the Word and Spirit of God (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depending upon that Idol so much adored) is sufficient of it self <hi>to search out all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>The occasion of my first med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with this matter, was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
               <p>Upon a certain <hi>First day,</hi> I being together with my Brethren, in our Prison-Chamber, they expected
<pb facs="tcp:104034:3"/>
that, according to our Custom, something should be spoken out of the Word, for our mutual Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but at that time I felt my self (it being my turn to speak) so emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, spiritless, and barren, that I thought I should not have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to speak among them so much as five words of Truth, with Life and Evidence: but at last, it so fell out, that providentially I cast mine Eye upon the eleventh Verse of the one and twentieth Chapter of this Prophecie; upon which, when I had considered a while, methought I perceived something of that JA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPER in whose Light you there finde this HOLY CITY is said to come or descend; wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got in my Eye some dim glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings thereof, and finding also in my heart a desire to see further thereinto; I with a few groans did arry my Meditatious to the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:104034:4"/>
JESUS for a Blessing, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> forthwith grant according to his Grace; and helping me to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Brethren, we did all eat, and were well refreshed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold also that while I was in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing of it, it so encreased in my hand, that of the Fragments that we left, after we had well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I gathered up this Basket-full. Methought the more I cast mine Eye upon the whole Discourse, the more I saw lie in it: Wherefore setting my self to a more narrow search, through frequent Prayer to God, (what first with doing, and then with undoing, and after that with doing again) I thus did finish it.</p>
               <p>But yet, notwithstanding all my labour and travel in this matter, I do not, neither can I expect that every Godly Heart should in every thing see the Truth &amp; Excellencie
<pb facs="tcp:104034:4"/>
of what is here discoursed; neither would I have them imagine that I have so thorowly viewed this Holy City, but that much more then I do here crush out, is yet left in the Cluster: Alas! I shall onely say thus, I have crush'd out a little Juyce to sweeten their Lips withal; not doubting but in little time more large measures of the Excellencie of this City, and of its sweetness and glory, will by others be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unfolded; yea, if not by the <hi>Servants</hi> of the Lord JESUS, yet by <hi>the Lord Himself,</hi> who will have this City builded and set in its own place.</p>
               <p>But, I say, for this DISCOURSE, if any of the Saints that read herein, think they find nought at all but words, (as many times it falleth out even in their reading the Scriptures of God themselves) I beg, I say, of such, that they reade charitably,
<pb facs="tcp:104034:5"/>
judge modestly, and also that they would take heed of concluding, that because they for the present see nothing in this or that passage, that therefore there is nothing in it: Possibly from that which thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cast away as an empty Bone, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may pick both good and wholsom Bits; yea, and also out of that suck much nourishing Marrow. You find by experience that that very bit that will not down with One, may yet not onely down, but be healthful and nourishing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Babes are more for Milk than strong Meat, though Meat will well digest with those that are of riper Years, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> To the Learned Reader.</head>
               <p>MY second Word is to my wise and learned Reader.</p>
               <p>Sir, I suppose in your reading of this DISCOURSE, you will be apt to blame me for two things: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have not so beautified my Matter with acuteness of Language as you could wish or desire: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Because also I have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, either in the Line, or in the Margent, a Cloud of Sentences from the Learned FATHERS, that have according to their Wisdom (possibly) handled these Matters long before me.</p>
               <p>To the first, I say, The Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is excellent and high; but for my part, I am weak and low; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:104034:6"/>
deserveth a more full and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Discourse</hi> than my small parts will help me to make upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But yet, seeing <hi>the Lord looketh not at the outward appearance, but on the Heart;</hi> neither regardeth <hi>high swelling words of vanity,</hi> but pure and naked Truth; and seeing also that a Widows Mite being all, even Heart as well as substance, is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more, and better, then to cast in little out of much, and that little too perhaps the worst: I hope, my <hi>little</hi> being <hi>all,</hi> my <hi>Farthing</hi> (seeing I have no more) may be accepted and counted for a great deal in the LORD'S Treasury. Besides, Sir; Words easie to be understood do often <hi>hit the Mark;</hi> when high and learned ones do only <hi>pierce the Air:</hi> He also that speaks to the weakest, may make the Learned understand him; when he that striveth to be high, is not onely for the most part
<pb facs="tcp:104034:6"/>
understood but of a sort, but also many times is neither understood by them, nor by himself.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Reason why you find me empty of the Language of the Learned, I mean their Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Words, which others use, is, because I have them not, nor have not read them: had it not been for the BIBLE, I had not onely not thus done it, but not at all.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I do find in most such a Spirit of Whoredom and Idolatry concerning the Learning of this World, and Wisdom of the Flesh, and GOD'S Glory so much stained and diminished thereby; that had I all their aid and assistance at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I durst not make use of ought thereof, and that for fear lest that Grace, and those Gifts that the LORD hath given me, should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Sir, What you find suiting with Scriptures, take; though it should not suit with Authors: but that which you find against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, slight; though it should be confirmed by Multitudes of them. Yea further, Where you find the Scriptures and your Authors jump, yet believe it for the sake of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Authority.

               </p>
               <p>Mistris, I suppose I have nothing here that will either please your wanton Eye, or go down with your voluptuous Palate: here is Bread indeed, as also Milk and Meat; but here is neither <hi>paint</hi> to adorn thy <hi>wrinkled face,</hi> nor <hi>Crutch</hi> to uphold or undershore thy <hi>shaking, totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, staggering Kingdom of</hi> ROME; but rather a certain presage of thy sudden and fearful final downfall,
<pb facs="tcp:104034:8"/>
and of the Exaltation of that holy Matron, whose Chastity thou dost abhor, because by it she reproveth and condemneth thy leud and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Life. Wherefore, <hi>Lady,</hi> smell thou may'st of this, but taste thou wilt not: I know that both thy<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 12 13.

               <p>But before I begin with any of them, I must speak a word or two concerning <hi>John</hi>'s qualification, whereby he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to behold and take a view of this City; which qualification he relateth in these words following.</p>

                  <p>The Angel being to shew this holy<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> qualified for this Vision.</note> man this great and glorious Vision, he first (by qualifying of him) puts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104034:12"/>
a suitable Capacity to behold and take the view thereof; <hi>He carried me away in the Spirit:</hi> When he saith, <hi>He carried me away in the Spirit,</hi> he means he was taken up into the Spirit, his Soul was greatly spiritualized: Whence take notice, That an ordinary frame of Spirit is not able to comprehend, nor yet to apprehend extraordinary things: Much of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, deserveth much of Gods matters; but little of the Spirit, deserveth but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of them: <hi>I could not speak to you as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babes in Christ; I have fed you with Milk, and not with Meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, nor yet are ye able,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.</p>
                  <q>And he carried me away in the Spirit, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Thus it was with the Saints of old, when God had either special Work for them to do, or great things for them to see: <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he had the vision of this City in the old Law, in the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity at <hi>Babylon,</hi> he must be first fore-fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a competent measure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 2. <hi>John</hi> also, when he had the whole matter of this Prophecie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104034:13"/>
unto him, he must be in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit; <hi>I was</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords day, and heard behinde me a great Voice, as of a Trumpet, talking with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, 11. Whence note again, That when God calls a man to this or<note place="margin">When God calls to Work, he fits for Work.</note> that Work for him, he first fits him with a suitable Spirit: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saith, when God bid him stand upon his Feet, <hi>That the Spirit entered into him, and set him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Feet,</hi> Ezek. 2. 1, 2.</p>
                  <q>And he carried me away, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Mark, <hi>And he carried me</hi> [<hi>away</hi>] &amp;c. As a man must have much of the Spirit that sees much of God, and his goodly matters; so he must be also <hi>carried AWAY with it;</hi> he must by it be taken off from things carnal and earthly, and taken up into the glory of things that are spiritual and heavenly: the Spirit loveth to do what it doth in private; that man to whom God intendeth to reveal great things, he takes him aside from the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and cumber of this World, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth him away in the solace and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the things of another World; <hi>And when they were alone, he expounded</hi>

Whence observe also, He is the man that is like to know most of God, that is oftenest in <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 2. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 34, 35, 36 37, 38.</note> private with him: He that obeyeth, when God saith, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> he shall see <hi>the Bride, the Lambs Wife: For a man through desire having SEPARATED himself, seeketh and intermedleth with all Wisdom,</hi> Prov. 18. 1.</p>
                  <q>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high Mountain.</q>
                  <p>Thus having shewed his frame, and inward disposition of Spirit; he now comes to tell us also of the Place or Stage on which he was set; to the end that now being fitted by illumination, he might not be hindered of his Vision by ought that might intercept: <hi>He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high Mountain.</hi> Thus did God of old also; for when he shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> the Patterns of the<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 3.</note>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104034:14"/>

                  <q>—To a great and high Mountain.</q>
                  <p>This <hi>Mountain</hi> therefore signifieth the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> on which the Soul must be placed, as on a mighty Hill, whereby he may be able (his Eyes being anointed with spiritual Eye-salve) to see over the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the Language of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is to be acknowledged for the Church and Spouse of the Lord Jesus; and is to be considered either generally, or more particularly: Now as she is to be taken generally, so she is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as being <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>the whole Family in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth;</hi> and as she is thus looked upon, so she is not considered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to this or that state and condition of the Church here in the world, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as she is the Church: therefore it is said, when at any time any are converted from Satan to God, <hi>That they are come to</hi>

                  <p>But again, As <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</note> to be understood, so also she is to be considered more particularly: 1.

With reference to her being recovered again from her apostatized and captivated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Thus it was with <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the Letter; which threefold state of this City shall be most exactly answered by our <hi>Gospel-Jerusalem,</hi> by out New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church. Her first state was in the days of Christ and his Apostles, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the days of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> her second state is in the days of Antichrist, and answereth to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the Jews from their City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and her third state is this in the Text, and answereth to their return from Captivity, and rebuilding their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104034:15"/>
and Walls again: All which will be fully manifest in this Discourse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Besides, That this holy City that here you read of, is the Church, the Gospel-Church, returning out of her long and Antichristian Captivity; consider,</p>
                  <p>First, She is here called <hi>a City,</hi> the very name that our Primitive <note n="†" place="margin">Ephes. 3. 19.</note> Church went under; which name she loseth all the while of her Apostatizing and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity under Antichrist: for observe, I say, all the while she is under the scourge of the <hi>Dragon, Beast,</hi> and the <hi>Woman in Scarlet,</hi> &amp;c. she goeth under the name of<note place="margin">Rev. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>a Woman, a Woman in travel, a Woman fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Dragon, a Woman flying into the Wilderness,</hi> there to continue in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and tempted condition, and to be glad of Wilderness-Nourishment, until the time of her Enemies were come to an end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason why she lost the title of <hi>City,</hi> at her going into Captivity, is, Because then she lost her situation and strength; she followed others then Christ, wherefore he suffered her Enemies to scale her Walls, to break down her Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; he suffered, as you see here,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104034:16"/>
the great Red Dragon, and Beast with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads and ten Horns, to get into her Vineyard, who made most fearful work both with her and all her Friends: her Gates also was now either broken down, or shut up, so that none could according to her Laws and Statutes enter into her; her Charter also, even the Bible it self, was most grosly abused and corrupted, yea, sometimes burned and destroyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most utterly: wherefore the Spirit of God doth take away from her the title of <hi>City,</hi> and leaveth her to be termed a <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Woman,</hi> as aforesaid: <hi>The Court that is without the Temple</hi> (saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) <hi>leave out, and measure it not, for it is given to the Gentiles; and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months,</hi> Rev. 11. 2. <hi>The Holy City shall they tread under foot;</hi> that is, all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Constitutions, her Forts and Strength, her Laws and Priviledges for a long time shall be laid aside and slighted, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a hissing, a taunt, and a by-word among the Nations. And truly thus it was in the Letter, in the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and his wicked Instruments, by whose hands the City was broken up, the Walls pulled
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104034:16"/>

                  <p>Secondly, The phrase also that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this of <hi>City,</hi> doth much concern the point; she is here called, <hi>The new and holy City,</hi> which words are explained by these, <hi>As a Bride adorned and prepared for her Husband:</hi> the meaning is, That she is now got into her Form, Fashion, Order and Priviledges again; she is now ready, adorned, prepared, and put into her Primitive state: Mark, though she was in her state of affliction called a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> yet she was not then either called a <hi>City,</hi> or a <hi>Woman ADORNED;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Woman robbed &amp; spoiled, rent and torn among the briers and thorns of the Wilderness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 6. &amp; 42. 22. &amp; 32. 13, 14. Wherefore this City is nothing else but the Church returned out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity from under the reign of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> As is yet further manifest, because,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104034:17"/>Thirdly, We finde no City to answer that which was built after the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Captivity, but this: for this, and onely this is the City that you finde in this Prophecie, that is nominated as the Antitype of <hi>that Second of the Jews:</hi> wherefore <hi>John</hi> hath no relation of her while towards the doom of Antichrist, and no description of her in particular until Antichrist's utterly overthrown: as all may see that wisely read the 17th, 18th, 19th, &amp; 20th Chapters of this Prophecie.</p>
                  <q>—And shewed me that great City.</q>
                  <p>The holy Ghost is pleased at this time<note place="margin">Why the Church at this day is called by the name of a <hi>City,</hi> rather than a Woman, Temple, House, or the like.</note> to give the Church the name of a <hi>City,</hi> rather than any other name; rather than the name of <hi>Spouse, Woman, Temple,</hi> and the like: (though he giveth us her under the name of a Woman also, to help us to understand what he means) but I say, the name of a <hi>City</hi> is now the name in special, under which the Church must go, and that for special Reasons:</p>
                  <p>First, To shew us how great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a People will then be in the Church; the Church may be a <hi>Woman,</hi> a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104034:17"/>
                     <hi>Temple,</hi> a <hi>Spouse,</hi> when she is but few, but an handful, but two or three; but to be a <hi>City,</hi> and that in her glory, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks great store of Members, Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and Citizens; especially when she goeth under the name of <hi>a GREAT City,</hi> as here she does: <hi>He shewed me that GREAT City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, She goeth rather under the name of a <hi>City,</hi> than <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Spouse;</hi> to shew us also how plentifully the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms of men shall at that day traffick with her, and in her, for her goodly Merchandize of Grace and Life: to shew us, I say, what wonderful custom the Church of God at this day shall have among all sorts of People, for her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treasures. It is said of <hi>Tyrus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 27 Rev. 18. 2, 3.</note> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> That their Merchandize went into all the World, and men from all quarters under Heaven came to trade and to deal with them for their Wares: why thus it will be in the latter day with the Church of God, the Nations shall come from far; from <hi>Tarshish, Pul, Lud, Tubal, Javan, and the Isles afar off;</hi> They shall come, saith God, <hi>out of all Nations upon Horses and Mules, and upon swift Beasts, to my holy Mountain Jerusalem:</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104034:18"/>
                     <hi>And it shall come to pass, that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord,</hi> Isa. 66. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Alas, the Church at that day when she is a <hi>Woman</hi> onely, or a <hi>Temple</hi> either, may be without that Beauty, Treasure, Amiableness, and affecting Glory that she will be endowed with when she is a prosperous City: <hi>His marvelous kindness is seen in a strong City,</hi> Psal. 31. 21. In Cities, you know, are the Treasures, Beauty, and Glory of Kingdoms, and 'tis thither men go, that are desirous to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themselves therewith: <hi>Out of Zion, the perfection of</hi>

                     <hi>Beauty, God hath shined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is called a <hi>City</hi> rather than a <hi>Woman,</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> to shew us how strong and securely it will keep its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants at that day; <hi>In that day shall this Song be sung, We have a strong City; Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will God appoint for Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks:</hi> And verily if the Cities of the<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 1, 2.

                  <p>But lastly and more especially, The Church is called here <hi>a City,</hi> chiefly to shew us that now she shall be undermost no longer: <hi>Babylon</hi> reigned, and so shall <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at this day; <hi>And thou, O Tower of the Flock, the strong hold of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first Dominion, the Kingdom shall come to the Daughter of Jerusalem,</hi> Mic. 4. 8.

For observe it, Christ hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained the Kingdom of Heaven for those that are his, when this World is ended, but hath also, as a Reward for his Sufferings, the whole World given into his hand; wherefore as all the Kings and Princes and Powers of this World have had their time to reign, and have Glory in this World in the Face of all; so Christ will have his time at this day to shew who is <hi>the onely Potentate and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 15. At which day, he will not onely set up his Kingdom in the midst of their Kingdoms, as he doth now, but will set it up even upon the top of their Kingdoms; at which day there will not be a Nation in the World, but must bend to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or perish: For <hi>the</hi>

O Holiness! how shall it shine in Kings and Nations, when God doth this!</p>
                  <q>He shewed me that great City, the holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, descending out of Heaven from God.</q>
                  <p>In these words we are to enquire into three things:</p>
                  <p>First, What he here should mean by <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What it is for this City to <hi>descend out of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And why she is said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend out of it <hi>from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, For the word <hi>Heaven,</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it is variously to be understood, but generally either materially or metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically: Now not materially here, but metaphorically; and so is generally, if not always, taken in this Book.</p>
                  <p>Now that it is not to be taken for the material Heavens where Christ in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is: Consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:104034:20"/>That the descending of this City, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not the coming of glorified Saints with their Lord; because that even after the descending, yea, and building of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there shall be Sinners converted to God; but at the coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus from Heaven with his Saints, <hi>the door shall be shut;</hi> that is, the door of Grace, against all Unbelievers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Heaven here is to be taken metaphorically, for the Church; which, as I said before, is frequently so taken in this Prophecie, as also in many others of the holy Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. &amp; 12. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 13. &amp; 13. 6. &amp; 19. 1, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 48. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 1. &amp;c. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, though the Church of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny of Antichrist, loseth the title of <hi>a standing City,</hi> yet in the worst of times she loseth not the title of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> She is <hi>Heaven</hi> when the great Red Dragon is in her, and <hi>Heaven</hi> when the third part of her Stars are cast unto the Earth; she is <hi>Heaven</hi> also when the Beast doth open his Throat against her, <hi>to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme her God, his Tabernacle, and those that dwell in her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now then to shew you what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104034:20"/>
are to understand by this, that she is said to <hi>DESCEND out of Heaven;</hi> for indeed to speak properly, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is always in the Scriptures set in the highest ground, and men are said to descend, when they<note place="margin">Ezr. 3. 1. Neh. 12. 1 Mat. 20. 17, 18. Luk. 19. 28. &amp; 10. 30.</note> go down from her, but to ascend, or go up, when they are going thitherwards: but yet though this be true, there must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be something significant in this word <hi>descending;</hi> wherefore when he saith, he saw this City to <hi>DESCEND out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he would have us understand,</p>
                  <p>1. That though the Church under Antichrist be never so low, yet out of her Loins shall they come <hi>that yet shall be a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 6, 13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>reigning City:</hi> Generation is a descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Loins of our Friends; he therefore speaks of the generation of the Church: Wherefore the meaning is, That out of the Church that is now in Captivity, there shall come a compleat City, so exact in all things, according to the Laws and Liberties, Priviledges and Riches of a City, that she shall lie level with the great Charter of Heaven. Thus it was in the Type, the City after the Captivity was builded, even by those that once were in Captivity, especially by their Seed and Off-spring; and thus it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104034:21"/>
shall be in our New - Testament New <hi>Jerusalem; They that shall be of thee,</hi> saith<note place="margin">Isa. 45.</note> the Prophet, (that is, of the Church in affliction) <hi>they shall build the old waste pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; thou shalt raise up the Foundations of many Generations; and thou shalt be called, The Repairer of Breaches, and the Restorer of Paths to dwell in;</hi> and again, They that sometimes had Ashes for Gladness, and the Spirit of Heaviness instead of the Garment of Praise, <hi>They shall build the old Wastes, they shall raise up the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, and they shall repair the waste Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Desolations of many Generations; for your shame you shall have double, and for confusion they shall rejoyce in their Portion,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 58. 11, 12. &amp; 61. 3, 4, 7. Thus therefore by <hi>descending,</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Churches Generation shall be this Holy City, and shall build up themselves the <hi>Tower of the Flock.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>1.

                  <p>These last words do put the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of doubt, and do most clearly shew unto us, that the descending of this City is the perfect return of the Church out of Captivity: The Church, when she began at first to go into Captivity, her Glory began to depart from her; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104034:24"/>
now she is returning again, she receiveth therewith her former Glory, <hi>having the Glory of God.</hi> Thus it was in the Type, when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> went into Captivity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the <hi>Captivity</hi> of our New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church under Antichrist) it is said <hi>that then the glory of God departed from them,</hi> and went by degrees, first out of the Temple <hi>to the Threshold of the House,</hi> and from thence with the Cherubims of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>for that time quite away from the City,</hi> Ezek. 10. 4, 18. &amp; 11. 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Again, As the Glory of God depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this City at her going into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; so when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she returned again, she had also then <hi>returned to her the Glory of God;</hi> whereupon this very Prophet that saw the Glory of God go from her at her going into Captivity, did see it, the very same; and that according as it departed, so return at her deliverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He brought me to the Gate,</hi> saith he, (that is, when by a Vision he saw all the Frame and Patterns of the City and Temple, in the state in which it was to be after the Captivity) <hi>he brought me to the Gate that looketh toward the East, and behold the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the God of Israel came from the way</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:104034:24"/>
                     <hi>the East</hi> (the very same way that it went, when it departed from the City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 23.) <hi>his Voice was like the Voice of many Waters, and the Earth shined with his Glory; It was according to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Vision which I saw, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vision that I saw when I came to destroy the City, and the Vision was like the Vision that I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face, and the Glory of the Lord came into the House by the way of the Gate, whose prospect is towards the East: so the Spirit took me up, and brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inner Court, and behold, the Glory of the Lord filled the House,</hi> Ezek. 43. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see it was in the Destruction and Restoration of the Jews <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by which God doth plainly shew us how things will be in our Gospel-Church; she was to decline and lose her glory, she was to be trampled (as she was a City)<note place="margin">Rev. 11.</note> for a long time under the feet of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted and wicked World: Again, She was after this to be builded, and to be put into her former Glory; at which time she was to have her Glory, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Glory, even <hi>the Glory of God</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her again; <hi>He shewed me,</hi> saith <hi>John,</hi>

                  <q>—And her Light was like unto a Stone most precious—</q>
                  <p>This Stone it is to represent unto us the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose light and clearness this City comes out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> for, as he saith, she hath the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> that is, his visible hand of Grace, Power, and Majesty, to bring her forth; so she comes in the light of this precious <hi>Stone:</hi> which terms, I say, both the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> do apply to the Lord Jesus, and none else; the one calling him, <hi>A precious Corner-Stone,</hi> the other calling him, <hi>The chief Corner-Stone, elect and precious,</hi> Isa. 28. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 6. Now then, when he saith this City hath the light of this Stone to descend in, he means, That she comes in the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wisdom, Knowledge, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Influences of Christ, out of her afflicted and captivated State: and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, she is rather said to descend in the <hi>Light of this Stone,</hi> then in the Light of God (though both be true) because it is <hi>the Man Christ, the Stone which the</hi>

                  <p>This sheweth us then these two things: first, That the time of the return of the Saints to build the ruinous City, is near, yea, very near, when the Light of the Lord Jesus begins to shine unto perfect day in her: God will not bring forth his People out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> especially those that are to be the chief in the building of this City, without their own Judgments:<note place="margin">The light of the Church shall be according to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Word.</note> 
                     <hi>They shall see Eye to Eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion:</hi> as he saith also in another place, <hi>The light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun sevenfold, as the light of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the Breach of his People, and healeth the</hi>

                     <hi>and be very high, for he will fill Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Judgement and Righteousness, and Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times:</hi> When <hi>Israel</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they wanted much of this; they went out blindfolded as it were, they went they knew not whither; wherefore they went not in the glory of that which this City descendeth in; as <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>The Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive, nor Eyes to see, nor Ears to hear, unto this day,</hi> Deut. 29. 4. But these shall see every step they take; they shall be like the Beasts that had Eyes both before and behind; they shall see how far they are come out of Antichrist, and shall see also how far yet they have to go, to the compleat rebuilding and finishing of this City.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This sheweth us how sweet<note place="margin">The Way out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon a pleasant Way</note> and pleasant the way of this Church will be at this day before them: Light, Knowledge and Judgement in GOD's matters, doth not onely give men to see and behold all the things with which they are concerned, but the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being good, they do also by this means convey very great sweetness and pleasantness into the Hearts of those that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104034:32"/>
have the knowledge of them: Every step, I say, that now they take, it shall be as it were in Honey and Butter: <hi>The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with Songs, and everlasting</hi>

                     <hi>Joy shall be upon their Heads; they shall obtain Joy and Gladness, and Sorrow and Sighing shall flee away,</hi> Isa. 35. 10. as he saith, <hi>Again, I will build thee, and thou shalt be built; O Virgin of Israel, thou shalt again be adorned with Tabrets, and shalt go forth in the Dances of them that make merry.—For thus saith the Lord, Sing with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the Nations; publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord save thy People, the Remnant of Israel: Behold, I will bring them from the North Country, and gather them from the coasts of the Earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with Child, and her that travelleth with Child together; a very great company shall return thither,</hi> Jer. 31. 4, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>By these words, <hi>the Blind and the Lame, the Woman with Child, and her that travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,</hi> he would have us understand thus much:</p>
                  <p>First, That the way of God shall by the illuminating Grace of Christ be

                  <p>Secondly, This City upon the time of her rebuilding, shall have her blind men see, her halt and lame made strong, she also that is with Child, and her that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth, shall joyntly see the City-work that at this day will be on foot, and put into form and order, yet before the end: <hi>Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee,</hi> saith the Lord to this People, <hi>and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praise and fame in every Land where they have been put to shame; at that time I will bring you again, even in the time that I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you: for I will make you a Name and a Praise, among all People of the Earth,</hi>

                  <q>And her Light was like unto a Stone most precious.</q>
                  <p>In that he saith, <hi>Her Light is like unto A STONE MOST PRECIOUS,</hi> he sheweth us how welcome, and with what eagerness of spirit this Light will at this day be imbraced by the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Truly the Light is good,</hi> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes</hi>

                  <p>These words are the Metaphor by which the Holy Ghost is pleased to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the whole business. Indeed Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, if fitly spoke and applyed, do much set off, and out, any point, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Doctrines of Faith or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is handled in the Churches. Wherefore, because he would illustrate, as well as affirm, the Glory of this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to the life; therefore he concludes his general Description of this City with these Comparisons: <hi>I saw,</hi> saith he, <hi>the holy City, the Lambs Wife:</hi> I saw her in her Spangles, and in all her Adorning, but verily she was most excellent; <hi>She was shining as the Jasper, and as pure and clear as Crystal.</hi> The Jasper it seems is a very beautiful and costly Stone, in as much, as that above all the precious Stones, is made use of by the Holy Ghost to shew us the Glory and shining Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues

of the Lord Jesus in this <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> and yet, behold! the Jasper is too short and slender to do the business; there must another Stone be added, <hi>Even like a Jasper Stone, clear as Crystal.</hi> Yea, saith the Lord Jesus, <hi>Her Cheeks are like rows of Jewels, and so are the Joynts of her Things: even like the Jewels that are the work of the hands of a cunning Workman,</hi> Cant. 1. 9, 10. &amp; 7. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Crystal is a Stone so clear and spotless, that even her greatest Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in the midst of all their rage, are not able, justly, to charge her with the least mote or spot imaginable: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he saith, that this City in her descending is <hi>even like the Jasper for light, and like the Crystal for clearness;</hi> he would have us further learn, that at the day of the descending of this <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> she shall be every way so accomplished with innocency, sincerity, and clearness in all her Actions, that none shall have from her, or her ways, any just occasion given unto them to slight, contemn, or oppose her. For</p>
                  <p>First, as she descends, she meddleth not with any mans matters but her own; <hi>She comes all along by the Kings high-way:</hi>

that is, alone by the Rules that her Lord hath prescribed for her in his Testament. The Governours of this World need not at all to fear a disturbance from her, or a diminishing of ought they have: <hi>She will not meddle with their Fields, nor Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, neither will she drink of the water of their Wells: onely let her go by the Kings high-way, and she will not turn to the right</hi>

                  <p>And observe it, that of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that you read of, touching the fence, fashion, or frame of this City, and of all her glory, the first thing that he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to our view, is, her Safety and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>She had a Wall.</hi> A Wall, you know, is for the Safety, Security, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

and Preservation of a Place, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Town; therefore it is much to the purpose that in the first place after this general description, he should fall upon a discovery of her Security and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for what of all this Glory and Goodness, if there be no way to defend and preserve it in its high and glorious state?

                  <p>Secondly, As by these <hi>twelve,</hi> we are to understand the <hi>Truth and Purity of the Doctrine of the Twelve;</hi> so again by this word <hi>twelve,</hi> we are to understand the sufficiency of that Doctrine and Ministry to bring in the twelve Tribes to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of this City: Mark, for the twelve Tribes there are twelve Gates, for every Tribe a Gate; and at the twelve Gates, twelve Angels, at every Gate an Angel: <hi>O Judah,</hi> saith God, <hi>I have set</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 6. 11</note>

                     <hi>them,</hi> saith God, <hi>and gather them, for I have reedeemed them; and they shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease as they have increased: and I will sow them among the Nations, and they shall remember me in far Countreys, and they shall live with their Children, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and I will bring them again also out of the Land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria, and I will bring them into the Land of Gilead and Lebanon, and place shall not be found for them,</hi> Zech. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the second Question,<note place="margin">Why the twelve Angels stand at the twelve Gates.</note> that is, Why these twelve Angels are said to stand at the Gates? which may be for divers Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, To shew us that the Doctrine of the Twelve, is the Doctrine that letteth in at these Gates, &amp; that also that shutteth out: <hi>Whose sins ye remit, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 18.</note> saith Christ; <hi>and whose sins ye retain, they are retained:</hi> And hence it is that<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 23.</note> the true Ministers in their right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, are called <hi>Porters;</hi> because as<note place="margin">Mark 13. 34.</note> Porters stand at the Gate, and there open to, or shut upon those that make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to enter in; so the Ministers of Christ by the Doctrine of the Twelve,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 23. 19.</note> do both open to, and shut the Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104034:47"/>
the Persons that will be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter in at the Gates of this City.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But again, They are said to stand at the Gates for the incouraging and perswading of the tempted and doubting Jews, who at the beginning of their return will be much afflicted under the sight and sence of their own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness: Alas! were it not for some to stand at the Gates of this City for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the incouragement of those that will, at that day in earnest be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after life, they might labour as in other things for very very Vanity; and might also be so grievously beat out of Heart and Spirit, that they might die in despair: But now to prevent this, for those that are in the way to <hi>Zion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:104034:47"/>
                     <hi>Trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the Land of Assyria, and the out-casts of the Land of Egypt, and shall worship the Lord in the holy Mount at Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>—And at the Gates twelve Angels, and Names written thereon, which are the Names of the twelve Tribes of the Children of Israel.</q>
                  <p>Thus it was in the Vision of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Ezek. 48. 31.</note> when he was taking a View of the Pattern of this City; <hi>And the Gates of the City,</hi> saith the Angel to him, <hi>shall be after the Names of the Tribes of Israel;</hi> which saying <hi>John</hi> doth here expound, saying, <hi>The Names of the twelve Tribes of the Children of Israel, were writ or set upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being thus, it cleareth to you what I said but now, to wit, That the Gates are called twelve, <hi>to answer the twelve Tribes, for their Names are written thereon:</hi> This must therefore without all doubt be a very great incouragement to this despised People; I say great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that notwithstanding all their Rebellion, Blasphemy, and contempt of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104034:48"/>
the glorious Gospel, their Names should yet be found recorded and ingraved upon the very Gates of New <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Thus then shall the Jews be comforted in the latter days; and truly they will have but need hereof; for doubtless at their return, when they are throughly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Murder they have committed, not onely upon the Bodies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, but of the Son of God himself: I say this must needs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the remembrance of the rest of their villanous actions, exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and distress their bleeding Souls: <hi>for the Children of Israel shall come, they and the Children of Judah together, going and weeping; they shall go and seek the Lord their God, and shall ask the way to Zion, with their Faces thitherward,</hi> Jer. 50. 4, 5. Mark, <hi>going and weeping;</hi> there will not be a step that these poor People will take in the day of their returning, but will be watered with the Tears of Repentance and Contrition, under the consideration of the wickedness that in the days of their Rebellion, they have committed against the Lord of Glory: as he saith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by another Prophet, <hi>I will pour upon the House of David, and upon the Inhabitants</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:104034:48"/>
                     <hi>of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as a Man mourns for his onely Son; and they shall be in bitterness for him, as him that is in bitterness for his first-born: at that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Valley of Megiddon, and the Land shall mourn,</hi> Zech. 12. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I say, they both have and also will have need of twelve Gates, and on them the Names of their twelve Tribes, with an Angel at each, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to enter this holy and goodly City; and to tell them that yet he counts them his Friends, in whose<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 6.</note> House he received the wounds in his Hands.</p>
                  <p>But again, As by the Names of the twelve Tribes written on the Gates, we may see what incouragement the Jews will have, at their Return, to enter in at them: so we may also understand that by the Names of the twelve Tribes here written, God would have us to perceive how all must be qualified, that from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles at this day do enter in at these Gates; namely, Those, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104034:49"/>

                  <p>From the order of their standing, I shall enquire into two things:</p>
                  <p>First, Why the <hi>Gates</hi> should look in this manner every way, both <hi>East, West, North,</hi> and <hi>South?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Why there should be three, just three, on every side of this City; <hi>On the East three, on the North three, on the South three, and on the West three?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the First, The Gates by looking<note place="margin">Why the Gates look eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Way.</note> every way, into all Quarters, may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to us thus much, That God hath a People in every corner of the World: and also, That Grace is to be carried out at these Gates by the Angels in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, into every place, to gather them home to him: as it is said of the living Creatures, <hi>Whither the Head looked, they</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, The Gates by their thus look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1</note> every way, do signifie to us, That from what Quarter or Part of the World
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104034:50"/>
soever men come for Life, for those men there are the Gates of Life, even right before their doors: Come they from the East, why thither look the Gates; and so if they come from North, or West, or South: No Man needs at all to go about, to come at Life, and Peace, and Rest: Let him come directly <hi>from Sin to Grace, from Satan to Jesus Christ, and from this World to New Jerusalem.</hi> The twelve Brazen Oxen that <hi>Solomon</hi> made to bear<note place="margin">1 Kin. 7. 23, 24, 25</note> the molten Sea, they stood just as these Gates stand, and signifie, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Doctrine of the twelve Apostles should be carried into all the World, to convert (as in the Primitive Times, so now at the building of New <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) and to bring in Gods Sheep to the Fold of his Church: Now I say, as the Word is carried every way, so the Gates, the open Gates, look also into all corners after them, to signifie that loving Reception that shall be given to every Soul that from any corner of the whole World shall unfainedly close in with Grace, through the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus therefore <hi>Men shall come from the East, and from the West, from the North, and from the South, and sit down in the</hi>

                  <q>On the East three Gates, on the North three Gates, on the South three Gates, and on the West three Gates.</q>
                  <p>Having thus shewed you in a word why they stand thus looking into every Corner or Quarter of the World; I now come to shew you why there must be just <hi>three</hi> looking in this manner every way.</p>
                  <p>First then, There may be three looking<note place="margin">Why there is three Gates looking every Way.</note> every way, to signifie that it is both by the consent of the Three Persons in the Trinity, that the Gospel should thus every way go forth to call men: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to shew you, that both the Father, Son and Spirit are willing to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Sinner from whatsoever part or corner of the Earth he cometh hither for Life and Safety: Come they from whence they will, the Father is willing to give them the Son, and so is the Son to give them Himself, and so is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to give them its help against whatever may labour to hinder them while they are here, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that three of the Gates
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104034:51"/>
look every way, it may be also to shew us, that there is none can enter into this City, but by the three Offices of the Lord Jesus; Christ by his Priestly Office must wash away their Sins; and by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office he must illuminate, teach, guide and refresh them; and by his Kingly Office rule over them, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them with his Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 10, 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 6, 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Or by three Gates, may be signified the three states of the Saints in this Life; an entrance into Childhood,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 12, 13, 14.</note> an entrance into a Manly state, and an entrance into the state of a Father in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Or lastly, The three Gates may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the threefold state we pass thorow from Nature to Glory: The state of Grace in this Life, the state of Felicity in Paradise, and our state in Glory after the Resurrection: Or thus, The state of Grace that possesseth Body and Soul in this Life, the state of Glory that posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul at Death, and the state of Glory that both Body and Soul shall be possessed with at the coming of the Lord

                  <p>First, It hath <hi>twelve Foundations:</hi> This argueth invincible strength and support. That Wall that hath but one Foundation, how strongly doth it stand, if it be but

                  <q>And the Wall of the City had twelve Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and in them the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>The Wall, you know, I told you, is the <hi>Wall of Salvation,</hi> or <hi>the Safety of the Church by Jesus Christ;</hi> to which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, as the effect of that, <hi>the special Providence and Protection of God:</hi> Now this Wall, saith the Holy Ghost, hath twelve Foundations, to wit, to bear it up for the continuation of the safety and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of those that are the Inhabitants of this City; a Foundation is that which beareth up all, and that upon which the stress of all must lie and abide: Now to speak properly, the Foundation of our

Happiness is but one, and that one none but the Lord Jesus; for <hi>other Foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11. So then, when he saith the Wall of the City had twelve Foundations, and that in them also are written the Names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Lamb; he doth not mean that this Wall had twelve Christs for its support, but, <hi>That the Doctrine of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is the Doctrine of the twelve Apostles that holds up the Wall of New Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> 
                     <hi>twelve Apostles is that Doctrine upon which both Christ, and Grace, and all Happiness standeth firm and sure for ever:</hi> and to signifie also, that neither Christ nor any of his Benefits can be profitable unto thee, unless thou receive him alone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the terms that they do hold him forth and offer him to Sinners in their Word and Doctrine: <hi>If we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach unto you any other Gospel,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, than that which we have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto you, let him be accursed: As I said before, so I say now again, If any man preach any other Gospel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8, 9.</p>

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:104034:53"/>And in them the Names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in them their Names:</hi>] This makes it manifest that by the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Wall, we are to understand the Doctrine of the twelve Apostles of the Lord Christ, <hi>for their Names are to it,</hi> or found ingraved in the Foundations. Thus it was with the Doctrine which was the Foundation of the Jewish Church: the first Pattern being delivered by the man <hi>Moses;</hi> his Name was always so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to that Doctrine, that at last it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came common, and that by Divine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, to call that Doctrine by the name of <hi>Moses</hi> himself: <hi>There is one that accuseth you,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>even Moses in whom you trust:</hi> and again, <hi>For Moses of old hath in every City them that preach him.</hi> John 5. 45. Act. 15. 21. The same liberty of speech doth the Holy Ghost here use in speaking of the Foundations of this Wall, which is the Doctrine of the Twelve. And in that he calleth the Doctrine by the Name of <hi>Foundations,</hi> and leaveth it onely with telling us the Names of the twelve Apostles are engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104034:54"/>
in it; he expects that men should be wise that read him, and that they should be skilful in the Word of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, if they come up clearly to the understanding of him.</p>
                  <q>And in them the Names of the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>Thus you see that the twelve Apostles,<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the XII, the purest of all other.</note> above all the Servants of Christ, are here owned to be the foundations of this <hi>Wall;</hi> and good reason, for they above all other are most clear and full in the Doctrine of Grace, and all Doctrines pertaining to Life and Holiness: <hi>In other Ages,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, it was not made known to the Sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Prophets by the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 3. 5. <hi>Moses</hi> was not fit for this, for his was a more dark and vailed Administration; <hi>While Moses is read, the Vail is over the</hi>

                     <hi>Heart,</hi> saith <hi>Paul:</hi> Neither was any of the Prophets fit for this, for they were all inferiour to <hi>Moses,</hi> and were as it<note place="margin">Num. 12. 6, 7.</note> were his Scholars: Nay, <hi>John the Baptist</hi> is here shut out; for <hi>the least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

                     <hi>of Heaven is greater then he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostles above all other were the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104034:54"/>
men that were with the Lord Jesus all the time, from the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time he was taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; they saw him, heard him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed with him, and were Beholders<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 39, 40.</note> of all the wondrous Works that he did; they did eat and drink with him after his Passion, and saw after he was risen, the print of the Nails and the Spear with which he was peirced, when he died for our Sins: And because they had seen,<note place="margin">The XII went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all others in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> felt, and at such a rate experienced all things from the very first, both touching his Doctrine, Miracles, and Life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said unto them in chief, <hi>Ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Earth,</hi> Act. 1. 21. &amp; 13. 31. &amp; 10. 39. &amp; 2. 31. 1 Joh. 1. 2, 3. Act. 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>Further, The Apostles were in that marvellous manner indued with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, that they out-stript all the Prophets that ever went before them; neither can I believe that in the best of times there should be any beyond them; yet if it should so fall out, that a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation should come, in which they should have, as to the pouring forth of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104034:55"/>
Spirit, their Equals; yet it could not follow, that therefore the Gospel should be offered in other terms than they at first have offered it; especially besides what hath been said of them, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to them 'twas said, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18. 18. they, as to their Doctrine, were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 'twas impossible they should err; he that despised their Doctrine, despised<note place="margin">1 Thess. 3. 8.</note> God himself: Besides, they have given in commandment that all should write<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may not be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> after their Coppy, and that we should judge both Men and Angels that did, or would do otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> must have his Rule from <hi>Paul,</hi> and so must holy <hi>Titus:</hi> All which, if we consider it, the holy Ghost speaks to the purpose, in saying, <hi>That in the twelve Foundations are found the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb:</hi> they are called the chief, and such as have laid the Foundation, and others build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that as no men have laid the Foundation but they, so none can lay even that Foundation otherwise then they afore have laid it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.

                  <q>—And in them the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>These words then, teach us two things worthy of our Christian Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>First, That God hath given to every man a certain and visible mark to aim at for his Salvation, or to build his Soul upon, namely, <hi>The Doctrine of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb:</hi> for in that he saith their Names are in the Foundations, it is better for us (all things considered) then if he had said, In them was the Name of God himself; that is, it is more easie to see (this way) through the mist of our Carnality what the Mystery of his Will should be, which is, that we receive Christ according to their Doctrine, Words, Writings, Epistles, Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Names, I say, being there,<note place="margin">The Names of the XII, as the Broad Seal of Heaven.</note> God counts it as the Broad Seal of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which giveth Authority to all that Doctrine whereunto by themselves they are prefixed and subscribed; not where they are writ by others, but by themselves
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104034:56"/>
I say, <hi>as the Token of every Epistle,</hi> and of<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 17.</note> their Doctrine for Truth; the which<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> insinuates, when he saith, that <hi>his</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 1</note> 
                     <hi>hand is the Token of every Epistle:</hi> as he<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> saith again, <hi>Am not I an Apostle?</hi> And<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 5.</note> again, <hi>Behold, I Paul have written unto</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>you;</hi> I <hi>Paul,</hi> I an Apostle, I a wise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Builder, I who am in my Doctrine one of the Foundations of the Wall of Salvation, I have written unto you. And, as I said before, there is a reason it should be thus; for as he who was the Foundation of the Jewish Church, even <hi>Moses,</hi> received the Pattern of all his Order from the Mouth of the Angel in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> so the twelve received their Doctrine of Faith and Manners, the Doctrine of the New Testament, from the Mouth of the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as from the Mouth of the Angel of the everlasting Covenant, on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Zion,</hi> Act. 7. 38. &amp; 1. 3. Matth. 28. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that he saith, <hi>The Names of the Twelve are in the Foundations,</hi> this shews us the reason of the continual standing of this <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> it is builded upon the Doctrine of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Lamb, and standeth there:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104034:56"/>
for observe, so long as he sees this holy City, he sees her standing upon these Foundations; but he saw the City till she was taken up, therefore she continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as being settled for ever upon them. Indeed the Primitive City, or first Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, was built upon these Foundations,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> and had also so long as they there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, sufficient supportation &amp; upholding by that means; but then, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, the Wall of her Salvation, and the Wall of Gods special Protection stood at a distance each from other, and were not so conjoyned as now they will be: wherefore they then, to answer the Type, did fall into the Ditch that was between, and through their Foolishness provoked God to remove the Wall of his outward Protection and Safeguard from them; whereupon the wild Beast, Antichrist, got into his Vineyard, making havock of all their Dainties: But mark, this City is not so, the Walls are now conjoyned, and for ever fastened upon the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therefore it abides for ever, and ascends higher and higher; yet not from the Foundations but by them into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Behold,</hi> saith God, <hi>I have graven</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 16</note>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:104034:57"/>And in them the Names of the twelve A. postles of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>This word <hi>twelve,</hi> must be warily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, or else the weak will be ready to stumble and take offence; wherefore to prevent this, consider,</p>
                  <p>First, The Twelve must be them<note place="margin">How you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the word <hi>Twelve.</hi>
                     </note> Twelve that were <hi>with the Lord Jesus from the Baptism of John, until the day in which our Lord was taken up,</hi> Act. 1. 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These Twelve are not nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be considered simply, as twelve Christians, or twelve Disciples; but as their Witness of the Lord Jesus (they being with him from first to last) was a Twelve-fold Witness of him in all his things; a twelve-fold seeing with their Eyes, a twelve-fold hearing with their Ears, a twelve-fold handling also with their Hands, and feeling of the Son of God: As one of them said, <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our Eyes, and our Hands have handled of the Word of Life; that which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye might have fellowship with us,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 1. 1, 2, 3. Now this being thus, it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104034:57"/>
followeth that the Doctrine of the other Apostles, as of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> was still but the Doctrine of the Twelve; their Doctrine, I say, and no other: Wherefore as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> were dissolved into the twelve Tribes, so these two, with all other the Apostles of Christ, are dissolved into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Twelve, because their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is onely the Doctrine of the twelve; for they center in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; their length and breadth, and depth and heighth being the Doctrine of the Twelve. So then the names of the Twelve being found in the Foundations of this Wall, it argueth that that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is onely true, that is the Doctrine of the twelve Eye-Witnesses of the Lord Jesus: And again, That at the day of Antichrists fall, this Doctrine shall be in its former purity, and bear the sway, and for ever hold up the Wall of safety, for the Inhabitants of <hi>New Jerusalem:</hi> And indeed this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrine, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Twelve is that upon which Eternal Safety is built and stands, is so true, that it must not be varied from, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Eternal Damnation: Here centred <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist, here cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104034:58"/>
                     <hi>Jude,</hi> here centred the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yea, here centred <hi>Paul</hi> himself, with all the Old and New Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Doctrine of the Twelve must be the Opener, Expounder and Limiter of all Doctrines; there also must all men cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ground, and stay. A man may talk of, yea, enjoy much of the Spirit of God; but yet the Twelve will have the start of him; for they both had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as he, and more then he: besides, they together with this, did feel, see, handle and receive Conviction, even by their very carnal Senses, which others did not; besides, their Names also are found in the Foundations of this saving Wall, as being there engraved by GOD himself; which putteth all out of doubt, and giveth us infallible ground that their Doctrine is onely true, and all mens false that do not keep within the bounds and limits of that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>To conclude: Here is yet two things worthy of noting:</p>
                  <p>The first is, That by the Names of the twelve Apostles being in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104034:58"/>
of this Wall, and the Names of the twelve Tribes being upon the Gates of this City, it giveth us to consider, that at the time of the building of this City, the Jews and Gentiles shall be united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> and become one Body: which very<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 1.</note> Consideration must needs be to the Jews<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 1.</note> a great incouragement to have in mind<note place="margin">Act. 13. 16, 26.</note> at their Conversion: for it plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16</note> that our New-Testament-Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 10</note> shall carry in their Mouths, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jews; by which means they shall be again reconciled, and made one with the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>The second Consideration is, That at<note place="margin">No Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher now allowed, but he that can preach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the XII.</note> the day of New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there shall be no Doctrine accepted, nor no Preachers regarded, but the Doctrine, and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Doctrine of the Twelve: for in that he saith, That <hi>in them are found the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb,</hi> he doth implicitely exclude all other, of whatever Tribe they pretend themselves: It shall not be then as now, a Popish Doctrine, a Quakers Doctrine, a Prelatical Doctrine, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Independant, and Anabaptist, thus distinguished, and thus confounding and destroying: but the Doctrine shall be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104034:59"/>
one, and that one the Doctrine where you finde the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb: <hi>If any man teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and consenteth not to wholesome Words, even the Words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Doctrine that is according to Godliness, he is proud, and knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the Doctrine of the Twelve is that which letteth Souls into this City; and that the same Doctrine is the Doctrine that keepeth up the <hi>Wall</hi> of their Salvation about them, when they are entred in within the Gates.</p>

                     </note> Wall, Gates, and Foundations, he comes to the Measuring-Line, to see how all things lie and agree with that.</p>
                  <p>Under the Law, I find that all things pertaining to the Worship of God were to be by Number, Rule and Measure, even to the very Tacks and Loops of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104034:59"/>
of the Tabernacle: Now the Rule or Line by which all things were then squared, it was the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances which was given to <hi>Moses</hi> by the Lord in the Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went to receive his Orders: and according to the Pattern there shewed him, so he committed all things, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to them that were to be imployed in the workmanship of the holy things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the rise and compleating of the Tabernacle, and all its Instruments. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. 40. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. 24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Now when this Rule was thus recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then whosoever observed not to do it, he was to fall under the Penalty that by the same Law also was prescribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Offenders and Transgressors, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>I find also that when the Temple was builded in the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> all things were then done according to the writing that <hi>David</hi> made, when the hand of God was upon him, <hi>when he made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all the work of this Pattern,</hi> 2 Chron. 3. 1, 2, 3. &amp; Chap. 4. 1 Chron. 19. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. &amp; 28. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thus again, When <hi>Josiah</hi> went about
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104034:60"/>
to bring to pass the Reformation of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Worship, after their revolting; he goeth to the Law of God, and by that, understanding what was out of order, and how to put all things into order, he so did reduce them to their former man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The same way also went <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> at the rebuilding of the Temple and City after the Captivity, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8. 3, 4. From all which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">This Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Reed is the Word of God.</note> That the Reed, the Golden Reed that here you read of, it is nothing else but the pure and unspotted Word of God; by which, both the City, Gates and Wall of this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is regulated: Which Word by the holy Prophet, <hi>is also compared to Gold, and is said to be above much fine Gold,</hi> Psal. 12. 6. and 19. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>I find in the Vision of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that the Angel that there is said to measure the City, which was a Type of our <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he appeared with <hi>a line</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 40. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>of Flax</hi> in his hand, to measure the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern withal; which very phrase doth shew us that his was but the Type, and an Old-Testament-business: but <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104034:60"/>
hath his in a New-Testament-stile, and that in the most excellent manner of Language, to signifie that his City, or the City that he hath the Vision of, is to be the end of all Types and Shadows, and the very perfection of them all: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us also, that the Line or<note place="margin">Why the measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Line of New Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in special, is called a Golden Reed.</note> Reed by which this City is builded, and squared, it is not now a Line of Flax, but a Reed of Gold, a Golden Reed; to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie not a Word of the Law and Letter that had to do with Shadows, but the New Testament, and ministration of the Spirit, which hath to do with Substance, <hi>and the heavenly things themselves,</hi> Heb. 9. 23.</p>
                  <q>A Golden Reed to measure the City, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>I told you at the first, that this City<note place="margin">The City measured</note> was the Church of God that should be in the latter dayes; but yet not the Church disorderly, and confusedly scattered here and there, without all visible order and discipline, but the Church brought into exact Form and Order, lying every way level and square with the Rule, and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Reed</hi> of the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Testament of Christ; wherefore he calleth it a City,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104034:61"/>
a City under Rule. Thus it was in the Type; for when <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was to be builded, and the City in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, it was not enough that they had Stones and Timber, but every one of them must be such Stones, and such Timber, and must also come under the Rule and Square of the Workman; and so being fitted by Hewers, Sawes, Axes and Squares, they were fitly put into the building, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 17, 18. and 7. 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 2. By this then we may see, with what a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, exact Line, Rule and Order this Church and City at this day, will be compact and builded; the Members must be all such as shall be made fit for the City of God, <hi>by the hewing words of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 6. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the Prophets;</hi> they must joyn in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Communion also according to the Golden Reed of the New Testament, and ministration of the Spirit. Indeed all the time of the reign of Antichrist, the Church, as she was a holy Temple in the Lord, so she was measured with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the truth of her Grace, and invisible condition: but as she is to be a City, so she then is to be troden down,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and to lie without all Form and Order:</hi> but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104034:61"/>
when Antichrist is dead, she shall again come into mind, be considered, reared, builded by measure, and inhabited: and observe it, as the Rule of the Carpenter is of use in the building, from the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the laying of a Stone in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even till it be in every point and part compleat; so the Golden Reed, with which the Angel is here said to measure the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be of use from the first Foundation, even to the laying of the last Stone thereof: As was also fore-shewed by the man that is said to measure the pattern of this, in <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Ezek.</hi> 40. to chapter 48.</p>
                  <q>And he measured the City.</q>
                  <p>That is, he measured the Church in her Constitution and Fellowship. Now, when God is said to measure, he is said to measure sometimes in Judgment, and sometimes in Mercy; sometimes to throw down, and sometimes to build up and establish: Sometimes, I say, he is said to measure in Judgment, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to throw down and destroy: Thus he measured the City before she went into Captivity, and the ten Tribes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104034:62"/>
before they were carried away beyond <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 17, 18.</note> because they lay cross to his Word,<note place="margin">Amos 7: 7, 8, 9.</note> and had perverted that which was right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when he is said to measure the City in this place, it is that she might be builded and set up: wherefore, as I said, the Line or Golden Reed that is now stretched forth to measure this City, it is to the end, that all things may be in right Form and Order, <hi>fitly joyned, and knit together, by that which every joynt sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, according to the effectual working of the measure of every part, making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Body, to the edifying of it self in love,</hi> Ephes. 4. 16. Col. 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Again, By measuring the City, he would have us to understand, that all her Limits and Bounds were now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that all things, even the Church and all the World, was made to see their own Compass: for as God in the dayes when Temple-Worship (only) was on foot, would not lose a Form or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of all the Forms and Ordinances of his Temple; so when City-work comes up, he will not lose an Inch of the Limits, and Bounds, and Compass of his City, she shall be full as large, and of as great a compass every way, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104034:62"/>
is determined of her: as he saith by the Prophet, <hi>All the Land,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be turned</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">This is that which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a new Earth.</note> 
                     <hi>into a Plain;</hi> that is, there shall be a smooth Face upon the whole Earth, all Snugs, and Hubs, and Hills, and Holes shall now be took away, <hi>even from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato Rimmon, South of Jerusalem: and it</hi> (the City) <hi>shall be lifted up, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her place, from Benjamins Gate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of the first Gate, unto the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananiel, unto the Kings Wine-Presses.</hi> The four places here mentioned in this verse, they do seem to be the four Corners of the City of old; at which places the City bounds were set; and in which very Circle the Prophet tells us, but with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Language, she shall be setled again, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 10.</p>
                  <q>And he measured the City, and the Gates thereof.</q>
                  <p>This was figured forth by the Vision<note place="margin">The Gates measured</note> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> for in it he saw the Angel go from Gate to Gate, and saw him take the exact and distinct measure of every one thereof; nay, not only of them in a general way, but of the <hi>Thresholds,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:104034:63"/>
the <hi>Porch,</hi> the <hi>Posts,</hi> and the <hi>Faces</hi> of their Enterances; he measured also eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little <hi>Chamber</hi> that was above upon the Gates, with all the Spaces that were between, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40 chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now by Gates, I told you, we are to understand the <hi>Son</hi> of God, as he is the Way to the Father, and to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this City: Wherefore when he saith, He measured the Gates, it is as if he had said, he measured the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, Strength &amp; goodly Countenance of Him, with the Mansions of Glory that are to be injoyed by every one that entereth in hereby; for the Porch, Posts, Face, Enterance and Chambers of the Gate in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> they signifie the Ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Strength, <hi>Shining Countenance,</hi> and resting places that every one shall find in the Lord Jesus that entereth in by him: and to measure all these, it is in substance but this, To set them forth, and out, in their full force, glory, largeness, beauty &amp; profitableness, in the view of all: for I told you at the first, the Golden Reed is the Word of God: Now the City and the Gates thereof, are said to be measured by this Golden Reed; which I say, can be nothing else, but an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>For if you search the Scriptures, you will finde that especially the great and principal Instruments of Gods Worship

in and under the Law, their Perfection was what here you read to be the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this City, even a <hi>four square.</hi> As for instance: <hi>The Brest-plate of Judgment,</hi> on which were engraved the Names of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> its exact point of Perfection was, to be a right <hi>four square.</hi> The <hi>ten Bases</hi> also, that were to be for Bearers to the Lavers in the Temple, they were to be <hi>four square:</hi> The <hi>Altar of Burnt-Offerings</hi> likewise, with the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Incense,</hi> their perfect Pattern was, that they should be <hi>four square:</hi> The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court</hi> and <hi>outward Court,</hi> with <hi>the Posts of the Temple,</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> on which they were to slay the Sacrifices, they were <hi>all four square.</hi> Yea, the City in the Type, in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was seen to be of the same frame and fashion eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, having just twelve Gates, and of each of the four sides three Gates. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 15, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. 8, 9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. <hi>&amp;</hi> 41. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40. 40, 41, 42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 48. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

                  <q>—And the length is as large as the breadth.—</q>
                  <p>This explaineth the matter yet more fully and distinctly; for as to the things that I made mention of before, though they were to be made <hi>four-square,</hi> and that their Perfection lay exactly in that form; yet these Squares did not lie in<note place="margin">Exod. 27. 1. &amp; 38. 1</note> their <hi>height and depth,</hi> but in their <hi>length</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and breadth,</hi> just as you read here of the<note place="margin">Ezek 40. 42.</note> Square of this City. As to instance: The <hi>Altars,</hi> though they were five Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long, and five Cubits broad, yet <hi>but three high;</hi> so the <hi>Bases,</hi> they were a Cubit and an half broad, and a Cubit and an half long, yet <hi>but half a Cubit high;</hi> the <hi>Tables</hi> also on which they slew the Sacrifices, they were a Cubit and a half long, and a Cubit and a half broad, yet <hi>but one Cubit high.</hi> VVhich things being thus, you see the reason of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the length is as large as the breadth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by <hi>length and breadth</hi> here, we

may yet observe another Mystery held forth unto us; for by the <hi>breadth</hi> is held forth the perfection of the Rule, or Law to which all Christians ought to yeild their hearty Obedience: <hi>His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exceeding broad:</hi> The breadth of<note place="margin">Psal. 119 96.</note> which, is signified, I say, by the breadth of those things that before you see to be<note place="margin">By breadth is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word, and by length the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness of the Saints obedience Luk. 1. 6. &amp; 2. 37.</note> the Instruments of the Worship of <hi>God:</hi> Now as by breadth, we are to understand the perfect latitude and compass of the Commandment; so by length, we are to understand the answerableness of the obedience of the Inhabitants of this City: for indeed the perfection of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Obedience lieth in an answerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Will of God; as it is said of the Father and Mother of <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist; <hi>they walked in all the Commandments of the Lord blameless;</hi> and of <hi>Anna, that she continued without ceasing in the service of God in the Temple, day and night:</hi> This is to be as long in our Obedience, as the Law is broad in commanding: the Law commands right Obedience, and the Christian giveth it; the Law commands continual Obedience, and the Christian giveth it; the Law commands univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Obedience, and the Christian giveth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104034:68"/>
it: He giveth it all these sorts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, 1. By the Person of Christ, for<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30</note> he is his Righteousness; he giveth it all these, 2. With the <hi>consent of the mind:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16</note> and 3. He giveth it all these Obediences in the love of the Spirit, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> that<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> is, an answering the breadth of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by the length of Obedience: wherefore when he saith, <hi>The length is as large as the breadth,</hi> he would have us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how perfect in Holiness these blessed Souls will be at this day: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is it that is by God expected to be in this City at this day: As the Angel with his Measuring-Line said to <hi>Zechariah, I am going to measure Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 2. 2</note> 
                     <hi>and to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof:</hi> To see whether their Doctrine be pure, and whether their Obedience be answerable.</p>
                  <q>—And he measured the City with the Reed, twelve thousand furlongs.—</q>
                  <p>These latter words do refer us to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct<note place="margin">A <hi>second measure.</hi>
                     </note> measure from that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the former measure pointing at the breadth of her Commandment, and the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104034:68"/>
length of her Obedience; but this at the Glory and Fulness of her Mansions and Portions: For after he had said, <hi>The City lieth four square,</hi> and that <hi>the length is as large as the breadth,</hi> (which is the full and compleat effect of that first measure) he comes over again with an other measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, saying, <hi>And he measured the City twelve thousand furlongs;</hi> as who should say, He measured the City, Gates, and Wall first, and sound them all exact, and according to the Golden Reed; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had so done, <hi>he measured the City with the Reed twelve thousand furlongs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He measured the City with the Reed</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A <hi>portion measured out for the City.</hi>
                     </note> That is, He measured out to the City, he measured for the City, for its Lot and Portion, twelve thousand Furlongs: Which very thing you find in the Vision of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> for after he had measured the City, the Vessels, with the Instruments of Worship; I say, when he had done this, he comes again with an <hi>afterwards,</hi> to measure the City her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Mansions, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I say, these words do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to her Portion that she is to enjoy of her God, as the former referreth to her Duty and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104034:69"/>Now that which maketh me conclude that this latter measure is a measure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the former, and that it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neither to the exactness of Rule, nor the compleatness of Obedience, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the largeness of the Portions that God will allot for thy Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, thou City of God, it is,</p>
                  <p>First, Because this is <hi>the biggest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi> For I find, by considering the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that as the Persons and Things pertaining to the Worship of God, were to go according to the Rule of this Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Reed; so also the Portions that pertained to the Persons worshiping, was to go by Rule and Measure also, (as here he saith he measured also the City, or to it, with the Reed, <hi>twelve thousand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</hi>) And hence it is that our Grace is called the <hi>measure of Grace,</hi> and that our<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> Glory is called a <hi>weight of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I say, I find that our Portions do<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 7. 2 Cor. 4. 17</note> go always under the biggest measure; the Spoons, Cups, Flaggons, Snuffers, Basons, Candlesticks and Pans, which were the Instruments of Worship, were not so large as the Chambers in the Temple, and the compass of the holy Land, which were the <note n="†" place="margin">See Josh. 15. to Chap. 19.</note> Mansions <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 14. 1, 2, 3.</note> and Portions of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:104034:69"/>Secondly, I take the <hi>twelve thousand furlongs</hi> to signifie Portions, rather than Worship or Worshippers; because, as to the nature of it, it most exactly agrees with the Portions that are measured out to this City by the Angel before <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is a measuring forth so much Land for the Portion of the Prince, so much for the Portion of the Priest, and so much<note place="margin">Ezek. 45, 46, 47.</note> for the Portion of the twelve Tribes: Yea, the very phrase, <hi>twelve thousand</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>furlongs,</hi> also implieth such a compass of Ground, by which we find the holy Land<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 18</note> hath been measured.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I take it to be thus also; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find not in all this description of this holy City, that any place doth give us that ground to speak to her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Portion, as this: and it would seem strange to me, that the description of this City given by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> should be more compleat then this that is given by our Prophet <hi>John:</hi> for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth most amply set forth her Portions, even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, for Prince, Priest, and the Tribes in particular. This therefore is to be understood of the Portions of the City, which <hi>John</hi> did see was measured out unto her, immediately after he saw
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104034:70"/>
the breadth of her Rule, and the length of her Obedience: Onely consider that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> measureth by Reeds, not count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Furlongs; but <hi>John,</hi> though he measureth by Reeds, yet counteth by Furlongs.</p>
                  <p>But now, though the holy Ghost is thus pleased to speak of the Portions of the Saints in the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as if he intended chiefly that their Portion should consist in outward Happiness, and in the enjoyment of such and such a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or compass of ground: Yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that these are but metaphorical and borrowed Expressions, spoken to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, under which is indeed included the nature of our blessed and spiritual Food and Nourishment: You know it is usual for the holy Ghost in Scripture to<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 15, 16.</note> call the Saints Sheep, Lambs, Heifers, Cows, Rams, Doves, Swallows, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>John</hi> saith here is twelve thousand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us, <hi>it lieth on this</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 47. 8, 9, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>side and on that side of the bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Water of Life:</hi> Now I think there is none so much void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as to think this Water of Life is any thing else but the precious Grace of God, in and thorow the Lord Jesus: Wherefore the ground or measure for Portions, it is nothing else but our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly Food, even spiritual Grace, and Gifts, and Comforts, that the holy Ones of this City shall most plentifully partake of, and enjoy: And so indeed the Prophet also saith, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Portions of the holy Land for this City: <hi>The increase thereof,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Ezek. 48. 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>shall be for Food unto them that serve the City; and they that serve it shall serve it out of the twelve Tribes of Israel: Out of the twelve Tribes,</hi> that is, out of the <hi>twelve thousand Furlongs,</hi> which is the the Portion of the Tribes. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Saying of the Prophet <hi>David, He maketh me to lie down in green Pastures, he leadeth me besides the still Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> and again, <hi>For the Lamb that is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them into living Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:104034:71"/>
                     <hi>for their shame, they shall have double; and for confusion, they shall rejoyce in their Portion: Therefore in their Land they shall possess the double; Everlasting Joy shall be upon them,</hi> Psal. 23. 2. Rev. 7. 17. Isa. 61. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the measure of the City, Gates, and Wall, and the effect of that; and thus you see also the measure of the Portion for the City, with what it is: Wherefore it remaineth that we see what is to be the effect of that also.</p>
                  <q>And he measured the City with the Reed twelve thousand furlongs, and the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.</q>
                  <p>Before he told us, that <hi>the length was as large as the breadth;</hi> which I then told you, did signifie the nature of her Rule, and the measure of her Obedience: but now he adds, and saith, That both <hi>in length and breadth, &amp; in height, she is equal:</hi> Wherefore in that he adds at last a squareness of height, to her squareness of length and breadth; and also in that he adds it not before he had told us of the measure of her Portions, he would
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104034:71"/>
have us to understand, that as the Rule in which this City shall walk, shall be compleat; and as her Obedience to that Rule shall be compleat; so her enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and his Grace at that day shall be proportionable also: She is <hi>square</hi> in her Rule, <hi>square</hi> in her Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and <hi>square</hi> in her Enjoyment of God, and his Goodness; <hi>the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.</hi> Indeed the Scripture saith, That in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 11</note> his Commandments there is great Reward: and again, <hi>This man shall be</hi>

                     <hi>Righteousness, those that remember him in his Ways: And the length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet in the Vision of the measures of the Portions, doth observe that there was a <hi>squareness</hi> in them, as

                  <p>Again, In that he saith, <hi>The length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal;</hi> he sheweth us how fit this City at this day will be, even for the Kingdom of Heaven and Glory: for observe, That as the Rule, Obedience, and Comforts of God, do make this City a square Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both in height, and length, and breadth; so the Holiest of all, which was a <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> Type of Heaven, was of the same fashion also; <hi>It was twenty Cubits high, and twenty Cubits long, and twenty Cubits broad; the length, and the breadth, and the height of it were equal,</hi> 1 King. 6. 20. 2 Chron. 3. 8.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104034:73"/>
in some place, and for some reason, of another manner and measure than the Wall is in general, as it compasseth round the City; which part of the Wall is called the <hi>broad Wall,</hi> the Wall upon which even half of the People <hi>might walk compleat at once,</hi> Neh. 3. 8. &amp; 12. 38.</p>
                  <p>But to trace out the business in the Type, and so to come to its answer in the Anti-Type: I find that a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there was a place called <hi>Tophet,</hi> which place was counted<note place="margin">2 Kin. 23. 10.</note> prophane, unholy, or defiled; I find also that this unclean unholy place, was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 33.</note> of <hi>Hell it self:</hi> Now mark, I find by the Scripture, that against this <hi>Tophet,</hi> this unholy and prophane place, was the <hi>broad Wall</hi> of the City for the defence of<note place="margin">A broad Wall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to keep the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> the Sanctuary, erected, and reared up: <hi>He measured,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>by the four sides, and it had a Wall rouud about, five hundred Reeds long, and five hundred Reeds broad, TO MAKE A SEPARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION BETVVEEN THE SANCTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARY AND THE PROPHANE PLACE,</hi> Ezek. 42. 20. Which VVall could not be that Wall which compassed the City, because it was but five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Reeds long: for take the measure
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104034:73"/>
of this Wall in its largest measure, and it is (if you count a Reed for that which we count a Pole) but twelve Furlongs, which compass will scarce go round ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Market-Towns; especially, if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this, you consider the breadth of the Wall, whose breadth is as large as its length; wherefore now there is not room enough for a City so big as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to stand in the midst thereof: I speak this, to shew you that the Wall in this place is not the Wall that goeth round about the City, but the Wall that is placed just between the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and <hi>Tophet,</hi> or Hell it self: Now though <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do differ touching their count about the thickness of this Wall, it is not so much to signifie the Walls are not one and the same, as to shew us that the one, to wit, <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Wall, was to incompass a worldly Sanctuary, but <hi>John</hi>'s to incompass a spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; wherefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s must be of so many Reeds long to go round about the material <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> as a Type; but <hi>John</hi> comes more to the spirit of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sheweth us what the Sanctuary, Wall, and the like, should mean: for by Sanctuary we are to understand (even in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104034:74"/>
the Old Testament) a place of Safety and<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 16.</note> Security, which was a Type of Christ:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18</note> Now in that <hi>Tophet</hi> did stand against the Sanctuary in the letter, it signifies that Hell it self is bent against all those that take shelter in Christ; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for in the very face of <hi>Tophet,</hi> even between it and our place of sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, is fixed an invincible and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mighty Wall, to keep in safety those that have fled to Christ for shelter.

                  <p>And now to bring down the matter to our <hi>New Jerusalem</hi>-state: for though it be true in all Ages, that there is between those that have taken sanctuary in Christ, and the bottomless pit, an invincible and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104034:74"/>
mighty Wall of Grace and heavenly Power, and of the Merits of Christ, to save <hi>to the utmost</hi> all and every one that<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25 26.</note> are thus fled to him for safety; yet there is some thing in it more then this, for those that come into the days and state of the <hi>New Jerusalem:</hi> For, I say, this Wall being it that makes a separation between the Sanctuary and the prophane place in general, and yet being spoken of as a thing extraordinary, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the state of this new City <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> it implieth that at this day the Saints<note place="margin">The profit of the broad Wall.</note> shall have that shelter by this Wall from all the force of Hell, and the damned Spirits that now from <hi>Tophet</hi> afflict them, that they never had before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you find at the begining of the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years,</hi> which (as I conceive) is the time of the building of this City, <hi>a mighty Angel is said to come down from</hi>

from being any more assailed with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked and erronious Doctrine, or fierce and fiery darts from the Prince of Darkness, which now many of them are so much anoyed and afflicted with: now the Church will be free from those hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish suggestions to blaspheme, to despair, and the like, that her Members do yet most dreadfully and sadly meet with: for observe, this old Tempter is said to be tied up, or to be cast into the bottomless Pit, first, as he is a <hi>Dragon,</hi> under which name he goeth in this Book, in his perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.

                     <hi>former Sorrows shall be past and forgot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou still objectest, But I have yet<note place="margin">Object.</note> an evil heart, and therefore if I be not rid of that at that day (should I live till then) why though there should be no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> to afflict me, I shall feel and meet with sorrow and trouble enough.</p>
                  <p>I answer thee: First, I dare not say<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that at this day thou shalt be in every sence without thy evil heart, in the midst of all this glory, tempted Soul: Yet I say thus much to thee;</p>
                  <p>First, Where there is no Devil to<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thus bound &amp; tied up.</note> tempt, though the Saints will yet be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and come short of a glorified state; yet they by his absence will be delivered from many dreadful vexing and burning hellish Darts, that will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104034:76"/>
confound and afflict the Soul like Arrows, whose heads are poisoned: Christians have a great deal of ease, when God doth (even at this day) with-hold the Devil for a season, (though yet they have their own lusts) over they have when the Devil and their own Lusts are suffered to meet and work together: yea, the Lord Jesus himself, who had no sin, yet in the Temptation was fearfully handled and afflicted with the Devil; though all the while, I say, he kept him at staves end, and did not suffer him in the least to anoy his Person; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis said that when he was in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 1. 12, 13.</note> in the conflict, <hi>the Angels came to minister to him:</hi> at the time of his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14, 15.</note> also, in which Agony doubtless Satan<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 44.</note> had a very great hand to afflict him, you see his complaint, how that he was sore<note place="margin">Mark 14. 33, 34.</note> amazed, and exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, being so laden with heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sorrow, that he was scarce able to stand or wag under the burden of it. Satan even from himself, besides the workings of our own Lusts, doth do us wonderful injury, and hits our Souls with many a fiery Dart, that we think comes either from our selves, or from Heaven,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104034:76"/>
and God himself; but now by this Wall, this <hi>broad Wall,</hi> this sorrow will be cut off.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Again, when Satan is thus tied up, we shall, together with this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall now also be greatly weakened</note> receive such a plentiful pouring forth of the Holy Ghost, that though there will remain in us still the remainders of our Corruptions; yet by the plentiful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellings of the holy Ghost, and the Joy and Peace and heavenly sweetness thereof, these things shall lie like lean, withered, blasted things: the reason of that power and that strength that our Lusts have to this day in our hearts, it is because we are so lean and thin and weak in the things of God: strong Grace makes Corruptions weak, and strikes them thorow, laying them at the point of death, always gasping for life: thus it was with <hi>Moses,</hi> he had such Grace in his Soul, and such Communion with God, that though he had yet a Body of Sin within him, it was a rare thing for him to see his wretchedness; that is, to see it pirt, lively, and powerful in him: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God saith, <hi>That upon the Land of his</hi>

                  <p>IN these words you have a discovery of<note place="margin">The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Wall.</note> the Glory both of the Wall and City it self; and that, as you see, under the notion of two choice Metaphors: the <hi>Wall is Jasper,</hi> the chief of Stones; and the <hi>City is Gold,</hi> the chief of Metals:

both the Materials of the Wall, the manner of their placing, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments that God will use for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up thereof: Now to speak properly, this Wall being the Lord Jesus Christ <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10 <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4.</note> Himself in his precious Merits, Benefits and Offices, the Builder hereof must needs be God Himself; for he it is that hath made this Christ for us a Safeguard and Defence, by making of him <hi>our Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> by which he doth incompass us round on every side, and that at every moment, to deliver us from the Power and Destruction both of Sin, Death, the Devil, and Hell.</p>
                  <p>But again, The building here spoken of, is a building of this Wall after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Antichrist, and so long after Christ was sent, and made these things in his own Person, to his beloved and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">The buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Wall.</note> Church: Wherefore the building of this Wall that is here spoken of, it must be understood of the recovering again the purity of those Doctrines in which the Lord Jesus with all his Benefits is found and made ours, for our everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Safety: For we find that the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who was a Type of our

                  <p>For the Workmen, I am sure God is the principal, as I said before; but yet he will do it by instruments, thorow the guidance of his Spirit.

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:104034:87"/>Lastly, When he saith this <hi>City</hi> is <hi>Gold,</hi> he also thereby insinuates how invincible and unconquerable a Spirit the People of God are possessed with: Gold is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal so invincible and unconquerable, that no fire can consume it; it may burn it indeed, and melt it; the Dross indeed doth consume, and give way to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the fire, but the Gold remains, and holds its ground; yea, it gets ground even of the Furnace and Fire it self; for the more it is burned and melted, the more it recovers its colour, and the more it shakes off its Dross and Dishonour: Just thus it is with the People of God, and hath been so even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>The more they oppressed them, the more they grew,</hi> Exod. 1. 12. the truth of which will be proved with a witness when God comes to set up this City <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> his Church hath been now for many hundred years in the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s Furnace; all which time she hath most gloriously endured and withstood the heat; and at last, when the fire hath done its worst against her, <hi>Behold, there comes out a City of Gold:</hi> A Type of which, was the state of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who though they were cast into
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104034:88"/>
the Fire, bound, and in disgrace; yet came out in the Liberty and Grace of the Son of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 23, 24, 25, 26. Wherefore let her be bold to say, even before she comes out of the Fire, <hi>When I am tried, I shall come forth as Gold,</hi> Job 23. 10.</p>
                  <q>And the City was [pure] Gold.</q>
                  <p>These words, <hi>PURE Gold,</hi> clear up what I said already: <hi>Pure Gold,</hi> or <hi>Gold</hi> upon which the fire hath done its work. The Church in the fire of Persecution is<note place="margin">Esth. 2. 12</note> like <hi>Esther</hi> in the perfuming Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but making fit for the presence of the King; which fire, when it hath done its work, then she comes into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in cloathing all of Gold: <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her cloathing is of wrought Gold:</hi> and again, <hi>At thy right hand did stand the Queen in Gold of Ophir,</hi> Psal. 45. 9, 13. Wherefore he means by <hi>pure Gold,</hi> Gold out of the Fire, Gold on which the fire of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temptation hath done its full and compleat work.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:104034:88"/>And the City was pure Gold, like unto clear Glass.</q>
                  <p>By <hi>Glass,</hi> in this place, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as both <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> do testifie, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. By <hi>clear glass</hi> then, we are to understand the Word in its own nature and purity, without the corruptions and traditions of men. Wherefore when he saith, this Golden City <hi>was like unto clear Glass:</hi> it is as if he had said, she is <hi>even</hi> with the Word and Law of her Goldsmith, in all her matters. The Word is a Golden Reed, this City a Golden City; and that, a Golden City, taken out of the furnace of affliction, and therefore like to the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Reed. <hi>And the City was pure Gold, like unto clear Glass.</hi>

I know that the Doctrine of the twelve hath been alwayes accompanied with goodly Gifts and Grace, from the first Churches quite down, that is, according to the measure of light they appeared in,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104034:89"/>
and according to the dispensations of God in the times of Antichrist. But yet the glory that this Doctrine had in these latter dayes, I mean since the Apostacy, it was nothing in comparison of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and splendor that will be in them in the day when this City is builded and compleat; Wherefore you find, that though all-along in Antichrist's reign, the Gospel of Grace hath shone, and given light to the Saints and People of God in all their travels and afflictions; yet the shining of it at that day was much<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the smoak of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</note> opposed and eclipsed by the smoak of the bottomless-pit: as he saith, <hi>There arose a smoak out of the pit, as the smoak of a great furnace, and the Sun and the Air was darkened by reason of the smoak of the pit, Rev.</hi> 9. 2.

This is that God spake of by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> saying, <hi>I will cause the Sun to go down at noon, and will darken the Earth in the clear day; and I will turn your feasts into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all your songs into lamentation;</hi>

                     <note n="†" place="margin">If you compare the stones you will find them (some of them) to differ in name, but know it is usual for one stone to go under 2 names; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Greek doth give many things other names than doth the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text.</note> same with those twelve Stones that long before were set in the Brestplate of Judgment, in which were engraven the Names of the twelve Tribes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> the names of which Tribes did comprehend <hi>the whole body of the house of their fathers,</hi> Exod. 28. 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 29. <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 14. Now then, seeing these Twelve are the same with those on the Breastplate of Judgement; and seeing also, that those on the Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate did comprehend the whole of the twelve Tribes: I conclude that for these Foundations to be garnished with all manner of precious Stones, it is as much as to say, they shall be garnished with abundance of Converts; Multitudes, and that of all sorts both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Moors, Tartars, Turks,</hi> and those in the utmost parts of the World, shall now be entangled with the Light and Truth, with the Glory and Goodness of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Converts the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> of the Twelve.

                     <hi>of the Wall were garnished with all manner of precious stones;</hi> That is, the Doctrine of the Twelve was garnished with all manner of precious souls; that is, converted by it, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a glory and a garnishing to it.</p>
                  <p>2dly. I take it to be the conversion of the Precious Ones of God; because, that, thus to understand it, is most like the phrase of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>What is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of rejoycing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

Mark, <hi>John</hi> saith, They are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104034:92"/>
                     <hi>garnished, Paul</hi> saith, <hi>they are crowned. John</hi> saith, they are garnished w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>precious stones</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they are crowned <hi>with the conversion of sinners.</hi> Thus therfore as God will lay these Stones with fair colours,<note place="margin">Isa. 54. 11.</note> so also he <hi>will lay these Foundations with Saphirs:</hi> that is, as he will beautifie the Doctrine of the Twelve with its former Glory, Sweetness and Authority: so he will crown and garnish it with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of many sinners. The Elect are the <hi>Jewels of God,</hi> and this is the day of<note place="margin">Malac. 3. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> his binding them up, even then when the Antichrist falls, and the Gospel breaks out in its primitive glory.</p>
                  <q>And the Foundations of the Wall were gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all manner of precious stones.</q>
                  <p>In these words, there is yet two things considerable:</p>
                  <p>First, That all who go to the adorning of these Foundations, they must <hi>be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones,</hi> not a common stone shall here be owned: And indeed what should Pebbles do among the Pearls and the<note place="margin">Job 28. 3</note> Diamonds of <hi>New-Jerusalem;</hi> or the stones of blackness and emptiness, among the Saints of Light! I tel you, that those which God doth reckon the adorning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104034:92"/>
they are all, and every one, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones;</hi> they must be all <hi>lively, glist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As he saith the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are garnished with <hi>precious stones</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so he saith it is with <hi>ALL MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER of Precious Stones:</hi> by which he would have us understand that all Saints have not the same degree either of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace, or gifts and vertue in them; there are some that excel, and differ from the rest, even as <hi>one Star differeth from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>another in glory.</hi> Some Saints, as they have both more grace, and also gifts than<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 29.</note> others; so too they are more laborious and painful in the work of God than their<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 10. 41.</note> fellows, and therefore he saith, <hi>ALL MANNER of Precious Stones.</hi>

yet say, That the <hi>Jasper</hi> here in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Foundations, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Christ, as well as in the other two places in this Discourse; I say it is yet to be understood of representing the Lord Jesus, though it also doth bear the name of one of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb: And in this very thing there is an infolding Mystery wrapped up, and inclosed.</p>
                  <p>For first, In that the Name of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note place="margin">The first account.</note> is writ in this Stone, and yet that this <hi>Jasper</hi> should represent Christ, it sheweth unto us the agreement that is between the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and Christ himself, to wit, That they are one and the very same; and hence it is that the Apostle saith, <hi>We preach Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, In that it is said the Names<note place="margin">The 2d. account.</note>

                  <p>Fourthly, In that he saith the Names<note place="margin">The 4th account.</note> of the Twelve are in the Foundations, and yet that Christ should be one of the twelve himself; It sheweth to us the Union that is between Christ and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People: Mark, In the twelve Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are placed all, even all manner of precious Stones: again, In the Twelve is placed the <hi>Jasper,</hi> Christ; by which we may see the nearness that is between Christ and his whole Body: <hi>I in them, and thou in me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that they may be made perfect in one,</hi> John 17. 23. 1 Cor. 12. 12. Christ and his Saints make but one Temple, one Man; being but one Flesh, one Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that this <hi>Jasper</hi> is said to<note place="margin">The fifth account.</note> be one of the Foundations, and that too the first and undermost; He sheweth farther, that Christ is the Foundation of them before God, that are the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him before men: The Twelve do bear up Christ before the World, as the twelve brazen Oxen did hold up the<note place="margin">1 Kin. 7. 25.</note> Molten Sea in the Temple; and Christ
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104034:95"/>
doth bear up the Twelve before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the high Priests did carry the twelve Stones on their Brest-plate of Judgment, when they went to make an Atonement for the Sins of the People<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 29.</note> into the Holiest.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It sheweth us further, That<note place="margin">The sixth account.</note> though the Apostles shall be adorned with the Conversion of those that they shall win to the Lord Christ; yet they will never be able to stand under that Glory and Honour, unless they are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and upheld by Christ, as their Foundation. Sirs, As Christ is the Strength of his People in their Work for him in this World, so he must be their Strength by which they must stand under the Reward they shall have for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when this World is ended: And hence it is, that the Prophet saith, <hi>They shall hang upon him all the Glory of his Fathers House, the Off-spring and the Issue; all Vessels of small quantity, from the Vessels of Cups, even to the Vessels of Flagons;</hi> and again, <hi>He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the Glory,</hi> Isa. 22. 24. Zech. 6. 13. He shall bear the Glory of our Salvation from Sin, Preservation in the midst of all Temptations, and of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104034:95"/>
our going to Glory; also he shall bear the Glory of our labour in the Gospel, of our Gifts and Abilities, of making our Labour and Work effectual to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Sinners, <hi>that in all things he might have the preheminence,</hi> Col. 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In that the Foundations<note place="margin">The 7th account.</note> are twelve, and Christ the undermost of them; It signifieth that all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Twelve, as they shall be for the garnishing of the Twelve, so also both the Twelve, with all that they are garnished with, shall be for garnishing of Christ; we shall stick like Pearls in the Crowns of the twelve Apostles, and they again with all their Glory shall stick in the Crown of Christ. And hence it is that you finde the four and twenty Elders, which four and twenty do (as I conceive) hold forth the Twelve both in the first and second <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> I say, hence it is that you finde them take their Crowns from off their Heads, and cast them down before the Throne of God,<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 9, 10, 11.</note> and of the Lamb, crying, <hi>Blessing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto Him</hi>

                     <hi>that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, One thing more of this <hi>goodly</hi>

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:104034:96"/>
                     <hi>Jasper,</hi> and then to the rest; which thing is this, That Jasper that here you find to be the first in the twelve Foundations, even that Jasper you find to be last of all among the Stones in the <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 28. 20.</note> Brest-Plate of Judgment: from whence you may note, 1. That Christ as he is to be the <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 12. 12.</note> Author or first of our Faith, so also he is to be the Finisher or last of our Faith. 2. That as he is to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10. Isa. 52. 12 &amp; 58. 8. Exod. 14. 19.</note> Captain and Leader of his People, so he is to be the Rere-ward and Bringer-up of his People, <hi>he is to go before them to lead them the way; and to come behind them to bring them all up.</hi> 3. Again, for asmuch as he is said to be last before he is first; that is, last in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and after that, first in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> it may be to shew us, that Christ was first to be least, lowest and last, and then to be Greatest, Highest, and First. He first humbled himself to the death, even to the shamefull death of the Cross; and then was by God his Father exalted and placed above every name: As he also<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> himself doth witness, saying, <hi>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to have entered into his Glory?</hi> Luke 24, 26.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:104034:96"/>The first Foundation was a Jasper, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Saphir, the third a Chalcedony, the fourth an Emerald, the fifth Sardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyx, the sixth Sardius, the seventh Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solite, the eighth Beryl, the ninth To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Touching the Jasper, you see what I<note place="margin">Touching the rest of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> have said. Now all I have to say to the rest of them, it is in general these three things.</p>
                  <p>First, In that the Foundations are all and every one of them <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> it signifieth that all the Doctrines of the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> will be only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrine of the twelve Apostles; not common stuff, not raked out of the dunghils and muck-heaps of this world, and from among the toyes of Antichrist, but spiritual, heavenly and glorious. He that hath his Word shall then speak it faithfully, <hi>For what is the chaff to the Wheat, saith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 23. 32.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in that they are called after the names of <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> it signifieth also, that at that day none shall be used or put into the Ministry but those that have received spiritual and heavenly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104034:97"/>
Gifts from above. 'Tis not every bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fellow, not those that look for their abilities from the rudiments of the world, that then shall be of any value or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: He must be a costly Stone, a stone about which the Lord Jesus hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cost of his heavenly Abilities, even he <hi>whom the Lord Jesus shall appear unto for that very purpose, to make him a Minister:</hi> He shall be a Minister, and none else at that day. The other shall be ashamed every one of his vision; yea, and shall in those dayes be so contemptible, that their Father and their Mother shall reprove them, and count them liars;<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 3, 4, 5.</note> yea, and shall be ready to run them through, while they are prophesying in their rough garments to deceive.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that these precious Stones are not all of one and the same nature, but every one of them several, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse one from another: It argueth that the Gifts of the Apostles, and so of the Ministers of the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> shall be<note n="†" place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture and operations of these stones, do hold forth the differences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations and operations that was and will ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the true and holy Ministers of the Lord Jesus.</note> differing one from another in Glory and operation; yet mark, as in these
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104034:97"/>
Stones, so in every one of them shall be perfect Glory, according to the nature of God's working by his Spirit; as the nature of the <hi>Jasper</hi> is perfect in his kind, and the nature of the <hi>Saphir</hi> is perfect in his. These Stones, some of them are of greater light and cleerness than others; and so some of the Apostles <hi>are cheifest.</hi> Some of these Stones, again, they are of a more fiery &amp; burning colour than others, they being bright also, but of a more mild brightness. Therefore some of the Ministry are called the <hi>Sons of Thunder,</hi> when others are stiled by the name of the <hi>Sons of Consolation.</hi> The gifts are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being diverse, their administrations are differing, and the operations of them also are differing, <hi>though all these things are from that one and the self same spirit, working in every one severally as he pleases,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 5. Rom. 12. 6. Mark 3. 17. Act. 4. 36. 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. All these things will spangle in the New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and carry their full breadth and sway as in the dayes of old.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this, In that he here saith, That the Foundations of the Wall are these twelve Stones; he doth it to shew that now also the former ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104034:98"/>
that was in the Apostles days will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the same, and in full force again: For their gifts of Knowledge, Judgment and Authority, they are such as have to this day lain buried, as it were, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves; but now they shall shew themselves again, even these Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-stones, <hi>Stones that are great Stones, Stones of ten Cubits, and Stones of eight Cubits,</hi> 1 Kings 7. 10. Thus much of the glory of the Foundations.</p>

                  <p>Having thus shewed us the glory of this City, Wall, and Foundations, he now comes to shew us the glory of the Gates, and of the Street of the City.</p>
                  <q>And the twelve Gates are twelve Pearls.—</q>
                  <p>The Gates, I told you before, they<note place="margin">The glory of the Gates.</note> signify Christ, both as he is the way to communion with the God of this City, and with the Inhabitants thereof, that so
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104034:98"/>
they may have a share in the Priviledges of the same. I told you also then, that though he tels us exactly of the measure both of City and Wall, yet he tells us nothing of the measure of these twelve Gates, and goings in thereat; and the reason is, because, Christ as he is the way to Grace, He is beyond all measure, both <hi>as to fulness and freeness,</hi> Ephes. 3. 8. And now again he puts us to the same plunge with the unsearchable riches of the Lord Christ; for who can count the worth of a Pearl as big as the Gates of a City? as indeed, when Christ himself doth speak of the Parable of the Pearl in the Field, he only telleth us that there is such a one, but never valueth the worth thereof, only he saith, <hi>a Pearl of great price,</hi> and so leaveth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 35, 36. Now when he saith that the Gates are Pearls, he thereby insinuates several things. As</p>
                  <p>First, To shew us how rich a Treasure<note place="margin">Christ a rich Christ to all that enter here</note> Christ Jesus our Lord is, and will be to all those that by him shall enter in through the Gates into this City; <hi>Riches and Honour are with me,</hi> saith he, <hi>even durable Riches and Righteousness.

                  <p>Christ is rich indeed, both in his Blood, Resurrection, Intercession, and all his Offices, together with his Relations, and all his Benefits; all which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth upon every one that receiveth him, and maketh them unspeakably wealthy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Pearl, as it is rich,<note place="margin">Christ is beautifull to al that here do enter.</note> and so worth much, so again it is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and amiable, even to take the eyes of all beholders; it hath, I say, a very sweet and sparkling Light and Glory in it, enough to take the eye, and affect the heart of all those that look upon it: And thus is Christ to all that come to him, and by him to the Father, &amp;c. <hi>My Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mother of Harlots</hi> had some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Beauty and Glory of this Stone, and knew that it had a very taking
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104034:99"/>
and drawing Glory in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she gets it for some time to adorn her self withal, <hi>She was decked with Gold</hi>

But now when he saith, <hi>the Gates are Pearl,</hi> it is as if he had said, This Woman is stript of her beauty and delicate orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 18. 12, 22, 23</note> Pearl is taken from her, and is set in his right place, even to be for the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Wherefore it is to be expected, that many should be taken with the way of entrance into this beloved City, in the day that she shall be set up, and appear in her heavenly<note place="margin">Pro. 8. 35 &amp; 3. 35. 1 Cor. 2. 8 Joh. 17. 24.</note> beauty. The glory of that City must needs be great, whose Wall is Jasper, and Gates are Pearl.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:104034:100"/>And the twelve Gates are twelve Pearls.</q>
                  <p>Not Pearls and other Precious stones<note place="margin">Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can let in souls to the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viledges of his Church.</note> commixed, but Pearl, only: To signifie that Christ only can let in souls into this City, that they may partake of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and priviledges thereof.

                  <p>Secondly, As he saith, The several Gates are each of them Pearls: So he saith, that every several Gate was <hi>of One Pearl;</hi> of one entire Pear. By which he would have us understand also, that as<note place="margin">As none can enter in but by <hi>Christ,</hi> so none can enter-in but by WHOLE <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                     </note> none can enter in but by Christ, so none can enter in but by whole Christ. Christ must be helpful to thee every way, or he will be helpful to thee no way; thou must enter in by every whit of Christ, or thou shalt enter in by never a whit of him. Wherefore look not to have him thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, if thou take him not for King and Prophet; nay thou shalt not have him in <hi>any</hi> one, if thou dost not take him in

                  <q>And the Street of the City was pure Gold, as it were transparent Glass.</q>
                  <p>In these words there are four things to be enquired into.</p>
                  <p>First, What this Street is?<note place="margin">Of the Glory of the street</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Why he saith not [<hi>Streets</hi>] but [<hi>Street</hi>] as of one?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Why this Street is called by the term of <hi>pure Gold?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, And why it should look like <hi>transparent Glass?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the First, A Street ordinarily is the place of common concourse, and the place of continual open salutation, and taking acquaintance one of another; and as touching this <hi>Street,</hi> we are also to understand it of the open and common place, or way of Gods Worship in which Saints salute each other, and acquaint
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104034:101"/>
themselves together; also here the World are converted, Saints built up and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp;c. <hi>Wisdom cryeth without, she utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

Wherefore it is usual in the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to call the transformatian of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Psal. 86. 11. &amp; 143. 8.</note> from Satan to God, <hi>a holy way,</hi> and also to admonish him that is so transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Ezra 11. 20.</note>

of life; but he that hath entered in by<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 1, 2. 2 Joh. 4. Rom. 6. 4.</note> them, he cannot but walk in newness of life. The next thing then that a man passeth into, when he is entered in to the <hi>New Jerusalem, is to walk in the STREET thereof,</hi> the way of Holiness, even the way in which men learn to fear God, and to believe in, and love the Lord Jesus, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now this Street or way of<note place="margin">Why this street is called not many, but one.</note> Holiness, it is on purpose called, not <hi>many,</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> to shew us the perfection of Light, Grace, Faith and spiritual Comfort that the Inhabitants of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 25.</note> shall then enjoy. <hi>Daniel</hi> also calleth it <hi>ONE Street,</hi> to signifie the same thing: Wherefore from hence I gather that then all Saints shall walk (as before I have made appear) even in <hi>one Street,</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Way, and in <hi>one</hi> Light. It is Antichrist that hath brought in all those Crossings, By-Laws, and odd Nooks that to this day many an honest heart doth greatly lose it self in; but at this day they shall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, that is, made all to savour <hi>one</hi> thing, and to walk <hi>one</hi> way, not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and devouring each other as now. And indeed, there is all reason it should be thus, for the Street it self is but <hi>one:</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:104034:102"/>
There is <hi>but ONE God, ONE Lord Jesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ONE Spirit, ONE Faith, ONE Baptism,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24 &amp; 32. 33.</note> even as we are also called in <hi>ONE hope of our Calling:</hi> Now therfore when Saints<note place="margin">Philip. 1. 27.</note> have the rubbish of Antichristian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 6.</note> and trumpery removed; then they shall have, as they also had of old, but <hi>one</hi> Heart, <hi>one</hi> Soul, <hi>one</hi> Judgment, <hi>one</hi> Mind, and shall with <hi>one</hi> heart and mouth glorifie God. The which also shall be prayed for of all the Saints, even of all that have received the pure language, before these things come to pass. <hi>They shall call upon the Name of the Lord with ONE Lip, to serve him with ONE Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> Zeph. 3. 9. Oh! the heavenly, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual harmony that will be in the City of God in those days, <note n="†" place="margin">2 Chro. 5. 13. 1 King. 6. 30. Cant. 3. 10. <hi>Why the Street is called Gold.</hi>
                     </note> when the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters and Singers shall be as <hi>One,</hi> to make <hi>One</hi> Sound, then the House shall be filled with a Cloud.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When he saith, that the Street of the City was <hi>pure Gold;</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to the Floor in <hi>Solomoms</hi> Temple, which was <hi>overlaid with Gold;</hi> he alludes to <hi>Solomons</hi> Chariot also, whose bottom was <hi>paved with Love,</hi> and <hi>overlaid with Gold.</hi> By the Floor of the Temple we are to understand the way of Holiness;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104034:103"/>
and by the Chariot of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Glory of that way. Again, in that he saith this <hi>Street is Gold,</hi> he would have us to understand the worth and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that is laid up in the ways of God, and of a truly gracious heart. First, for the worth and treasure that is laid up in the ways of God, They <hi>beget Light,</hi> they<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 130. &amp; 119. 9. Prov. 2. Isa. 64. 5.</note> change the heart, they lead from Death, the Devil and Hell, to Life, God and the Kingdom of Heaven; in them God walks, and those that walk there also are sure to meet with him. O this way, <hi>It is the way which no Fowl knoweth, and which the Vultures eye hath not seen; it cannot be gotten for Gold, neither shall Silver be weighed for it; the Gold and the Crystal cannot equal it, and the exchange of it shall not be for Jewels of fine Gold. No mention shall be made of Coral, or of Pearls, for the price of Wisdom is above Rubies,</hi> Job. 28. 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 28. <hi>All the ways of God they are pleasantness, and all his</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>paths are Peace,</hi> and ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before our necessary food.</p>
                  <p>Again, As the Ways of God are thus rich, and so far above the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> of the world; so also is that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and gracious heart, without which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104034:103"/>
no man can walk in this <hi>Golden Street.</hi> It is not every Clown with his clumping dirty shoes that is admitted into Kings Privy-Chambers, and private Palaces: Neither doth, or will God at the day of New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> suffer any to trace about this <hi>Golden Street,</hi> but such as have <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den feet,</hi> and that beautified with <hi>goodly shoes.</hi> For, as for this Street, all that<note place="margin">Cant. 7. 1</note> walk in it, they must be [<hi>golden men</hi>]<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> with [<hi>golden hearts</hi>] and with Graces <hi>that are much more precious than Gold that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 18</note> 
                     <hi>perisheth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further; In that he saith, this Street is <hi>Gold, pure Gold;</hi> he giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand also, what great delight and pleasure the Lord's People will take in his Ways and Ordinances in that day: There will not then be that backwardness to do good, and to receive God, as there is in these more dry &amp; empty days of the Gospel. As Gold is pleasing to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man and worldling, so shall the Ways of God be to the Saints and Godly at that day. Now we have strong Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and weak Grace, but then we shall have strong Grace and weak, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Corruptions. You that are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, you know what an high and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104034:104"/>
lifting up of heart one small gale of the good Spirit of God will make in your souls, how it will make your lusts to languish, and your souls to love, and take pleasure in the Lord that saves you. You know, I say, what a flame of love, and bowels, and compassion, and self-denial, and endeared affection to God and all Saints, it will beget in the soul. O! <hi>it is good to be here,</hi> saith the gracious heart: Well, and so thou shalt be alwayes, if thou live to see <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> setled in her own place. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <q>And the Street of the City was pure Gold, as it were transparant Glass.</q>
                  <p>Mark, a Street of Gold like Glass, a Street of Gold, <hi>as it were transparant Glass.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What is meant by Glass.</note> By Glass here, as also in the eighteenth verse, we are to understand the word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. Wherefore when he saith, <hi>the Street, the Golden Street was like unto Glass;</hi> he means, that the walking and carriage of the Saints at this day shall be like unto, or according to the Word, the Life of the Saints answering the Life of the Word, and Rule of the Lord Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:104034:104"/>Again, in that he doth add to <hi>Glass,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first Reason why tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparant Glass.</note> the word <hi>Transparent,</hi> he would have us to understand thereby these two things.</p>
                  <p>First, That the walking and ways of Holiness of the Saints shall be more in the Power and Spirit of the Word than all along in the reign of Antichrist they have been. For transparent Glass, it is the most cleer and excellent Glass, and goeth as far beyond other sorts of Glass, as he that walks in the Spirit and Power of the Commandment, goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him that only walks in the Letter and outward Word thereof. Alas, the Churches of Christ at their first assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, will be like the coming together of <hi>Ezekiels bones,</hi> cloathed much with flesh and sinews, but greatly void of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 7, 8. Wherefore the Spirit, Power, Holiness and Majesty that now will appear in the Church, it will greatly transcend and go beyond the Spirit, Power and Holiness that hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her in former days: <hi>Then shall the Sun be ashamed, and the Moon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, when the Lord shall reign in Mount Zion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then shall the Sun be ashamed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 24. 23.</note> that is, then shall that little light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Word that hath been

in the Church in the days when a third part of the glory of the Gospel was hid by the smoak of the Pit, be as it were<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 12. &amp; 9. 2.</note> laid aside, and be useless; every Saint shall be under the light of a Sun that shines <hi>seven-fold brighter,</hi> even <hi>as the light of seven days.</hi> We see it is so in some measure at this day; What Light, and with what clearness do the Saints in this day see the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, beyond what the holy and goodly Martyrs and Saints did in the days that were before us, <hi>Hus, Bilny, Ridly, Hooper, Cranmer,</hi> with their Brethren, if they were now in the world, would cry out &amp; say, <hi>Our light and knowledge of the Word of the Testament of Christ, was much inferior to the Light that at this day is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth, and that will yet daily, in despite of Men and Devils, display its Rayes and Beams amongst the sons of men!</hi> When the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were to depart the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord made known himself to them, otherwise than ever he made known himself <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 6. 3.</note> either to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> their fathers. <hi>The Book also,</hi> at the recovering the Church from under<note place="margin">Rev. 5th and 6th <hi>chapters.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, It must needs be that the<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Glass</note> Church return to her old and primitive love: for what is the cause of the want of love to Christ, and one another now, but our want of light in the Things, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and Priviledges of the glorious Gospel of the Son of God? Wherefore this being come, then Love will reign, and have her perfect work among the Godly.

                  <p>Alas! Though now, through Grace, the Saints of God have attained to more Light and Knowledge in the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, than heretofore they had; yet their Light is far inferior to that which will be, when this City is builded: Our spiritual Union and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship in the very Bowels of the Grace and Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is yet greatly defective.

                     <hi>that which is in part be done away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the [<hi>Temple</hi>] in this place<note place="margin">What this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Temple signifies.</note> excluded, can signifie nothing else but the outward orderly way of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which the Saints ought with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in Faith, to be found in till their Lord comes: Consider,</p>
                  <p>First, That our New Testament doth use the word <hi>Temple,</hi> three general ways:</p>
                  <p>1. For the outward Order and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 1 2, 3.</note> or Discipline of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. For the Body of Christ, which is his Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, For the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Lamb, which here are said to <hi>be the Temple of this City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then, when he saith, He <hi>saw NO Temple therein,</hi> he cannot exclude the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, for they are here said to be <hi>the Temple of it:</hi> Neither can he shut out the Church, which is the Body of Christ, for that is the City it self; yea, and the Church shall be Gods Temple, and God and Christ the Temple of the Church for ever and ever: He must therefore by this word [<hi>no Temple</hi>] exclude onely the outward Way of Gospel-Worship, in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104034:108"/>
which the Saints in the times of the New Testament, both meet and edifie each other; and also meet their God, and are blessed and refreshed by him.</p>
                  <p>Again, That this outward Gospel-Worship should be laid aside while the Church is in this World, before her Lord doth come to be enjoyed by her, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Personal Presence; it looks too like <hi>Ranting Opinions,</hi> and contradiction to Scripture, for me to believe: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. for when He comes, but not till then, shall these things be laid aside.</p>
                  <p>Besides, That which yet confirms me more fully in this Opinion, is, Because herein this New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> doth most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly answer the City and Temple, which was builded after the Captivity; which City and Temple being once built, it stood till Christ our Lord did visit them in his own Personal coming the first time; as the Prophets also said it should: <hi>The Lord whom ye seek,</hi> saith one, <hi>shall suddenly come to his Temple; even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts:</hi> And again, <hi>I will shake all Nations, and the Desire of all Nations shall come; and I will fill this House with</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:104034:109"/>
                     <hi>glory, saith the Lord of Host: Wherefore the glory of this latter House shall be greater than that of the former, saith the Lord of Hosts: And I will give Peace in this place, saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. Hag. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Now observe, That from the time of the building of the second Temple, to the coming of Christ, the Worship of the Temple-Order was to be by all most devoutly and continually observed: but when the Lord Jesus was come, and had established his own more honourable and New-Testament-Dispensation, then all the former Temple-Worship fell to the ground, and became (with all the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Worship that thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed) null and void; yea, and it was a derogation to his Gospel to offer to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that former way of Worship, after he had by his own Personal Presence and Spirit, brought in that other Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All which, I say, will be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our second and New-Testament New <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> For as the old <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was builded after the Jews were come out of literal <hi>Babylon,</hi> so is our New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> builded after our coming out of the Antichristian Oppression of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104034:109"/>
spiritual <hi>Babylon:</hi> again, As that City did after she was builded, continue, and retain her Temple-Worship, until the Personal appearing of Christ the first time; so New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall retain and hold her outward <hi>New-Testament-Worship</hi> till He comes in Person the second time: After all which, as the second Temple was swallowed up of a more heavenly and spiritual Dispensation, by the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Presence of Christ; so shall also the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Temple-Worship be swallowed up by the glory of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Person of Christ the second time; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, for he speaks in the Person of Christ, <hi>Till I come, give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to reading, to exhortation, to Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, when this holy City doth once again appear upon the stage, and in her own situation, and when she hath bin shewed in the Attire of a Queen before the face of all Nations, and their Kings; and when she hath by the Glory of the Light of her New-Testament-Temple, gathered, as with a Net, the number of Gods Elect; then she is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Husbands Privy-Chamber, where she and he alone shall be in that blessed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104034:110"/>
Fellowship and Communion that shall not again be once eclipsed, or in the least interrupted to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I shewed you my present Light into this portion of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if any can give me further, I hope I shall not refuse it: but as yet, methinks this should be the genuine sence of this place, and is the very track of <hi>John</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: For after he had seen the <hi>Wall</hi> for present Safety, the <hi>Foundations</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, the <hi>Gates</hi> for Entrance, and the like; then he comes to tell us of the Glory of all, and of the Street it self at last; which indeed is the last and end of all the Order of God, and to continue till an end be put to it by Mortality's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing swallowed up of Life: As is yet more fully shewed you in the next Verse of this description.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104034:113"/>
doth last, even the World it self hath need of the shining of the Church; but at this day, this time will be no longer, because the Day of Eternity will break, and by that means cause the World that now is, even the World of the Ungodly, to cease to have a being here any longer.

                  <p>This is rendered as the reason, why at this day both the light of Sun and Moon are needless; it is, because <hi>the Glory of God did lighten it,</hi> and because <hi>the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> Now the Glory of God must be understood in this place, not of that Glory that doth attend the Church in this world, for that Glory doth attend the Church upon the account of her Purity of Worship, of Temple-Worship, and doth either abide on her, or withdraw it self, according to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act observing the Rule, or declining from it, as I have shewed you in the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 11 vers.</note> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this discourse. But the Glory that here you read of, it is a Glory that supplieth this City without those Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, yea, therefore, those Ordinances (as the Temple and the light of the Sun and Moon) do cease because of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Glory that now is come into this City: <hi>The City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it</hi>

(mark) <hi>for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I say, this Glory that now he speaks of, it is the Glory that shall possess this City at the end of her Glory in this world; wherefore, as saith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, from this day forward, <hi>The Sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the Moon give light unto thee; but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory,</hi> Isa. 60. 19.</p>
                  <q>For the Glory of God did lighten it, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Thus it was at the finishing of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in the Wilderness, and of the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> both which were figures in their finishing, of the finishing of the state of the Church in this world: and it is said of them, that in the day when they in all things were accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the fashion that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before concerning their Order and accomplishment, that then the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God [so] <hi>appeared upon them, that</hi>

The Glory of the Lord was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> while the pattern of the Tabernacle was giving: but it rested on the Tabernacle when the work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was finished; to signify, I say, that the Glory of God will rest in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and in his Church by them, so long as Ordinances are in use: but when they are needless, then it will rest in the Church without them, and that more gloriously than ever it therein did rest by them.</p>
                  <q>For the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</q>
                  <p>Mark; Though now there shall be no need of Temple, Sun or Moon: yet Christ the Lamb, <hi>or the Man who was offered in sacrifice for our Redemption,</hi> shall be of use and benefit; for, <hi>the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> Wherefore, all, that we (who are the saved) shall enjoy of Glory and Sweetness in another world, though we shall not enjoy it from God through Christ, by and in the Ordinances, yet we

                  <p>This word <hi>day,</hi> we may understand two ways; either for the day of bringing in to fill this City, or for the day of her perfection and fulness.

                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>John</hi> considering this, doth quite exclude the night, saying, <hi>There shall be no night there.</hi> Indeed, after this <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> hath had her Golden day in this world, I say, just towards the ending thereof, she will yet once again be beset with raging <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore by the Glory and Honour of the Nations in this place, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, That all the Treasures of the Church, and all the Graces that at this day lie scattered here and there, some in one place and some in another; they shall be found no where at that day but in this City, <hi>in the Church that walks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rule.</hi> Now the Reasons why I take this honour and glory to be meant of these things, are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:104034:127"/>First, Because thus it was in the time of the building of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after the Captivity; the Treasure of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was become the Treasures of the Provinces of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was again restored and brought to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as you may see by the Scriptures now cited.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because I find indeed, that<note place="margin">Ezek. 20 6, 25.</note>

                     <hi>Lands.</hi> Now, I say, seeing the milk and honey, which is the Comforts of the Church and her Treasure, is called, <hi>the Glory of all Lands:</hi> I take Glory and Honour in this place to signify the same thing also.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because also I find, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Prophets, that the Christians Glory and Honour, lieth mostly, even principally in Heavenly and Spiritual things; as in Faith, Love, Experience of God, of Grace, of Christ, and Spiritual Life. I reade, that at the building of of this City, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall meet together, and that at that day they shal mutually be partakers of each others glory. <hi>The Gentiles shall milk out, and be</hi>

                     <hi>the Jews: and the Glory of the Gentiles shall be again extended unto the Jews, like a mighty flowing stream:</hi> But I say, that this Glory and Honour should consist in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, or that the Glory that is meerly carnal, should be principally here intended, I confess it grates too near the ground for me to believe or rejoyce in. Alas, I find that those souls that have not now the tenth part of the Spirit and Life of heavenly things, that shall then be poured forth; I say, I find that these are trampling on the World, and disdain the thoughts of being taken with its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Wherefore much less will it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed in that day, when the Glory and Goodness of God shall in that manner break forth. Again, Can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the cheif of the Glory that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should bring to the <hi>Jews</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sixteen hundred years warming in the bosome of Christ? I say is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the great Crop of all they have reaped, should consist in a little outward <hi>trumpery?</hi> or if it should, would it be a suitable medicine in the least to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the eyes of a broken and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People, as the <hi>Jews</hi> will be at that

day? or if the Glory that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at that day shall suck from the <hi>Jews</hi> were such as this, would it at all be as life from the dead to them in a Gospel sence? The Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall be a wall to<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13, 14, 15.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> at their return, but such a wall as will cheifly consist in spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly safeguard, &amp; in outward because of that: <hi>I am a Wall,</hi> saith she, <hi>and my breasts</hi>

                     <hi>are Towers,</hi> on which the <hi>Jews will build upon her a Palace of Silver.</hi> But must this Wall, I say, consist cheifly in outward Glory, in the Glory of earthly things? or must this Silver-Palace be of that nature either? no verily, but when God hath builded the City <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and put his Church into such a state, that <hi>upon all her Glory shall be a defence</hi> of Heaven, then shall the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their coming into this City, build by their experience a Palace for spiritual and heavenly pleasure, to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and comfort their brethren withal.

Now the reason why the Church may be said to have some within her that are none Elect, and yet be counted holy still, it is, because the Church is to judge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by their Words and Lives; they know not the Heart absolutely: and therefore if in Word and Life a man be as he ought, he is to be accounted a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saint, and orderly ought to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Church as such: So that I say, as I said before, these words of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ing out Sinners out of the Church, they are not to be understood as if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that those should be debarred visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Communion, that in Word and Life
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104034:130"/>
appeared visible Saints, that are so judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by the Rules of Christs Testament; but that such should be from it shut out, that appeared visible Sinners: Those that are <hi>Defilers, Workers of abomination, and Makers of Lies,</hi> none of these shall enter.</p>
                  <q>But those that are written in the Lambs Book of Life.</q>
                  <p>These words explain the matter: Those, and those onely, shall enter here, that are found written in the Lambs Book of Life. Now by <hi>Book of Life,</hi> we are to understand two things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth: First, Either the Book of Gods eternal Grace and Mercy tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Christ, in which all the Elect are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for ever: Or, Secondly, That Book of Life in which the Lord Jesus hath all recorded that are visible Saints by calling; for, for both these there is a Book of Life. For the first of these, I judge these Scriptures do suit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. and for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, these, with that in the Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32, 33. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19.</p>
                  <p>Now the Book of Life in this place
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104034:130"/>
must not be so strictly taken as if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded those onely that were elect of God to eternal Life, but must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of that Book wherein is recorded the Rules and Bounds of visible Church-Communion; and so all those that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Gifts and Operations of special or common Grace, do fall within the compass of those Rules and Bounds. Thus it was in the Type, at the return out of Captivity, none were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted entrance into the Church, but those that could shew their Priviledges by Genealogy, and the Records of the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 62, 63. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7. 64, 65. &amp; 2. 20.</note> Church; and to others it was said, That they <hi>had neither Portion, nor Lot, nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial in Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that by Book of Life in this place we are to understand that Book that hath in it the Bounds and Liberties of this City, and so every one that falleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of these Bounds and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges visibly, Consider,</p>
                  <p>First, They that are visible matter for visible Church-Communion, they shall be found within this City, and yet there shall not enter any, <hi>but those that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lambs Book of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now visible Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104034:131"/>
doth not absolutely call for one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invisible Saints, neither can it: for if the Church was to joyn with none but those whom they knew to be the very Elect of God (as all invisible Saints are) then she must joyn with none at all; for it is not possible that any Church should be so infallible to judge in that manner of the Elect, as to discern them always, and altogether from the non-Elect, which cannot be an invisible Saint.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By <hi>Book of Life</hi> therefore, in this place, we are to understand, I say, that Book that hath written in it every visible Saint, whether they be Elect, or not; and so such a Book that is capable of receiving in a man at one time, and of blotting of him out again, as occasion doth require, at another: which thing is onely applicable to that Book that binds and looses on the account of a mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a visible Saint, or a visible Apostate: which thing is onely applicable to the visible Rules of receiving or shutting out of visible Church-Communion; which Rules being the Rules of Christs New-Testament, it is proper to call it the Book of Life; and is about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104034:131"/>
of going in or going out of this very City, so called: <hi>If any man shall take</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things that are written in this Book.</hi> O how happy is he who is not onely <hi>a visible,</hi> but also <hi>an invisible</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 5.</note> Saint! He, he shall not be blotted out of the Book of Gods eternal Grace and Mercy; when others are liable to lose a share not onely in Heaven, but to be for ever blotted out of the Book that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth of visible Believers also.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. But again, to explain the matter yet more: In the visible Church there is not onely Sons but Servants, that is, not onely those that are truly Elect, but such as have received a Gift for the perfecting the Church under <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 46. 16, 17.</note> Christ, in his Service here in this World: Now, I say, the Servant for the time present hath his place in the Church as well as the Son, though not the place of a Son, but of a Servant, even a place of Service, as of Preaching, Prophesying, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7</note> the Ordinances that are given to the Church, and the like; all which, a man that hath not Grace may do, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104034:132"/>
that by the appointment of Christ; thus<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12 1 Cor. 13 1, 2, 3, 4. Mat. 25. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> was <hi>Judas, Demas, Hymeneus, Phyletus,</hi> and others; who sometimes were the Servants of Christ in the Church, and did minister for him to them; yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, notwithstanding, such as were all that time strangers and aliens to the life, and power and saving operations of the justifying and preserving Grace of the Gospel: as he saith also by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah, Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of aliens shall be</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 61. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>your Plough men, and your Vine-dressers.</hi> For verily Christ will give to those that have not his saving-grace, yet great knowledge and understanding in the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, and will also make them for profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in his Church, to feed their flocks, to plow up the fallow ground of their hearts, and to dress their tender Vines: Yet, I say, they themselves shall not be everlastingly saved, for they want his saving-grace. As Christ saith, <hi>The servant abideth not in the house for</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</hi> As he saith again in another Prophet, <hi>If the Prince give a gift to any of his sons, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance thereof shall be his sons; it shall</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:104034:132"/>
                     <hi>be their possession by inheritance: but if he give a gift of inheritance to one of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then it shall be his to the year of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 46. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>after it shall return to the Prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons for them.</hi> Some indeed have grace aswel as gifts; now they that are such, the profit of their gifts shall be rewarded by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their grace, but as for them that have only a gift, when the work of a gift is done, then they cease to be any longer of use in the Church, and therefore are forthwith shut out of the same, <hi>but the Son abideth for ever.</hi> Thus you see that as visible Church-communion doth not absolutely call for the Elect only, but admits, and that by the Book of Rules, all that are visible and open Saints by calling: so also the Lord Jesus himself doth and will use some in his Church as his Officers and Servants, that yet in a a strict sence are neither his Sons nor Members; Who yet are within the bounds of that Book of Life that here he speaks of, as is evident, because with Christ's allowance they are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commnnion with his Church, and by him also furnished with Gifts and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to profit and edifie withal. Now
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104034:133"/>
observe, such a one is admitted, though but a Servant, yet not by the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause but such a one. The Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth no man upon the account of gifts alone, but upon the account of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Grace; as of Gospel-Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of the Confession of Faith, and of a Conversation suitable to the same: All which a man that is not elect may have the notion of, yea, the <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 6 4, 5.</note> power though not the <hi>saving Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Further, this which I have said about the visible Church-Communion, and so consequently about the Book of Life, it must needs be a Gospel-Truth; yea, a thing for Truth in this <hi>New-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> because, besides what hath been said, there will be found in this City, even at the coming of the Lord Jesus, (which coming of his will not be for some time after the building and setting of it up) I say, there will be then sound among them <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> and such who have not the saving-grace of God in their souls: But yet, 1. these very souls shall be counted by the Church, yea, by Christ himself, for <hi>Virgins;</hi> that is, such as had not defiled their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. 2. And will be such Virgins as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104034:133"/>
have, and hold every one her Lamp, even as the Wise themselves. 3. Such <hi>Virgins</hi> as were, every one of them, gone forth from the pollutions of this evil-world. 4. And so such as continued visible Saints, even till the Bridegroom came, for then 'tis said in the margent, they cryed, <hi>Our Lamps are going out.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> These, I say, be those gifted people that will have place in the Church, and so place in the Book of Life here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which yet will (though they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue hid from the Church) be discovered in the day of the Lord to be such, as had only a gift, but not grace; and shall for their secret sins be cut off, and cast away, notwithstanding they were visible Saints all their dayes.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then; If the Scripture saith, that none that <hi>defileth,</hi> or that <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abomination,</hi> or <hi>maketh a lie,</hi> shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this holy City, which yet is but the Church on Earth; with what face can Defilers think and say, they shall possess a part among the Church which is in Heaven. Again, If many that have received gifts from God, and that may be serviceable in his House, shall yet be put out of doors at the coming of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104034:134"/>
Lord, What will they do that have been, and yet continue both giftless and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as visibly as the light that shineth? and that instead of being the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Vine-dressers of the Church, prove Thieves, Robbers, Persecutors, and the like! yea, if many that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of that Book of Life that hath the Records and Rules of a rightly constituted visible Church, may yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, what will become of them that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were so much as written <hi>therein!</hi> must they not perish rather! <hi>And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever were not found written in the Book</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20 16.</note>

                  <q>And he shewed me a pure River of Water of Life.</q>
                  <p>This Water of Life, is nothing else but the manifold Grace of God in Christ, let forth to the Inhabitants of this <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> wherewith she is watered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, as the Earth with rain from Heaven, for the good of those that drink thereof. For both the word <hi>Water,</hi> and that of <hi>Life,</hi> they are but metaphorical sayings, under which is held forth some better and more excellent thing. And indeed it is frequent with God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to speak of his Grace and Mercy under the notion of Waters, of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a Sea, and the like; <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1, 2. <hi>Mica</hi> 7. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Now it is called <hi>Water,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Because no soul can be cleansed or effectually washed from its guilt and<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 7.</note> filth, but by the Grace of God. <hi>I washed thee with water, yea I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and thou becamest mine,</hi> Ezek. 16. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is called <hi>Water,</hi> because
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104034:135"/>
it also quencheth the spiritual thrist of them that by Faith do drink thereof: <hi>I will give,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>to him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirst</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 41. 18</note> 
                     <hi>of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely.</hi> And again, <hi>He that drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst,</hi> Rev. 2. 16. John 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>Further, As it is called <hi>Water,</hi> so it is called the <hi>Water OF LIFE,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diverse account.</p>
                  <p>First, Because it is that which reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the soul that drinketh thereof, from the Death of Sin and the Curse of God, to a principle of Life and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blessing. <hi>And it shall come to pass that everyone that liveth, that moveth whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the waters shall come, shall live.</hi> Ezek. 47. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is called the <hi>Water of Life;</hi> because, that from it comes all those heavenly and spiritual quicknings and revivings, that (like <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi>) do fetch again, and chear up the soul that was sinking, and giving up the Ghost in this world. <hi>There is a River, the streams whereof make glad the City of God,</hi> Psal. 46. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is called the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> because, it healeth the soul of all its spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104034:135"/>
infirmities and diseases, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by the reason of the remainders of sin, the creature is most sadly anoyed and infected. <hi>And there shall be a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Fish</hi> (of men he means, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 19.) <hi>because the waters shall come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they</hi> (the Fish) <hi>shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come,</hi> Ezek. 47. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly; It is called the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> because that whosoever doth effectually drink thereof, shall <hi>die no more, but the Water that Christ shall give him shal be in him a Well of water, springing up in him to eternal life;</hi> wherefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it in another place the <hi>Living Water,</hi> because the quality and nature of it is to beget, to encrease, to maintain, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 10, 14.</p>

                  <p>First, To shew you that it is Grace alone that saveth the sinner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:104034:136"/>And secondly, To shew you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> this day the Doctrine of this Grace will be by it self alone without the commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that dirt and trash that for a long time, even to this day, hath been thrown into it.</p>
                  <p>First, It sheweth us, that it is Grace alone that saveth the sinner, pure Grace, Grace that admits of nothing of ours to be in the least a helper in the matter of our happiness; we <hi>are justified freely by his Grace</hi> through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ. As he saith by the Prophet, <hi>I will pour [CLEAN] water upon you, and you shall be clean, and from all your Idols will [I] cleanse you. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord. Be ye ashamed, and confounded for all your own evil ways, O House of Israel.</hi> Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27, 32, 33. It is clean water indeed, it is clear in the nature of it, clear in the gift of it, and clear in the working of it: It wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth freely, throughly and perfectly: <hi>from all your Idols will I cleanse you,</hi> Rev. 21. 6. Ezek. 16. 9. Ezek. 36. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This word <hi>pure, and clear as Crystal:</hi> It also sheweth us that at the day of New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the Doctrine of Grace shall be cleansed from all those
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104034:136"/>
dirty and muddy inventions, that Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and the Wisdom of this world hath thrown into this River, and into its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Crystal Streams; I say, at this day they shall not come near it, neither shall the rubish they have already cast into it any more be there for ever. <hi>I will destroy all the Beasts thereof</hi> (the beastly men he means) <hi>from beside the great waters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of Beasts trouble them. Then will I make their Waters deep, and cause their Rivers to run like Oyl, saith the Lord God,</hi> Ezek. 32. 13, 14.</p>
                  <q>And he [shewed] me a pure River of Water of Life, clear as Crystal, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>In that he saith, he <hi>saw</hi> this River, he giveth us in a Mystery also to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how openly and plainly this River shall in all its Crystal Streams and Cur-rents be apprehended and seen by the Children of this City; for in this Vision he doth as it were represent in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Children of New <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> as God said to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in another case, <hi>Thou shalt be their sign, and they shall do as</hi>

                  <p>This word, <hi>proceeding,</hi> hath also in it two things.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, A discovery of its gradual extention to those to whom it goes.</p>
                  <p>First, Touching to whom or whither it goes; it is let out both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> indifferently; and so it never yet was, since the Foundations of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church; for in the time of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it did run to the <hi>Jews</hi> in special, and in the times of the New-Testament

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much touching whither this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goes.</p>
                  <p>And now to come to the manner of the extention of it in the way of its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A thing that proceeds, it doth what it doth gradually, that is, by degrees. First, it comes or goes so far, and then further, and afterwards further than that; till at last it ascends to the height and uppermost degree that is alotted for its perfection: All which the Holy Ghost would have us gather out of this word, it <hi>proceedeth,</hi> or that <hi>John</hi> saw this <hi>Holy-Water proceeding:</hi> The which, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in a mystery unfoldeth to us, saying, the first time he passed over this Water, <hi>it was up but to his ancles;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">Ezek. 47 3, 4, 5.</note> time he passed through, <hi>it proceeded to his knees;</hi> the third time <hi>to his loyns,</hi> and last of all, became <hi>a River to swim in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, It is but up <hi>to the ancles,</hi> that is, but shallow, and signifies that, first, the soul is but a little child in Gods things, such as the Apostle calls <hi>Babes Children, little Children.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:104034:138"/>Secondly, Then from the <hi>ancles</hi> it proceeds to the <hi>knees,</hi> that is, somewhat higher then the ancles, and signifieth that the Christian groweth from a Child to a Young and Strong-man, one that is now gotten deeper into the things of God,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 13.</note> and that is able to tug with, and <hi>overcome the wicked ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, After this, it proceeds high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>even up to the loins;</hi> this signifies, that as Grace makes men <hi>Children</hi> of God, and his <hi>Young-men,</hi> so also it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Ancients</hi> in his Church; it makes them grave, knowing, solid Guides, and Unfolders of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Kingdom; these are such as are instructed into the Kingdom of God, and that can bring out of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury <hi>things new and old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It yet proceeds higher, even to be above the head, <hi>a River to swim in,</hi> and that such a River as can by no means <hi>be passed over.</hi> This signifieth our launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Eternity; our being beyond all heights, depths, lengths and breadths, in the open Visions and Enjoyments of Grace. <hi>For there the Glorious Lord shall be unto us a place of BROAD Rivers, and Streams, wherein shall go no Gallie with</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:104034:139"/>
                     <hi>Oars, neither shall gallant Ships passe thereby,</hi> Isa. 33. 21. Thus we begin Children, and wade <hi>up to the ancles</hi> in the things of God, and being once in, it riseth and proceeds to come <hi>up to our knees,</hi> then to our <hi>loins,</hi> and last of all to be <hi>a River to swim in;</hi> a River so wide, so deep, and every way so large, <hi>that can in no wise be passed over.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And he shewed me a pure River of Water of Life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>Having thus spoken to the Water, what it is, as also to whom it extends it self, and how it proceeds: He now comes to shew us from whence and from whom it doth come. <hi>It proceeds,</hi> saith he, <hi>from the Throne of God and of the Lamb, Out of the Throne of God;</hi> this <hi>Throne of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 22. Heb. 4. 16.</note> it is in another place called the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> from which, as always, so now in a special manner he will issue forth of himself in the glory of the Gospel of the Grace of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to the Inhabitants of this City. When he saith therefore, that it doth proceed out of the Throne of God, it is as if he had said, I saw, that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104034:139"/>
from the yearning bowels of the great God did flow continually the Living Streams of the everlasting Fountains of Grace, and that not only to, but in the midst of this City, wherewith her Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are continually watered and their Pastures kept always green and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth, Come ye to the Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb.</q>
                  <p>In that this Water of Life is said to proceed not only <hi>out of the Throne of God, but also of the Lamb.</hi> It signifieth and holdeth forth unto us two speciall things.</p>
                  <p>First, That the Throne of God is also made the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ, upon which he (as a reward of his Sufferings and Victory over Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all Evils) is set down, and upon which he sits and rules as Lord and Chief of all Worlds. He is set down on the<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2. &amp; 10. 12. &amp; 12. 2.</note> right hand of Power, on the right hand of the Majesty on high; as he saith, <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit down with</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3 21</note> 
                     <hi>me on my Throne, even as I overcame, and am set down with my Father upon his Throne.</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:104034:140"/>
This being thus, it signifieth that this City shall have her enjoyments of Life, Peace and Joy in the holy Ghost, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Kingship of the Lord Jesus Christ, aswel as by the vertue of his Priestly and Prophetical Office. The Church doth in our dayes know a little what Joy, Peace and Life is to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Christ, even through that dark and glimmering sight that she hath of the Offices of Christ in a mist; but she feels not yet what Joy she shall have, and what Peace she shall enjoy when her Lord in all his Offices is manifest before her, and when he in the glory of them doth reign in the midst of this <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> There are none of the Offices of the Lord Jesus yet upon the <hi>Throne in his Church on Earth,</hi> though they be all upon the Throne in Heaven: O! but the day is coming that they shall be all upon the Throne in the Church on Earth, when they shal each of them in its full length, breadth, heighth and depth bear sway among his People, and before all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:104034:140"/>
                     <hi>O that thou wouldest rend the Heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the Mountains might flow down at thy presence!</hi> O that the day were come that the smoak should go forth of the Temple of God, that men might enter into it, and there meet with God upon the Throne, and with Jesus in him upon the Throne in all his Offices. It will be thus, thou <hi>Zion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 64. 1.</note> shortly, and <hi>great shall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing observable, is, That as all Grace comes from out of the Throne of God, so it also proceeds, or comes out of <hi>the Throne of the Lamb:</hi> that is, No Grace comes to any, but thorow the Victory and Conquest of the Lord Christ: <hi>We are justified freely by his</hi>

away: for this River will not onely wash away the sins and filthiness of those that are truly gracious, but it will also destroy the Heretick and erronious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; it will be to them at that day as the red Sea was to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old; which Sea, though it was a Wall on this hand, and on that, to the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> yet it destroyed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 29</note> assayed to go thorow it, as <hi>Israel</hi> did. The reason also why we are at this day in such confusion in matters of Religion, it is for want of the <hi>clear and pure streams of this River of Water of Life;</hi> all which will be mended when there is but one River to water this City, and that too the pure River of the Water of Life, in all its streams as <hi>clear as Crystal;</hi> then shall all drink-in all things into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and be watered with the same Dews of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of <hi>the Water of Life</hi> that belongeth to this <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                     <q>And in the midst of the Street of it, and on either side of the River was there the Tree of Life, which bare twelve manner of Fruits, and yeilded her Fruit every month; and the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This <hi>Tree of Life</hi> is the Lord Jesus Christ; and that he is here called a <hi>Tree,</hi> rather then by other of his Names, it is to shew us how fruitful and exceeding advantagious he in all his Benefits will be to the Inhabitants of this City: this is that Tree under whose Branches the<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31, 32.</note> Fowls of Heaven shall now most safely lodge, and finde relief from the hot and fainting Beams of the persecuting Sun of this world, as the Word doth there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>
                  <p>Now before I come to speak to this Tree touching the manner of its Fruit, and its often bearing, with the efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of its Leaves, which here he saith doth heal the Nations; I will take notice of one or two general things that lie before me, from the standing of the Tree in the <hi>midst of the street of this City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:104034:142"/>First then, In that he saith this City hath a <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in it; He alludes to the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the pleasant Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise that God began the World withal; whereby he signifieth, that as the World began with a Paradise, so also it shall end with a Paradise, when Sin and Satan have done their worst: This New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> shall be the wind-up of the world, and in it shall stand the Tree of Life, as well as there stood one in the goodly Garden which was the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <p>Now this <hi>Tree of Life</hi> being in the midst of this City, it signifieth that the Inhabitants of it shall be sweetly sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, refreshed and defended with its coolness, and also sweetly nourished and comforted with its dainties: And hence it is that the Scriptures do hold him forth in his benefits to his Church, under

His shadow will make us <hi>return,</hi> that is, <hi>to our first Love;</hi> to the dayes of our youth, to our young, fresh, tender, and flourishing Faith, Love and Self-denial, that we received in the dayes of our Espousals. 2. As it will make us return <hi>to</hi> these, so it will make us revive <hi>in</hi> these; they shall <hi>return, and revive;</hi> they shall revive <hi>as the Corn;</hi> as the Corn doth when in the heat of Summer after long scorching, it it covered with cool Clouds, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the bottles of Heaven. 3.

shall be excellent, <hi>They shall revive as the Corn, they shall grow as the Vine, and shall send forth their scent as the Wine of Lebanon.</hi> This Tree is a Perfuming-Tree, and makes them also that abide under the shadow thereof, to smell as sweet-smelling Myrrh; it makes them smell as the Wine of thy Grace, O Lord, and as the fragrant Oyntments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <p>But again; As he shall be thus profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his People for shadow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving; so he will be in the midst of the Street of it for food, for refreshing, and replenishing that way. <hi>I sate down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his shadow with great delight,</hi> said she, <hi>and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</hi> Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel tels us, that this Tree is all Trees;<note place="margin">Ezek. 47 12.</note>

more to be found in him for the food of the Soul, than there can be on all Trees for the food of the Body. He is a Fir-tree for tallness, greenness and strength; He is an Olive for fatness, a Vine for sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Hos. 14. 8.

                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude. Seeing Christ is said to be in the midst of the Street of this City, it sheweth unto us with what, at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, the actions of the Saints of this City shall be seasoned. The Street, you know I told you, is the Way of Holiness in this City; the place of Spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and solace. Now in the very midst of this Street there stands this Tree, which being thus, it sheweth us how wonderfully Christ, as a Tree of Life, will be in all the words and deeds of the Inhabitants of this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi> they will walk in Christ, they will talk in Christ, they will do all they do in Christ; or rather Christ will be found in all their wayes, <hi>even as the Tree of Life is found in the midst of the Street</hi>

                  <p>Again, In that this Tree is said to stand in the midst of the Street, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto us how common and free his benefits will now be also. The Plumbs, and Figs, and Grapes and Apples of this Tree, will be open to every Passenger; not a Boy nor a Girl that now shall play in thy Street, O <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but shall eat of the Fruits of the Tree that stands in he midst of thee, as of common <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 31. 4, 5.</note> things.</p>
                  <q>And in the midst of the Street of it, and and [on either side] of the River was there the Tree of Life.</q>
                  <p>As this Tree doth stand in the <hi>midst of the Street</hi> of this City, so it also standeth <hi>one each side</hi> of the River of the Water of Life, of which you have heard before. Now when he saith, <hi>the Tree is on either side of the River;</hi> whence by the way note yet again, That both the Water of Life, and also the Tree of Life, they are both to be enjoyed by the Inhabitants of this City in the way of Holiness; the Tree is in the midst of the Street, and the River runs <hi>thorow</hi> or between the very tables of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104034:144"/>
the heart of this Tree of Life; <hi>on either side of the iver was there the Tree of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, In that it is said that this Tree of Life is on either side of the River; it argueth that they who come at any time at this River for water to quench their thirst, and to make them live, they must come to it by the Tree of Life, which is Christ. In more easie terms, read it thus; There is none can partake of the Grace<note place="margin">Col. 2. 3, 9.</note> of God but by the man Christ Jesus, which is this Tree of Life; for this Tree,<note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note> this Christ, doth stand on either side of the River, to signifie that all Grace to us comes thorow his bloody Wounds,<note place="margin">John 14. 6.</note> Death and Victory. <hi>I am the Way,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>the Truth and the Life, no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And on either side of the River was there the Tree of Life.</q>
                  <p>Mark, But one Tree, and yet such a Tree whose body reached as far as the River reached; indeed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saith this Tree is <hi>all Trees for meat,</hi> yet not to shew that there is more Trees of Life than one, but to shew that all that can be thought of that is good for soul-nourishment is to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104034:145"/>
be found in this one, that is in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: and it is further evident, that though he saith <hi>all Trees,</hi> as if he meant many, yet he spake but metaphorically, to shew thereby the fulness of Christ; because, <hi>John</hi> doth understand him so, calling it <hi>one Tree,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Tree of Life.</hi> But mark again; so far as the River goes, so far the Tree goes, so that where you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the Tree of Life, be sure there is none of the Water of Life. No Christ, no Grace; <hi>He that hath the Son hath life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>but he that hath not the Son shall not see</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>life, but the wrath of God abides upon him: For on either side of the River was [there] the Tree of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Which bare twelve manner of [Fruits.]</q>
                  <p>This word, <hi>Fruits,</hi> it may be taken two ways, either as it relates to God, or as it relates to man (for as I said before,<note place="margin">Judg. 9. 9, 13.</note> the Fruits of this Tree <hi>refresheth the heart both of God and man.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Now if it be taken with reference to God, then it signifieth the compleat satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that by the worthiness of the Fruits of the Passion of Christ is given to God for the salvation of the Church; this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104034:145"/>

                  <p>2. If Fruit here be taken with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to men, then it signifieth the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Glory that those for whom he dyed and rose again, should receive by this means. His Fruit I have shewed you is sweet to the taste of his Church, which Fruit is the effect of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for Sinners, and the comfortable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it in the soul.</p>
                  <q>Which bare [twelve] manner of Fruits.</q>
                  <p>In that he saith, the Fruits are <hi>twelve,</hi> he herein alludeth to the twelve Tribes of the <hi>Israel</hi> of God; for which twelve Tribes here will be found a suitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Food, healing Food: <hi>I will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, These that <hi>John</hi> calleth <hi>twelve manner of Fruits,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calleth, <hi>all manner of Fruit for meat:</hi> For
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104034:146"/>
indeed, as I shewed before, there is that to be found in Christ, both for fulness and variety, that is not to be found in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth beside. Here is Fruit for Body, Fruit for Soul, Fruit for Babes, Fruit for Strong-men, Fruit for Fathers, yea, for glorified Saints and Angels: Fruits, variety of Fruits, even <hi>twelve manner of Fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. By <hi>twelve manner of Fruits,</hi> he doth also allude to the Apostles, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>twelve,</hi> and are those who have made provision for the House of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the twelvefold manner of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of God unto them, and of the twelve fold manner of Operation of that holy Spirit, <hi>which wrought in every one of them severally as he pleased:</hi> which <hi>twelve</hi> were before figured out unto us by the twelve Officers of King <hi>Solomon</hi> (the<note place="margin">

                     </gap> its <hi>Fruit every month:</hi> For indeed, what ever you reade of, concerning this City
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104034:146"/>
in this description of <hi>John,</hi> you find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other in the Writings of the Prophets that giveth ground for such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. Wherefore seeing the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>Solomon</hi> were twelve, and the Apostles of Christ twelve also; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Officers of <hi>Solomon</hi> made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for his house, each man his month in a year, and the Fruits of this Tree of Life is called <hi>twelve manner of Fruits:</hi> I do take the twelve manner of Fruits here to be signified by the provision of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's</hi> Officers according to the twelve seasons of the year, and they a Type of<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 7. 1 Cor. 3. 2.

                  </p>
                  <q>And yeelded her Fruit every month.</q>
                  <p>As this confirmeth what I have said before; so it further sheweth us these three things.</p>
                  <p>First, That the effectual Fruits of Christ for the saving of the world, they are to be had especially, at certain seasons: It yeelded her Fruit every <hi>Month.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104034:147"/>Secondly, It sheweth also that at the building of this <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> these Seasons will be very thick and quick; she yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Fruit <hi>every month.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It sheweth us, also, the abundance of provision that this holy City shall then enjoy from the Tree of Life, even <hi>all manner of Fruit, every Month.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For the first, That the Gospel hath and will be especially effectual at certain Seasons for the saving of the sons of men: it is shewed us by the descending of the Angel into the Pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi> to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the water, which as it was at certain seasons, so he that in those seasons first stepped in, he only was made whole o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 4.</note> whatsoever disease he had. It is shewed us also in that Parable of the Lord's hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men to work in his Vineyard; which time of hiring, though it lasteth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral from the first hour to the eleventh yet so, as that there were vacant seasons between hiring-times, and hiring-times<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> quit thorow the whole day; he went out at the <hi>first, third, sixth, ninth, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour, and not at every hour to hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Labourers.</hi> For as God hath appointed out before hand the number of his Elect
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104034:147"/>
so also he hath determined in his good<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 15, 16. Hos. 6. 11 Jer. 2. 24</note> pleasure the day of their bringing in, and will then have them as certainly as the wild Ass is found in her month. Of which times and seasons, because men are ignorant, therefore they should with all faithfulness wait upon God in all the<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 8.</note> seasons of his Grace for their souls, even as he did for his body; who because he would be there at all seasons, brought thither his bed and couch to rest there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As by the Fruit of this Tree being yeelded at certain seasons, We may gather that there are certain seasons in which the Word in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner shall be blessed and made successful to the salvation of many souls: So again, in that he saith, <hi>This Fruit is yeelded every month,</hi> it signifieth that in the days of the building of the City, the <hi>New-Jerusalem,</hi> these Seasons will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick and quick. <hi>Lift up thine eyes,</hi> saith God to this City, <hi>all these gather themselves together, to come unto thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters from the ends of the Earth. All the Flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee</hi> (so that thou wandering by, shalt say) <hi>Who are these that flie as a cloud, and</hi>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:104034:148"/>
                     <hi>as Doves to the windows. For I will make thy Mountain a way, and my high ways shall</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 11, 12. Isa. 60. 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>be exalted. Behold these shall come from far, and lo these from the North and the West, and those from the Land of Sinim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that she is said to yeeld not only <hi>Fruit,</hi> but <hi>all manner of Fruit;</hi> and that not only one manner of Fruit now, and another then, but <hi>all manner of Fruit,</hi> and that, <hi>every month:</hi> it argueth also, that at this day <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shal have abundance of heavenly and spiritual provision, and of variety of dainties for her solace and refreshment; alwayes new, I say, and immediately from the Tree. <hi>The Fruits of the Vine shall at that</hi>

Be not afraid, ye Beasts of the field, for the Pastures of the Wilderness do spring: for the Tree beareth her Fruit; the Fig-Tree and the Vine do yeeld their Strength. Be glad ye Children of Zion, and rejoyce in the Lord your God; for he hath given you the former and the latter rain moderatly, and he will cause it to come down to you, the rain, the former and the latter rain in the first month;</hi>

                     <hi>and the Floors shall be full of Wheat, and</hi>

                     <hi>every one,</hi> not only, <hi>sit under his own Vine and under his own Fig-tree, but from thence they shall call each to other, to give to each other their dainties, and none shall make them afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations.</q>
                  <p>By <hi>Leaves</hi> here, we may understand the blessed and precious Promises, Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Encouragments that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Christ's undertaking for us, we have every where growing upon the new Covenant; which Promises and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragments they are, and will be, most freely handed to the wounded consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that will be tossed upon the restless waves of doubt and unbelief, as was the Olive-leaf by the Dove brought home to <hi>Noah,</hi> when he was tossed upon the<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> waves of that outragious Flood that then did drown the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:104034:149"/>But again, by this word, <hi>the Leaves,</hi> You may conceive, that still he hath his eye to the Paradise in which at first God placed <hi>Adam</hi> and his Companion, for 'twas to Leaves they fled for covering, after they had transgressed against their<note place="margin">

                        </gap>n. 3. 7.</note> Maker. Now then, in his saying the <hi>Leaves are for healing,</hi> it is as if he had said, the Paradise that will be towards the latter end of the world, will far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip the Paradise that first was planted in the begining thereof; for as the Tree of Life, which is the Christ and Saviour, shall stand where did the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, which is the Old Covenant, and Law of Works: So the Leaves of this Tree shall be for healing, and for covering the nakedness of poor transgressors; though the Leaves that <hi>Adam</hi> found in the first Paradise, do what he could, did leave him naked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christs Leaves are better than Adams Aprons. Ezekiel</hi> saith, that these Leaves<note place="margin">Ezek. 47 12.</note> are <hi>for medicine,</hi> that is, they <hi>are for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> saith <hi>John;</hi> the which may most fitly be applied to the blessed promise of Grace, for as a Leaf for Medicine, when applied to a sore in the body doth supple, molify, and heal the wound; so the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:104034:149"/>
word of Promise when rightly applyed to the soul, it doth supple, molify and heal the wounded conscience; <hi>He sent his word and healed them, and delivered them from their distractions. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderous works to the Children of men!</hi> Psal. 107. 20, 21.</p>
                  <q>And the Leaves, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>There is yet another Mystery lieth in these words.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, <hi>And the Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are for the healing of the Nations,</hi> but <hi>the Leaves;</hi> by which he would have us to understand, that all the benefits, and priviledges that we do here receive from Christ, they are as inferior to the Glory we shall have from him when we come to Heaven, as inferior, I say, as the Leaves are to the Fruit. Again, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and sweetness that at any time we receive from the Lord, it is not before, but after a Promise is suitably applied, even as the Fruit of the Tree with which the body is comforted, is not before, but after the Leavs have put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Wherefore Christ might well
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104034:150"/>
say to <hi>Nathaniel</hi> (and that after he had received some refreshment from a Leaf)<note place="margin">John 1. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt see greater things than these;</hi> and <hi>Paul, That yet a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory is laid up for</hi>

                     <hi>all Believers:</hi> for indeed, indeed, the Glory that God hath prepared for us against the day of God, it doth, and will more outstrip the most high Enjoyment of the highest Saint in <hi>New-Jerusalem</hi> (notwithstanding their Enjoyment will be so eminent) than doth the sweetest Fruit outstrip the Leaf that hangeth on that Tree: <hi>And the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Leaves</hi> be so good, O Lord, let us enjoy the Fruit; and not a little, or earnest, but the whole Harvest thereof in thy Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Thus much touching this Water and Tree of Life.</p>

                  <p>This is the conclusion of the whole Discourse; and it sheweth unto us the blessed effect of the blessed recovering

                  </p>
                  <p>For there hath no state of the Church been yet in the world, but that state hath been liable to a Curse; but this state, to wit, the state she will be in at her build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, wil be a state without parallel, a state properly her own. <hi>And there shall be no more Curse.</hi>

                  <p>By <hi>Curse</hi> in this place we are cheifly to understand, not the taking away of the Curse, the eternal Curse which separates between God and the soul for ever; for so the Curse in this sence hath always been taken away, by vertue of the terms, the general terms of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that in common for every Saint in all ages: But by <hi>Curse</hi> here, we are<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13 Zeph. 1. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> to understand that, or those Curses, that do, and have frequently befallen the Church for her Sin and Apostacy; as<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 28</note> namely, the giving up his People to their own darkness and ignorance; his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and my House shall be built in it,</hi> saith the Lord; and again, <hi>I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem for ever:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> considering this, he saith, there shall be here <hi>no more any Cnrse, but the Throne of God.</hi> God will now when he returneth to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> bring his Seat with him, to signify his sitting down in the midst his People, to be their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-keeper for ever.</p>
                  <q>But the Throne of God shall be in it.</q>
                  <p>By this word <hi>Throne,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, yet further, these particular things.</p>
                  <p>First, How blessed a state this City will be in at all times, for the answer of of prayer; the Throne of God will be in the midst of them; <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:104034:152"/>
                     <hi>the Mercy-Seat,</hi> they will be open now to all the Inhabitants of this City; yea, the fame thereof shall so spread, that it shall be rumored among all Nations, that <hi>in Jerusalem God will be found speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that <hi>in Jerusalem</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven and eternal Mercy <hi>is found</hi> at all times by them that seek his face. <hi>My House,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 56. 7.</note> saith he, <hi>shall be called, a House of Prayer for all Nations.</hi> Yea, many People, and strong Nations shall at that day come to seek the Lord at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to pray before the Lord. And at that day, the very Fasts of the House of God, <hi>shall</hi>

                     <hi>be to the House of Judah, Joy and gladness, and cheerful Feasts;</hi> therefore Love, Truth and Peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Throne of God being now established in this City, what a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, what rule, what a life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness &amp; godliness, what dread and majesty will now be in the hearts of all the Sons o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How to an hairs breadth<note place="margin">Isa. 48. 17</note> wil he command and guide them with his eye at all times, when they should either turn to to the right hand or to the left: What Wisdom (I say) what Holiness, what Grace and Life will be found in all their words and actions? The Throne
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104034:152"/>
of God is among them, from which there will come continual influence, light and splendor into all their hearts. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, O ye Nations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it in the Isles afar off. He that scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Jacob, will gather him, and keep him, as a Shepherd doth his Sheep: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that is stronger than he. Therefore they shall come, and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord, for Wheat, and for Wine, and for Oyl, and for the young of the Flock and of the Herd; and their</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Throne of God being in this City, there is also thereby disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what sway and commanding an Authority this City will have at this day, (as I have already shewed you) over all the Earth: <hi>The Lord shall roar out of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and shall utter his voice from Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the Heavens and the Earth shall</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104034:153"/>
Throne, to shew the majesty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding awe that then that City had over all, both far and near; it had for the bearers of the steps twelve Lions, six on<note place="margin">1 Kings 10. 18, 19 20.</note> this side, and six on that side of the Throne. This City shall then be the Head and Chief, but the Tail and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach no more: <hi>Glorious things are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>

                  </p>
                  <q>And his Servants shall serve him.</q>
                  <p>That is, <hi>him only:</hi> Indeed his Servants serve him always, but yet withal they do too too often serve with the wills and lusts of men even in their Service and worshipping God; that is, they serve him in much Affliction, Temptation, Fear and Persecution, but then they shall serve him without any of these: Yea, <hi>they shall take them Captives whose Captives they were, and they shall rule over their Oppressors. And it shall come to pass in that day</hi> (O City) <hi>that the Lord shall</hi>

                  <q>And they shall see his face.</q>
                  <p>This also argueth a very great dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Grace and Mercy to this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> When God did deliver up his People into the hand of the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>

Wherefore by the sight of his face here, we are to understand that glorious visible appearance of God that then will be for this City and People in the face of all the world: For by the Face of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 12.

                  <p>First, They shall see his Severity and Judgments upon the Whore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They shall see how God by his strange Judgments and works of Wonder hath brought this about: <hi>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy</hi>

                     <hi>And his Name</hi>] That is, his Fear and Image, it shall appear in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

Wherefore by <hi>Name</hi> here, he means the Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the Gospel, which in those days shall walk openly with Honour, with Reverence and Esteem before all men. At this day the World will, as I have said, be so far off from opposing and persecuting, that they shall wonder and tremble and fear before this People; yea, be taken, affected, and pleased with the welfare of this Beloved. <hi>The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the Hills shall break forth before</hi>
