         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS humbly offered againſt ſome
Clauſes in the Preſent Bill for Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Privateers.</head>
            <p>VVHEREAS It is the Intent of this Honourable Houſe, That Privateers
ſhall pay no Tenths for any Prize Ship or Goods except French
Goods, yet in <hi>Page</hi> 37. where all Goods except French are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from Tenths, the word Ship is left out, and nothing in any other place to
help it.</p>
            <p>Therefore it's prayed the word Ship may be there added.</p>
            <p>That it often falls out, that Enemies Ships are driven into our Ports, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
or Havens by contrary Winds, and other times they come in as Spies and
to Trade with ill affected perſons contrary to Law, and get out again unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted
by any but Privateers; wherefore His Majeſty by His Commiſſion to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers,
as an Encouragement to them to annoy the Enemy, hath given them
what Prizes they ſhall take in Ports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as at Sea, which Encouragement
is by this Bill in <hi>Page</hi> 38 taken from Privateers, and not only ſo, but a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcouragement added, for by this Clauſe, if a Privateer Chaſes a French
Ship into any of our Harbours and there ſeize her, Their Majeſties ſhall have
the ſole benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 43. By this Bill its Enacted that if an Engliſh Ship retaken, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have been, after the taking by the Enemy, by them ſet forth as a Man
of War, ſhe ſhall be reſtored to the former Owners, paying one Moyety for
Salvage, whereas before by the Law of Nations, ſuch a Ship retaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
wholly to the retaker as a Lawful Prize, and therefore this Clauſe will
diſcourage Engliſh Privateers from Engaging French Privateers, which above
all ought to be encouraged.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Page</hi> 45 this Bill gives but one half of ſuch Owlers and Wooll Boats
as the Privateers ſhall take, to them, whereas before they had the whole.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it's humbly prayed that the ſaid three Clauſes may be left out
of the ſaid Bill.</p>
            <p>And Whereas by this Bill, the ſelling and diſpoſal of French Prize Goods
is given to the Commiſſioners of Prizes, It's humbly prayed that, that part of
the Bill may be altered, ſo that the parties concerned in Privateers may have
the management and diſpoſal of their own Eſtates, for few will be willing
to run the riſque and charge of Privateering when what they take, ſhall be
put into other peoples hands and management.</p>
