         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There are none of ſuch poor

Sacrifice his Life to the Idol of
Honour, and caſt himſelf into
the flames of <hi>Aetna;</hi> In a word,
there is no ſuch flatneſs and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of Spirit, that hath not
one ſpark of Ambition in him,
to aſpire to Honour: As there
are none but deſire it, ſo few that
deſerve it; many, they would be
great, they will not be good;
Glorious, but not Gracious; they
would be Honourable, but will
not be Holy.</p>
            <p>Many would riſe to Honour,
but they quite miſtake the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool;
And ſeek it rather any
where than in Holyneſs; nay,
ſome think they cannot be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
enough, unleſs Godleſs.
Holyneſs is poſted over to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38441:7"/>

thought by ſome to be fit only

dry Divines, Men of low and
poor Spirits (as they errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

Chriſtians; and better no Men, if
not Chriſtians. 'Tis the Badge
of Chriſtianity that makes us Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
for that is the Livery

nay indeed be real ſlaves to their

that Kingly Prophet, inſpired

<q>This Honour have all his Saints,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Holyneſs and Honour God hath
ever knit together with a Chain
of Adamant,<note place="margin">Pſal. 149. 9.</note> a Bond of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable

<hi>Them that honour me I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note>
As ſhame of Sin, ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is the natural Off-ſpring of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38441:8"/>
Grace; As the ſhadow of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Honour is always an inſeperable
attendant of Holineſs, like ſome

like a pair of Turtle Doves,
where you ſee the one, the other
cannot be far; or the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
upon the Mercy-ſeat, by a
reciprocal and mutual proſpect
continually interview each other.
The true <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder, or Stair
of Aſcent to Glory, is no other
than Grace, and the high way to
Honour, Holyneſs: no way to
become great but by being good,
nor truly honourable, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holy, yea even in God's ſtile,
<hi>Optimus</hi> goes before <hi>Maximus,</hi> as
if God himſelf, who is eſſentially
great, could not be great, if not
good, or not ſo great, if not ſo
good, or not the greateſt of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38441:9"/>
all, if not the beſt of All.</p>
            <p>Only the truly Holy, are the
truly Honourable:</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe Honour is nothing
elſe but an atteſtation of the worth
and worthineſs that is in any
Man; whence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us,
<q>Honor est in honorante, non in
honorato.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He means the outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of ſuch reſpective Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Complements of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as the worth and quality of
the perſon honoured deſerveth.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit of God, the
beſt Herald that ever was, and
therefore knows beſt how to give
Names and Titles, never makes
mention of the Saints but with
Titles full of Honour and Grace;
as <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the

            <p>It is not unworthy obſervation
how regardleſs God is of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>The World indeed is a very

goodneſs without greatneſs, if
they be his Saints they are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
All the Honour that comes
from the World, is but like the

the true proportion of the Face,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38441:11"/>

Grace and Beauty. But that
is the true Honour indeed,
without all ſtain or taint, that
comes down from him, who
alone is the God of honour,
and therefore alone can give
it; He that is from Heaven
is above all, and therefore his
Teſtimony is ſo too; not he who
Commends himſelf is allowed,
but he whom God Commends;
He is the true worth whoſe praiſe<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 18.</note>

for is it not an honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,

God's friend. But as if to be a

they are not only admitted to

ſuch an honour it is to be God's

as if all this were not yet honour

The Wife ſhines with the Beams

            <p>4. Their Reward is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
it is no petty Farm, or

nor vaniſhing dignity, but a

being a thing whereof we are
naturally ambitious; what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
eſtate then is this, which
is attended with ſuch a glorious

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38441:14"/>
that thoſe Hypocrites in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi>

               <hi>It is a vain

other Maſters take Servants, but
it is as well for their own benefit
as their Servants, but God takes
his meerly for the benefit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of thoſe that ſerve him, to
dignifie them with ſpecial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Hence is it we find ſuch
glorious things attributed to the
Saints in Scripture; they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Kings and Prieſts, and Temples
of the Living God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 3. Hag. 2. 23 Jer. 22. 24.</note> Judges of the
World, yea Angels too: The
Signet upon God's right hand:
The Apple of his Eye:<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 10.</note> His Crown
of Glory,<note place="margin">Zech. 2. 8. Iſa. 62 3.</note> and Diadem in God's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38441:14"/>
right hand. Oh what glorious
and goodly things are ſpoken of
the Saints of God? what a happy
confluence of Honour attends
them at every turn? Such and
ſuch Honour have all his Saints.</p>
            <p>What is the moſt that an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monarch can beſtow upon his
Favourite and Minion, when he
ſets his Wits on work to honour
him, why! to cloth him in Purple
and Royal Apparel, to ſet a
Princely Diadem on his Head,
to put a Chain of Gold about his
Neck, a Ring upon his Finger,
to ſet him in a Tryumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
with proclamation of the
Kings favour; this is all that
earthly <hi>Caeſars</hi> can beſtow upon
their Favourites; But what is this
to the Honour of God's Saints,
what is the ſhadow to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
inſtead of fine Linnen and
Royal Apparel, they have the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38441:15"/>
Royal Robes of Grace, the Kings
Daughter is all glorious within.<note place="margin">Pſ. 45. 13.</note>
They ſhall not have a fading, but
a flouriſhing; not a mortal, but
an immortal Crown, not of Gold,
but of Glory; inſtead of a Chain
of Gold,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chain of
Heavenly Graces; inſtead of a
Ring they are planted as Rings
and Signets on Chriſt's right hand.
And thus ſhall it be done to the
man whom God honours.</p>
            <p>And thus 'tis apparent that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Holy ones are truly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
the only men that excel
upon the Earth.<note place="margin">Pſ. 16. 3. Prov. 12. 26.</note> They are more
excellent than their Neighbours.
They are the only men, the men
of a thouſand; they are as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Servants told him,<note place="margin">Job 33. 23.</note> worth
thouſands of others. And it muſt
needs be ſo, for the Garland of
true Honour is only twiſted and
woven of the Flowers of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38441:15"/>
Graces, that alone which
makes us Holy, makes us Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
nothing mends the Name,
but what mends the Conſcience.
A holy and a gracious Life hath
a far fairer proſpect in the Field of
Honour, than all worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
beſides.</p>
            <p>A Field of Sincerity, charged
with Deeds of Piety, cannot but
be accompliſhed with a Crest of
Glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves, that
Lighted all their Divinity at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Candle, whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
calls purblind, that cannot ſee
a far off, could ſay that Honour
was the proper reward of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> amongſt their
Myſtical and Hierogliphical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
painted Honour next to
Humility, averring what <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
hath ſince recorded, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38441:16"/>
Honour goes Humility.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 33. 18. 12.</note> And
the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
their Temple,<note place="margin">Honour is like a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace with a low Door, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which no man can enter but he muſt firſt ſtoop.</note> that a Man
muſt unavoidably paſs through
the Temple of Virtue, before he
touched the Stair of Honour.</p>
            <p>Thus it ſtands good both in
God's and Man's account, that
Grace is the Highway to Glory,
and Holyneſs to Honour. And
here I dare be bold to Challenge
all Ages and Times, who ever
was there, that honour'd God,
and was not honoured again.
Yea even whilſt the Saints live
on earth, they want not honour,
they are honour'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Angel, Good men, nay by
Evil men. Holineſs ſtrikes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Reverence, even into
the hearts of thoſe that hate it,
that thoſe that have not hearts to
love it, are forced to admire it.
<hi>Herod</hi> Reverenced <hi>John Baptist,</hi>

that they cannot but in their own
Boſoms give it an honourable
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe then, doth
the Wicked Man brag of his
Houſe, and Herauldry, derive
his Line of Honour from never
ſo noble Progenitors, ſince God
honours him not, he hath not one
drop of honourable Blood in
him, his Honour is but like ſome
Pillar of Smoke, that vaniſhes
and diſſolves of it ſelf, it is but
like a blazing Star, the very Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Well may he while he lives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the outward Ceremony,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38441:17"/>
but never the honour of the
heart: well may he make a blaze,
and ſhine in the World while he
lives, but when his Candle is out,
he ends like a Snuff that cauſes a
Noiſom Smell in the Noſtrils both
of God and Man; when he dyes,
all his Honour is interr'd in the

Mourning; and never till then
ſatisfi'd the living ſo well, as by
his dying, they rejoice at his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
but with this allay of grief,
<hi>That it was no ſooner;</hi> never do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that Honour is but <hi>Magnum nihil,</hi>

For when God hath once by the

out of ſight, then is every one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to bleſs their Memories, and

This is the condition of us all,
evil things we feel them before

loſe them before we know them:
<hi>De bonis judicamus a tergo;</hi> 'Tis
the want that commends the

reſemble an excellent Picture, or

that looks well when ye are

nothing worth; but the
Saints to tamer Fowls, (often
Prey to ſuch Hawks) that are

will look to their honour when

than <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd,

And if they are ſo honourable,
let us know how to prize them

the Celebration of our Annual

Traditionary, of ſo long a ſtanding

Certainly God muſt loſe
a great deal of his Honour, if
we bury the Honour of his Saints:
<hi>Laudate Dominum,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,
in Sanctis,</hi> if God be to be
praiſed in all the Works of his

is he not to be honour'd in the

Saints, thoſe whom he raiſed
up to be horoical Inſtruments
for the propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>But as many things are good
in the intent, which are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo in the event, good in
the Inſtitution, not always in the
Execution; as there are many
things excellent in their firſt birth
and original, which in tract of
time gather ſoyl and ruſt, and
ſo degenerate from the purity of
their firſt Inſtitution; even ſo it
is with the honour of the Saints,
for whilſt Men out of too ſtrong
a bent and overplus of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affection towards the Saints,
thought they could never honour
them enough, at laſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
flat Idolaters, turning Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
into Piety, Affection into
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38441:28"/>
Superſtition, Veneration into
Adoration. When the People
firſt met together at the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Martyrs, (an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Yearly Cuſtom of the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches) to praiſe God
for his Martyrs, at laſt they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
their Arrand, and turned
their Worſhip of God into the
Worſhip of the Martyr; at firſt
their Reliques were pretious, at
laſt they grew holy; firſt the
Saints were honour'd, but after
worſhipped; at firſt they but
commend, but afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrined;
ſo hard it is to ſubſiſt
in a Golden Mediocrity: we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhoot under, or over; not
do, or over do; either not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Saints at all, or too
much: being right <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men,
(too many in this point) never
think we mend the matter, till
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38441:29"/>
we marr it. God gave the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
an expreſs inhibition, not
to take his Name in vain, at laſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> out of a ſuperſtitious
Reverence, durſt not ſo much
as name the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the

to name him in vain, therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
they would not name
him at all: the Brazen Serpent at
firſt erected by God's Inſtitution,
for Hiſtorical Commemoration,
onely of their delivery from
fiery Serpents, at laſt from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Commemoration, it was
tranſlated to Religious Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo the Saints were firſt
honour'd out of Affection, at

            <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> in policy, (as

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38441:29"/>
their Children to lye and not to
lye, but with this diſtinction, to
lye to their Enemies, but to tell

tells us the iſſue of this
<hi>Perſian</hi> Education, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
forgot their diſtinction, and
made bold even to lye to their
beſt Friends. So the <hi>Roman</hi>
Clergy teach the People to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Saints, and not to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
them, ſo long till they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

welfare St. <hi>Auſtin, Sancti ſunt

That is the trueſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Saints which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
of their honour to God's

and <hi>propter Deum,</hi> muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
without impeachment and
derogation of God's honour,
to be a follower of the Saints,
as they be (or were) of

the Saints.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that the
Bleſſed Virgin receives not ſo
much Indignity from her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that deny her, as from
ſuch her Friends that Deifie
her; it is a Sin to give the
Saints more than their due, as
it is to give them leſs: to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of all honour, was
the Errour of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and
many of this laſt Age; to
give them too much, was
firſt the Errour of the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi>
and at this day of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> whereby they do not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38441:30"/>
ſo much honour the Saints, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God.</p>
            <p>The truth is, we honour the
Saints triumphant in Heaven,
but we give them only <hi>honor
Charitatis,</hi> not <hi>honor Religionis;</hi>
we give them Veneration, but
not Adoration; we honour their
Memories, but we erect no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Shrine; we honour them
as fellow Servants now glorifi'd,
but not as demy Gods half deifi'd;
we honour them as Patterns for
imitation, not as Patrons for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
we know no Reliques,
but their Graces; we obſerve
their Feſtivals, by the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Revolutions of the Year,
but we dedicate no Days to
the Saints, but only to the God
of the Saints. What is there no
mean in giving honour to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38441:31"/>
Saints, but we muſt deny them,
or deifie them? Is it not enough
to Commend, but we muſt
Adore them? Is there no mean,
but we muſt be either ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or Idolatrous, or that we muſt
make them either leſs than Saints,
or little leſs than Gods? Is it
not a dangerous thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
that honour upon them,
which muſt needs bring them
into Emulation with God; with
aſpiring <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to be <hi>ſimiles

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38441:31"/>
Is it not the general Voice
of the Church, <hi>Non nobis Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?</hi>
Not unto us, O Lord. Do
not the Saints in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi>
caſt down their Crowns at the
feet of the Lamb? And in their

Let God have his due
above all, and the Saints their

that are Gods; and to the Saints
the things that belong to them:
Let the Saints have their due

out of the Titles of Honour, and
inſtead thereof practice Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Whoring, Swearing, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and Scoffing at the Saints,
as Qualities of a Gentile ſtamp,
and think the aſcent of a pair of
ſtairs in a Bawdy-houſe, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
and equivolent, as thoſe of
Virtue, to arrive at the Temple
of Honour, and as Authentick,
being Licenſed by the <hi>Imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
of the Times. What ſhall I
ſay? why thus to ſuch, That
God hath blotted their Names
out of the number of thoſe that
ſhall poſſeſs Eternal Honour, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38441:34"/>
marvel they are not aſhamed to
let them remain in the Church-Regiſter,
ſo much to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of Chriſtianity; but where
ſhame's laid aſide, no wonder
they commit all manner of Sin
with Greedineſs and Glory in
their ſhame, brag of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries,
and would as fain
ſtifle the Repute of Holineſs, as
they have done the Checks of
their own Conſciences, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Men of their Parts and
Knowledge ſhould be preſcribed
Holineſs by any, nay, even by
God himſelf, being ſpiced with
that Pride that was in <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
and his fellow-aſpiring Angels,
that made the firſt Schiſm and
Separation in the pureſt Church,
even in Heaven it ſelf, among
the Angels that were wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
But let ſuch know, a Dram
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38441:34"/>
of Holineſs, is above a Talent
of Parts; a Drop of Grace,
above a Sea of Knowledge:
Though in Knowledge we are
ſaid to be as Angels of God,
yet in Holineſs, like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Therefore ſo much as God
is above an Angel, ſo much is
Holineſs above Knowledge, and
the more ſo, becauſe Knowledge
may be without Holineſs, but
never Holineſs without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
pluck therefore off the
Plumes of your Pride and Self-conceitedneſs,
the deplorable
Errour of moſt of our Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts,
and really is the Peſt
of the Church and Bane of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which is beſt preſerved
in Unity and Humility.</p>
            <p>Who then is Wife, and would

Eſtate flouriſh, let him purge
himſelf from Original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Actual Tranſgreſſion, by
Faith in the Blood of Chriſt:
Shame is the conſequent of Sin,
but Honour ever attends on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;
wherefore acquaint your
ſelves with the Ways of Chriſt,
follow his ſteps, walk as he walked,
ſtamping your Actions in
the Mint of Virtue,<note place="margin">He that Sails by the Star of Virtue, ſhall in time land himſelf upon the Shore of Honour.</note> your
Names ſhall be writ in
Heaven, and your Fame
be Current, if not in this
lower, in that upper Court of
Honour, and had in everlaſting
Memory, while others are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in Oblivion, yours ſhall
ſurvive even Poſterity. If Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be your Aim, and Holineſs
the Path that you tread towards
it, you ſhall then indeed be
right worſhipful, right honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38441:35"/>
when ſuch as by their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
purchaſe Titles, not by their
Virtues, ſhall be baſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble.</p>
