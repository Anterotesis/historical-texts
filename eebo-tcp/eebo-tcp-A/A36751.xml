            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe zeale of our duties at once unto His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Service, and the reliefe of our diſtreſſed Friends in <hi>Pontefract,</hi> being, by the bleſſing of God, ſeconded with ſucceſſes of happineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our greateſt hopes, I was commanded by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> to give unto your Highneſſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a particular Accompt of each occuring circumſtance in this our Expedition.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> we began our march from <hi>Banbury</hi> towards <hi>Daventry,</hi> where we had Intelligence of an uncertain number of Horſe and Foot that attended thereabouts with deſigne to affront Vs in our march, but Sir <hi>William Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> marching before Vs with his Horſe, was onely looked on by them at a good diſtance, and after the encounter of a little skitmiſhing, they perceiving the reſt of our Horſe advancing towards them, wheeled off in great diſorder, and Sir <hi>William Compton</hi> had the execution of them in their flight very neare <hi>Northampton</hi> Towne. Their particular loſſe in this defeat, I preſume your Highneſſe has already received account of at full from <hi>Banbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Monday the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we continued our March to <hi>Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> without any oppoſition or ſight of Enemy, but here we were certainly advertized of a conjunction made that night of all the Horſe of <hi>Leiceſter, Darby, Nottingham, Grantham, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Burleigh,</hi> and <hi>Rockingbam,</hi> aſſociated under the conduct of Colonell <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> (and then in preſent motion) drawn out, but upon what deſign, ſeverally reported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill the next day being <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 25. marching from <hi>Harborough</hi> towards <hi>Melton-Mowbray,</hi> we were at full aſſured; for approaching neare the Towne, we diſcovered ſome Horſe and Dragooners in it, and upon another paſſe of the ſame water in a faire Meade, about halfe a mile from the Towne, their main ſtrength (as we jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them) being neare 2000 in all, were drawn up to oppoſe us (as Sir <hi>Marm. Langdale</hi> did conceive) at the paſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109369:3"/>
a place of very great advantage, for which purpoſe he was inſtantly putting himſelfe into a poſture to endeavour to force the paſſe, but their eagerneſſe to fight ſaved us that labour; for by that time that we were well in order drawn up, and had gained the brow of the Hill on the South ſide of <hi>Melton,</hi> the Enemy was advanced through the Towne to meet us, and in a gallant fury gave us a bold charge upon the very ground cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by our ſelves to fight upon; the encounter continued hot and ſharp a good while, with ſeverall various appearances of ſucceſſe on both ſides; but at length they were wholly routed, many of their Commanders ſlaine, many hurt, and all the body ſcattered unto their ſeverall Garriſons, the fatigue of our long March, and the night intervening, prevented our very farre pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them in a ſtrange Country, but we ſlew upon the place neere 100, and took almoſt ſo many Priſoners and foure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Horſe. The loſſe we ſuſtained was ſmall, only Sir <hi>Iohn Girlington</hi> and Captain <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> two gallant Gentlemen, both ſlaine in the firſt charge, and ſome few wounded. One Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hacker</hi> held a Garriſon for the Rebels at Sir <hi>Eraſmus de la Fountains</hi> houſe in <hi>Kirby,</hi> within a mile of the place we fought upon, who being with his Horſe and Drogooners totally rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this battaile, went back in deſpaire to his Garriſon and burnt it, and then fled with ſuch as would follow him, being but two in all, in the night to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> a common Parliament practice, to ſet a Houſe on fire, and then to runne away by the light of it. The purſuit of the Enemy being done, and the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the field gathered by our men, wherein was good ſtore both of Horſe-mens Armes and Muskets.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Marm. Langdale</hi> rallying all his Troops together again in order, continued his March that night beyond <hi>Belvoir</hi> Caſtle, and the next day, being <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 26, we advanced foure miles beyond <hi>Newark,</hi> at which time the Enemy with ſome Foot from <hi>Lincoln, Welbeck,</hi> and ſome other adjacent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and with eight Regiments of Horſe, and one of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners had beſiedged <hi>Norwell</hi> Houſe, a Garriſon holden by <hi>Newark</hi> Forces ſome miles from the Town. But having gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned intelligence of our advance and ſucceſſe had againſt <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter,</hi> (their admired Champion) they inſtantly deſerted the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109369:3"/>
attempt, and retreated in great diſorder unto <hi>Retford,</hi> from whence the night following they fled in as much feare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction unto <hi>Doncaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Thurſday the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the Governour of <hi>Newark</hi> aſſiſted us with 400 Foot and about 400 Horſe under the Conduct of his Lievtenant-Governour, which joyned to us, we marched that night beyond <hi>Tuxford,</hi> not diſturbed either in march or Quarters by any Enemy, and the next day being Friday the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, we advanced towards <hi>Doncaſter;</hi> about <hi>Roſſinton</hi>-Bridge ſome three miles from the Towne, our Forlorne Parties diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ſome appearance of an Enemy, but ſtill as we approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our body they retreated, this night we expected they would have diſputed our paſſage over the River <hi>Dun,</hi> but they onely made a <hi>bon-mine</hi> there, and left us the Towne of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> to Quarter in that night.</p>
            <p>The next morning, being Saturday the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> we drew early into the field, where immediately Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> put the Army into the poſture of Battaile he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to fight in, and prepared the Souldier with a knowledge of ſuch difficulties as they ſhould expect this day to encounter with, and therefore to goe armed with the conſtancy of undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reſolutions, it being a buſineſſe that was at firſt no leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to undertake, then it was now deſperate to decline; The newes was entertained by a welcome from the Souldiers that eccho'd out aloud their joyfull acclamations. This prophetick Omen preſaging clearly the happy conſequence of their enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Victory.</p>
            <p>We marched without ſight of Enemy, till we came neare <hi>Wentbrigge,</hi> above three miles ſhort of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> where about 1000 Horſe, and 500 Dragooners of the Enemies, attended that place, as much as poſſibly they could, to impede the ſpeed of our courſe that way, but without much danger in the diſpute, we forc'd the Paſſe, but yet they ſo retarded our march, as the beſiegers had gain'd time to be all drawne together both Horſe and Foot in order, being in number about 2500 Foot, and neare 4000 Horſe and Dragoones, all the ſtrength of <hi>Engliſh</hi> that poſſibly the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> could draw together in the <hi>North,</hi> excepting the Forces that <hi>Meldrum</hi> lay withall before <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109369:4"/>
and Sir <hi>John Savile</hi> before <hi>Sandal,</hi> which he himſelfe in Perſon came this morning unto them, with two Regiments of Horſe, and 500 Commanded Muſqueteers.</p>
            <p>Betwixt foure and five in the afternoone, we gained the Top of the Hill over againſt the Caſtle, their Army ſtanding all drawne up in the bottome, and now me thought we view'd them with the fancy of that great Captaine when he firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered Elephants, <hi>Tandem par animis periculum video,</hi> a good advantage was it to us, that our Forlorne Parties, ſeconded with ſeverall Diviſions of our Horſe, had beaten in that great Body of their Van-currier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in ſuch diſorder into their Main Battaile, as taking that opportunity with a continued charge, this had not time to recover themſelves into any ſetled order, and though the ſuddaineſſe of the Action gave not leave for each Diviſion of our Horſe to obſerve its proper time and place of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall orders to Charge in, yet in the whole it was ſo fully done, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that there was not one Body of them all, but did foure or five ſeverall times that day act their parts with very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Execution.</p>
            <p>The Fight continued without a cleare Victory, at the leaſt three houres, untill there was not left on our Party ſtanding in order to Charge withall, more then three ſmall Bodies, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of above 120 in each Body, which with ſome Officers and Gentlemen together rally'd, gave a ſeaſonable Charge to the laſt of the Enemies ſtrength, the Caſtle at the ſame inſtant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a gallant Sally of 200 Muſqueteers, who fell in the Reare of the Enemies Foot, our owne Foot firing upon them at the ſame time in their Flanck, and this totally cleared the Field. We followed the Execution ſixe or ſeven miles three ſeverall wayes, as the Enemy fled; A ſhort time (with a Reſerve of Foot, and <hi>Morgans</hi> Dragooners, and one peece of Cannon) they endeavoured to defend the Paſſe at <hi>Ferrybrigge,</hi> but were ſoon beaten off, loſt their Cannon, and in the purſuit their Carriages, with 34 double Barrells of Powder, and a proportionable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Match and Bullet, and much other ſpoyle. There were ſlaine about 300 upon the place, and many drowned in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which water they took as nimbly as if it had been their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Element, as yet we have not had time to fiſh for them:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109369:4"/>
betwixt 7 and 800 Priſoners, of which 44 Officers of quality, 22 Colours of Foot, being all they had there, and not one eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with their Armes, and 26 Standarts of Horſe, many of their chiefe Officers both of Horſe and Foot ſlain, as Colonel <hi>Armyn,</hi> Colonel <hi>Thornton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Malevary,</hi> and many more, whoſe names I have not, all the Foot Armes we took, to the number of 2500 at the leaſt, and many Horſe Armes. <hi>Te Deum Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus. Non nobis, Domine, non nobis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One remarkable circumſtance I cannot omit to acquaint your Highneſſe with; They had ſome few dayes before given out, that they would take the Caſtle with a Stratagem, which ſhould be thus: They would make as if reliefe were comming to it, and ſo they would ſeem to draw all off, as to fight the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, (leaving onely an Ambuſcada in the Towne) and then they would skirmiſh together, and ſeem defeated by the Relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſo retreat diſorderly as beaten, in expectation the Caſtle ſhould make a Sally, and then their Ambuſcada ſhould ſurpriſe it; But I hope they were now taught the danger of jeſting with edg'd Tooles, and will hereafter leave ſuch mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At our firſt advance into the Country, it was generally reported, that your Highneſſe was come in Perſon, which ſtruck a great terrour into the Enemy and Courage into our Souldiers, as had your Highneſſe tranſmitted ſome of your Royall Spirit into their hearts, and your active ſtrength into their Armes, ſcorning to be guilty of any Act that they ſhould have had cauſe to have bluſht, had your Highneſſe looked on.</p>
            <p>About two of the clock in the morning, all parties that had been in purſuit of the Enemy being returned, we drew into Quarters to refreſh, and about eight of the clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on Sunday the ſecond of <hi>March,</hi> Sir <hi>Marm. Langdale</hi> ſent parties out into the Country, which brought in plenty of all ſorts of proviſions for the Caſtle, and then appoynted a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous the next morning. In the interim he was advertiſed that <hi>Roſſiter</hi> with all his broken Troops rallyed, and others joyned to them, and 300 Dragooners, was come to <hi>Doncaſter</hi> with intention to joyne with <hi>Fairfax,</hi> whereupon we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly Marched towards them, but they having ſecured the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109369:5"/>
