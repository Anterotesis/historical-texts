            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Da. And I sawe that the beast was slayn and hys body destroid and casten out to be burned, and the powr of the other beastes taken awaye, and the tymes of theyr lyues were sette them vnto tyme and tyme.

But not so that theraftyr there shuldbe no more Kyngdoms and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For GOD wyll haue Kyngdoms and imperies styll to stande, gouerners to rule, comon weales to be serued, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be executed, good men to be defended, euyll to be punisshed but so that they do not althynges as they liste, as dyd the. iiij. beastes whiche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fered ne regarged GOD ne man but he wyll rather they beleue in Christe hym to obaye, wyth hys words to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe &amp; theraftyr to gouerne theyr sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectis y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them selues myght knowe also, and to shewe them selues to haue a lorde in heuen.

And the other beastes had then also lost theyr hyghe empyres, and skant retained they any myserable remembrance of their former maiestie whiche because they reiected Christe, they also loste their glorie. For in all the hole worlde was there not a corner in whiche the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and empyres at that tyme when Rome fyll, were not eyther vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe or sewerly meruerlously chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

For this minyshed not the maiestie and empire of Christ, but made them mo re clear, when a lytle aftyr he shuld come with great glorye, and these rebellis pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe with euerlastyng torments: Euen as hym selfe testified by this most apt si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.

And his cytezens (which may<note place="margin">Luc. xix.</note> not be vnderstande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of them whiche some tyme before beleued) hated hym, and sent a message after hym, saynge. We wyll not haue thys man to reigne ouer vs &amp;ee. But he returned at last, said, these myne enimies whiche wyll not haue me raigne ouer them brynge them hyther and slaye them before me. The Kyngdom of Chryst therfore which we praye dayly to come vnto vs euen hys worde wherin he raygneth by fayth, loue and innocency of lyuynge, and

But beware lest any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, Daniel in this place to speke of the laste iugement. For here it is iuged secretely and partyclarely of the .iiij. bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.

And to be short, there is nothing in this place of Daniel that thou maist wreste vnto the last iugment, except thou woldest obscure and depraue the hole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Da. I went to one of the bystan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders asking him the trwthe of all these thinges, whiche interpreted to me these thinges saing. These. iiij. beastis, be iiij.

And the most hyghe faythfull of God, shall receyue and obtayne their Kingdome for euer and euer. Osi. That is the former Dominacyon of Rome ended, not only Christe, but his faythfull with hym shall reygne, for the godheyt of Christe once declared by the preachyng of the Gospell, and throwing downe of the olde Idolatry, there began Christen magistratis to rule, and thence forth all imperies were holden to obeye hym. Also sith Christ wolde raygne not

by violence and weape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by hys word and holy ghoost, hym self then not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge presentely, but only by hys holye faythfull, it followeth these faythfull to raygne with Christe, because they teache and interprete the word and wyl of god, wherfor he sayd. Who so heare you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me, and who so despyse you, despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me. Wherfore whatsoeuer any one of the leaste of the very faythfull shall teache by Christes worde, &amp; hys spirite, shall commaunde or forbydde, euen the same also ought not the hygh monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the worlde more to contempne or transgresse, then yf Christ hym selfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently hath commaunded it them in hys owne persone. And except they obeye it, doutles they shall suffer therfore, other her, or to come. Note also that Daniel cal leth the holy faythfull, the most highe (for so is it in the hebrwe) as thoughe he wold saye, I speke not of euery called ho ly one, but of the very holy heuenly whiche be sanctifyed wyth the word and spyryte of Christe, for there be some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ons in a certayne externe chosen ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, because they be shauen, anointed,

Osi. There may noman blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the worde but the same blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth also the name of God.

The pope therfor blasphemeth the name of God.

So great is the might &amp; powr of the lyes, of the iuglings, of the false coulored doctrine, of the false mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and of the ipocrisye of the popedom that euen the very holy faithful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal seme to be ouercomen and taken for here tiques when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pope so dampneth &amp; decla reth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

he blasphemeth non euill men, as the self thing witnesseth it, but onely the good and the very trwe churche, euen Gods holy faithfull, we ought to ioye &amp; reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se when we be thus blasphemed of him.
