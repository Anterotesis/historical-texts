         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Hue and Cry
AFTER THE
FALSE PROPHETS
AND
DECEIVERS
Of Our Age;
AND
A DISCOVERY of them by their <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi>
and who they <hi>are</hi> in this Age that follow the same
<hi>spirit,</hi> and act the same <hi>things as</hi> did the <hi>false Prophets</hi> in former <hi>Generations.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOrasmuch as in the World at this day, and through all
Christian Nations, there is a great Cry concerning <hi>false
Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> each one sort and sect of people
accusing and charging the Teachers and Ministers that
are of others, and not of their way, to be <hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>false
Prophets.</hi> Thus the <hi>Papists</hi> cry against the <hi>Protestant Ministers,</hi>
and the <hi>Protestant Ministers</hi> do the like by the <hi>Papists,</hi> each <hi>one
sort</hi> of people cryes the like against the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the
<hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without all controversie, there are in the Christian
World (so called) and in these Kingdoms many <hi>false Prophets</hi>
and <hi>Deceivers</hi> even at this day, and hath been for many Ages,
since the dayes of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> And the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi>
and <hi>multitudes</hi> have been <hi>deceived</hi> into the way of <hi>Error</hi> through
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46083:2"/>
the means of the <hi>Deceivers,</hi> who have done much hurt in the
world by their <hi>Divinations</hi> and <hi>Antichristian wayes</hi> that they
have walked in; But though it is acknowledged by all sorts of
Christians, That there are and have been many <hi>Deceivers</hi> and
<hi>false Prophets,</hi> yet the great Controversie is at this day, who are
the <hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>false Prophets?</hi> seeing (as I have said) that
every sort of men are accusing others to be such. But now it
remains to be sought out [and that carefully by all] who are the
<hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>false Prophets;</hi> whether <hi>Papist</hi> Ministers, or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
Ministers, or whether any <hi>others;</hi> and who such are in
this day.</p>
            <p>Now therefore for this very end, that it may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
unto all, who the <hi>Deceivers</hi> are, and that they may be <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from,</hi> and their wayes <hi>eschewed</hi> by all people: Thus I try
them, and bring them to right and true Judgment, and shall
not charge and <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Protestants,</hi> or any others, by their
<hi>Name,</hi> or because of their <hi>Name</hi> that therefore they are <hi>Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi>
But seeing that all sorts of Christians do profess the
<hi>Scriptures;</hi> and that they own them, Therefore according to
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by the Spirit of God, I shall lay both <hi>Papists</hi>
and <hi>Protestants,</hi> and <hi>all others,</hi> to the Line of Judgment, by the
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gave them; and if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Protestants,</hi> or whose <hi>Ministers</hi> soever come under the
Judgment of that Rule, they shall be concluded by the Rule
of <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to be <hi>false Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Deceivers:</hi> Therefore come out <hi>Papists, Protestants, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Quakers,</hi> and all others, come forth and hear your <hi>Tryal,</hi>
and receive your <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all, it is concluded (and that I hope by all reasonable
men) That whosoever they are at this day through the world,
whether <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> (so called) or whoever, that shall
be found walking by the same spirit, and in the same wayes,
and doing the same things that the <hi>false Prophets</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> did in
the dayes of old, and that the <hi>false Brethren</hi> and <hi>false Teachers</hi>
among the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Apostles dayes</hi> walked
in and followed, such may at this day be adjudged, deemed,
and taken to be <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>false Teachers, Deceivers</hi> and
<hi>Seducers,</hi> and this without respect to any <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46083:2"/>
that they bear in their Religion. And this is the Rule of
<hi>Tryal</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> in which I may justly and righteously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>1. They were <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers</hi> in the dayes of
the <hi>true Prophets,</hi> Isa. 56. 11. <hi>That were greedy dumb Dogs,
which could never have enough; and that sought every one of them
for their gain from their quarter; and that preached for Hire, and
divined for Money,</hi> Mic. 3. 11. <hi>The Priests that taught for Hire,
and the Prophets that divined for Money,</hi> against such as these
<hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> cryed, and that by the Spirit of the Lord,
being commanded of Him so to do.</p>
            <p>Now whosoever, whether <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi> of any sort,
<hi>Independents, Presbyterians, Quakers,</hi> or any other, that have a
<hi>Quarter</hi> from which they seek their <hi>Gain</hi> for <hi>Preaching,</hi> and
teach for <hi>Hire,</hi> and have Hire for Teaching, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Tythes or
Sums of Money, and <hi>divines</hi> for Money; such, whatsoever
they be, without respect of their <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Professions,</hi> walk by
the same spirit, and in the same way, and do the same things
as the <hi>false Prophets</hi> did, and are <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers:</hi>
And therefore all People, it is left to the Witness of God in
your Consciences, and that you may give witness in this Case,
who are they now, and where they are that can never have
enough, but are greedy after <hi>gain</hi> and covetous, and that seek
for Gain from their Quarters, or <hi>Portions</hi> of a <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>City,</hi>
And where are they now? and who is it that preach for Hire,
and divine for Money, that take so much Money or Gifts by
the <hi>Year</hi> or <hi>Month</hi> for Preaching? Who is it, or, who are they
now that walk in these wayes? S<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>, whoever they be, whether
<hi>Papists, Protestants, Sectaries</hi> (so called) are <hi>false Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Deceivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>They were</hi> false Prophets <hi>and</hi> Deceivers, that stood not in
the Counsel of the Lord, and that did not turn People from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
and evil wayes, but spake a Vision of their own hearts, and
not from the mouth of the Lord; And that cryed Peace to them
that walked wickedly, and prophesied lyes, and used their tongues,
and said, the Lord saith it, when as the Lord had not spoken to
them; and that seduced the people by crying Peace, when there was
no Peace; and saw Vanity, and spoke Vanity and Lyes in the dayes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46083:3"/>
of the true Prophets: <hi>I say, such were</hi> false Prophets <hi>and</hi> Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p>Now whosoever, whether <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants,</hi> or any <hi>others</hi>
that do not stand in the Counsel of God, and that do not turn
People from their Iniquities and their evil wayes; but speak
a Vision of their own hearts, and not from the mouth of the
Lord; and that cry Peace to them that walk wickedly, that
prophesie lyes and use their tongues, when the Lord hath not
spoken to them; And that seduce <hi>People</hi> by crying <hi>Peace,</hi> when
there is <hi>no Peace;</hi> and that builds the wall, and daubs it with
untempered mortar, and that do not profit the People at all,
but cause them to erre; Such are <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers</hi>
at this day, wheresoever and whosoever (without respect of
Name or Title in their Profession) Such now walk by the spirit
of the <hi>false Prophets,</hi> and are in the way of the <hi>Deceivers,</hi> which
the Lord sent true Prophets to cry against.</p>
            <p>And now to all People, of what Name soever, it is left to
the Witness of God in you all to give witness, who they are
now, and where they are that are guilty hereof. Who is it
now that stand not in the Counsel of God, and that do not turn
People form their Iniquities, that do not convert them to God
by their preaching, But speak what they have studied for, even
a <hi>Divination</hi> of their own Brain, and not what they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God; and that use their tongues, and take other
mens words, the words of Christ, the Prophets and Apostles;
when as they have not the same Spirit of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
Nor have they heard the Voice of God speaking to them,
But take <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and say, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord,</hi>
when the Lord <hi>never spoke to them,</hi> nor <hi>sent them.</hi> Who is it
now, and where are they that are guilty hereof? and that cry
<hi>Peace</hi> to the Wicked, when the Lord speaks <hi>no Peace</hi> to them;
and that are light vain persons, and covetous and greedy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that see Vanity and daub with untempered mortar;
that cry Peace unto people, and say they shall have Peace by
Christ, while yet they kill Christ, and are not changed by Him.
Where are there such now, by whom people are not converted
to God, although they preach time after time? Let all people
bring in their Witness; For whosoever are such at this day,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46083:3"/>
whether they be <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants, Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi>
(so called) or whosoever, Such (I say) are led by the spirit of
the <hi>false Prophets,</hi> and are in their way and practices, and all
such are to be judged, deemed and taken for <hi>Antichrists Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> without respect of Persons
or Titles of Religion.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They were</hi> false Brethren <hi>and</hi> false Teachers, that taught
for filthy lucre; that professed they knew God in words, and in works
denied him; being abominable and disobedient, and to every good
work reprobate; Who had a Form of Godliness, but denied the
Power; and were heady and high-minded men, and lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
more than lovers of God; that were ever teaching, and never
able to bring people to the knowledge of the Truth. <hi>And such were</hi>
false Prophets <hi>and</hi> false Teachers, <hi>that</hi> through Covetousness and
feigned words, did make merchandize of people; that beguiled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
souls, and that had hearts exercised with covetous practices;
being out of the right way, and following the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who
loved the wages of unrighteousness. <hi>These, and such as these,
were</hi> Deceivers <hi>and</hi> false Teachers <hi>in the Apostles dayes,</hi> Tit.
1. 11. 2 Tim. 3. 5, 7. 2 Pet. 2. <hi>chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whosoever, whether <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants,</hi> or of what
sect soever they be that do these things, that teach for
<hi>filthy lucre;</hi> that profess God in words, but in works deny him;
and that live wickedly, and are disobedient to God; and have
the <hi>form</hi> of Godliness, but want the <hi>power;</hi> and are heady and
high-minded men, and love pleasures; under whom people
are ever learning, but not able to come to the knowledge of
the Truth; and that through Covetousness and feigned words
make merchandize of people; that are unstable men, and do
exercise themselves in covetous practices; and are not in the
right way, but do follow the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
wages. Whosoever are such, whether they be <hi>Papists</hi>
or <hi>Protestants,</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> or <hi>whomsoever</hi> they be, they follow
the spirit of the <hi>false Prophets,</hi> and are in the way of the <hi>false
Teachers,</hi> and are <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> even <hi>false Prophets</hi>
and <hi>Deceivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to all people whatsoever I appeal for Evidence to
the Witness of God in your Consciences, that you may judge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46083:4"/>
in this case; Where are they now, and who is it? Are there
not some such present amongst you this day in your <hi>Cities</hi> and
<hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>Countries,</hi> even such as teach for filthy lucre; that
will preach were they can get gain for preaching, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
and that profess God and Christ with their lips, and shew
much love, but deny God in works; who live unholy lives,
and in evil wayes, and give bad Examples to people, and that
are reprobate to good works; and that have the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
but not the power; and that are heady and high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ambitious persons; and that are teaching many years
together, and people cannot come to the knowledge of the
Truth by them, but are alwayes ignorant and wicked. And
do not your Teachers exercise covetous practices among you,
and go in the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> for Gifts and Rewards (<hi>viz.</hi>) so
much for a Sermon, and for a years Preaching: Such who are
made Ministers by man, and not by the Lord, and who do not
profit the people at all: Whosoever they are that are such
[now in this Age] are <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and follow
the spirit, and walk in the steps of the <hi>Deceivers</hi> of <hi>old;</hi> and
whosoever they are, whether <hi>Papists, Protestants,</hi> or any others,
they may lawfully be taken, judged and deemed to be <hi>false
Prophets,</hi> Ministers of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>Deceivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>The</hi> false Prophets <hi>and</hi> Deceivers <hi>in the dayes of old, were</hi>
feigning and flattering men, and cryed Peace to the wicked, and
cryed Peace, peace, to every one that put into their mouthes; but
prepared War against every one that did not, <hi>Mica.</hi> 3. 5. And
they respected mens persons, and held mens persons in Admiration
because of Advantage, <hi>Jude</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Now whosoever, whether <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> or any else,
that are <hi>feigners</hi> and <hi>flatterers,</hi> and that cry peace to the wicked,
and cry peace to them that put into their mouthes; but are
bitter and angry and perverse against such as will not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give them Hire and Money for preaching; and that respect
mens persons, and turn every way from one kind of Worship
to another; and have mens persons in admiration for their
own gain and advantage. Whoever are such now in this Age,
are <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all people, bring in your Evidence; who are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46083:4"/>
such now? and where are they that are flattering men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
cry Peace to all that will give them means and put into their
mouthes, and that admire the persons of great men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the persons of great men for advantage; If there be any
such now amongst you, whether they be <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants,
Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called) you may justly take such,
and let such be deemed, judged and reputed <hi>false Prophets,
Seducers</hi> and Ministers of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now all people upon Earth, <hi>try, learn</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> your
<hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> lay them to the Line of Judgement:
For if they are such as are here described, if they bear these
Marks and Fruits declared, and if they follow the same spirit,
and do as the <hi>false Prophets</hi> of old did, according as 'tis decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then may you justly judge them to be
<hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>false Prophets,</hi> and Ministers of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> For
whosoever they be that are amongst you, as preach for <hi>hire,</hi> and
that have a Quarter from whence they seek their <hi>Gain,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
for Money, and go a preaching for Gifts and Rewards,
and that teach for <hi>filthy lucre;</hi> and that are covetous persons,
heady and high-minded persons, and ambitious men, that do
not profit the people at all, nor turn them from sin by their
preaching; and that prophesie lyes, and that are flatterers and
changeable persons, and will turn from one way to another,
and have mens persons in admiration because of advantage.
Whosoever he be that is one of these above described, who
hath these marks and signs upon him, of this <hi>Physiognomy,</hi> of
this <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Feature</hi> as before described; wheresoever such
a one shall be found, or whensoever you see him, or meet with
him; or if such a one be amongst you, or pass by you, let him
be <hi>suspected, taken, deemed</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> for a <hi>false Prophet</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi>
without respect of his Name and Title in his Profession
of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, Christ Jesus prophesied and said,</hi> That Deceivers and
false Prophets should come, who should have the sheeps cloathing, but
inwardly ravening wolves: <hi>And</hi> Iohn <hi>said,</hi> the false Prophets were
already come into the world [<hi>in his dayes</hi>] even the false Prophets
and Antichrist; whom Christ said should come; <hi>And the</hi> false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46083:5"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Deceivers <hi>that Christ said</hi> should come, <hi>John saw</hi> were
come into the world <hi>in his dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, who is it, and where are they <hi>that are wolves in sheeps
cloathing,</hi> that are <hi>those Antichrists</hi> that Christ said <hi>should come;</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> said <hi>were come?</hi> Even such are they that have the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
(viz.) <hi>Christ's words,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles words,</hi> and the <hi>Saints
practices;</hi> they have the <hi>sheeps cloathing,</hi> but <hi>inwardly</hi> are the
<hi>wolves</hi> in the evil nature; and their evil nature is covered
with the Saints words and practices; and such are the wolves
in sheeps cloathing, that have the outside of the sheep, but
want the Nature of Christ, and are in the contrary nature.</p>
            <p>And to all people that are upon the Earth I do appeal, and
ask, where are they that are such now? and, who are they?
whether they be <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants,</hi> or whomsoever else that
are such, that have the outside, the sheeps cloathing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
are wolves of a devouring nature; such are they that
Christ said should come, and <hi>Iohn</hi> saw was come; And such
are Ministers of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whosoever they are, and such are
in the world, and have overspread it since the Apostles dayes:
and whole Christendom hath been <hi>deceived</hi> by such <hi>Wolves</hi> in
<hi>Sheeps cloathing,</hi> even by such as have got the <hi>Outside,</hi> the
<hi>Saints words</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> but wanted the <hi>Life,</hi> and have been
in the <hi>Evil Nature,</hi> and not in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>CHRIST
IESUS:</hi> And such now in this Age, are to be taken, judged
and deemed <hi>false Prophets</hi> and <hi>Deceivers, Wolves</hi> in <hi>Sheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
and Ministers of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
