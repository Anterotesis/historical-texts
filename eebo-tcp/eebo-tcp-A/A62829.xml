            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat the ſaid Sir Peter Vanlore did in his life-time ſettle the Caſtle and Parkes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes in Wilts worth 600 <hi>l.</hi> yearly; and the fifth part of divers other his Mannors and Lands worth yearly 2500 <hi>l.</hi> upon the ſaid Lady <hi>Powel,</hi> and the Heires of her body: And for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of ſuch iſſue, the reverſion of the ſaid Caſtle and Parks to his own right Heirs; which your Petitioners the ſaid Counteſs of <hi>Sterling,</hi> Dame <hi>Suſan,</hi> and <hi>Jacoba</hi> are, and entayled the fifth part of the ſaid other Mannors and Lands upon all your Petitioners his Grandchildren, and ſome others his Grandchildren by name, and ſo dyed; and the ſaid Lady <hi>Powel</hi> upon the ſixth day of <hi>October</hi> 1651 died without iſſue; and your Petitioners are thereby become lawfully entituled to the ſaid Caſtle, Manners, and lands, according to the ſettlement of the ſaid Sir <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 That by reaſon of ſome implacable differences between the ſaid Sir <hi>Edw. Powel,</hi> and the ſaid Lady, they lived apart for about 15 years together before her death; and one <hi>Thomas Levingston</hi> a Lawyer (who marryed <hi>Anne Caeſar</hi> one of the Grandchildren of the ſaid Sir <hi>Peter Vanloore)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived by the ſaid lady to take part with the ſaid Sir <hi>Edw. Powel</hi> againſt her, the ſaid lady <hi>Powel,</hi> became much diſaffected to, and diſpleaſed with the ſaid <hi>Tho. Levingston,</hi> and his wife.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the ſaid lady about <hi>Septem.</hi> 1651. being dangerouſly ſick (of the ſickneſs whereof ſhe ſoon after died) at a houſe in <hi>Chelſey,</hi> where ſhe had long lived ſole and ſeparate; and the ſaid Sir <hi>Edw. Powel,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Levingston</hi> &amp; his wife, knowing the ſaid lady had a great eſtate at her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe (ſome with, and ſome without the conſent of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> which they contrived to gain unto themſelves by ſeveral ſtrange unlawful practiſes) they, together with one <hi>Wil. Hinſon</hi> another Lawyer, and a Juſtice of Peace of Middleſex, and neer kinſman of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> (and to whom, as 'tis commonly reported, he hath given all his eſtate, and diſinherited his own Brother and Heir) with divers other their kinred, ſervants, and confederates, did about the 7 day of the ſame <hi>Septem.</hi> (according to a Complot betwixt them) forcibly enter into the ſaid houſe at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> wherein the ſaid Lady <hi>Powel</hi> then lay dying; [and to which the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had no Title;] and guarded and ſecured the ſame with armed men, cauſed all the Ladies ſervants to be preſently arreſted and violently taken away by one <hi>Thomas Crook</hi> then Under Sheriff of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> [whom they brought with them] and to be impriſoned without Bayl, upon falſ &amp; feigned Actions of many thouſand pounds, which they never proſecuted, but became non-ſuit therein; and with Guards of armed and diſſolute men they chained up the Doors of the ſaid Houſe, and in Warlike manner kept it and the neereſt friends and kindred of the ſaid Lady from her untill ſhe died, engaging their Confederates to ſecreſie and fidelity by Rings of Gold given to them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57954:2"/>
with this Motto inſcribed, <hi>viz. (Never to be forgotten or requited)</hi> and diſcharged the ſaid Lady <hi>Powels</hi> Apothecary for but delivering a civil Meſſage from ſome of her friends, and placed a new Phyſitian of their own engagement, and ſtrange ſervants (whom the Lady knew not, and againſt her wil) to attend her in her laſt ſickneſs; and fearing leaſt the ſaid Lady ſhould make any diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their wicked doings from her chamber window (which open'd into a neighbors ground adjoyning) they forbade that Neighbour, to permit any of the ſaid Ladies friends to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, or ſtand near the houſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That having thus by force and practice ſecluded all but themſelves, they (upon the 18 day of the ſame <hi>Septemb.)</hi> brought Judge <hi>Warburton</hi> (who knew not the Lady <hi>Powel)</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> unto the ſaid houſe at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> then chained up and kept guarded; and then, and there procured the ſaid Lady (as the ſaid Judge certifies) to levy ſeveral Fines of the ſaid Caſtle, Parks, Mannors and lands, unto one <hi>Anthony Baſſet;</hi> which Fines (as the ſaid Complotters affirm) were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome Writings, which ſhe ſhortly after ſealed to the uſe of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward Powel, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton,</hi> and his wife: And the ſaid <hi>Lady Powel</hi> did about that time alſo (as they pretend) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a great perſonal Eſtate (which was your Petitioners ſaid Grandfathers) to the ſaid <hi>Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and his wife; although the ſaid <hi>Lady</hi> utterly deteſted them as perſons of a moſt evill and dangerous converſation, and oft times hath been heard to wiſh the ſaid <hi>Anne Levingſton</hi> were not of her kinred.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That the ſaid Confederates ſuſpecting [as they had cauſe] the ſudden death of the ſaid <hi>Lady Powel</hi> [who died thus impriſoned upon the 6 day of <hi>Octob.</hi> following] might render all their plots and fines ineffectual; They by practice between one <hi>Gardiner</hi> an Attorney, and <hi>James Pickis</hi> a Curſiſtor, procured ſeveral Writs for paſſing the ſaid Fines to be made out antedated in Eaſter Term before, and made returnable in Trinity Term next after; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your Petitioners of all poſſibility of redreſs, cauſed the ſame Fines to inrolled of Record, as acknowledged and levyed in Trinity Term [four moneths before they were acknowledged, and contrary to the true intent of the Statute made in the 23 year of the Reign of the late <hi>Qu-Eliz:</hi> and the practice ſo dangerous [if admitted] as tendeth to the deceiving of all ſuch as ſhall purchaſe or deal for any lands, and to eſtabliſh wickedneſs by a law.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That yet doubting all theſe plots would not hold (wickedneſs filling them with fear of diſcovery) they procured a ſequeſtred Parſon to certifie under his hand, that the ſaid <hi>Lady Powel</hi> was reconciled to the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> and had received the Sacrament of the Supper, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a paper under the ſaid <hi>Ladies</hi> hand to ſignifie her well pleaſedneſs, although upon, or neer that very day that paper was ſubſcribed, the ſaid <hi>Lady Powel</hi> did publikeby rebuke the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> and affirm, That their plot was to diſinherit the right Heirs of the lands; but that ſhe would be torn in pieces with wild horſes before ſhe would do it. And the ſaid Certificates are things ſo altogether unuſual, and full of ſuſpition, that the Judges of the Common-pleas in diſlike thereof did publikely in open Court tell the ſaid <hi>Levingſton, that he had over-acted his part therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 That the Petitioners ſo ſoon as they poſſibly could, complained of the ſaid wrong to the Court of Common-pleas, where the chief Juſtice thereof did openly affirm, <hi>That he knew not what was force and fraud, if theſe Actions of the ſaid Confederates were not;</hi> and Judge <hi>Puliſton,</hi> and Judge <hi>Atkins,</hi> two of the other Judges, did alſo in open Court ſeveral times earneſtly expreſſe themſelves againſt the foulneſſe of the ſaid <hi>Levingſtons</hi> practice, in obtaining the ſaid Fines; but ſaid it was paſt their power to relieve your Petitioners, but there was a Parliament then ſitting that could, and they believed would relieve them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That your <hi>petitioners</hi> have for the ſpace of a year and half addreſt themſelves to the late Parliament for relief, which was ſo far ſenſible of the foulneſs of the Crime, That they cauſed it particularly to be excepted out of the Act of General pardon; but never found leiſure-time for the hearing thereof, or giving your <hi>petitioners</hi> relief, or to provide for prevention of like wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs for the future.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>petitioners</hi> believing, That God hath ſitted you with Spirits to relieve againſt Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to do and act righteouſneſs, Humbly beſeech you to vouchſafe a Hearing to your <hi>petitioners</hi> Complaint, and to afford them ſuch relief, That the ſaid Fines and Deeds (ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly obtained) may be produced and vacated, Offenders puniſhed, and like wickedneſs for the future by ſome good law prevented. And (as they now do) ſo they ſhall continue to pray that the Spirit of Wiſdom, Councel, and the fear of the Lord may reſt upon you, and abide with you, for his glory, the good of his people, eſtabliſhing Righteouſneſs in the Nation, that the Calamities thereof may ceaſe, when men of publike Spirits ſhall ſtand up that date and will do juſtice.</p>

            <head>SOME CONSIDERATIONS HUMBLY PROPOSED To the Worthy Members of Parliament, By <hi>Thomas Levingston</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife, and <hi>William Powel,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Hinſon</hi> Eſquire; <hi>concerning a Petition and Complainſt againſt them by</hi> John Blount, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>Counteſs of</hi> Sterling <hi>his Wife, and Others, now under conſideration before the honorable Committee for receiving</hi> PETITIONS.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, The matter in difference between the <hi>Plaintiffs,</hi> and theſe <hi>Defendants,</hi> is, onely the Title unto the Eſtate lately belonging unto the Lady <hi>Powel</hi> deceaſed, the <hi>Defendant Anne's</hi> Mothers Siſter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Complaint</hi> againſt the <hi>Defendants,</hi> is, That they did wickedly force the ſaid Lady <hi>Powel,</hi> by ſeveral evil practiſes uſed upon her, to ſettle her Eſtate upon her Neece (the <hi>Defendant Anne)</hi> and did cauſe a Fine to be antedated for the perfecting of the ſaid Settlement: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> deſire the ſaid Fine, and the <hi>Defendant Anne's</hi> Deeds to be produced and vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Force complained of hath been legally examined and tryed. For the Force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> is a pretended forcible Entry upon, and alſo a forcible Detainer of the Houſe of the ſaid Lady <hi>Powel,</hi> and that was legally tryed by a Jury upon the place where the force is ſuppoſed to be committed, and no force found.</p>
            <p>And the pretended antedating of the Writs for the Fine complained of, is no more then the antient uſual practiſe in levying Fines for many hundred years, when any ſettlement is made of any Eſtate in the vacation time. For the Writs muſt bear date in a Term, and cannot bear date in the ſucceeding Term, and therefore muſt bear date in a preceding Term. And in moſt of the aſſurances and ſettlements, made of any mens eſtates in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Fines</hi> acknowledged between the Terms, the Writs muſt bear date and be returnable the Terms foregoing; and if thoſe be not good in law, moſt mens Titles to their Eſtates are void; and if this were not admitted, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not make any perfect Conveyances and Aſſurances of their Eſtates by Fines in the vacation time.</p>
            <p>And as well the ſaid pretended force and antedating of the ſaid Writs, as all other the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed evil practiſes that the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> could then ſuggeſt were examined before the Judges (one of which took the ſaid Fine in a judicial way, the ſaid Lady acknowledging to him that ſhe did the ſame freely and willingly, and without conſtraint.) And upon the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> firſt reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full falſe ſuggeſtions, they gave rules to ſtop further proceedings upon the ſaid Fine. But upon full hearing of both Parties, with their Councel, gave their Judgement that the ſaid Fine ſhould be proceeded in, to be perfected, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſaid Complaint againſt the Defendants is irregular; For their Complaint ought now to be againſt that Court of Juſtice, who have examined and determined the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters complained of, and cauſed the Settlement complained againſt to be perfected, if they have done Injuſtice therein: and the parties ought not to be further vexed and moleſted, when their Cauſe is Legally heard and judged.</p>
            <p>But, if the ſuppoſed evill gaining a Title to the ſaid Eſtate by the Defendants be not fully examined, yet, it is both Examinable and Determinable in the ordinary Courts of Law and Equity; And many Settlements of ſeveral Eſtates by Fines and Deeds have been anulled and vacated upon ſufficient proof made, that they have been unduely gained or procured by evill practices.</p>
            <p>Yet the Honourable Committee for receiving of Petitions, onely upon hearing the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the Defendants, without their Anſwers or Defence, have required the Defendants Deeds and Evidences concerning the Defndants <hi>Annes</hi> Title to the ſaid Eſtate, to be produced,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57954:3"/>
which may be of very evil conſequence, that their Adverſary claiming the ſame Eſtate ſhould peruſe or be advertiſed of their Title before any Tryal be brought upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Defendants in all humility and ſubmiſſion offer it to conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether the Legiſlative Power, as Legiſlative can try the Matters in queſtion ſuggeſted againſt the Defendants.</p>
            <p>For if the Defendants have evilly and wickedly gained a pretended Title to the ſaid Eſtate, they have tranſgreſſed, either the common law, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25. <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </note> or the Statute law of the land, or elſe they have done contrary to the Rules of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <note place="margin">Romans 3. 20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of Sinne.</hi>
               </note> and equity.</p>
            <p>If either of the firſt, the Defendants puniſhment for <note place="margin">Romans 7. 7. <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law.</hi>
               </note> their offences, will be known by the laws they have broken; and it is onely the Juriſdictive power, as Juriſdictve, that can try the Defendants for thoſe offences. The buſineſs being no more then the Application of the laws in being to the offences done.</p>
            <p>If the Defendants have done the latter (that is) done contrary to a good conſcience, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equity, in gaining the ſaid Title, then that muſt be tried by the known Rules of Equity, known and practiſed in this Nation (For there cannot be a particular Equity that concerneth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants onely) And that cannot be within the limits of the legiſlative power, as legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when the work is onely to meaſure a Fact by the Rule already in being.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is humbly offered to be conſidered, Whether any Reaſons be offered by the Plaintiffs againſt the Defendants, why the legiſlative power, ſhould in an extraordinary way, ſhould take this particular Controverſie out of the hands of the Ordinary Courts of law, and Equity, when others of the ſame nature concerning Titles, unduly gained have been, and are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried, judged and determined by them</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether any Reaſons be offered by the Plaintiffs, why they are not relievable by the ordinary proceedings of law, and equity, if there be juſt cauſe for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Legiſlative power ſhall pleaſe in this Caſe to exerciſe the Jurisdictive power, (for otherwiſe they cannot take conuſance of it) <note n="*" place="margin">The wiſdom and care of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in their late conſtitution of the Committee for Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, provided againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Legiſlative power with the juriſdictive &amp; limited them to receive ſuch Petitions onely for the Parliament, as are proper to the legiſlative power, or not relievable elſewhere,</note> 'tis humbly offered to be conſidered, Whether it can concern them to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Defendant <hi>Annes</hi> Title to the ſaid Eſtate by the ſaid Fines and Deeds (as is now required by the ſaid Committee) before they have tried the Defendants for their ſuppoſed offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the undue gaining of the ſaid Fine and Deeds? For if the Defendants be not guilty of any ſuch offences, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be ſuppoſed to intermeddle with the Defendant <hi>Annes</hi> Deeds or Title.</p>
            <p>Now the Defendants being clear in their own conſciences from any wicked practice, plot, or combination, whereof they are falſly and maliciouſly accuſed by the means, occaſion, and procurement of one <hi>Crump,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Crompton,</hi> who was a mean menial ſervant unto the ſaid <hi>Lady Powels</hi> husband, and had indeavoured wickedly to ſeparate the ſaid <hi>Lady</hi> from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>husband to her diſhonour, and who ſtriveth and hopeth to gain a great perſonal Eſtate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſuggeſting many falſhoods againſt us the Defendants, and inciting others upon ſuch grounds to contend for the ſaid <hi>Lady Powels</hi> real Eſtate.</p>
            <p>We the Defendants upon the Conſiderations aforegoing humbly pray,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Either a diſmiſſion of the matters in queſtion, to the ordinary courſe of Juſtice and Equity.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Or otherwiſe if the Parliament pleaſe to take the Tryal of them unto themſelves, That the Defendants may be firſt legally tried in ſuch manner as the Parliament ſhall direct, for the offences whereof they are accuſed, before their Deeds and Title to the Eſtate in question be called for out of their hands,</hi>

            <head>AN ANSWER To a Printed Paper; Entituled, Some Conſiderations humbly propoſed to the worthy Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> by <hi>Thomas Levingſton</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife, and <hi>William Powel,</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>Hinſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> concerning a Petition and Complaint againſt them, by <hi>Mary,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and others; now under conſideration before the Honorable Committee for receiving Petitions.</head>
            <p>THe Complainants firſt obſerve, that the Defendants have very wiſely, for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, miſtated the Caſe of the Complainants; for they complain of a moſt notorious practice, of force, and fraud, to diſ-inherit them; And the Defendants in their Paper ſtate the Caſe as if the Complaint were onely of force; and to the fraud and practice anſwer not at all.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The true ſtate of the Caſe ſtands thus, and will be made good by theſe particulars:</head>
               <p>The Complainants ſay they complain of a diſ-inheriſon, done unto them, in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1651. of lands neer 1200 <hi>l.</hi> yearly value, and of a great perſonal eſtate gotten from them, by wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, upon the late Lady <hi>Powel,</hi> their fathers ſiſter, while ſhe lay dying, put in execution by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Levingſton,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his wife, <hi>William Hinſon,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edward Powel,</hi> ſince deceaſed, and divers others, their Confederates.</p>
               <p>They ſay that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw. Powel,</hi> and his Lady, had lived aſunder for 15 years before, in impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable differences, wherein the ſaid M. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> and his wife, and <hi>Wil. Hinſon,</hi> were conceived by the Lady, to take part with the ſaid ſir <hi>Edward</hi> againſt her; That ſir <hi>Edward</hi> and M. <hi>Hinſon</hi> were indebted to ſome [in truſt to be at the Ladies diſpoſe] the ſum of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> and that by an outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous force in the ſaid <hi>Septem.</hi> in the time of her laſt ſickneſs (whereof ſhe upon the 6. of <hi>Octob.</hi> next after died, in which moneth 2000 <hi>l.</hi> of the 8000 <hi>l.</hi> was payable) they by confederacy violently entred into the houſe where the ſaid Lady had long lived ſeparate, and then lay ſick, and to which the ſaid ſir <hi>Edward</hi> had no title (for 'twas bought with the Lady <hi>Vanlores</hi> money, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in truſt) arreſting and haling all her ſervants from her by one <hi>Crook</hi> then Under-Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex</hi> (whom they brought with them for that purpoſe) upon falſe and feigned Actions of many thouſand pounds, which they never proſecuted, but became non-ſuit in.</p>
               <p>That they chained &amp; bard up the doors of the ſaid houſe, &amp; kept it with guards of arm'd &amp; hired men, with granadoes, ſwords, guns, and piſtols, charged with bullet, and ordered to do executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; oblieging their confederates to fidelity, by Rings of Gold given them with this Motto, <hi>viz. (Never to be forgotten or requited)</hi> That they diſcharged the Ladies Apothecary, and violently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all her kindred, friends, and ſervants, that knew her many diſeaſes and infirmities, and would not admit them to ſight of her, ſaying, <hi>They ſhould never ſee her face more;</hi> nor did they, [being violently kept from her by the ſaid Force] That they placed upon her a new Phyſitian, and new ſervants of their own Engagement againſt her Will.</p>
               <p>That during this force they brought Iudge <hi>Warburton</hi> (who knew not the Lady <hi>Powel)</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Chelſey,</hi> to take ſeveral Fines of her. That they procured a ſtrange Miniſter (of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Levingſtons</hi> acquaintance [but unknown to the Lady <hi>Powel)</hi> to be aſſiſtant to them in theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and forbade the Doctor of the Pariſh, (an honeſt godly Divine] to come to the houſe, and though the Lady in her life-time deſired and appointed him to preach her Funeral Sermon, they forbade him to come to the Funeral, and appointed a guard of their Confederates in the force to keep him out of the Pulpit at the Funeral of the Lady (had he thither come) and to keep in that ſtranger Miniſter who preacht the Funeral Sermon, and then read ſome unuſual Writing in juſtification of the Confederates, That M. <hi>Hinſon</hi> then was, and ſtill is a Juſtice of Peace of that County, and he and Mrs. <hi>Levingſton</hi> were always preſent and very active in this force, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and directing all things of, and in order to it; and ſhe upon the remove of the Ladies ſervants, cryed out, <hi>The Plot hath taken, the Plot hath taken;</hi> and gave order to thoſe of the force,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57954:4"/>
                  <hi>That if Mr. Vandenbemde the Ladies kinſman did but go out of the houſe, to keep him out; for that then ſhe knew how to do her work;</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vanden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemde <hi>was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr.</hi> Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton <hi>a year before to be of this Plot, and to have ſhare of the benefit but he refuſed it.</hi>
                  </note> and therupon they got him out by a device ſuddenly contrived amongſt them, and ever after kept him out by the force; and neither he, nor any of the Ladies friends, kindred, neighbors, or ſervants ever after ſaw the Lady.</p>
               <p>The Complainants ſay this practice to gain the ſaid eſtate, was in the end compleated by 7 ſeveral Fines, pretended to be acknowledged by the ſaid Lady (upon the 18 day of the ſaid <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> during the ſaid force) and by confederacy with Clerks perfected in 11 dayes (all out of Term) and inrolled of Record neer 4 months, before themſelves confeſs them to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and by colour of ſeveral Writings pretended to be executed by the ſaid Lady during the ſaid force, a little before ſhe died, to the uſe of Sr <hi>Edw. Powel,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> whom ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſted.</p>
               <p>And they ſay that Mrs. <hi>Levingſton</hi> endeavoured to gain the ſaid Eſtate by ſeveral other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent wicked practices; to the amazement of ſuch as heard the Evidence of them before the Honourable Committee for Petitions.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Anſwers to</hi> Mr Levingſton<hi>'s Objections in the ſaid printed Paper contained.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS to the Defendants pretence that the force was not found by the Jury upon the place, it is truth, that upon an Indictment of forcible entry, grounded upon the Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Jury did not upon the Evidence then given find a forcible entry within that Statute; but the <hi>Defendants</hi> themſelves well know, and their Councel did then confeſs, <hi>that a foul force was fully proved; but the title of the houſe in Chelſey into which they riotouſly entred was not then proved to be in any of the Proſecutors, by reaſon that the Deed of the Title to the houſe could not then be had (but it is ſince found) and the want of that Deed, at that time, was the onely cauſe why the forcible entry within that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was not found; although a foul force otherwiſe was fully proved, and by themſelves could not be denied, and is ſince alſo found by Verdict againſt the ſaid Confederates in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Bench before the Lord chief Juſtice</hi> Roll.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Petitioners</hi> complain not onely of antidating Writs, (which the printed <hi>Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi> of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 9 diſallowes) but of making the Fines (ſuppoſed to be acknowledged the 18. of <hi>September) Records of Trinity Term</hi> (neer four Months before the acknowledgment of them, to prevent the <hi>Petitioners</hi> of all relief in any <hi>inferior Court.</hi> And the firſt of the <hi>Proclamations</hi> upon the ſaid Fines is entred upon <hi>Record</hi> as made of <hi>Trinity Term</hi> alſo, againſt all truth and ſenſe, and contrary to the Act of <hi>Parl</hi> made 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. for bar by Fine, and 5 years non-claim (the practice of which falſe <hi>recording of Proclamations</hi> upon Fines is dangerous to all mens eſtates) and the <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners</hi> are adviſed, <hi>That the falſe recording of Fines ſo late acknowledged in Sept. to be made Fines of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity term before, is not warranted by ancient courſe, or uſual preſidents (if it be) they expect the Records [to warrant ſuch courſe] ſhould be produced by the Defendants;</hi> And the Petitioners ſay, <hi>That it is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Act of Parliament made in the</hi> 23 <hi>of Queen</hi> Eliz. <hi>againſt falſe practice, and deceits in Fines, it being to little purpoſe for that Statute, ſo carefully to provide that the day of the acknowledgment of the Fine be certified; and yet to ſuffer a Clerk [contrary to the truth of that Certificate] to record the Fine as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged neer</hi> 4 <hi>moneths before the ſame is certified, and confeſſed to be acknowledged; And that if this courſe of falſe recording fines and proclamations thereupon ſhall be admitted, it will then be in the power of a Clerk of the Common-Pleas, to deceive any Purchaſer of the Land he hath bought and paid for, and to praeclude the rightful Owner of the full time allowed him by law, to make his just claim to ſave his Inheritance; and indeed it will prove the greatest Cheat in the Land: for when a Purchaſer hath taken his Aſſurance by Feoffment or Deed inrolled, and paid his money, he ſhall notwithſtanding have his Aſſurance over-reached by a falſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidated fine to another perſon; nay, one Fine ſhall over-reach and out-strip another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Complainants do alſo ſay, <hi>That the vacuating of theſe Fines ſhakes no mans Title or Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but ſuch as are built upon ſo foul a practice, which the Complainants ſay there never was; and therefore no man elſe in danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that part of the Objection, <hi>That if this courſe of recording Fines of the Term before be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, no man can make a perfect purchaſe in vacation;</hi> We anſwer, <hi>That the Purchaſer may keep his money until his Aſſurance be perfected, which is without miſchief to either party; however, of evils the greateſt is moſt to be avoided; and that is the danger of deceit to all Purchaſers, by the allowance of this courſe of antidating Fines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſay the Purchaſer may have a good aſſurance by Fine acknowledged in vacation; and the States ſilver being entred, it will be a good fine of the enſuing Term, though the party die; and where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of fines have been ſo late in a long vacation, the uſe hath been to make them fines of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Term; and if it had been ſo done in this Caſe the Court of Common-Pleas (finding a prastice) might then have ſtopped the fines which by this courſe (the Cyrographs being made up as of the Term before) was prevented:</hi> And 'tis to be obſerved, that the <hi>Complainants</hi> complain not alone, becauſe the writs were antidated; but as they were antidated by practice.</p>
               <p>Alſo, whether the Lady <hi>Powel</hi> acknowledged theſe Fines, or not, appears not to the <hi>Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;</hi> for the <hi>Confederates</hi> had excluded all but themſelves: And the Judge declared in Court, and elſewhere, <hi>that he never ſaw the Lady</hi> Powel <hi>before;</hi> and if a Judge (as 'tis poſſible he may) take a Fine, either by force, or of a ſuppoſititions perſon, theſe Fines are binding by the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57954:4"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and cannot be avoided but in <hi>Parliament;</hi> for that by the common law no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment lies againſt a Fine of Record, how untrue ſoever. And the truth is, the Judges <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Judge</hi> Atkins <hi>ſaid in open Court it ſounded ill in his ears here, that it would found worſe in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worſe in the high Court of Heaven.</hi>
                  </note> vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently exclaimed againſt ſo much of this practice, as then was made appear unto them (for much more hath been diſcovered by their own Confederates ſince) and the Judges did not deny to vacuate the ſaid Fines, as unſatisfied with the practice, but as conceiving it beyond their power to give relief; becauſe the States ſilver being entred, and the Cyrographs made up in haſte to compleat the practice before the Term began, the Fines were thereby become perfect Fines pleadable at Law; and not to be nullified but in <hi>Parliament;</hi> which the Judges openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they believed would give remedy.</p>
               <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection that the Petitioners ought now to complain of the Court of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas, is anſwered in the Anſwer to the laſt Objection before; onely this is obſervable, that Mr. <hi>Levingſton</hi> would fain have the Petitioners complain of the Court of Common-pleas, that he might find ſubterfuge under them, and his offence impunity, by involving the Court in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Crime, whereas the Judges themſelves declared the Petitioners relief to be in Parliament only.</p>
               <p>As to the fifth Objection, that the Petitioners are relievable in the inferior Courts, and therefore ought not to ſue to Parliament for relief, We anſwer, It is true, Chancery hath in ſome Caſes made Decrees againſt Eſtates gained by practice; but theſe Decrees bind onely the perſons, and work not upon the title or intereſt of the land; nor can that Court puniſh the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders: and the Petitioners are not willing to follow Mr. <hi>Levingſtons</hi> perſon for their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not knowing whether he may reſolve to go, or abide impriſonment, in caſe Chancery ſhould order him to reconvey. They ſay alſo, that Chancery cannot make a good Title of theſe lands to the Petitioners; nor will any man deal with them for their intereſt in the land upon a Decree in Chancery, ſhould the Petitioners have need (as indeed they well may have) to mortgage, ſell, or ſettle them; for the truth is, no Court but Parliament can vacuate Fines inrolled of Record, though gotten by practice; and that was agreed in Star-chamber 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> by the then Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi> and all the chief Judges of <hi>England.</hi> And that Fines are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vacated in Parliament Mr. <hi>Levingſton</hi> well knew (whatever he pretends) when he made his Agreement with Mr <hi>Vandenbemde</hi> (one other of the diſ-inherited Grandchildren) to give him his ſhare of the lands in queſtion, gotten from him by this practice <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton <hi>by (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Mr.</hi> Vandenbemde) <hi>is to have</hi> 4 <hi>years profits of Mr.</hi> Vandenbemde's <hi>ſhare of the land's in queſtion to bear his charges againſt the Petitioners Complaint in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
                  </note>; for by the Articles betwixt them, Mr <hi>Levingſton</hi> provided to defend himſelf againſt your Petitioners Complaint in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at Mr. <hi>Vandenbemdes</hi> coſts and charges; which ſhews, Mr <hi>Levingſton</hi> knew and expected that your Petitioners muſt and would come to Parliament for relief.</p>
               <p>As to Mr <hi>Levingſton's</hi> Objection, Why Parliament ſhould not intermeddle herein; becauſe his offence is either againſt Common law, Statute law, or Rules of Equity; and therefore he onely to be cenſured by Common law, Statute law, or Court of Equity, We anſwer, That all fraud is againſt the common law; and that his falſe Antidates, and recording of his Fines and Proclamations thereupon are againſt two Statute laws; the one of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and the other, 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> before mentioned; and all his whole action is againſt the Rules of good Conſcience, in that, Mr <hi>Levinſtgon</hi> being a perſon of a gainful profeſſion, and having at preſent an eſtate in land of 600 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, by the guift of your Petitioners Grandfather (beſides the land in queſtion,) of part of which he alſo was to have a ſhare) and having no child himſelf, ſhould yet by ſo foul a practice go about to diſ-inherit the Petitioners (three whereof are the mothers of 19 children) of the beſt part of their livelyhood, to maintain themſelves, and them: But we ſay, as before, no Court can vacuate a recorded Fine, but Parliament; how tranſcendent ſoever the Crime in obtaining of it be; and therefore we appeal to Parliament to do it, and to puniſh the offence: For when a Lawyer ſhall ſo notoriouſly practice to violate the Laws, and all Rules of Equity, and good Conſcience, his Knowledge ought to aggravate his Crime. And by the Argument of Mr <hi>Levingſton,</hi> the Parliament ſhould have no power to puniſh any offence at all; for all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are either againſt common law, Statute law, or good Conſcience; And therfore by this Rule all Crimes muſt be cenſured and puniſhed by the Courts below; and Parliament ſhould have no juriſdiction over any Crime at all; which, how abhorrent from Reaſon, and contrary to Experience it is, let all men judge that underſtand any thing at all, what the power or courſe of Parliament is.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Complainants</hi> obſerve, that M. <hi>Levingſton</hi> doth very wiſely deſire to be judged in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;</hi> for that, <hi>Chancery</hi> cannot vacate the Fines, nor puniſh his offence, how tranſcendent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall appear to be.</p>
               <p>But we ſay, it is the proper work of Parliament to relieve where the inferior Courts cannot, and the inferior Courts cannot nullifie a fine; therefore, Parliament muſt, otherwiſe there will be a failer of power to do juſtice; And it is manifeſt, where great frauds or force have appeared to the Parliament, it hath been uſual for them to give a remedy where there was none before; and a more full, or more ſpeedy remedy, where there was remedy by law before, eſpecially in matter of complaint of complicated nature (as this is) where both the Civil Title, and matter Criminal, is in queſtion before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57954:5"/>
And we ſay, That <hi>Fines, Recognizances</hi> inrol<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, and <hi>Conveyances</hi> gotten by practice, or dureſſe, have been complained of, and vacuated in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that ſhall be made manifeſt by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if it be denied.</p>
               <p>As to the conſideration offered, <hi>Why the Deeds ſhould not be produced to the honorable Committee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Crime be examined,</hi> We anſwer, That the fight of the Deeds would more clearly manifeſt the practice, <hi>by comparing the</hi> Ladies <hi>Seal and hand-writing, and the names of the Witneſses endorſeder ſubſcribed;</hi> and more eſpecially in this Caſe is it neceſſary, that all Deeds be produced, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely peruſed, becauſe the <hi>Petitioners</hi> have reaſon to believe, that M. <hi>Levingſton</hi> hath in the Deeds (whereby he claimes the perſonal eſtate) contrived great guiſts and bequeſts to ſome perſons whom he intends to produce as Witneſſes for him to prove the Deeds for the land; and ſo Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that ſwear for their own benefit ſhall not be detected for want of ſight of all Deeds; Nor is this Order of the honourable Committee to compel him to being in his Deeds more then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to diſcover the practice requires; nor more then <hi>Chancery</hi> and other Courts uſe to do in matters of complaint of fraud and practice, and many other Caſes.</p>
               <p>As to ſo much of Mr. <hi>Levingſtons Conſiderations</hi> as concerns the means, occaſion, or procurement of the <hi>Petitioners Complaint,</hi> they deny, That they complain by any other means or procurement, then their own, and for their own Inheritance, Eſtate, &amp; Right; and they recriminate his charge of malice and falſhood upon himſelf, he having lately had three of his Witneſſes convict of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in the Upper-Bench before the Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Roll,</hi> and two others of them indicted, and to be tried for perjury the next Term, in other Cauſes that have iſſued from theſe practices.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Defendant</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Levingſton</hi> did heretofore offer to one <hi>Dowthwait</hi> a reward of 50 <hi>l.</hi> value to ſwear your <hi>Petitioners</hi> out of other part of their <hi>inheritance</hi> [to the value of 500 <hi>l.</hi> yearly] is ſworn by <hi>Douthwait</hi> himſelf upon his <hi>Examination in Chancery in another Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Petitioners do aver, <hi>That they <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>omplein as well for the perſonal eſtate, as real, (being both unduly gotten from them by</hi> M.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Complainants ſay that they did heretofore in open Court refuſe to be concluded by the reference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed betwixt</hi> Mr. Levingſton, <hi>and</hi> Mr. Crompton <hi>[concerning the perſonal eſtate in queſtion] wherin one</hi> M.

               <p>
                  <hi>And the petitioners do affirm, th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> Sir Edward Powel, <hi>and</hi> M.

               </p>
               <p>And the Petitioners do obſerve, that M. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> and his wife, would fain inſinuate a ſcandal, and ſtick ſome oblequie upon that dead Ladies reputation, who living (as they would have the world believe) obliged them with the guift of her whole eſtate.</p>
               <p>But truth will out; and were M. <hi>Levingſton</hi> and his wife conſcious to themſelvs, that the lady <hi>Powel</hi> had really intended her eſtate to them, the Petitioners believe, they would in modeſty and common gratitude have forborn to have hinted that reproach and ſcandal to her, who [being in her grave] cannot now make anſwer for her ſelf.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the <hi>Complainants</hi> ſay, That all the Engliſh Hiſtories and Records cannot parallel this <hi>tranſcendent practice,</hi> whereby the eſtate in queſtion is gotten from them; and that they have hitherto purſued it as with <hi>Hue-and Cry;</hi> and ſhall give a more particular account of it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this being but minutes of it, and in haſte.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Several Writs of Covenant,</hi> ſued forth for the paſſing of theſe Fines, are all antedated, and bear <hi>teſte</hi> the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> 1651, and made Returnable <hi>Tres Trinitatis</hi> following which is the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>June.</hi>
