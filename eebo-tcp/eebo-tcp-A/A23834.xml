            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS Defence of the <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the Antient and Illuſtrious Confeſſors, who ſome Ages ago enlightned the Southern Parts of <hi>France,</hi> is laid down at your Majeſty's Feet for Your Protection, as well as their Succeſſors do now fly into your Dominions for Relief.

            <p>It was from them that this Church (now ſo happy in your Majeſty) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the firſt Beams of that heavenly Light, which it now enjoys, and which it of late maintained with ſuch vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that it is deſervedly eſteemed the chief Body, as well as the juſteſt Glory, of the whole Reformation. The Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of thoſe earlieſt Reſtorers of the

There is nothing in this Hiſtory that will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrike or charm. Thoſe true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their crucified Maſter, were conſiderable for nothing but the Purity of their Doctrine, the Innocency of their Lives, and the Patience as well as the Conſtancy of their Sufferings.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was no hard matter for us to juſtify the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> from the Accuſation of Schiſm, which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> thought fit to charge upon them; for by ſhewing the Antiquity, Purity, and Succeſsion of thoſe Churches, I have made it appear, that what the Biſhop calls Schiſm, ought in Juſtice to be look'd upon as a vigorous Oppoſition to the falſe Worſhip and Uſurpations of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction; and by conſequence, that there is no more reaſon to call the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> Schiſmaticks, becauſe of their refuſing Subjection to the Pope, and rejecting the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than there is to call the Church of <hi>England</hi> Schiſmatical for the ſame Reaſons.</p>
            <p>But it is ſo long ſince the heads of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have founded their Deſign of an Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and ſo have fitted their Stile to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, that it is now become a very familiar thing with them, to treat thoſe as Rebels and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:50988:5"/>
Schiſmaticks, who will not ſubmit to their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: ſo that we need not wonder if they, who have eſpouſed the Intereſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who defend her againſt the Proteſtants, do boldly charge thoſe with Schiſm againſt whom they write, without giving themſelves the trouble of proving their Charge.</p>
            <p>Nay, perhaps we are to think our ſelves obliged to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> who raiſing himſelf a little above the common Method of the Doctors of his own Communion, has limited himſelf to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of Schiſm only, whereas he might with as much reaſon, have charg'd them with Hereſy, if he had followed the Writers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of his own Party, or the Legends of the Saints of his Communion. For it is certain, that the Writers of Controverſy in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe who have writ the Lives of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors that have been canoniz'd, have never look'd upon the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> as any other than <hi>Manichees;</hi> ſo thorowly rooted is the Spirit of Calumny in the Members of that Church: the Character of Father of Lies, being very neceſſary to ſupport that of Murtherer honourably, whereof they have been in Poſſeſsion ſo very long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:50988:5"/>I cannot tell whether the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> has forgiven himſelf for his Tenderneſs towards the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> whom he only treats as Schiſmaticks. For ſeeing one Day informs another, and that thus Men come to refine their Notions to the utmoſt, who knows but the Biſhop, who when he writ his <hi>Book of Variations,</hi> had only obſcurely hinted, that to accuſe the Pope of being Antichriſt, was a Character of <hi>Manicheiſm;</hi> who knows, I ſay, but that now he ſees ſo clearly, that the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> have formally declared that the Pope is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, he will not a-new make them <hi>Manichees</hi> once more, the better to accommodate himſelf with the Maxims of his New Syſtem? If he ſhould not do it himſelf, to avoid the ſhame of being guilty of a Variation, at leaſt it's very obvious to believe, that ſome of thoſe who are engaged with him in the ſame Cauſe, will not fail of taking that Courſe; and therefore I am glad I have prevented him, by ſhowing, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were no <hi>Manichees,</hi> though they took the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, I hope it will not be harder for us to juſtify the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> from the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations brought againſt them by the Biſhop of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:50988:6"/>
               <hi>Meaux.</hi> He uſes his utmoſt Endeavours to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a moſt abominable Calumny raiſed by his Predeceſſors, and ſtrives, by repreſenting the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> as a People who had revived the Errors of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> to make them equally odious to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whom his Violence, together with that of his Colleagues, have forc'd to take upon them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profeſſion of Popery.</p>
            <p>The Jews built the Tombs of thoſe Prophets, whom their Fathers ſlew; proceſs of Time having cur'd them of their Fury, that enrag'd their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers againſt the Ambaſſadors of Heaven. Thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only, know not what it is to diſown the Rage and Slanders of their Predeceſſors. She has accuſed the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> and has done it on purpoſe to inſpire her Votaries with a barbarous Cruelty, againſt a People, who refus'd to bear the Yoak of her Tyranny: And 'tis to pleaſe her, that her Miniſters muſt ſtill go on to tear the Memory of thoſe faithful Servants of God, for the utter Extirpation of whom ſhe formerly armed the Hands of all the furious Zealots of her Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:50988:6"/>And as in handling the Hiſtory of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> I thought needful for the Satisfaction of the Reader, to make ſome Remarks on their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, their Succeſſion, their Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Miniſtry; ſo I intend now to follow the ſame Method exactly in theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Hiſtory of the <hi>Albigenſes;</hi> and I hope this will be equally uſeful to ſhew what care God hath taken to preſerve theſe other illuſtrious Witneſſes of his Truth, notwithſtanding all thoſe Corruptions that overſpread the Churches of the Weſt.</p>
            <p>I have ſet down the Character of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> both Antient and Modern, in my <hi>Remarks upon the Hiſtory of the Churches of</hi> Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, ſo fully, that it will not be neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I ſay there in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is certain, that it was rather Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> that he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> than any due regard to Truth, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> having been as much accuſed of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> as the <hi>Albigenſes;</hi> neither are there any more ſolid Proofs to convict the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> of thoſe Errors, than the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:50988:7"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe this new Hypotheſis of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> wherein he aſſerts, that to accuſe the Pope of being Antichriſt, is a Character of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> is ſo exceſſively ridiculous, that it is hard to gueſs, how even the Biſhop himſelf, could ever give Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to it.</p>
            <p>It is a very ſurprizing thing to ſee the Biſhop maintain, in his new Commentary upon the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> that the Prophecies of St. <hi>John</hi> concerning Antichriſt, were actually accompliſhed above <hi>1200</hi> Years ſince. Antichriſt then muſt have made his eſcape in the Crowd, without being at all perceiv'd; for the greateſt Lights of the Church, and thoſe who had their Eyes moſt open to diſcover him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perceiv'd any thing of all this. <hi>Vega</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> who have written on the <hi>Revelations</hi> with as much Learning as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to make any Diſcovery in antient Hiſtory that could be applicable to the Apocalypſe; and all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers of Controverſy, muſt have been a Company of Aſſes, not to ſtumble upon ſo eaſy an Anſwer, which would eternally have ſtopp'd the Mouths of the Proteſtants in ſo tickliſh and tender a Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:50988:7"/>But 'tis no matter, ſince two Proteſtant Authors, and thoſe of the firſt Rank too, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> have handed this Notion to the Biſhop: it being very probable, that the Biſhop did for this Reaſon, hinder the Clergy from putting the Works of <hi>Grotius</hi> in the Catalogue of Books, which they forbad a little before the Revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi>: and he would have been as civil to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> too, if his Commentary upon the New Teſtament had been known to him, any where elſe than in <hi>Pool</hi>'s Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. And really theſe great Men very well deſerv'd, that a particular Regard ſhould be had to them; their Miſtake in the point of Antichriſt having prov'd as advantageous to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as their learned Works can be profitable to the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But it is yet a more ſurprizing thing to ſee the Biſhop make this Charge of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, a Character of their being <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> which none that have ever writ againſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have taken the leaſt notice of.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Succeſs may be of ſo groundleſs a Charge, I ſhall make it appear, that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> could not accuſe the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> without making great Numbers of his beſt Catholicks ſuſpected,

and Abettors of the <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in this Point.</p>
            <p>I thought it was my Duty to clear <hi>Wicklef</hi> and his Diſciples from the Slanders caſt upon them by the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux:</hi> I know very well, that he has done nothing, but repeat the old Calumnies wherewith the Papiſts formerly endeavoured to blacken that great Man, without taking the leaſt notice of the Apologies that have been made in his behalf. But either Men muſt reſolve never to write againſt theſe Gentlemen, or be content to undergo the Drudgery of repeating publickly thoſe ſolid Anſwers that have been returned to their Accuſations before; which the Writers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party always think fit to diſſemble.</p>
            <p>I hope however, that ſeeing the Matter I undertake to treat of, naturally engaged me to take notice of great Numbers of Matters of Fact, which were neceſſary to be examined towards the clearing of this Subject; and that the Malice and Cruelty of the Enemies of theſe antient Chriſtians have robb'd us of what might be moſt material for their Juſtification: the Reader will not expect, I ſhould put theſe Remarks into any other form, than that in which I wrote my <hi>Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the Churches
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:50988:8"/>
of</hi> Piedmont. For I could neither write a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Hiſtory, nor diſpenſe with the Examination of ſeveral Matters of Fact, which could not be cleared ſo well as they ought, without ſome critical Enquiries, that will be unpleaſant to all thoſe who ſearch for any thing elſe but Truth. I have confined my ſelf here entirely to the enquiry after, and illuſtration of that alone; and I am perſuaded, that thoſe who will take the pains to weigh what I have ſaid in theſe following Sheets with care, will be of the ſame Opinion. And I heartily wiſh, that it may triumph over Falſhood, and Innocence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt all the Aſſaults of Obloquy and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the Original of the Churches of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi> and <hi>Aquitain.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore the Gauls were entirely reduc'd by <hi>Ceſar</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the Roman Empire, and after that under the ſaid Emperor, <hi>Gallia</hi> was commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Parts, whereof the one was called <hi>Braccata,</hi> the other <hi>Comata. Gallia Braccata</hi> contained not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> and was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ciſalpina,</hi> but alſo <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> whereof <hi>Vienna</hi> was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50988:12"/>
the Capital City. The other, to wit, <hi>Gallia Comata,</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts; the firſt whereof was called <hi>Belgica,</hi> the other <hi>Celtica,</hi> and the third <hi>Aquitain.</hi> But <hi>Auguſtus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolute Maſter of <hi>Gaule,</hi> made ſome Alteration in this Diviſion; for he extended the Bounds of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining thoſe of <hi>Celtica,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed <hi>Aquitain</hi> into three Provinces, whereof the firſt and ſecond were on this ſide of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and reached to the <hi>Loyre</hi>; the third reached from the <hi>Garonne</hi> to the Pyrenean Mountains. <hi>Bourges</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> were the Mother-Cities of the firſt and ſecond of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and <hi>Eulſe</hi> or <hi>Eaulſe</hi> was the Metropolis of the third, which City having been deſtroyed by the Wars, <hi>Auſch</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded her in that Dignity.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> which at firſt was only a Province, whereof <hi>Vienna</hi> was the Capital City, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was pleaſed to take that Honour from her, to beſtow it upon <hi>Lions,</hi> which ſeemed to him more commodious to be made the Seat of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This Province was afterward changed, by being divided into four Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>Narbonenſis, Viennenſis,</hi> the <hi>Maritime Alps</hi> and the <hi>Greek Alps.</hi> And after this Diviſion, <hi>Narbonenſis</hi> was again ſubdivided into two parts, the firſt and ſecond, as may be ſeen ſince the fourth Century.</p>
               <p>It was needful at the entrance of this Diſcourſe, to give the Reader this ſhort Draught of the Countries that went under the Name of <hi>Gallia,</hi> to give him an Idea of that part of them, where we intend to ſhew him the Continuation of that Church which gave birth to the Albigenſes, and furniſhed the Weſt with Witneſſes of ſo great weight againſt the Corruptions of the Romiſh Party; and indeed though the <hi>Viſi-Gothes,</hi> who cut off theſe Provinces from the Roman Empire; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the French, who deſtroyed the <hi>Viſi-Gothes</hi> in the time of <hi>Clovis,</hi> made very great Changes in this Diviſion of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> yet we may exactly obſerve, that the Church of theſe Provinces, hath well nigh always made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Body by her Synods and Canons.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of Difficulty preciſely to fix the firſt Riſe of theſe Churches. I own that ſome Greek Fathers have believ'd, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Creſcens,</hi> Diſciples of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> did preach the

Goſpel in <hi>Gallia</hi>; but that which engaged them in this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeems of little or no ſolidity. And the <hi>Galatia</hi> mention'd by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſecond of <hi>Timothy,</hi> doth not ſignify <hi>Gallia,</hi> but a Province of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> as the learned <hi>Petavius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth.</p>
               <p>Others have believed, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf preached the Goſpel in theſe Provinces, as he paſſed through them in his way to <hi>Spain,</hi> where the fourth Century took it for granted that he preached the Goſpel: but neither doth this ſeem ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſufficient Authority; and we do not find that the antient Authors of theſe Countries did ever maintain any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Should we indeed, as to this Point, give credit to the moſt part of the Romiſh Legends, to which <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals pays too great a Deference, it would be an eaſy matter to give to the moſt part of theſe Churches a moſt auguſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. We might ſuppoſe that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were the Founders of them by the Miniſtry of their Diſciples, or that <hi>Clement</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent them thither almoſt immediately after the Martyrdom of the Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> They tell us that <hi>Paul</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Narbon, Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of <hi>Tholouſe, Martialis</hi> of <hi>Limoges, Frontinus</hi> of <hi>Perigueux, Vincentius</hi> of <hi>Daeqs, Georgius</hi> of <hi>Puy, Eutropius</hi> of <hi>Xaintes:</hi> Much like as for ſome Ages ſince, in moſt of the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>France,</hi> they ſuppoſe that the firſt Biſhops were ſent them by the ſame Apoſtles, or by their firſt Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>But we meet with nothing but Falſities in theſe pretended Traditions: and it is impoſſible to reconcile them with what <hi>Sulpicius Severus</hi> and <hi>Gregorius Turonenſis</hi> tell us concerning the Riſe of Chriſtian Religion among the Gauls. The former of theſe diſtinctly aſſures us, that <hi>Gaule</hi> never had any Martyrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Empire of <hi>Aurelius</hi> Son of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Hiſt. lib. 2. <hi>Sub Aurelio Antonini filio Perſecutio quinta agitata; ac tunc primum inter Gallias Martyria viſa, ſerius trans Alpes Dei Religione ſuſcepta.</hi>
                  <q>The fifth Perſecution was carried on under <hi>Aurelius, Antonine</hi>'s Son; and then firſt were Martyrdoms ſeen among the Gauls, the Divine Religion having been later entertained beyond the <hi>Alps.</hi>

This ſingle Period of <hi>Severus</hi> gives Sentence againſt

all thoſe pretended Martyrs wherewith the Churches of <hi>France</hi> have fill'd their Breviaries. The latter tells us plainly, that it was not till the Empire of <hi>Decius,</hi> about the year 250, that the City of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> had for her firſt Biſhop <hi>Saturninus,</hi> who was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> in company of ſix others, into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Gauls, to preach the Goſpel, to wit, <hi>Gatian</hi> at <hi>Tours, Trophimus</hi> at <hi>Arles, Paul</hi> at <hi>Narbon, Dionyſius</hi> at <hi>Paris, Auſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moine</hi> at <hi>Clermont,</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> at <hi>Limoges.</hi> This is that which is clearly proved from the Acts of the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> cited by <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies of two antient Authors, the one of the 5<hi>th</hi> Century, and the other more antient, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſame who wrote the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Saturninus,</hi> have made ſuch an Impreſſion upon ſome of the Learnedeſt Men of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Boſquet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Montpellier, Sirmond,</hi> and <hi>Launoy</hi> the famous Doctor of the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> as to make them with Scorn reject thoſe Legends, which aſcribe more antient Founders to theſe Churches, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they are the greateſt Ornament of the Breviaries of the Gallican Church, and that they cannot loſe their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, without ſhaking the belief of abundance of Miracles, and the Authority of a great number of Devotions.</p>
               <p>And indeed, what reaſon is there to own a Tradition for authentick, which we ſcarcely find back'd with any Witneſs for the ſpace of above 700 years? Beſides, don't we know, that it was the Diſpute about Precedency between the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the 8<hi>th</hi> and 9<hi>th</hi> Century, and which we find laſted till the 12<hi>th,</hi> that engaged the ſeveral Parties to deviſe this great Antiquity, and boldly change that, which before had been the current Belief of their Churches, becauſe it did not anſwer their Pretenſions, nor comport with their Vanity, to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute inſtead thereof fabulous Originals, under whoſe ſhelter they might maintain a Diſpute with more advantage againſt thoſe that were on even ground with them?</p>
               <p>But however it be difficult to fix the certain Original of theſe Churches, for the Gothick Liturgy, which was uſed in theſe Provinces, aſſures us that St. <hi>Saturninus</hi> came from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> from whence it ſhould ſeem that the firſt Founders of the Churches
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50988:13"/>
of <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> came likewiſe, yet thus much we may aſſert that the Goſpel ſoon took deep root there.</p>
               <p>My Deſign is not to refute here what the Authors of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends have inſerted in their fabulous Relations, concerning the Eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Religion in theſe Provinces, and the Character of the Piety of thoſe firſt Founders of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, of their Precepts and of their Miracles. Indeed there is reaſon to deplore either the boundleſs Impudence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Roman Communion, in obtruding ſuch palpable Falſities, or the prodigious Stupidity of the People of that Church, who feed themſelves with Stories more fabulous than thoſe of <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and make them the Subject of their Devotion. We read in the Life of St. <hi>Martialis,</hi> that after the Saint had converted <hi>Limoges,</hi> he there conſecrated Churches to the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt, of the H. Virgin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> whoſe Couſin he was. We read that he raiſed to Life the Prieſts of the Idol, whom God had ſtruck dead with a Clap of Thunder, for their poiſoning St. <hi>Martialis</hi>; and that, after their Reſurrection, he converted them. We find that he admitted to the Vow of Virginity a Perſon called <hi>Valeria,</hi> who ſome time after having had her Head cut off, by order of the Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> whoſe Courtſhip ſhe had ſlighted, immediately took up her Head, and carried it to St. <hi>Martialis,</hi> as he was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſs. We find him there going to <hi>Rome</hi> to give an account to St. <hi>Peter</hi> of his Commiſſion: all this is very gravely related by the <hi>Legendaries</hi>; yea, the Impudence of theſe Knaves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that Point, as in the ninth Century, to conciliate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to theſe fabulous Relations. Several Councils were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Limoges,</hi> where with intolerable Impudence they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed two Epiſtles upon St. <hi>Martialis,</hi> the one as writ to thoſe of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and the other to thoſe of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and which bear much a like Reſemblance to the Apoſtolical Writings of thoſe times, as Aſſes do to Lions: and all that theſe inſipid Authors tell us about it, is ſo entirely framed according to the Manners, Notions and Cuſtoms of the later Ages, that we can find nothing in their Writings but what ſome ſtupid Monks have inſolently invented and patch'd together, with ſo little regard to Reaſon, that one of theſe extravagant Fellows maintains that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50988:14"/>
the Bleſſed Virgin was ſaying her Roſary at the time ſhe was viſited by the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not certainly known whether the Books which St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> has written againſt the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> ought to perſwade us that thoſe Hereticks had then already ſpread themſelves among the <hi>Gauls</hi>; for ſeeing he writ them in Greek, this Work ſeems to have been deſigned againſt the Hereticks of the Eaſt; for though we have a Tranſlation of theſe Books, more ancient than the time of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> yet we have no Proof that it was done with Deſign to refute Perſons who had endeavoured to corrupt the Faith from the very Beginning of its Eſtabliſhment in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that in the fourth Century, <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably corrupted and infected the Purity of theſe Dioceſſes: <hi>Saturninus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> and thoſe of his Cabal, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned St. <hi>Hilary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> for an Heretick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he oppoſed Arianiſm with all his Might; but ſoon after we find that Truth raiſed her ſelf again from under its Ruins: For though at the beginning of the fifth Century the <hi>Viſi-Gothes</hi> who were Arians, had made themſelves Maſters of theſe Provinces of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and which they remain poſſeſs'd of till they were taken from them by <hi>Clovis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>; yet we do not find that Arianiſm ever prevailed there, the Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Paſtors having prevented the Peoples yielding ſo far to the Authority of theſe <hi>Arian</hi> Kings, as to follow them in their Error, the very Nature of theſe Diſputes ingaging the Enemies of the Church to maintain ſuch Maxims, as put a ſtop to the Peoples Superſtition, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Veneration of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that St. <hi>Gaudentius</hi> takes notice that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> were ſcattered up and down theſe Provinces, and <hi>Priſcillianiſm</hi> was nothing elſe but <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> in Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as appears from the Writings of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But this evil Plant withered ſoon after; both the Arians, who were Maſters, and the Orthodox, equally joining their Endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that Hereſy. Neither indeed do we find after the ſixth Century, any mention made of <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> in theſe parts; ſo that we may affirm that Chriſtianity was preſerved there with much Purity in thoſe primitive times, and arrived to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50988:14"/>
of Strength and Vigor, as to baniſh both thoſe Hereſies, whereof the one attack'd the Father of our Saviour, and the other denied the Divinity of the Son.</p>
               <p>But what I have already ſaid in general, is not ſufficient to give us a competent and juſt Idea of the Chriſtianity which was planted in theſe Provinces, and which the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> have ſo happily aſſerted, both by their Preachings and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We muſt therefore take a Review of theſe Primitive Ages, and conſider a little wherein conſiſted that Religion which theſe Dioceſſes received from thoſe firſt Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who conveyed thither the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and tranſmitted the ſame to Poſterity, as a ſacred Truſt committed to them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Faith of the Church of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the Second Century.</head>
               <p>WE have no <hi>Gallick</hi> Author, whoſe Name is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>;<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 4. c. 20.</note> he was a Diſciple of St. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>; and being ſent into <hi>Gaul</hi> by that Apoſtolick Man, he was firſt Prieſt of the Church of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and afterwards ſucceeded <hi>Photinus,</hi> firſt Biſhop of that City; it was in his time that the Church ſuffered the fifth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution under the Government of the Emperors <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius. Euſebius</hi> has preſerved the Relation of the Martyrdom of the Believers of <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Probability is judged to have been made by St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the Name of both theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>This Relation tells us firſt of all, that the Roman Preſident having cauſed ſome Slaves to be apprehended that belong'd to Chriſtians, made them confeſs, at the Sight of Tortures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50988:15"/>
for them, that the Chriſtians did eat Children in their Aſſemblies, and that they there promiſcuouſly polluted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by abominable Inceſts; which was afterwards confirmed by weak Chriſtians, who for fear of Torments abjured their Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Chriſtians having confuted this Calumny, by their Conſtancy in induring the Torments, and above all the reſt <hi>Blandina,</hi> who after a whole day's ſuffering Tortures, having cried with a loud Voice, <hi>I am a Chriſtian: there is no Wickedneſs committed amongst us:</hi> (which was ſeconded by <hi>Byblis,</hi> who before had abjured) <hi>How,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſhould the Chriſtians, to whom it is not lawful to eat the Blood of Beaſts, devour Infants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Blandina</hi> is repreſented to us in theſe Acts, as praying to God with great Affection, and as it were converſing with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in Prayer. <hi>Attalus</hi> being ſet in a Chair of Iron, to be there burnt, and perceiving the ſmell of his broiled Fleſh, ſaid to the Spectators in Latin; <hi>In hoc demum eſt homines vorare quod agitis; nos verò neque homines voramus, neque omnino quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam mali facimus.</hi>
                  <q>This that ye do here is indeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Men; but as for us, we neither devour Men, nor do any thing at all that is evil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>; The Church was deſirous to bury what remained of their Bodies, as the Relation informs us, but the Fury of the Pagans who burnt them to Aſhes, hindred them: Theſe are the chiefeſt Heads of this Relation, where we find nothing but God and Jeſus Chriſt called upon, where we do not ſee the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers troubling themſelves to explain or qualify the corporal Manducation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as it became them to have done, had they believed their eating of him with their bodily Mouth; and where there is not the leaſt Word that might give us to underſtand that theſe Churches took care to preſerve theſe ſo precious Relicks, to honour them with their Adorations, as in latter times has been done.</p>
               <p>We find here alſo the Spirit of Calumny tranſporting the Heathens againſt the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt; and how far the Cruelty of Torments may prevail to make Men confeſs the moſt enormous Calumnies to be true. The Reader muſt not forget theſe two Characters of old <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50988:15"/>
have renewed theſe very ſame Slanders againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes, and have pretended to confirm them by Confeſſions which the Cruelty of their Tortures have forced from them.</p>
               <p>Neither is it only in this Work of his, that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, what in his time was the Faith of theſe Churches planted in <hi>Gaul,</hi> for he hath left us five Books, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> has preſerved for us ſome Epiſtles of that ancient Biſhop, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether refulgent with the Purity of the Faith delivered by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gives us this for one Character of the Gnoſticks, that they embraced Doctrines which were not to be found in the Writings of the Prophets or the Apoſtles, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>And 'tis with the ſame Spirit that he attributes to Hereticks, the accuſing of the Scripture for being unintelligible, without the Help of Tradition, whereas he maintains that that which had been preached, was committed to Writing by the ſpecial Will of God, to the end it might be the Ground and Pillar of our Faith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. And that it is to make the Apoſtles Hypocrites, to ſuppoſe that they taught ſome things in publick, and others in private; whence it appears clearly, that when he makes uſe of Tradition, he only does it with reſpect to thoſe ſcriptural Doctrines which the Hereticks oppoſed, and whereof they pretended that the Apoſtles had left the contrary to thoſe that ſucceeded them, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 'Tis upon this occaſion that he alledgeth the Teſtimony of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> founded by the Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as of one that was moſt known: <hi>Ad hanc enim Eccleſiam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>propter potentiorem Principalitatem, neceſſe eſt omnem convenire Eccleſiam, hoc eſt eos qui ſunt undique fideles, in quo ſemper ab his qui ſunt undique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervata eſt ea, quae eſt ab Apoſtolis Traditio</hi>;
<q>For to this Church, becauſe of its more powerful Superiority, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves the whole Church to come, that is, the Believers of all Parts, for as much as therein the Tradition from the Apoſtles has always peen preſerved by the Believers of all parts.</q>
It is apparent that whatſoever Deſign he may have had to raiſe the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; he makes no other uſe of it, than to make out, that it was impoſſible thoſe Doctrines which the Hereticks gave out for Apoſtolical,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50988:16"/>
ſhould be really ſo, ſeeing they were unknown to a Church which had had the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors for her Guides, more eſpecially ſeeing that Church was placed in the very Seat of the Empire, which continually drew to <hi>Rome</hi> a vaſt number of Believers from all the different places of the Empire, from whence they brought not along with them a different Tradition from that which they found in the Boſom of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had no other aim but this, is owned by <hi>F. Queſnel</hi> in his Notes upon the tenth Epiſtle of St. <hi>Leo, pag.</hi> 809. And this appears evidently, becauſe after all that Eſteem which he had for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was not afraid to write to her Biſhop very cenſuring Letters, upon the account of his having excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Eaſter the fourteenth of the Moon of <hi>March</hi>; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe he continued in the Communion of thoſe Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> without being concerned at the Excommunication of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He reduces the whole Faith of Chriſtians throughout the World, to that which we call the Apoſtles Creed, without mentioning ſo much as a Word of thoſe Doctrines which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſuperadded to it, pretending to confirm them by Tradition, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He maintains the Scriptures to be both clear and perfect, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He rejects the Doctrines which the Hereticks grounded upon the Explication of ſome Parables, maintaining that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be eſtabliſhed, but upon clear and evident places of Scripture, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It appears by his Writings, that Penance at that time was publick, without diſpenſing with Women that were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with the Sins of Uncleanneſs, by which means being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to extream Confuſion, it made ſome of them abjure Chriſtianity, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He makes it appear that <hi>Caelibat</hi> was not yet known in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whence theſe firſt Chriſtians of the <hi>Gauls</hi> derived their Original, which is acknowledged by the <hi>Fevardentius, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50988:16"/>7. He aſſigns to the <hi>Marcoſians</hi> the cuſtom of anointing thoſe they received into their Communion, with Balm, [<hi>Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balſamo</hi>] which ſhews, that at that time extream Unction was not known: And we may make the ſame Obſervation from his imputing to other Hereticks, the anointing of Perſons at the Point of Death, with Oil and Water, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He attributes to the Gnoſticks, the Imitation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, becauſe they had the Images of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24. which makes it evident that the Chriſtians had no Images, much leſs that they gave to them any religious Worſhip. And indeed we find him reaſoning, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. after ſuch a manner, as ſhews that the Chriſtians were yet in full Poſſeſſion of a Right to reproach the Heathens with all thoſe Abſurdities that ariſe from the Uſe of Images. The ſame may alſo be gathered from <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 42. where he divides the Law into two Tables, in a manner very different from that of the Doctors of the Roman Church, and altogether conformable to the Judgment of <hi>Joſephus</hi> and other Jewiſh Doctors.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He makes it appear that he knew nothing of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Accidents from their Subjects, which is the ſole Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <q>A Virgin drove us out of Paradiſe, and by a Virgin we have found eternal Life.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. That he did not believe we ought to have recourſe to the Interceſſion of Saints, can be invincibly demonſtrated from hence, becauſe he did not believe that the Faithful ſhould ſee the Face of God before the Day of Judgment, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He plainly aſſerts that the Apoſtolical Succeſſion is of no Conſideration without the Truth of Doctrine. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 43. ſo far was he from making it a bar to hinder Believers from examining the Doctrine propounded to them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He maintains that the Gates of Heaven were open'd to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of the Aſſumption of his Fleſh; ſo far was he from believing that his glorified Body could penetrate Bodies. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 66.</p>
               <p>He aſſerts that Jeſus Chriſt, at his being born, opened the Bleſſed Virgin's Womb, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 66. which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemns for divers Reaſons.</p>
               <p>And for as much as he holds the Holy Ghoſt to be the Food of Life, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 75. accordingly he maintains, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. that our Bodies are nouriſhed by the Creatures of God received in the Euchariſt, and that they receive growth by them.</p>
               <p>He diſtinctly aſſerts that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as to its Subſtance, conſiſts of Bread and Wine, which are the Creatures of God, which he receives as Oblations of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind from the Sacrifices of the old Teſtament; and indeed in caſe he had otherwiſe conceived the matter, he would have favoured the Opinion of the Gnoſticks, who pretending that the Work of the Creation was not the Work of the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, could never have lighted upon a more comfortable Doctrine than that of Tranſubſtantiation, by means of which the Nature of Bread and Wine would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, and nothing left but the Accidents, that is to ſay, meer Fantomes, without any thing of Reality. <hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34, <hi>&amp;</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50988:17"/>In like manner we find him aſſerting, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 33. that what Jeſus Chriſt gave to his Diſciples in the Cup, was the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Product of the Vine.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We ſee clearly from what <hi>Euſebius</hi> has preſerved of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that the Variety in obſerving a Faſt before Eaſter was very great, and that there was no Law of the Apoſtles, or of Jeſus Chriſt injoining it, every one uſing it according to his own free Will and Devotion. We find alſo that whatſoever Reſpect St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was no more inclined to be led by her ſole Authority, than St. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi> was, whom he much commends; and if he conſidered her as an Apoſtolick Church, yet he never attributed to her any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the other Flocks of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I will not diſſemble that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſeems ſomewhat at a loſs, about the ſtate of Believers after Death; but to this it is ſufficient to ſay; 1. That we find in St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Faith almoſt in the ſame form that we find it in the Apoſtles Creed, as it is called. 2. That if we do not agree to all the Opinions of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> about the State of Souls after Death; 'tis certain that the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do at leaſt reject as many Articles as we do, yea and more too.</p>
               <p>From what I have ſaid, we may however perceive what was the State of the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Gaul,</hi> a little after the middle of the ſecond Century, which is the time wherein St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> lived and flouriſhed.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could produce for the following Century as Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick a Witneſs concerning the State of the Churches in this part of <hi>Gaul</hi>; but indeed though there were diverſe famous Writers, whoſe Works are cited by St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> yet there is in a manner nothing of them left to us. I know there are ſome who believe that <hi>Victorinus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers</hi> in the third Century: but this is not found true, for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he was Biſhop of <hi>Paſſau Patavionenſis,</hi> and not <hi>Picta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vienſis</hi>; ſo that we muſt proceed to thoſe who can inform us of the State of this part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> during the fourth Century.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The Faith of <hi>Gallia Aquitanica,</hi> and <hi>Narbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> in the Fourth Century.</head>
               <p>ST. <hi>Hilary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> a famous Confeſſor in the Perſecution which the <hi>Arians</hi> ſtirr'd up againſt the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, can afford us much Light concerning the State and Faith of theſe Dioceſſes: This great Man was married, as he who publiſhed his Works at <hi>Paris</hi> owns, after the famous <hi>Baptiſta Mantuanus,</hi> obſerving that the Law for the Celibacy of the Clergy was not yet introduced, and that before that time, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> expreſſeth it, they rather made choice of married Perſons, than unmarried, becauſe the former were judged more proper for the Functions of the Holy Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>But this is not the only Article wherein he differ'd from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as well as the Church of <hi>Aquitain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He counts the Canonical Books as we do, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds them for Apocryphal, which we reject, as we find in the Preface to his Commentary upon the Book of Pſalms.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He lays it down for an Error and piece of Impiety to look upon the Scripture as imperfect, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118. <hi>Lit. Vau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He aſſerts that Ignorance is not capable of excuſing Men, ſeeing the Scripture is propoſed to us as the Rule of our Faith and Manners: <hi>Non habet veniam ignoratio voluntatis; quia ſub ſcientiae facultate neſcire, repudiatae magis, quam non repertae ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae eſt reatus: Ob id enim longe à Peccatoribus ſalus, quia non exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierint Juſtificationes Dei: Nam utique non ob aliud conſignatae literis manent, quam ut ad univerſorum ſcientiam, notionemque defluerent.</hi>
                  <q>Ignorance of the Divine Will gives no Excuſe; becauſe to be ignorant when we may learn, makes us guilty of rejecting Knowledg, rather than miſſing of it: For therefore is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion far from Sinners, becauſe they ſearch not after that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50988:18"/>
which juſtifies before God, and which indeed is for no other reaſon preſerv'd in Writing, but that it might be derived to the Knowledg and Underſtanding of all.</q>
This is a Stile, and theſe are Maxims very different from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He affirms that we are to be ignorant of whatſoever the Scripture doth not teach us: and after having aſſerted, that it is the Character of Hereticks to conceal the Holy Scripture, <hi>fol.</hi> 204. he maintains that it is another Mark of Hereſy to believe beyond what the Goſpel teacheth us. <hi>Tu qui ultra E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium ſapis, neceſſe eſt ut aliis alibi arcanorum doctrinis, cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem Paterni nominis adeptus ſis.</hi>
                  <q>Thou who art wiſe beyond the Goſpel, it muſt needs be that thou haſt elſewhere by other ſecret Doctrines, attained the Knowledg of God the Father, <hi>fol.</hi> 132.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He aſſerts, that it was the Will of God, that the Scripture ſhould be plain and clear. <hi>Quantae enim potuit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, verborum ſimplicitate evangelicam fidem locutus eſt, &amp; in tantum ad intelligentiam noſtram ſermones aptavit, in quantum naturae noſtrae ferret infirmitas, non tamen ut quicquam minus dignum naturae ſuae majeſtate loqueretur.</hi>
                  <q>The Lord hath expreſs'd the Faith of the Goſpel in the greateſt Simplicity of Words he could, and ſo far accommodated his Speech to our Underſtanding, as the Weakneſs of our Nature would bear, yet ſo as not to ſpeak any thing unbecoming the Majeſty of his Nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He there alſo confirms the Fulneſs of Scripture after a moſt Authentick manner: <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Trin. Non eſt humano aut ſeculi ſenſu in Dei rebus loquendum</hi>;
<q>In the things of God we are not to ſpeak according to a humane or worldly ſenſe and meaning.</q>
And a little after; <hi>Quae ſcripta ſunt legamus, &amp; quae legerimus intelligamus, &amp; tunc perfectae fidei officio fungemur.</hi> 
                  <q>Let us read what is written, and underſtand what we read, ſo ſhall we diſcharge the Duty of perfect Faith.</q> So likewiſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 46. <hi>Non eſt de Deo humanis Judiciis ſentiendum, neque in nobis ea natura eſt, ut ſe in coeleſtem cognitionem ſuis viribus efferat; à Deo diſcendum eſt, quid ex Deo intelligendum ſit; quia non niſi ſe authore cognoſcitur.</hi>
                  <q>We muſt not think of God according to humane Judgment, for neither is our Nature ſuch, to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50988:19"/>
able to raiſe it ſelf by its own Strength to Heavenly Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; we muſt learn of God whatſoever is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of him, becauſe he is not to be known any further than as he is the Author of our Knowledg.</q>
And a little after; <hi>Loquendum ergo non aliter de Deo eſt, quam ut ipſe ad intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentiam noſtram de ſe locutus eſt:</hi>
                  <q>Wherefore we are no otherwiſe to ſpeak of God, than as he in Compliance with our Underſtanding, hath ſpoke to us concerning himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. He owns no other Foundation of the Church, beſides the Confeſſion of the Divinity of our Saviour, made by St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> inſtead of referring it to the Perſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or to the Functions of his Apoſtleſhip; <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>

                  <q>This is the only immoveable Foundation, this is the only happy Rock of Faith confeſs'd by the Mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> Thou art the Son of the living God.</q>
And ſo likewiſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 77. <hi>Super hanc igitur Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionis Petram Eccleſiae aedificatio eſt:</hi> 
                  <q>Wherefore upon the Rock of this Confeſſion the Church is built.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. He overthrows all the Exceptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in favour of the Adoration of Angels, by maintaining that the Angel who appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> was Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>de Trin. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; lib. de Synodis contra Arianos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. He was ſo little of the Belief, that the Faith of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple depends upon that of their Paſtors, that he aſſerts and proves in his Book againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Auxentius,</hi> that the People may continue Orthodox under Heretical Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He overthrows all Worſhipping of Creatures, which is practiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by maintaining, that if any ſhould worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, believing him to be a Creature, he would be accurſed. <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>de Trinit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. He dream'd ſo little of the Infallibility of the Pope, which a great part of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> owns as the greateſt Article, into which the Faith of all Chriſtians muſt be reſolved, that he pronounces many Anathema's againſt <hi>Liberius,</hi> becauſe he had ſubſcribed to an Arian Confeſſion of Faith; as may be ſeen in the Fragments of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Pithaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50988:19"/>13. He lays it down for a Maxim, that Jeſus Chriſt alone was without Sin, in his Diſcourſe upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> 58, and 138.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He owns God only to have the Power of forgiving Sins, <hi>Can.</hi> 8. in <hi>Matth.</hi> ſo far was he from attributing this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Miniſters, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth at this day.</p>
               <p n="15">15. He formally aſſerts that the good Works of one Man are of no avail to deliver another from Puniſhment, which overthrows the great Foundation of Satisfactions and Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, after the manner that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes uſe of them, <hi>Can.</hi> 27. in <hi>Matth.</hi> The wiſe Virgins tell the fooliſh, that they cannot give to them of their Oil; <hi>Quia non ſit forte quod omnibus ſatis ſit, alienis ſcilicet operibus &amp; meritis neminem adjuvandum, quia unicuique lampadi ſuae emere oleum ſit neceſſe.</hi>
                  <q>Leſt perhaps there might not be enough for them all, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that no Body can be helped by the Works and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of another, becauſe it is neceſſary for every one to buy Oil for his own Lamp.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. He was ſo far from believing the Merit of Works, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent doth, that he diſcourſeth thus upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. <hi>lit. Coph. In operibus quidem Bonitatis totus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus eſt, ſed ſatis eſſe hoc ſibi non putat ad ſalutem, niſi ſecundum miſerationem Dei &amp; judicia, miſerationem conſequatur.</hi>
                  <q>He is indeed wholly perfect in all the Works of Goodneſs, but he doth not think this ſufficient for his Salvation, except ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mercy of God and his Judgments, he obtain Mercy.</q>
And it is the ſame Notion he gives us, ſpeaking of the Parable of the Labourers, upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. <hi>Mercedem non operis ſed miſericordiae, undecimae horae operarii conſequuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. We cannot deny but that St. <hi>Hilary</hi> believed a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but yet in that Point he differed much from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: He owns a Baptiſm of Fire after this Life, but ſuch a Baptiſm as was to be conferred at the laſt Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Day of Judgment, <hi>Matth. Can.</hi> 2. And that which muſt needs greatly ſcandalize the Papiſts, is, that St. <hi>Hilary</hi> maintains that all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, without excepting ſo much as the Bleſſed Virgin, muſt endure the Fire, which he expreſly affirms on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If we have a Mind to know whether he allowed the Notion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which believes that we can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50988:20"/>
perfectly fulfil the Law of God; we may eaſily be reſolved by his manner of treating the young Man, who boaſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before Jeſus Chriſt, as if he had done it: He accuſes him of Inſolence in ſeveral places of his Works, for pretending to be juſtified by his Works. <hi>De Trinit. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Can.</hi> 19. <hi>in Matth. &amp; Lib. de Patris &amp; Filii unitate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. He overturns the common Notion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is, that when Jeſus Chriſt entred in to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Doors being ſhut, he had not loſt the Solidity of his Body, and conſequently that there was a Penetration of Dimenſions: St. <hi>Hilary</hi> rejects this Notion as abſurd, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Penetration of Dimenſions impoſſible, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de. Trinit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. He aſſerts that the Euchariſt is celebrated in breaking of Bread, and that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt did drink of the Fruit of the Vine at the Lord's Supper, and mentions not ſo much as one Word of Tranſubſtantiation, in a place where he particularly explains the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, <hi>Can.</hi> 30. <hi>in Matth.</hi> To ſpeak the Truth, how could he have any other Thoughts, who maintains that Jeſus Chriſt is no longer on the Earth, in reſpect of his Body, becauſe it is impoſſible for a Body to be in more places than one? <hi>Adeſt enim &amp; cum fideliter invocatur per naturam ſuam praeſens eſt; ſpiritus enim eſt omnia pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrans &amp; continens; non enim ſecundum nos corporalis eſt, ut cum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubi adſit, abſit aliunde, ſed virtute praeſenti, &amp; ſe quâcunque eſt, porrigenti, cum replente omniae ejus ſpiritu in omnibus ſit, tamen ei, qui in eum credat adſiſtit.</hi>
                  <q>For he is preſent by his Nature, when he is call'd upon with Faith, he being a Spirit pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating and containing all things: for he is not like us corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, ſo as that when he is in one place, he ſhould be abſent from another, but he is in all places by the Preſence of his Power which extendeth it ſelf where-ever he is, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that filleth all things; yet he is in a more peculiar manner with him that believes in him.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. He was ſo far from approving the Romiſh Inquiſition, that he calls the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> Antichriſt, for perſecuting thoſe that were not of his Opinion, <hi>lib. in Conſtant. Auguſt.</hi> Yea he judg'd all Force to be ſo contrary to the Spirit of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, that he maintains that there can be no Religion where Force is made uſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50988:20"/>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>; He was ſo far from believing that the Antichriſt, whereof St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, was already come; that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that he would be revealed in the Churches that were then poſſeſſed by the Arians, and that the Faith being thus attack'd, the true Believers would be forced to look out for Shelter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Mountains in Woods and Caves, leaving the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt Maſter of the publick Places conſecrated to the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>This is the Sum of what may be gathered from the Writings of St. <hi>Hilary.</hi> I make no mention of ſome Errors of this great Man, becauſe <hi>Claudianus Mamertus</hi> having confuted them about the end of the fifth Century, has made it appear that they were only ſome particular Opinions of this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and that we cannot look upon them as the common Faith of the Dioceſs where he was ſetled. But the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of the Articles I have noted; <hi>Claudianus</hi> is ſo far from blaming them, that he approves them by his Silence, and ſhews that his Doctrine in this Reſpect, was the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have nothing left us of the Works of <hi>Rhodanius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who was contemporary with St. <hi>Hilary</hi>: But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clear to us, that this Holy Confeſſor having been ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baniſhment with St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> after the Council of <hi>Beziers,</hi> by the Cabal of <hi>Saturninus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> Favourer of the <hi>Arians</hi>; we are to conſider <hi>Rhodanius</hi> as a Defender of the ſame Faith, and an illuſtrious Witneſs of the Belief of his Dioceſs: And we ought to make the ſame Judgment of <hi>Phaebadius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> who was ſo much engaged in the ſame Quarrel, and who acquired ſo great a Name by the vigorous Oppoſition he made againſt the Errors of <hi>Arius</hi>: But Providence has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us none of his Works.</p>
               <p>In effect, this great Man, who wrote in the Year 357. as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Book againſt the Arians, gives us ſufficiently to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what his Faith was in divers Articles, and what was the Doctrine of the Dioceſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He maintains that the Catholick Faith is found with thoſe who ſpeak according to the Holy Scripture, and not amongſt thoſe who only make uſe of Prejudices. After having quoted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50988:21"/>
ſeveral places of Scripture, to prove againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son, he concludes in this manner, <hi>B. Patr. T.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 174. <hi>Volentes igitur à Patre Filium ſcindere, &amp; infra Deum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, de Evangelio praeſcribunt:</hi>

He expreſſeth himſelf yet more ſtrongly to this purpoſe, towards the end of his Book, <hi>ib. p.</hi> 180. <hi>Hoc credimus, hoc tenemus, quia hoc accepimus à Prophetis; hoc nobis Evangelia locuta ſunt, hoc Apoſtoli tradiderunt, hoc Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in paſſione confeſſi ſunt; in hoc mentibus fidei etiam haeremus, contra quod ſi Angelus de Coelo annuntiaverit, Anathema ſit.—Ergo ut ſupra diximus, praejudicatae opinionis authoritas nihil valebit, quia contra ſemetipſam, ipſa conſiſtit.</hi>
                  <q>This we believe, this we hold faſt, becauſe 'tis this we have received from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, this the Goſpels have declared to us, this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have left us, this the Martyrs in their Sufferings have confeſſed, and to this we adhere with our Minds by Faith, ſo that if an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach contrary to this, let him be accurſed. — Wherefore, as was ſaid before, the Authority of a prejudicate Opinion can be of no force, becauſe it ſtands againſt it ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He makes it appear that the Name of Catholick was not ſufficient to be a true Chriſtian, when he repreſents that <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had ſo far ſeized the Minds of all the World, that it was neceſſary to eſpouſe the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy, to procure the Name of being Catholicks, <hi>ib. p.</hi> 169. <hi>Sed quia aut Haereſis ſuſcipienda eſt ut Catholici dicamur, aut verè Catholici non futuri; ſi Haereſin non repudiamus, ad hanc tractatûs conditionem, neceſſitate deſcendimus.</hi>
                  <q>But becauſe we are either to become Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that we may be called Catholicks, or ceaſe to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks indeed; by becoming Hereticks we are neceſſitated to write this Treatiſe.</q>

               <p n="3">3. He aſſerts that the Revelation of Holy Scripture is ſo perfect, with reſpect to the Divinity of our Saviour, that Anathemas are to be pronounced againſt all thoſe that advance any other Doctrine. This appears from the great number of Paſſages which he quotes from thence, <hi>p.</hi> 173, <hi>&amp;</hi> 178. to which he joins the Anathema, whereof I have already ſpoke before.</p>

               <p>Thus doth he implicitly overthrow the firſt Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> the Imperfection of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Matters of Faith, the Authority and Neceſſity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which are the compleating of it, and other ſuch like Doctrines. We ſhould now proceed to examine what the State of theſe Dioceſſes was in the following Century, but that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſtops us, to reflect upon the Hiſtory and Doctrine of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> whoſe Name is too famous, and his Memory too unworthily torn by that Biſhop, not to afford him that Defence which his Zeal againſt Superſtition doth juſtly deſerve.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. An Examination of the Opinions of <hi>Vigilantius.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIgilantius</hi> was born in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> as is proved by <hi>de Marca,</hi> in a Diſſertation of his which is not yet publiſhed, and Prieſt in the Dioceſs of <hi>Barcelona</hi>; he had contracted a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friendſhip with St. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who was ordained Prieſt at <hi>Barcelona</hi>; St. <hi>Paulinus</hi> recommended him in particular to St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> as he paſſed through <hi>Campania,</hi> where St. <hi>Paulinus</hi> was Biſhop, in his way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; St. <hi>Jerome</hi> received him with all the Affection poſſible, in the Year 394. and calls him the Holy Prieſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> in his 13<hi>th</hi> Epiſtle to St. <hi>Paulinus.</hi> He made no long ſtay in the <hi>Holy Land</hi>; it is probable that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about <hi>Origeniſm,</hi> which troubled that Province, obliged
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50988:22"/>
him to return the ſooner. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſeems to inſinuate that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius</hi> had been gained by <hi>Rufinus,</hi> Enemy to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and that after <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was come into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in ſome other Provinces, he accuſed St. <hi>Jerom</hi> for having too great a Liking for the Writings of <hi>Origen, &amp;c.</hi> decrying him every-where as an <hi>Origeniſt.</hi> This was the true Cauſe of the Hate and Rage of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> whereof we have a very ſenſible Inſtance in his 75<hi>th</hi> Epiſtle, which he wrote againſt <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius</hi> about the Year 397. where he treats him with the greateſt Indignity. <hi>Vigilantius</hi> being returned into <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſeems to have made his abode there, and to have publiſhed a certain Treatiſe, about the Year 406. againſt the worſhipping of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which about 60 Years before, was introduced into the Church. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> being informed hereof, had an Occaſion offered him of defending the Superſtition of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the Cenſures of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and of unloading againſt him the moſt injurious Language that Hatred could inſpire.</p>
               <p>The Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have not been wanting long ſince, to draw their Advantage from theſe Invectives of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> againſt the Proteſtants, and never ſpeak of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> but as a Heretick. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath carefully traced their Steps: he tells us therefore after his manner very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that even in the fourth Century, the moſt clear-ſighted of all the reſt, there was found but one only, <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> who oppoſed himſelf againſt the Honours given to the Saints, and the worſhipping of their Relicks, yet he is look'd upon by the Proteſtants, as the Perſon who has preſerved the <hi>Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that is to ſay, the Succeſſion of the Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and is preferred by them to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who hath the whole Church for him.</p>
               <p>This of Neceſſity obligeth us to take a particular view of the Opinions of <hi>Vigilantius.</hi> I ſhall not make a ſtop to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate what the Biſhop ſaith that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> wrote in the fourth Century, nor at his endeavouring to cloak the Notion of his Church concerning the religious Worſhip they give to Saints and to Relicks, under the indeterminate Expreſſion of the Honours of Saints, and the Worſhip of Relicks: But to come to the thing it ſelf, I maintain, that if <hi>Vigilantius</hi> had the Misfortune
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50988:22"/>
of falling under the Diſpleaſure of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> by the Cenſure he pronounced againſt the popular Superſtition of rendring vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Honours to the Relicks of Saints, yet was he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church that then was, nor treated as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. <hi>Gennadius</hi> owns that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> had an elegant Stile, and that his Zeal for Religion had engaged him to write. I own that he charges him with a Miſtake in his Explication of the ſecond Viſion of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in ſome other Articles for which he reckoneth him amongſt Hereticks. But we are to take notice, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> that <hi>Gennadius</hi> wrote an hundred Years after <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> and ſo follows the Judgment St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had given before of him. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That he calls theſe Articles Heretical, after the manner of ancient Authors, who very frankly beſtowed the Name of Hereſy on every thing that diſpleaſed them, though it had never been condemned by the Scripture, nor rejected by the Body of the Church. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That he look'd upon theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Hereſies as of very ſmall Importance, becauſe he ſpeaks of an abſurd Explication of the ſecond Viſion of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had revived, as of an Error more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than thoſe of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> which he does not expreſs, and mentions them as Trifles. However be it as it will if the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> maintains theſe two things; 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi> was the only Man that oppoſed the Honours of the Saints, and the Worſhip of Relicks; and 2<hi>dly.</hi> That St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had the whole Church on his ſide in his Anſwer; I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the Biſhop, that either he is deceived himſelf, or was willing to deceive his Reader, in both theſe things.</p>
               <p>The Falſity of the firſt will appear to every one that can read St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi>; St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf witneſſeth, that the holy Biſhop, in whoſe Dioceſs <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was a Prieſt, that is to ſay, the Biſhop of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> was of <hi>Vigilantius</hi>'s Opinion: ſo that we have already diſcovered one Biſhop, whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> endeavoured to conceal from us; but we ſhall find a greater number whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf owns to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Vigilantius</hi>'s Opinion, leſt we ſhould imagine that <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi> and his Biſhop were Schiſmaticks:
<q>O horrible! ſaith St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> ſome Biſhops alſo are ſaid to be Partakers of his Crimes:</q>
And we may judg of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Moderation by that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50988:23"/>
which follows; <hi>Si tamen Epiſcopi nominandi ſunt, qui non ordinant Diaconos niſi primo uxores duxerint, nulli caelibi credentes pudicitiam:</hi>
                  <q>If we may call them Biſhops, who ordain none to be Deacons except they be married, not truſting the Chaſtity of any unmarried Perſon.</q>
What then ſhall we conclude that ſo many Churches whoſe Biſhops and Prieſts were all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, had no lawful Biſhops or Prieſts? Can any thing be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more extravagant than this? To this Acknowledgment of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> we may add what he ſaith himſelf on the 65<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>; for he owns that <hi>Vigilantius</hi>'s blaming of that popular Superſtition, had induced divers Perſons in <hi>Gaul,</hi> to abſtain from frequenting the Churches of the Martyrs, and to withdraw themſelves from the Prayers that were made there. The Falſity of the ſecond Article will be no leſs evident, if we examine the manner of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s defending himſelf againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi>; for though he had undertaken to run down <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> yet after all he agrees with him in the main.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> owns in his 53<hi>d</hi> Epiſtle, which he writes to <hi>Riparius,</hi> that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> had writ twice againſt the Worſhip of Relicks, and that he called thoſe that adored them, <hi>Cinerarii</hi> and Idolaters, <hi>qui mortuorum hominum oſſa venerarentur,</hi> who did honour the Bones of dead Men; for which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> calls him a Samaritan and a Jew, becauſe he counted dead Bodies to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, as if Chriſtians ſtill lived under the Law.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Vigilantius</hi> blamed the Cuſtom of honouring them in the Churches, becauſe it was a piece of Superſtition in a Place dedicated to religious Worſhip, to beſtow any Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Creatures, though the moſt holy and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that might be. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is forced to prevaricate upon this Charge; his way of defending this matter is ſuch as would never pleaſe the Palat of the Church of <hi>Rome. Nos autem non dico Martyrum reliquias, ſed ne Solem quidem &amp; Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, non Angelos, non Archangelos, non Cherubin, non Seraphim, &amp; omne nomen quod nominatur, &amp; in praeſenti ſaeculo &amp; in futuro, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus &amp; adoramus, ne ſerviamus Creaturae potius quam Creatori, qui eſt Benedictus in ſaecula. Honoramus autem reliquias Martyrum, ut cum, cujus ſunt Martyres adoremus, honoramus ſervos, ut honor ſervorum redundet ad Dominum, qui ait, qui vos ſuſcipit, me ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50988:23"/>
Ergo Petri &amp; Pauli immundae ſunt Reliquiae, ergo Moyſi corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum immundum erit, quod juxta Hebraicam veritatem, ab ipſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultum eſt Domino; &amp; quotieſcunque Apoſtolorum &amp; Prophetarum &amp; omnium Martyrum Baſilicas ingredimur, toties Idolorum templa vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramur, accenſique ante tumulos eorum cerei Idololatriae inſignia ſunt.</hi>
                  <q>But we neither worſhip nor adore, I do not ſay the Relicks of Martyrs, but not ſo much as the Sun and Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor any Name that is named in this World, or in that which is to come, leſt we ſhould ſerve the Creature rather than God, who is bleſſed for ever: But we honour the Relicks of the Martyrs, in worſhipping him whoſe they are; we honour the Servants, that their Honour may redound to the Lord, who ſaith, He that receives you, receives me: What are the Relicks then of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> unclean? Is the Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> unclean? which according to the Hebrew Truth was buried by the Lord himſelf; and as often as we enter the Churches of the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Martyrs, do we worſhip the Temples of Idols? and ſhall we ſay that the Tapers which burn before their Monuments are the Marks of Idolatry?</q>
               </p>
               <p>What a fine Application doth St. <hi>Jerom</hi> make here of that Paſſage? <hi>He that receives you, receives me</hi>; and how ſolid an Anſwer doth he return to a ſolid Objection, when he tells us, <hi>We honour the Servants in worſhipping him whoſe they are?</hi> What a Conſequence is this? Is there any other Honour due to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, beſides that of being interred? Was not this the Cuſtom uſed to the Chriſtians of old, before the time of <hi>Conſtantius?</hi> It is well enough ſeen, that the good Father skips over the Difficulty, and under a general Proteſtation of worſhipping nothing but God, he endeavours to ſhelter a Cuſtom which had been introduced after the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s time, that is to ſay, about 60 Years before. <hi>Vigilantius</hi> blamed the Cuſtom which but a little before had been introduced of lighting Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before the Tombs of Martyrs, and paſſing the Night by them in Prayer, wherein he followed the Maxims of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Elvira,</hi> held under the Empire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> about 90 Years before. After what manner doth St. <hi>Jerom</hi> refute theſe Complaints of <hi>Vigilantius?</hi> he tells us of the Preſence of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50988:24"/>
Angels at the Grave of Jeſus Chriſt; he relies upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Apoſtles, who buried the Body of St. <hi>Stephen:</hi> He produceth the Cuſtom of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Apoſtles, who ſpent the Night in Prayer; and all this without doubt extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the purpoſe, and the Proteſtants are much in the wrong, to prefer the Opinions of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> to ſuch ſolid Reaſonings as theſe.</p>
               <p>But it may be replied, That St. <hi>Jerom</hi> diſputed only ſlightly, and for Argument's ſake, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Riparius,</hi> not having then ſeen the Writing of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and therefore handled the matter only as a Declaimer.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the beſt Excuſe that can be alledged to make the Reader digeſt the furious Tranſports and Invectives of this famous Monk, who treats <hi>Vigilantius</hi> no otherwiſe than as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Julian the Apoſtate,</hi> and ſeems very willing to have had him deſtroyed by the Law mentioned in the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> And after all this, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is the ſame in his Book againſt <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> which follows this Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>After a Preface which out-does all the Monſters that either the Scripture or Fables ſpeak of, he begins thus; <hi>Exortus eſt ſubito Vigilantius, ſeu verius Dormitantius, qui immundo ſpiritu pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net contra Chriſti ſpiritum, &amp; Martyrum neget ſepulcra veneranda, damnandas dicat eſſe Vigilias, nunquam niſi in Paſcha Alleluja cantan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, continentiam Haereſin, Pudicitiam Libidinis ſeminarium; &amp; quomodo Euphorbus in Pythagora renatus eſſe perhibetur; ſic in iſto Joviniani mens prava ſurrexit, ut in illo, &amp; in hoc Diaboli reſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cogamur inſidiis.</hi>
                  <q>Here is ſuddenly ſtarted up one <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> or rather <hi>Dormitantius,</hi> who with an unclean Spirit fights againſt the Spirit of Chriſt, and denies that any Veneration ought to be given to the Sepulchres of Martyrs, condemns the Watchings at them, affirms that Alleluja's ought to be ſung at no time except Eaſter, calls Continence Hereſy, and Chaſtity the Nurſery of Luſt; ſo that as <hi>Euphorbus</hi> was ſaid to be born again in <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> in like manner in him ſeems to be revived <hi>Jovinianus</hi>'s Wickedneſs, in whom as we were forced to oppoſe our ſelves againſt the Wiles of the Devil, ſo likewiſe are we now equally obliged to oppoſe this Man's Errors.</q>
What <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Eloquence is this? What a ſtrange Account of things is here?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50988:24"/>But there is ſomething worſe behind, ſee what Stories he tells of <hi>Jovinian: Eccleſiae Authoritate damnatus inter Phaſides aves &amp; carnes ſuillas, non tam emiſit ſpiritum, quam eructavit, iſte Caupo Callaguritanus,</hi> &amp; in perverſum propter nomen viculi, mutus Quintilianus: <hi>Miſcet aquam vino, &amp; de priſtino artificio, ſuae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nena perfidiae Catholicae fidei ſociare conatur, impugnare virginita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, odiſſe pudicitiam, in convivio ſaecularium contra ſanctorum Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia proclamare, dum inter phialas philoſophatur, &amp; ad placentas li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guriens, Pſalmorum modulatione mulcetur, ut tantum inter Epulas David &amp; Idithum &amp; Aſaph &amp; filiorum Core cantica audire dignetur.</hi> Surely the good St. <hi>Jerom</hi> did not think of what he ſaid, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly was he tranſported with an inconſiderate Zeal for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy; but however, this Zeal of his had a reaſonable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: <hi>Prohnefas!</hi> ſaid he. This is the firſt Hereſy of <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>; he would have it allowed to Miniſters to marry, whereas in the ten Provinces ſubject to the Pope, in the ſeventeen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Juriſdiction of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and in the five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Egypt</hi> they followed a contrary Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>This without doubt was a crying Hereſy, and yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Decretal of Pope — to <hi>Hymerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tarracona,</hi> that it had made ſo little Impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, that <hi>Innocent</hi> I. was fain to write A. D. 405. to <hi>Exuperius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> upon the ſame Subject of the Celibacy of the Clergy, ſo much oppoſition did that Buſineſs every where meet with at that time. We muſt conſider further the manner how St. <hi>Jerom</hi> applies the Paſſage, which only regards Adultery, to the Celibacy of the Clergy: But this is only by way of Preface.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us at firſt, that he had received <hi>Vigilantius</hi>'s Book, by the Care of <hi>Riparius</hi> and <hi>Deſiderius,</hi> who lived near the Countries that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> had infected with his Opinions, and that he had been informed by them, that there were ſome there who favoured his Vices, and were pleaſed with his Blaſphemies: After having branded his Book for a ſtupid piece of Ignorance, and which did not deſerve to be diſcuſs'd, were it not for the ſake of ſome <hi>ſilly Women, laden with Sins,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. he aſſaults <hi>Vigilantius</hi> upon the account of the place of his Birth; he was born at <hi>Calaguri,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50988:25"/>
whereupon St. <hi>Jerom</hi> makes a learned Diſquiſition into the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of that People, from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time: <hi>Nimirum,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>reſpondet generi ſuo, ut qui de Latronum &amp; Convenarum natus eſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, quos Cn. Pompeius, edomitâ Hiſpaniâ, &amp; ad Triumphum redire feſtinans, de Pyrenaei jugis depoſuit, &amp; in unum oppidum congregavit, unde &amp; Convenarum urbs nomen accepit, hucuſque latrocinetur contra Eccleſiam, &amp; de Vectonibus, Arrebacis, Celtiberiſque deſcendens, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſet Galliarum Eccleſias, portetque nequaquam vexillum Chriſti, ſed inſigne Diaboli. Fecit hoc idem Pompeius etiam in Orientis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ut Cilicibus &amp; Iſauris Piratis, Latronibuſque ſuperatis, ſui no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis inter Ciliciam &amp; Iſauriam conderet civitatem. Sed haec urbs hodie ſervat ſcita Majorum, &amp; nullus in ea ortus eſt Dormitantius: Galliae vernaculum hoſtem ſuſtinent, &amp; hominem moti capitis, atque Hippocraticis vinculis alligandum, ſedentem ſinunt in Eccleſia &amp; inter caetera verba Blaſphemiae, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>He indeed (ſaith he) every way anſwers his Extraction; for being deſcended from Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and a mix'd Rabble drawn together from ſeveral parts, whom <hi>Pompey</hi> after he had conquered <hi>Spain,</hi> and haſting to his Triumph, removed from the tops of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills, and gathered them into one City, which therefore was called the City of Strangers; what wonder is it then, if being ſuch a one, he ravage and ſpoil the Church, and if deriving his Pedigree from the <hi>Vectones, Arrebaci</hi> and <hi>Celtiberi,</hi> he make Incurſions upon the <hi>Gallick</hi> Churches, fighting not under Chriſt's but the Devil's Banner? <hi>Pompey</hi> alſo did the ſame in the Eaſt, where after he had overcome the Pirates and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Iſauria,</hi> he built a City bearing his own Name, between <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Iſauria:</hi> but to this day that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obſerves their Fore-fathers Cuſtoms, and never produced any <hi>Dormitantius</hi>; whereas <hi>Gaul</hi> maintains an home-bred Enemy, and ſuffers a Man that is half mad, one fit to be bound in <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Bands, to ſit in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <q>What need is there for thee, not only to venerate, but alſo adore ſomething I know not what which thou worſhippeſt, carrying it about in a little Box. And again in the ſame Book; why doſt thou kiſs by way of Worſhip, a little Duſt wrapt up in Linnen? And afterwards; We have almoſt ſeen a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Rite introduced into the Churches; whole heaps of wax Tapers lighted in the Face of the Sun, and Men every where kiſſing a little Duſt, ſhut up in a ſmall Box, with religious Reverence, which is wrapt about with fine Linnen. Theſe Men muſt need render a great Honour to the moſt Bleſſed Martyrs, whom they ſuppoſe to ſtand in need of the Illuſtration of vile Candles, whereas the Lamb that is in the midſt of the Throne, doth illuminate them with all the Brightneſs of his Majeſty.</q>
This is a dreadful Crime in <hi>Vigilantius</hi> beyond all controverſy.</p>
               <p>Who is there, replies St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to this, that ever adored the Martyrs? And he proves that it may not be done by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> are concerned to enquire whether St. <hi>Jerom</hi> was very Orthodox, in denying a thing which at preſent cannot be ſo abſolutely denied, without the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſy. After St. <hi>Jerom</hi> has ſhewn his Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Expreſſion, <hi>Illud neſcio quid,</hi> as if <hi>Vigilantius</hi> therein had ſpoke Blaſphemy, and derogated from the Honour due to the Martyrs, he defends his Judgment by the Examples of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that is to ſay, of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who had tranſported to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the Relicks of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and of the Emperor <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who had caus'd the Bones of the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to be brought out of <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Thrace,</hi> with the Approbation of the Biſhops and People of that time. This is a very ſolid Defence, if we may believe St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> for it ſeems there is no more to be ſaid, when once a Superſtition comes to be 60 years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50988:26"/>That which diſpleaſeth, is, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> goes about to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this popular Worſhip, by this curious way of arguing. <hi>Mortuum ſuſpicaris, &amp; idcirco blaſphemas; lege Evangelium, Deus Abraham, Deus Iſaac, Deus Jacob; non eſt Deus mortuorum, ſed vivorum. Si ergo vivunt, honeſto juxta te carcere non clauduntur: Ais enim vel in ſinu Abraham, vel in loco refrigerii, vel ſubter Aram Dei, animas Apoſtolorum &amp; Martyrum conſediſſe, nec poſſe ſuis tumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis &amp; ubi voluerint adeſſe praeſentes; ſenatoriae videlicet dignitatis ſunt, ut non inter Homicidas teterrimo carcere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſed in liberâ honeſtâque cuſtodiâ in Fortunatarum Inſulis &amp; in Campis Elyſiis recludantur.

Si Agnus ubique, ergo &amp; hi qui cum Agno ſunt, ubique eſſe credendi ſunt. Et cum Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus &amp; Daemones toto vagentur orbe, &amp; celeritate nimiâ ubique praeſentes ſint, Martyres poſt effuſionem ſanguinis, ſui arcâ operientur incluſi, &amp; inde exire non poterunt?</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Thou ſuppoſeſt him to be dead, and therefore thou blaſphemeſt; Read the Goſpel, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob; he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. But if they be alive, ſay you, they ought not to be ſhut up in ſuch narrow Priſons; and you own that the Souls of the Apoſtles and Martyrs have taken up their abode either in the Boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or in a Place of Refreſhment, or under the Altar of God, and they cannot be preſent at their Tombs, or where-ever they pleaſe: for by your account, they are Perſons of the firſt Quality, and ſo ought not to be ſhut up amongſt Murtherers in a filthy Dungeon, but to enjoy a free and honourable Cuſtody in the fortunate Iſlands, and the Elyſian Fields. Thus you limit and ſet Laws to God, and bind the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in Chains, and keep them in cuſtody till the Day of Judgment; ſo that they cannot be with their Lord, of whom it is written, that they follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes. Now ſeeing the Lamb is every where, they who are with the Lamb muſt be ſuppoſed to be every-where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and when the Devil and Spirits do wander throughout the whole World, and by their over great Nimbleneſs, are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50988:26"/>
preſent every-where, ſhall we ſay that the Martyrs after the ſhedding of their Blood, are ſhut up in their Coffins without being able to ſtir from thence?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe fine Reaſonings of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi> have two Characters. The 1<hi>ſt,</hi> is, that they are contrary to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of moſt of the Antients; The 2<hi>d,</hi> is, that they have been deſpiſed by St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> And in fine, have diſpleaſed all the Schoolmen; ſo that it is not worth while to contradict them. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> handles the reſt of his Matter much at the ſame rate. <hi>Dicis in libello tuo, quod dum vivimus, mutui pro nobis orare poſſumus poſtquam autem mortui fuerimus, nullius ſit pro Deo exaudienda oratio: praeſertim cum Martyres ultionem ſui obſecrantes impetrare non quiverint.</hi>
                  <q>You ſay in your Book, That whilſt we are alive we may mutually pray for one another, but that after we are once dead, no Man's Prayer can be heard for another; and the rather, becauſe even the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs themſelves begging of God that he would avenge their Blood, have not been able to obtain their requeſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is it St. <hi>Jerom</hi> anſwers to this? he ſaith, That if the Saints, when alive, procured Favours for others, they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them much rather now when they are with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing they are not dead, but aſleep, as the Scripture tells us.</p>
               <p>As to the wax Tapers, the uſe of which is blamed by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us ſomething that will not over-well agree with the Church of <hi>Rome.

                  <q>Neither do we light wax Tapers at Noon-day, as you cauſleſly complain, but only to allay the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50988:27"/>
Darkneſs of the Night with the help of Candles, and to be kept waking by the Light of them, leſt being in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we ſhould fall aſleep as well as you: But, and if ſome out of Ignorance and Simplicity amongſt the Lay-men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Women, of whom we may truly ſay, that they have a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledg, ſhould do this in honour to the Martyrs, what is the loſs or hurt of all this? So the Apoſtles alſo murmur'd of old, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made waſte of her Ointment; but were reproved by our Lord himſelf; neither did the Lord want the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any more than the Martyrs ſtand in need of Wax Tapers; and yet becauſe the Woman did it in honour to Chriſt, her Devotion is accepted of; and ſo they who light wax Tapers, receive a reward according to their Faith; for the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Let every one abound in his own Senſe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>One cannot avoid taking notice how St. <hi>Jerom</hi> abuſeth this Paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Pretence he gives for adjudging Rewards, to all ſorts of Superſtition; however we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that in this Article St. <hi>Jerom</hi> hath many more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers than <hi>Vigilantius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilantius</hi> call'd them Idolaters, who by lighting Wax Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by Day-light, did imitate the Cuſtoms of the Heathens. How does St. <hi>Jerom</hi> anſwer him. Firſt, He tells him, that what was done of this kind to Idols, was deteſtable, but that the ſame thing when done out of reſpect to the Martyrs, is very commendable. 2<hi>ly,</hi> That the Eaſtern Churches lighted Candles at the reading of the Goſpel, though there be no Relicks of the Martyrs. 3<hi>ly,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt aſſigns to the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Lamps lighted. 4<hi>ly,</hi> He oppoſeth to <hi>Vigilantius</hi> the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who celebrated the Maſs upon the Tombs of the Apoſtles, as upon an Altar. I fear I ſhould tire the Patience of my Reader, ſhould I go about to examine this Piece of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s throughout, this Specimen may ſuffice to judg of the whole Work.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore only reduce to ſome few Articles, what I have further to add, in order to the full clearing of this Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50988:27"/>1. I affirm, that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> had no reaſon to ſay that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> oppoſed himſelf againſt the Honours done to Saints. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> does not accuſe him of it in any part of his Works, he only blames him becauſe he was not for giving them ſo great Honour as other Men did. <hi>Quid neceſſe eſt tanto honore, non tantum honorare, ſed etiam adorare illud neſcio quid?</hi> 
                  <q>What neceſſity is there not only to honour, but even to adore and worſhip I know not what, with ſo very great Honour?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis for the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> to tell us, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves with St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was an Heretick for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Souls of Saints are preſent at their Graves; and whether St. <hi>Jerom</hi> doth ſolidly prove, that we ought to believe them to be every-where, where Jeſus Chriſt is; becauſe it is ſaid in the Revelations, that <hi>the Virgins follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The truth is, <hi>Vigilantius</hi> ſtretch'd the Point too far, in maintaining, that after we are dead, the Prayer of any one for another cannot be heard. Probably alſo he might be too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, in refuſing to enter into the Churches of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, to ſignify his Averſion to the Superſtition which then began to be introduc'd, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> complains, <hi>De moribus Eccleſ.—cap.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But it is falſe, that becauſe <hi>Vigilantius</hi> found fault with the Adoration of Relicks; therefore St. <hi>Jerom</hi> maintain'd the ſame to be lawful: he was ſo far from that, that he upbraids <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> with calumniating the Church by this his Accuſation. <hi>Quis, O inſanum caput! aliquando Martyres adoravit? Quis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem putavit Deum?</hi> 
                  <q>Who ever, O fooliſh Man, adored the Martyrs? Who ever took a Man to be God?</q> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> takes Adoration to be an Act due to God alone, and which he does not divide in two ſorts, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does at this day, which indeed makes three different ſorts of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is falſe, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> maintains that the Church prayed to Saints, whereof <hi>Vigilantius</hi> accuſeth thoſe againſt whom he had writ. He agrees with <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> that the Saints ought not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50988:28"/>
to be prayed to even as Friends to Chriſt, and Interceſſors with God; <hi>Ne ut Amici quidem Dei &amp; comprecatores ad Deum.</hi> Is it not manifeſt that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> abuſes the World, when he quotes St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which prays to Saints on both theſe accounts, which are ſo expreſly rejected by St. <hi>Jerom</hi>; and when he upbraids the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants for following of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> in an Article which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> owns as well as he, and the whole Church at that time? But to ſpeak the truth, The whole of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> his Crime, conſiſts: 1<hi>ſt,</hi> In that he was willing to bring the Diſcipline of the Council of <hi>Elvira</hi> in force again, which was aſſembled at the beginning of the 4<hi>th</hi> Century; the Conſtitutions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were undervalued towards the end of the ſame Age, after the Chriſtian Religion began to bear down all its Oppoſers, under the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and his Children. 2<hi>ly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he attributes to the Church ſome Cuſtoms, which were not all of them authorized, though they were already generally received and maintained by the Ignorant and Superſtitious ſort of People. 3<hi>ly,</hi> Becauſe he oppoſed ſome Cuſtoms as general, which were capable of being explained in a tolerable Senſe. But indeed at the bottom, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> were very well agreed upon the Point we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; neither do we find that the Church, to which <hi>Vigilantius</hi> did belong, did ever except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Thus it is evident, that the Proteſtants may look upon <hi>Vigilantius</hi> as a zealous Defender of the Chriſtian Purity, and one of thoſe who oppos'd themſelves againſt Superſtition in its firſt riſe.</p>

                  </note> that this holy Biſhop carried the Euchariſt in a Wicker-Basket, a way by no means agreeable to the Cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where it is accompanied with quite different Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Becauſe it is made the Object of Adoration, and that in the very Streets. 2<hi>ly,</hi> Becauſe People dare not touch the leaſt Crumb of it, as being perſuaded that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is in the Hoſt, multiplies according to the number of the Crumbs, into which the Hoſt may be broken. 3<hi>ly,</hi> Becauſe by this means it might come to be trod under foot or loſt, upon which a thouſand Inconveniencies muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>It is worth obſerving here concerning this Cuſtom of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt about, which was in uſe in the 2<hi>d</hi> Century, as appears from the Writings of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>; that it differ'd very much from what we find in the Romiſh Church, ſince the 12<hi>th</hi> Century. For indeed ſince that time, <hi>Rome</hi> has taken great care to obtain Laws whereby all that walk in the Streets, whether Jews, Heathens or Chriſtians, might be compelled to adore, what ſhe looks upon as her God. But we find nothing like this in any Law of the Emperors or Chriſtian Princes in favour of the Adoration of the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Witneſs whom we may conſult about the State of theſe Dioceſſes, is <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> Monk of <hi>Primuliacum</hi> in <hi>Guienne.</hi> And ſince he wrote at a time, when the Zeal for that kind of Life did tranſport the beſt Men, we need not wonder that he hath inſerted ſo many Fables in the Books

               </p>
               <p>I ought in this Place to mention a Canon of the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Orange</hi> held in the year 441, at which 15 of the Biſhops of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> and the Country about <hi>Lions</hi> aſſiſted. 'Tis the XVII Canon; the firſt Words are theſe, <hi>Cum Capſa &amp; Calix offerendus eſt</hi> (other MSS. have <hi>inferendus,</hi> which ſeems more agreeable to reaſon) <hi>&amp; admixitione Euchariſtiae conſecrandus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find that this Canon does hint at theſe two things very clearly. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That at that time they kept the Bread of the Euchariſt in a Casket or Coffer, ſo far were they from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50988:35"/>
making it an Object of their Adoration. 2<hi>d,</hi> That the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling only of the Bread that was conſecrated before, with the Wine that was not conſecrated, made them look upon the Wine, though not conſecrated by the Words of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; which is the moſt extravagant and ſenſleſs Notion in the World, if we ſuppoſe that theſe Fathers were ſeaſon'd with the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which attributes to the Words of Chriſt, only the Virtue of changing the Subſtance of the Wine into the Subſtance of the Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Allatius</hi> takes a great deal of pains to avoid this Argument, which ſhews, that the Greek Church, that believes the ſame, cannot be of the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time, the thing is certain,<note place="margin">Comment. de Ordine Rom. pag. 139.</note> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billon</hi> has ingenuouſly acknowledged, that this is the true ſenſe of that Canon. And indeed there are many Proofs that make it evident, that both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers were of this Opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Salonius</hi> one of the moſt famous Biſhops of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> owns no other Doctrine but that of the Old and New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Drink Waters out of thine own Ciſtern;</hi>

                  <q>By Ciſtern he means the Catholick Doctrine, that is, that of the Old and New-Teſtament; and by the Well, he underſtands the Depth and Height of the ſame Catholick Doctrine, that is, the various meanings of holy Scripture: For in theſe Words, he teacheth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Doctrine of Hereticks, and to attend to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Holy Scripture.</q>

                  <q>By the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Bounds he underſtands the Bounds of Truth and Faith, which Catholick Doctors have plac'd from the beginning.</q>
He would have no Man therefore receive the Truth of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith and Goſpel-Doctrine, any otherwiſe than it hath been handed down to them by the Holy Fathers; and likewiſe commands that no Man interpret the Words of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, otherwiſe than according to the Intention of each Writer.</p>

thereby meaning the Euchariſt or the Sacrament, which was given in little Bits.

               </p>
               <p>This we may ſee in his Extract of the Sentences of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> where he repeats what that Father had ſaid upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33. upon occaſion of theſe Words of the vulgar Verſion, which ſays, that <hi>David ferebatur in manibus ſuis,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Achiſh.</hi> Where it clearly appears, that he underſtood thoſe Words as well as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did, of the Sacrament of his Body, which may be called his Body in ſome ſenſe; that is to ſay, by way of Likeneſs, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> expreſſeth himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
               <p>I cite nothing here from thoſe other Works, which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him, becauſe indeed they are none of his.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only obſerve two things: The firſt is, that in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Demetrius</hi> he plainly ſhews, that he knew nothing of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the Neceſſity of the Miniſters Intention for the Validity of the Sacraments: for there he attributes all to the Work of God, and not to that of the Miniſter, according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> upon the Queſtion of the Validity of Baptiſm conferred by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
               <p>The other is, that as he follows St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in the Matter of Free Grace, as one may ſee in his Poems gathered from the Opinions of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his Sentences, ſo he rejects the Doctrine of Merit and Works, as a pure <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine, in ſeveral Places of his Writings.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We muſt join with theſe Authors, <hi>Arnobius</hi> the Rhetorician (ſince it is very probable that he lived in <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> becauſe he has dedicated ſome of his Works to <hi>Leontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Riez,</hi> who died about the year 485.) <hi>Arnobius</hi> explains his Belief in the Matter of the Euchariſt after this

               <p n="2">2. We ſee clearly that he did not own the Exiſtence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, in the manner of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe he maintains all Creatures to be corporeal; and

that the Soul is diſtinctly in a certain place,<note place="margin">Lib. de Creat. Pag. 598.</note> becauſe if it were otherwiſe, we muſt conclude it to be every where. That which is very ſtrange, is, that <hi>Mamertus,</hi> who hath refuted him, doth yet more directly thwart this Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the various Hypotheſes which he propoſeth when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes this <hi>Fauſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Riez.</hi> But this Century hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd me too long; I proceed now therefore to conſider the State of theſe Dioceſſes in the Sixth Century.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The State of theſe Dioceſſes in the Sixth Century.</head>
               <p>WE do not find ſo many Authors of theſe Dioceſſes in the Sixth Century, as we have had in the foregoing: but however, thoſe we have of them, are ſufficient to inform us what their State was. I begin with St. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who aſſiſted at the Council of <hi>Agde</hi> in the year 502, and died in 542; ſo that he reach'd almoſt the middle of this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
               <p>This great Man fully repreſents the Notion that he had of the Euchariſt, when he ſhews, that in Baptiſm there is the ſame Change, and the ſame Preſence of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt which he owns in the Euchariſt;<note place="margin">Pag. 278.</note> as appears in his 4<hi>th</hi> and 5<hi>th Homily.</hi> But in his 7<hi>th Homily,</hi> he ſpeaks in ſuch a manner as needs no Commentary:
<q>And therefore ſince he was now about to withdraw his aſſumed Body from our Eyes, and carry it up to Heaven, it was needful that the ſame day he ſhould conſecrate for us the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, that he might continually be remembred by the Myſtery which was once offer'd up for our Redemption:</q>
that ſo ſeeing his Interceſſion for the Salvation of Man was daily and continual, the offering up of our Redemption might be perpetual alſo, that this everlaſting Sacrifice might live in our Memory, and be always preſent by Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50988:38"/>2. Though he ſpeaks of the Euchariſt as changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the Power of God, yet he maintains that it is by Faith, and by the Acts of Underſtanding, that we can partake thereof. See how he ſpeaks to a Chriſtian who hath been regenerated by Baptiſm.
<q>Wherefore as without any bodily feeling, having laid aſide what before thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemedſt advantageous, thou art ſuddenly become clothed with a new Dignity: and as it is not thy Eyes, but thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that perſuades thee that God hath healed what was wounded in thee, blotted out thy Sins, and waſh'd away thy Stains; ſo when thou goeſt up to the venerable Altar to be ſatisfied with Food, thou may'ſt ſee the ſacred Body and Blood of thy God by Faith, admire it with Reverence, reach it with thy Mind, receive it with thy Heart, and above all, take it in with thy Soul.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He expreſly aſſerts, that the Body which the Prieſt diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, is as well in a little Part as in the Whole; which agrees only with the Sacrament, and not with the natural Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He maintains, that the Oblation of the Bread and Wine made by <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> did typically ſignify the Sacrifice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; which is abſolutely falſe, if it be true that the Conſecration deſtroys the Nature of the things offered, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes. Hear what he ſaith:
<q>He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> (whoſe Genealogy or Original was unknown to thoſe of that time) by the offering of Bread and Wine did foreſhew this Sacrifice of Chriſt: of whom the Prophet pronounceth, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, according to the order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> And Bleſſed <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ſpeaking of this Myſtery, ſignifies the Wine and Blood with one Word; <hi>Long before,</hi> (pointing at the Lord's Paſſion) <hi>in the Bleſſing of the Patriarch, he ſhall waſh his Garment in Wine, and his Clothes in the Blood of the Grape.</hi> Mark how evidently it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Creature Wine is called the Blood of Chriſt. Conſider what thou art further to enquire concerning this twofold Species, ſeeing the Lord himſelf witneſſeth.</q>
                  <q>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ſaith he, you ſhall eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you; which Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50988:38"/>
is a moſt evident and ſtrong Argument againſt the Blaſphemies of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who impiouſly preſumes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Baptiſm ought to be conferred upon Infants, not to obtain Life, but to attain the Kingdom of Heaven: For by theſe Words of our Lord pronounced by the Evangeliſt, <hi>You ſhall not have Life in you,</hi> is plainly underſtood, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that hath not been baptized, is not only deprived of Glory, but Life alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the ſame Sermon, he ſaith, in Conformity with the Notion of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> about the Mixture of the Water with the Wine in the Chalice, that by the Water is repreſented the Figure of the Nations, and by the Wine the Blood of the Paſſion of our Saviour, which ſuppoſeth the Subſiſtence of the Wine, as well as of the Water, and utterly overthrows the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He overturns the Notion of the Romiſh Purgatory, and follows here alſo the Sentiments of thoſe of the Ancients, who removed Purgatory to the laſt Day of Judgment.<note place="margin">Homil. 8. pag. 282.</note>
                  <q>But if neither in our Tribulations we bleſs God, nor redeem our Sins by good Works, we ſhall ſo long abide in that Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, till all our leſſer Sins be conſumed, like Wood, Hay, and Stubble. But ſome body may ſay, What matter is it how long I ſtay there, ſo I may but at laſt paſs through into eternal Life? Let no Man ſay ſo, moſt dear Brethren, for as much as this Purgatory Fire is more painful than any thing that can be thought, ſeen or felt in this World. And ſeeing it is writ of the Day of Judgment, that it ſhall be one Day, how can any one know whether he may be Days, Months, or even Years, in paſſing through it?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In his 12<hi>th</hi> Homily he exhorts the People, not to go out of the Church on Sundays, before the Celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and makes the Prayers of the Prieſt to appear ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when there are no Communicants to receive: <hi>To whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall the Prieſt ſay, Surſum corda?</hi> But we are eſpecially to obſerve, that when he preſſes the Greatneſs of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and the Adoration due to the Sacrament, he ſays never a Word of what ſome Popiſh Orator would repreſent to us on the like Occaſion.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50988:39"/>4. In the 20<hi>th</hi> Homily he exhorts the Country People to read the Scriptures, and removes all Excuſes which they might make to avoid this Duty, with as much Earneſtneſs as thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> expreſs'd, when they would diſſwade their Auditors from the reading of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The 38<hi>th</hi> Homily is a Collection of ſeveral places of Scripture, treating of the means by which Remiſſion of Sins is granted to us. He reckons up there twelve ſeveral means, where we are to take notice, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That he doth not ſpeak one Word of confeſſing to a Prieſt, nor of the Power God hath beſtowed on them to pardon Sins, as Judges, which at preſent is the great and only mean to obtain the Pardon of Sin; thoſe other whereof St. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> ſpeaks, being of no uſe without the Pardons pronounced by the Prieſt, in the Tribunal of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That which is here peculiar is, that tho he has ſaid a very great deal about the Efficacy of Contrition for the Remiſſion of Sins, in his 29<hi>th</hi> Homily, he has not been able to avoid the <hi>cautè lege</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cenſors, as we may ſee in the <hi>Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Patrum, of the Paris Edition.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> We are to obſerve that whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to find the Sacrament of Extreme Unction and Auricular Confeſſion, in the 5<hi>th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Epiſtle; <hi>Caeſarius</hi> diſcovers nothing there, but the Chriſtian Duty of praying one for another, proceeding from the Charity we owe to our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruricius</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Limoges</hi> from the Year 535. in which he aſſiſted at the firſt Council of <hi>Auvergne:</hi> He aſſiſted alſo at the 4<hi>th</hi> Council of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in 541. and at the 5<hi>th,</hi> in 549.</p>
               <p>We have nothing left us of this Prelate, ſave his two Books of Epiſtles, though even there we can inform our ſelves about ſeveral very important Matters, which demonſtrate what the Faith was that was then received and imbraced in <hi>Aquitain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He takes for granted that dying Perſons are immediately taken up into Heaven, ſo far is he from mentioning Purgatory. See in what manner he comforts <hi>Namacius</hi> and <hi>Ceraunia,</hi>

<q>Indeed you have reaſon to take a great deal of Comfort from the Will of Chriſt, ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death was his Lot, that he has been pleaſed to take him away in that State, to which he pronounceth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50988:39"/>
of Heaven to belong, that at the ſame time you might have a Patron inſtead of a Son, and leave off deploring him as loſt, whom you ſee the Lord hath taken to himſelf.<note place="margin">Pag. 382.</note>
                  </q>
And in another place:
<q>Wherefore let your Faith wipe off your Tears, ſince we believe that thoſe who are dear to us, do not loſe their Life, but change it, they leave this World full of Sorrows, and haſten to the Region of the Bleſſed, and take their leave of this painful Pilgrimage, that they may arrive at the Land of Reſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſuppoſeth <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> to be the ſame thing, when he brings in a young Woman that enjoyed the Glory of Heaven, ſpeaking after this manner:<note place="margin">Pag. 383. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 4.</note>
                  <q>Wherefore my loving Parents, rather bewail your own Sins, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think of redeeming your own Crimes, that if you love me in Chriſt, you may be thought worthy to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Patriarch's Boſom, where the Lord, acording to the Purity of my Innocence, and his great Kindneſs, has placed me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He exhorts a Lady of his Acquaintance to the reading of Holy Scripture, when he ſent her a Painter.
<q>But, ſaith he, you ought to look for more perfect and great Inſtruments in thoſe Divine Writings from whence theſe are taken, if ever you deſire to perfect what you have begun, or attain what is promiſed you. If you thus ſeek, the Lord will give you both Knowledg and Strength to underſtand what you read, and keep what you underſtand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ferreolus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zez,</hi> muſt not be forgot by us, he was choſen in the Year 553. and died in 581. We find in the Rule that he writ for Monks, that he ſetled in his Dioceſs an uncommon Strain of Piety.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do not find him to demand the Approbation of this his Rule at <hi>Rome,</hi> as has been done for ſome Ages ſince. He ſends to the Biſhop of <hi>Die,</hi> to deſire his Advice, and afterwards publiſhed it with the Approbation only of that Biſhop, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling himſelf about any other Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He orders his Monks to work with their Hands, that they might not be chargeable to the Publick,<note place="margin">Cap. 5. Regul.</note> as all the Orders of Mendicants are at this time.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50988:40"/>3. He receives none but ſuch as are come to Mens Eſtate, and will have them tried before they be admitted, whereas St. <hi>Bennet</hi> ordained, that thoſe whom their Parents had preſented to a Monaſtery,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> ſhould from their Infancy be received and abide there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He will have the great Employment of the Monks to be the reading of the Pſalms, which he will have them go through every Week.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He will have them on Anniverſary Days of the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Saints, to read the Acts of their Martyrdom, for a worthy Celebration of the Memory of their Paſſion; but not a Word of incouraging the Monks to offer up Prayers to them on theſe ſolemn Days.<note place="margin">F. 6.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Above all he requires of every Monk daily to read the Scripture, and not to diſpenſe with it, upon any Pretence, or becauſe of any other Buſineſs whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was born in <hi>Italy,</hi> but coming into <hi>France</hi> in the Year 575. he ſtayed there in the Service of St. <hi>Radegunda,</hi> and was ordained Prieſt at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where he lived in great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation till the end of that Century. Some will have him to have been raiſed to the Epiſcopal Dignity in the ſame City, but this appears to be wholly uncertain. <hi>Gregorius Turonenſis,</hi> who often mentions him as his Friend, never gives him any other Title but that of Prieſt. However it be, it appears by his Writings, that he was very far from Popery; in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He never in the Life of St. <hi>Martin</hi> attributes to that holy Man, that upon any occaſion he prayed to the Saints for the working of his Miracles.<note place="margin">Book 3. pag. 764. <hi>Bib. Patr.</hi>
                  </note> This we may ſee in his Relation of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s raiſing a Child to Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He looks upon all Biſhops as the Vicars of St. <hi>Peter</hi>; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he ſaith to the Biſhop of <hi>Metz; Apparet Petri vos me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruiſſe vices</hi>: It appears you have deſerved to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Vicar.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We meet with nothing more commonly in the Epitaphs which he made, than this Notion, that deceaſed Believers are in Heaven; from ſuch Expreſſions as theſe; <hi>Hunc tenet ulna Dei. Inter Apoſtolicos credimus eſſe choros. Non hanc flere decet,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50988:40"/>
quam Paradiſus habet.</hi> Accordingly alſo he maintains that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom is the Heavenly Glory.<note place="margin">Pag. 796.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>; It appears from an Expoſition he hath made on the Apoſtles Creed, that he owned no Doctrines, beſides thoſe contained in that ancient Formulary, as Articles of his Faith, becauſe he makes no mention at all of thoſe new Articles which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath added to that Creed, and which ſhe impoſeth on her People, as another part of that which makes the Object of Faith.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that the Spirit of Superſtition had already made a conſiderable Progreſs in all places; we meet with an illuſtrious Example thereof in the Dioceſs of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> which joined to <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis:</hi> The People there began to render a religious Worſhip to Images, whereupon <hi>Serenus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> was forced to follow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in breaking the Images to pieces, which drew upon him the Cenſures of <hi>Gregory</hi> I.<note place="margin">Lib. 9. Ep. 9.</note> who exhorts him to erect them again, though he commends him for having oppoſed himſelf to their Adoration, and exhorts him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to inſtruct the People, to prevent their falling again into Idolatry. And it is natural to conclude, that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the People met with the ſame Checks in many other places.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The State of the Dioceſſes of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Narbon,</hi> in the Seventh Century.</head>
               <p>I am come to the Seventh Century, of which I have two pieces of great Authority to produce: The firſt concerns the Purity of theſe Dioceſſes, in regard to their Faith. There was a Council held at <hi>Toledo</hi> in the Year 633, whereat <hi>Silva</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Narbon</hi> aſſiſted, in the Name of the Biſhops of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> and they began the Synod with a Confeſſion of Faith, which ſhews beyond all Controverſy, that nothing was look'd upon by them as an Article of Faith, that was not received for ſuch in the Creed of the ancient Chriſtians; for there was not ſo much as one Word to be found there of all thoſe Articles which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> impoſeth upon thoſe of her Communion, as an Addition to the primitive Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond regards the Practice of the publick Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that is the <hi>Gothick</hi> Liturgy, which of a long time was uſed in theſe Dioceſſes; wherefore to make a fuller Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Religion of theſe Provinces, it will be of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to make ſome Remarks upon this Liturgy, which was in uſe there.</p>
               <p>It is not probable that all the Parts of it are of equal Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as may be ſeen by the Office of the Aſſumption of the Bleſſed Virgin in Soul and Body, which was rejected in <hi>France,</hi> as a thing uncertain, towards the end of the 9<hi>th</hi> Century, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Teſtimony of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuardus.</hi> One may make the ſame Judgment of divers other Offices, which are found in this <hi>Gothick</hi> Liturgy; the Barbariſm which appears in all its parts, ſufficiently ſhows its Age: In the mean time ſuch as it is, it does not want the Marks of a conſiderable Purity, which it ſeems, obliged <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. to aboliſh and ſuppreſs it with all his Might.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50988:41"/>1. We find in it the Recital of the Apoſtles Creed, as the only Profeſſion of Faith, which the Churches of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces required of thoſe who would be Partakers of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</p>
               <p n="2">2. We don't find in it any Prayer addreſs'd to Saints. It ſuppoſeth all along from one end to the other, that the Saints pray in general for the Church, and on this Ground it is, that therein they deſire God to have regard to their Prayers, and to receive their Interceſſion, their Suffrages, and ſo forth.<note place="margin">Patrocinia.</note> There is no greater ſtreſs laid upon the Power of the Bleſſed Virgin with God, than on that of the Patriarchs and Apoſtles, yea, of the Anchorets and Virgins. True it is, that there is a ſolemn Commemoration of divers Saints, but it may eaſily be perceived, that it is only done out of a Deſign to glorify God, by repreſenting to themſelves their Examples, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſpoſing themſelves to imitate them. This is done in the Office of St. <hi>Forreſtus</hi> and <hi>Ferucio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find divers Confeſſions to God before the Liturgy,<note place="margin">Pag. 271.</note> but none at all made to Angels, to the Bleſſed Virgin or Saints, as at this day is done in the Romiſh Maſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We find there no particular Diſtinction for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> only that the Biſhop of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is called the firſt of Biſhops. <hi>Mabillon</hi> in his Preface triumphs,<note place="margin">Pag. 276.</note> becauſe of this Title, but he is extreamly out in his account; for hath the firſt Biſhop any Juriſdiction over the ſecond?<note place="margin">Pag. 266.</note> the ſecond over the third? We find there the Prayer for the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but with a Clauſe which <hi>Mabillon</hi> owns to be found in all the ancient Miſſals, and is ſtruck out of the Roman Liturgy, in order to extend the Papal Monarchy over all the Earth.</p>
               <p>We do not find therein the leaſt Foot-ſtep of Prayers for the Pope, which ſhews that the Decree of the Council of <hi>Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> wherein it was ordained that Prayers ſhould be made to God for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not obſerved throughout <hi>Gaul</hi>; yea what is more, the ſame Liturgy gives the Title of Head of the Church to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>

                  <hi>Teſtis eſt dies bodierna Beati Petri Cathedra Epiſcopatus expoſita: in qua fidei merito revelationis myſterium, filium Dei confitendo, Praelatus Apoſtolus ordinatur. In cujus confeſſione eſt fundamentum Eccleſiae; nec adverſus hanc Petram portae inferi praevalent.</hi>
                  <q>St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Epiſcopal Chair, which is ſhewn to this Day, can teſtify this: wherein by reaſon of his Faith, when he confeſſed that Myſtery that was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, even the Son of God, he was ordained a Biſhop. In whoſe Confeſſion is the Foundation of the Church; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Gates of Hell prevail againſt this Rock.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We read there that the Gates of Hell do not ſignify Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will have it, but the State of the Dead, from whence the Faith which St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath profeſſed, delivers thoſe who imitate him:
<q>Let us pray, ſaith he, that the Souls of the deceaſed being brought up out of Hell, the infernal Gates may not prevail over the Dead, becauſe of their Crimes which the Church believes are overcome by the Faith of the Apoſtle.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. We find there, as in the Romiſh Maſs, an high Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrine of the Merit of Works: And though we find the Word <hi>Merit</hi> often uſed in it,<note place="margin">Pag. 230.</note> yet we alſo meet with thoſe neceſſary Explications of it, as are ſufficient to hinder any wrong Impreſſion that may be made by a Word of an ambiguous ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I do own that we find in it the Prayer for the Dead, but there are a hundred other Paſſages which ſpeak them to be in <hi>Peace,</hi> in the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> that they are at reſt; and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which very plainly import that they had not received
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50988:42"/>
the Notion of Purgatory, no more than the Authors of the Roman Liturgy had at that time.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome Paſſages in it, which ſeem to ſuppoſe the Souls departed to be in a place of Torment; but I have two things to ſay to this Point; the one is, that thoſe Miſſals, whoſe Stile comes near to the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are of a later Date: the other is, that the ordinary Article, <hi>pro pauſantibus, for thoſe who are at reſt,</hi> imports nothing like a place of Torment. To theſe two Conſiderations we may add, That what is ordinarily requeſted for them, is either that they may have a part in the firſt, that is to ſay, a more early Reſurrection, which is the ſame with the Opinion of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium:</hi> or that they may be written in the Book of Life, or carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom: which ſhews that the State of Souls after Death, was not more certainly determined by thoſe who governed theſe Churches at this time, than by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church any where elſe.</p>
               <p>We read that there are divers Flocks,<note place="margin">Pag. 279.</note> whereof each Biſhop is the Paſtor, as well St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> as <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Indeed we find that to every Biſhop is given the Title of <hi>ſummus Pontifex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 290.</note> and <hi>ſummus Sacerdos.</hi>
                  <q>Grant unto us, Lord, who this Day are celebrating the Anniverſary of the Deceaſe of thy high Prieſt and our Father, <hi>Biſhop Martin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee there the manner of adminiſtring Baptiſm, with the Unction or anointing called the <hi>Chriſmation</hi>; but we do not find that they made two Sacraments of them, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſince done.</p>
               <p>We find there alſo the Conſecration of Wax Tapers, but yet without aſcribing to them all thoſe Virtues which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes to her conſecrated Tapers in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Order.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But I go on to that which is moſt conſiderable in this Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. <hi>Mabillon,</hi> who hath publiſhed it in <hi>France,</hi> according to the Copy printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> pretends that it expreſly ſhews, that the Churches which made uſe of this Liturgy, held the Doctrine of the Real Preſence. If inſtead of ſome Paſſages that he quotes, we could find there a preciſe Order for adoring the Sacrament after Conſecration, as being become the Body
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50988:43"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, which we do not find in any part of it, there would indeed be ſome ground for his Pretenſion; but there is not ſo much as a Word to this purpoſe: which makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in theſe Dioceſſes, they had not received this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor the natural Conſequences of it any more than in any other part of the Catholick Church; for we find that as ſoon as ever this Opinion was entertained, it was immediately followed with ſupreme Adoration.</p>
               <p>Neither do we find any thing therein of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, any more than of the Adoration of the Sacrament, which is another Conſequence of the Real Preſence.</p>
               <p>We do not find any Maſſes there without Communicants. St. <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> whom I have already cited, would have account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ridiculous and a mere Profanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>; We do not find that the Communion under one kind was there thought to be a Conſequent, as it hath been in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Real Preſence: And yet one would think that the Fear of prophaning the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as being very ſubject to be ſpilt, ought to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to take the ſame Precautions, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſince done to prevent ſuch dreadful, and yet ſuch common Inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Mabillon</hi> had well conſidered theſe eſſential Defects, which a Papiſt cannot but naturally meet with in this <hi>Gothick</hi> Liturgy, in all Appearance he would not have been ſo laviſh of his Judgment. But without making uſe of theſe juſt Anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the matter in hand, let us conſider a little whether the attentive Examination of the Liturgy, be not ſufficient to clear theſe Prejudices, and oblige him to put another ſenſe upon the Words which he hath wreſted to confirm his Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The Characters we meet with in this Liturgy are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It makes a great Diſtinction between that which is taken with the Mouth, and that which is received by the Heart. <hi>Grant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 190.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, that what we have taken with our Mouths, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with our Minds, and that the temporal Gift may be to us an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Remedy.</hi> This Obſervation is decretory, for the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiators own that both Good and Bad receive the Body of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Goffridus Vindocinenſis</hi> expreſly aſſerts it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50988:43"/>
that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> has rejected it as a great Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.<note place="margin">Tr. 26. in Joan.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſuppoſeth likewiſe that Jeſus Chriſt is above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and that he is no otherwiſe near to us than by the Communion of our Nature which he hath taken to himſelf.<note place="margin">Pag. 191.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t qui te conſortem in carnis propinquitate laetantur, ad ſummorum Civium unitatem, ſuper quos corpus aſſumptum evexiſti, perducantur:</hi>
                  <q>That they who rejoice to ſee thee their Brother, in the Nearneſs of thy Fleſh, may be brought up to the Unity of thoſe higheſt Citizens, above whom thou haſt carried up thy aſſumed Body.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſuppoſeth the Sacrament to be only a Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>We remember thy Suffering,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 192.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy Body broken for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our Sins.</hi> Which is a plain Alluſion to the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. and ſhews that the Authors of this Liturgy, did underſtand them of the Croſs, and not, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, of the Euchariſt. The <hi>Ambroſian</hi> and <hi>Gallican</hi> Liturgies have followed the Senſe of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which deſerves ſome Obſervation.<note place="margin">Pag. 255.</note> We meet with the ſame thing again:
<q>Thou didſt command by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thy Servants, that the Paſſover ſhould be celebrated by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of a Lamb for ever, until the Coming of Chriſt; and haſt commanded the ſame Cuſtom to be obſerved for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſuppoſeth that we receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt ſpiritually:
<q>Let us, deareſt Brethren,<note place="margin">Pag. 193.</note> who have been fed with the Food of Heaven, and refreſhed with the Cup of the Eternal Wine, render never-ceaſing Praiſes and Thanks to our God, begging of him that we who have ſpiritually receiv'd the Sacred Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, being freed from fleſhly Vices, may deſerve to be made Spiritual.</q>
What it means by the word Spiritual is very plain,<note place="margin">Pag. 207.</note> where it calls the Dove that appeared at the Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Spiritalis Columba. And the ſpiritual Dove deſcending upon his Head by the Holy Ghoſt, that cameſt thy ſelf.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 231. P. 296, &amp; 300.</note> Thus it calls the Euchariſt ſpiritual Sacrifices, <hi>He hath refreſhed us with the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bread and the Spiritual Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50988:44"/>5. It takes for granted, that the Believers of old did eat the ſame Living Bread,<note place="margin">Pag. 229.</note> which Jeſus Chriſt gives us:
<q>For he himſelf is the living and true Bread that came down from Heaven, and always dwells in Heaven, who is the Subſtance of Eternity, and the Food of Power. For thy Word, by which all things were made, is not only the Bread of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, but of the very Angels themſelves. By the Nouriſhment of this Bread, thy Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> was enabled to faſt 40 Days and Nights, when he received the Law, and abſtained from carnal Food, that he might be the more capable of taſting thy Sweetneſs, living on thy Word. Let this living and true Bread which came down from Heaven, that he might give Food to the Hungry, yea that he himſelf might be the Food of the Living, become to us ſuch Bread as that our Hearts may be ſtrengthned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; that ſo in the Power of this Bread, we may be enabled to faſt theſe 40 Days without any impediment from Fleſh and Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It calls the Sacrament, Gifts laid upon the Altar.
<q>Be pleaſed to ſanctify,<note place="margin">P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 234, &amp; 237.</note> O Lord, theſe Gifts which we offer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Altar, offering immaculate Sacrifices upon the Holy Altar. Let us beſeech the Almighty through his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to bleſs and ſanctify theſe Gifts by the offering up of his Body and Blood, that he would be pleaſed alſo to bleſs the Gifts offered by his Servants.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It calls the Sacrament, <hi>Salutiferam Dominicae immolationis effigiem, in ſacrificio ſpiritali Chriſto offerente transfuſam.</hi>
                  <q>The ſalutiferous Repreſentation of our Lord's offering up of himſelf transfuſed into the ſpiritual Sacrifice, whereof Chriſt himſelf is the Sacrificer or Offerer.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. We find there a Prayer, whoſe Title is, A Collect for the Breaking of the Bread after Conſecration. Which ſcarce proves, that they were perſuaded that the Subſtance of the Bread was deſtroyed by the Conſecration.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſame which in ſome Places it calls the Body of Chriſt, it elſewhere calls the Sacrament of the Body.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50988:44"/>10. It reduceth all to the virtue of the Euchariſt.<note place="margin">Pag. 296.</note>
                  <q>Keep within us, Lord, the Gift of thy Glory, and let us by the Virtue of the Euchariſt, which we receive, be armed againſt all the Pollutions of the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. It ſuppoſeth that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt abides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and prays that it may continue there incorruptible.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
                  <q>Hear the Prayers of thy Family, Almighty God, and grant that theſe holy Things which we have received of thy Gift, we may by thy Gift keep incorrupted within us.<note place="margin">Pag. 298.</note> And again; let us with unanimous Prayer entreat the Divine Mercy, that theſe ſaving Sacraments being received into our inward Parts, may purify our Soul, and ſanctify our Body, and confirm our Hearts and Minds in the hope of heavenly Things.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. It calls the Euchariſt <hi>Holy Bread:</hi>
                  <q>Bearing in mind the moſt glorious Paſſion of our Lord, and his Reſurrection from the lower Parts of the Earth; We offer up unto thee, O Lord, this unſpotted Sacrifice, this holy Bread, and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cup, beſeeching thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. It calls the Sacrament, <hi>Holy Myſteries,</hi> in ſeveral Places.</p>
               <p>Theſe many Inſtances one would have thought might have obliged <hi>Mabillon</hi> to believe that the Authors of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, did ſpeak figuratively in ſome other Places, where they ſeem to ſpeak more ſtrongly, and to give us another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially conſidering the manner of their expreſſing themſelves, when they ſpeak of the Feaſt of St. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi>
                  <q>It it worthy and juſt, equal and ſaving,<note place="margin">Pag. 275.</note> for us always to give Thanks to thee Almighty, and merciful God, and in this Banquet of thy Sacrament, to join the Head of thy Martyr by an Evangelical Commemoration, and to offer it upon thy Propitiatory Table, as in a Diſh of ſhining Metal.</q>
And we may add ſeveral others upon each of thoſe Paſſages which ſeem the moſt likely to deceive us.</p>
               <p>If we had the Canon of this Liturgy, which theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did not think fit to give us, we ſhould there eaſily find the Solution of theſe Difficulties; for it is very probable, it was like that of the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Liturgy, where it was ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50988:45"/>
ſpecified, that the Bread was the Figure of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as that it put an end to all manner of Cavillings on the Point. Indeed theſe Words, <hi>The Figure or Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sacrifice of our Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 237.</note> do plainly ſhew, that this was their meaning. But we muſt make a ſhift to help our ſelves with what they have been pleaſed to give us. It is eaſy to judg what thoſe Paſſages were, which <hi>Mabillon</hi> judg'd to be moſt favourable to his Cauſe; for he hath caus'd them to be Printed in great Characters, that no Body might paſs them by.</p>
               <p>Thus the word <hi>Truth,</hi> ſeem'd to him to determine the Queſtion of the Real Preſence;<note place="margin">Pag. 195.</note> the Words are theſe:
<q>We beſeech thee, Almighty God, that like as we do now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Truth of the Heavenly Sacrament, ſo we may cleave to the Truth of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</q>
But this learned <hi>Benedictine</hi> has ſuffer'd himſelf to be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his own Prejudice. The Author of the Liturgy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth two times; the one before the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, which was only an obſcure Image of a Thing that was to come; this is that which is expreſt in theſe Words:<note place="margin">Pag. 206.</note>
                  <q>Or that the Living Bread, by denying of himſelf, ſhould not afford Life; but for the Redemption of his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the Praiſe of his Glory, what before he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd in a Parable, he may now vouchſafe in Truth.</q>
The other, wherein the Death of Jeſus Chriſt hath authoriz'd the Signification of the Euchariſt; upon which account, he calls it <hi>the Truth of the Heavenly Sacrament.</hi> We have a like Expreſſion of Baptiſm, alluding to the Paſſage of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> in one of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Homilies, upon <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s coming to Jeſus Chriſt, related by <hi>Paulus Diaconus, In inventione S. Crucis</hi>; and 'tis the ſame we find alſo in ſeveral Paſſages of St. <hi>Caeſarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find that the word <hi>Transformation</hi> has perfectly charm'd him.<note place="margin">Pag. 202.</note>
                  <q>We therefore, Lord, keeping theſe Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Precepts, do moſt humbly beſeech thee that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to receive, bleſs and ſanctify this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it may be to us a true Euchariſt, in thy own and Son's Name, and of the Holy Ghoſt; that ſo there may be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50988:45"/>
a Transformation of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thy only Begotten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
And in a Marginal Note he obſerves, that the ſame Word is made uſe of in this Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:<note place="margin">Pag. 228.</note>
                  <q>That it may pleaſe thee to ſend down thy Holy Spirit upon theſe Solemnities, that it may be to us a true Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, in thy own and Son's Name, and of the Holy Ghoſt, for a Transformation of the Body and Blood of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, thy only Begotten; that it may beſtow upon us, who eat it, eternal Life, and the everlaſting Kingdom to thoſe that ſhall drink it.</q>
And alſo,<note place="margin">Pag. 285.</note>
                  <q>That thy Bleſſing may come down upon this Bread and Wine, for the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thy Holy Spirit; that bleſſing thou may'ſt bleſs them, and ſanctifying thou may'ſt ſanctify them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
And the like in other Miſſals as antient as this; which he obſerves alſo in his Preface.</p>
               <p>But this after all, ſignifies nothing elſe but the Change which the Holy Ghoſt produceth in making the Elements after Conſecration, to become the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. This is that which our Authors have fully juſtified by an infinite number of Examples borrowed from Baptiſm, and other things conſecrated by Prayer. <hi>Boethius</hi> in his Books, <hi>De conſolatione Philoſophiae,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Converſi in malitiam, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam quo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> amiſêre naturam. Evenit ergo, ut quem transformatum vitiis videas, hominem exiſtimare non poſſis.</hi>
                  <q>Being turn'd into Malice, they at the ſame time loſe humane Nature: So that if you ſee one transformed by Vice, you cannot look upon him as a Man.</q>
And <hi>Ratramnus</hi> in his Book of the Body and Blood of our Lord, ſaith, That Jeſus Chriſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times could change the Manna, and Water out of the Rock in the Wilderneſs, into his Fleſh and Blood: the ſame <hi>Ratramnus</hi> that oppos'd <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> who was the firſt Publiſher of the Doctrine of a real Change.</p>
               <p>We find there the Notion of <hi>Vertere and convertere in carnem:</hi>
                  <q>Beſeeching that he who then changed the Water into Wine,<note place="margin">Pag. 208.</note> would be pleaſed now to change the Wine of our Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into his Blood.</q>
And again,
<q>Let us entreat him,<note place="margin">Pag. 209.</note> that he who as at this day, by his Son, turned the Species of Water into Wine, would be pleaſed in like manner, to change
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50988:46"/>
the Oblations and Prayers of us all, into a Divine Sacrifice, and to accept them as he did accept the Offering of <hi>Abel</hi> the Juſt, and the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Patriarch.</q>
But the appearance of this ſeeming Difficulty, we find in the following Leaf. Beſides, that it is ridiculous to ſuppoſe the real Change of the Prayers of Believers into the Body and Blood of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is ſuppos'd of the Oblations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 240.</note>We meet with an Expreſſion which ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange:
<q>O Jeſu Chriſt, who in the Evening of the World, waſt made an Evening-Sacrifice on the Croſs, vouchſafe to us, that we may become new Sepulchres for thy Body.</q>
Tho indeed theſe Expreſſions plainly ſhew that they are only inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the prefiguring the Death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 33. de inſtitut. Cleric.</note> according to the Notion of <hi>Rabanus Maurus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find there frequently, that the Sacrament is ſaid to be a Remedy for the Body, and an Expiation for the Soul; but this doth no more ſuppoſe the carnal Preſence, or the Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the fruit of a Propitiatory Sacrifice, than that which we find in the <hi>Roman Order,</hi> in bleſſing a Grave, that it may be a ſaving Remedy to the Party reſting in it, for the Redemption of his Soul.</p>

Theſe words, <hi>offer'd up himſelf,</hi> ſeem to him to be applicable to the Act of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt: but he muſt not take it ill, if we tell him, that it is not true, that he then offer'd up any Sacrifice: the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt conſiſting only in his Death on the Croſs; the Euchariſt, where he had only his Death before his Eyes, was only the Memorial of his Sacrifice, his Offering conſiſting only in his Death. If he did offer up himſelf in the Euchariſt, then was he already dead, which is a Notion attributed to <hi>Gregory Niſſen,</hi> but is refuted by the Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as impertinent.</p>

Beſides, it is abſolutely falſe, that Jeſus Chriſt did after his Reſurrection, retake the ſame Blood which he loſt on the Croſs. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that ſhe hath it in her keeping, and it is ſhown in I don't know how many places.

by this means to ſubject the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches to himſelf, under the plauſible pretence of making them more uniform with the Church of <hi>Rome; Gregory</hi> VII<hi>th,</hi> undertook to ſuppreſs the <hi>Gothick</hi> Liturgy, which was not leſs but rather more different; becauſe the Popes after <hi>Adrian</hi> I. had made great Changes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy, and had enrich'd it with many Novelties, which the Ages after <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, had produc'd in Religion.

               <p>THere was no part of <hi>Gaul</hi> ſo ſhaken and laid waſte by the Wars, as <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi> were in the 8<hi>th</hi> Century: Though all <hi>France</hi> ſuffer'd in ſome meaſure, yet theſe two Provinces were, during a long ſeries of Years, the Theatre of War and Calamity. However, we may ſay that theſe Miſhaps ſerv'd only to awaken the Zeal of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make them the more ſenſible of the Averſion they ought to have to the Idolatry which reigned in the Eaſt; and which it ſeems God was willing to puniſh with the Scourge of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the great Enemies of Images and Idolatry.

               <p>The Judgment of theſe Dioceſſes concerning Images ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in Publick, when their Deputies aſſiſted at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Francfort,</hi> which condemned the 2<hi>d</hi> Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> notwithſtanding that it had been approved by the Pope. The 2<hi>d</hi> Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had in the year 787, ordain'd the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images, under the Penalty of being Anathematiz'd. The Eaſt was entirely over-run with this Superſtition; and what we have already ſeen of <hi>Serenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Marſeille,</hi> makes it evident, that it had likewiſe made great Progreſs in the Weſt. <hi>Charlemain</hi> and the whole Body of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Churches, if we except <hi>Rome</hi> and ſome Partiſans of the Pope in <hi>Italy,</hi> were deſirous to ſtop this torrent: <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and cenſured them by the Pen of the famous <hi>Alcuin.</hi> His Writings were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Charlemain.</hi> This great Emperor thereupon, in the year 794, aſſembled at <hi>Francfort</hi> a Council of the Biſhops under his Government; that is, thoſe of <hi>Italy, Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> as well to condemn <hi>Elipandus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>

               <p>Now that we may exactly know the Opinions which obtain'd in theſe Dioceſſes, whoſe Biſhops approved the Book of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain</hi>; the Reader needs only conſider carefully the Poſitions of <hi>Charlemain</hi> againſt ſeveral Opinions which have ſince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <q>It is no ſmall Error to ſerve any thing with religious Worſhip beſides him who ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And he repeats this afterwards; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we read that any thing is to be worſhipped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God;<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5. pag. 184.</note> becauſe it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>

<q>Moreover, ſaith he, for as much as we ſee that <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation is reſtrain'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from worſhipping him; and that <hi>Peter</hi> the Paſtor of the Church forbad the Worſhip of the Centurion; and that the choſen Veſſel, together with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with a ſtrong Oppoſition, rejected the Adorations of the <hi>Lycaonians</hi>; we are without doubt to conclude from theſe Examples; that Adoration, which only belongs to God, who alone is to be worſhipp'd and alone to be ſerv'd, is not to be rendred to any Creature whatſoever, except only by way of Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 25. pag. 227.</note> to expreſs our Humility.</q>
So afterwards;
<q>The Goſpel-Rule of the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which is ſometimes recommended to us in the Words of our Lord himſelf, and ſometimes by Examples, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is repreſented to us by Oracles either more obſcure, or more plain and open; ſometimes is taught in plain, and other-times in figurative Expreſſions, rejecting the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all other things whatſoever, ſave only the Adoration whereby we mutually ſalute one another, enjoins the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God alone.<note place="margin">Pag. 228</note>

And again;

<q>God alone is to be worſhipp'd,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 21. pag. 218.</note> God alone is to be adored, God alone is to be glorified; of whom it is ſaid by the Prophet, The Name of him alone is exalted; and to the Saints, who having triumphed over the Devil, do reign with him, Veneration is to be rendred, either becauſe they have fought couragiouſly for the Preſervation of the State of the Church, or becauſe they are known to aſſiſt it with their continual Patronage and Interceſſion. So likewiſe,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 23.</note> We venerate the Saints who are dead with the triumph of Merits, but they are not to be ador'd with Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for that very reaſon, becauſe it is Divine Worſhip.

Images formed by the Induſtry of Artificers, paſs to the Veneration of thoſe Perſons, according to whoſe Likeneſs they have been wrought. Charlemain</hi> doth cenſure thoſe who had made a Parallel between Images and the Euchariſt, in ſuch a manner as ſhews that he knew nothing of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. He ſaith,
<q>That the Euchariſt is made by the Hand of the Prieſt, and by calling upon the Name of God, both Prieſt and People joining their Prayers in the Conſecration thereof; whereas Images ſtand in no need of Conſecration, but are made at the Diſcretion of the Painter. He ſaith that <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> did not preſent an Image as a Type of the Body and Blood, but Bread and Wine: that <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded a Lamb to be eaten as a Type of our Saviour, wholly rejecting the Cuſtom of worſhipping Images. That the Pſalmiſt who ſang that Men ſhould eat the Bread of Angels, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, hath alſo declared, that the Makers of Images are like unto the Images they have made. That the Sacrament is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution; whereas the inſolent Uſe of Images, is not only without Scripture, but alſo directly contrary to the Writings of the Old and New Teſtament. That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our never inſtituted the Memory of his Suffering to be kept up by the Works of Artificers and worldly Arts, but by the Conſecration of his Body and Blood: that he was not willing that his Faith and his Confeſſion ſhould be expreſs'd by Pictures, but by the Mouth and the Heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We are carefully to take notice, that the Authors of this Book, who deſired to exalt the Sacrament of the Euchariſt with all their Might, never give the leaſt hint that Jeſus Chriſt had inſtituted it, to make it an Object of Adoration.
<q>They ſay that the Euchariſt, according to the Judgment of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is preferable almoſt to every other Sacrament; that it is made inviſibly by the Spirit of God, and conſecrated by the Prieſt, who calls upon God; that it is carried by the Hands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and laid upon the Altar of God in Heaven; that it can neither increaſe nor be diminiſhed; that it is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Old and New Teſtament; that it is the Life and Nouriſhment of Souls, that by its Manducation it leads to the Entrance of the Heavenly Kingdom; that it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50988:49"/>
can never be aboliſhed, no not in the time of Perſecution; and that no body can be ſaved without receiving of it. Whereas Images are viſibly made by the Hand of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, painted by the Art of the Painter, placed on the Walls by the Hands of Men, that by them, if Men inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe them, Sins are increaſed; that they can increaſe and diminiſh in Beauty, according to the Ability of the Workman; that Age ſpoils them; that they only feed the Eye; that they only bring to remembrance things paſt, by looking upon them; that they may be ſpoiled by taking wet; that they who keep to the true Faith are ſaved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any Regard to Images. And to exaggerate the Folly of their Anathema's pronounced againſt thoſe that did not worſhip them, they conclude that this Anathema ſtrikes at the Saints of old, of whom we never read that they adored them; that the ſame was levell'd at the Martyrs, who from the Baptiſmal Font paſſed immediately to the Kingdom of Heaven, without any Adoration of Images; and laſtly, that it is darted againſt little Infants, who cannot worſhip them, and of whom notwithſtanding, the Son of God ſaith, <hi>Suffer little Children to come to me,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
I own that <hi>Charlemain</hi> cenſureth <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſaria,</hi> for giving to the Euchariſt the Name of the true Image of Jeſus Chriſt: For after having made out, that no Artificer can form a true Image of Jeſus Chriſt; he adds, when he ſpeaks of the Euchariſt;
<q>That Jeſus Chriſt did not offer up to God the Father for us in Sacrifice, any Image or Prototype but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that he who of old had been foretold by viſible Reſemblances under the Shadow of the Law, in the Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Lamb, and in ſome other things, as being the Sacrifice that was to be offered, by truly accompliſhing the things that had been propheſied of him in the Oracles of the Prophets, did offer up himſelf to God the Father, for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifice, and beſtowed upon us (the Shadows of the Law being paſt away) not ſome imaginary Sign, but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Body and of his Blood. For the Myſtery of the Blood and Body of our Lord, muſt not now be called an Image, but the Truth; not the Shadow, but the Body;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50988:50"/>
not a Type of things to come, but that whith had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by the Types of old: For now (according to the Song of Songs) the Day is riſen, and the Shadows are gone; now Jeſus Chriſt, the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believes, is come, he hath now fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the Law. Now upon thoſe who ſat in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Shadow of Death, a great Light is riſen. Now the Vail is taken off from the Face of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and the Vail of the Temple being rent, hath opened to us all Secrets and Things hid. Now the true <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> Chriſt the King of Righteouſneſs and King of Peace, hath beſtowed upon us not Sacrifices of Beaſts, but the Sacrament of his Body and of his Blood, and hath not ſaid, This is the Image of my Body and of my Blood; but, This is my Body which ſhall be given for you, and this is my Blood which ſhall be ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it is plain that <hi>Charlemain</hi> underſtands by the Word Image, a Prototype, like the Shadows of the Law, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to which it is true, what many of the Fathers have ſaid, that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are the Body and the Truth; though otherwiſe conſidered as Sacraments, they are ſacred Signs, which cannot be confounded with the things ſignified by them, without renouncing the Light of common ſenſe. Moreover, we are to obſerve that <hi>Charlemain</hi> never ſaid that the Euchariſt is properly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. If he denies Jeſus Chriſt to have ſaid concerning the Euchariſt, this is the Image of my Body, taking the Word as a Prototype, and a Shadow of things to come; yet he always holds that it is his Body in a Sacramental Senſe, for he never ſpeaks of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt as the Body of our Lord, without adding the Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacrament, or of Myſtery. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he hears the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Body and of the Blood,</hi> once mentioned, and twice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>he hath beſtowed upon us the Sacrament of his Body and of his Blood:</hi> And laſtly, <hi>the Myſtery of the Body and of the Blood, cannot be called an Image.</hi> Now the Word <hi>Myſtery,</hi> according to the conſtant Uſe of the Church, properly ſignifies the <hi>Symbol,</hi> the <hi>Figure,</hi> the <hi>ſacred Sign</hi> of the Body and Blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>

                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>; We ought to obſerve, that though he ſays that the Sacrament is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, yet he never ſaith that it ought to be adored. Indeed he ought to have drawn up an Impeachment againſt theſe Worſhippers of Images, upon this Article, and a very important one too, becauſe it is very evident that the <hi>Greek</hi> Worſhippers of Images did not adore the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, but gave only a ſimple Veneration to it, like to that which they beſtowed upon the Croſs, the Altar and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as one of their Authors tells us, in a Book which they call, <hi>An Invective of the Orthodox againſt the Oppoſers of Images,</hi>

                  <hi>Charlemain</hi> had ordered a Collection of Homilies to be made out of the Works of <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Leo,</hi> St. <hi>Maximus,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> which he cauſed to be publiſhed in theſe Dioceſſes, as well as the reſt of his Empire; now theſe Homilies do ſo ſtrongly oppoſe the moſt part of thoſe Novelties, which were then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be introduced, that this Book for a long time ſerved as a Bar, to hinder People from leaning too much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe things that incline Men to Superſtition. There is no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the leaſt verſed in the Matters of Controverſy, who ſeeing the Names of thoſe ancient Doctors comprized in this Collection, will not remember how much theſe Fathers have oppoſed themſelves to a Multitude of Corruptions which prevailed at laſt, by the factious Endeavours of ſome of the latter Popes; wherefore I may excuſe my ſelf from making an Extract of this Collection, chooſing rather to produce other Witneſſes, which the ſame Dioceſs affords us concerning the Faith of theſe Dioceſſes in the ninth Century.</p>
               <p>I can only produce three or four; but to recompenſe the ſmallneſs of their Number, they are Men againſt whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the moſt contentious Adverſaries will have nothing to oppoſe. In the firſt place it is certain, that as the Biſhops of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Narbon</hi> had ſet themſelves againſt the Superſtition and Idolatry of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the Pope in the matter of Images at the Council of <hi>Francfort</hi>; ſo their Succeſſors imitated their Zeal and Vigor in the Synod at <hi>Paris</hi> in 824, upon the ſame Queſtion; where they determin'd that Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who had writ an Anſwer to the Book of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and therein under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Defence of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> had made uſe of in the ſaid Reply, <hi>ſuperſtitious Teſtimonies, and not at all to the purpoſe, anſwering what he thought fit, and not what was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And beſides they drew up a new Collection of great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Arguments againſt this ſuperſtitious Worſhip, to recal Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> and thoſe of his Party from their doating on Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:50988:51"/>We can ſhew further, that the ſame Zeal was continued in this Dioceſs. <hi>Baluzius</hi> hath acknowledged, and ſo has <hi>Maſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> before him, that the Book of <hi>Agobardus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi>

But it may not be amiſs to quote it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, not only to ſhew what were the Opinions of the Churches of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon</hi> (becauſe though he was born in <hi>Spain,</hi> yet he had continued for a long time in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> whither he was invited, becauſe of the general Eſteem he had gained, to be the Coadjutor to <hi>Leidradus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> to whom he ſucceeded;) but alſo becauſe it appears by his Works, that the moſt illuſtrious Biſhops of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi> carefully conſulted him in Matters of Difficulty, as their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, being indeed a moſt famous Doctor, able to inſtruct and inform them.</p>

<q>That we are to hold far otherwiſe than you do, whom not only in his Book, which he hath writ againſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> concerning thoſe who have been blamed by the Doctors, yea the beſt of them, ſpeaks thus; which ſort of Writings, that is to ſay Expoſitions, are not to be read with a Neceſſity of believing, but with a Liberty of judging; for thoſe Books only, that are of Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are to be read not with a Liberty of judging, but with a neceſſity of believing, which form the Apoſtle himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, ſaying, <hi>Quench not the Spirit, deſpiſe not Prophecies, try all things, hold faſt what is good, abſtain from every Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil.</hi>

                  <q>That if this is the Property of humble Saints, why then doth <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us; but if we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins?</hi> Who if like you, he had been inclined to have not mean, but great Thoughts of himſelf; he had whereof he might glory, becauſe he lay in the Boſom of his Lord, and was beloved of him above the reſt of his Diſciples. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, <hi>In many things we offend all</hi>; which if any ſhall imagine not to be ſpoke in Truth, but by way of Humility, let him know that therein he follows <hi>Pelagius.</hi>

He plainly declares that our Communion in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſame with that of the Believers of old, when he applies that Paſſage of the 1<hi>ſt</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, and 2. of the drinking of the Holy Ghoſt, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in theſe terms that there is no other Difference between the Believers of the Old and New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Pag. 1250.</note> but this,
<q>That the great Sacraments of Salvation which are wrought by the Mediator for us and for them, ſave us as being already paſt, but them as yet to come, becauſe we believe and hold what is paſt, they believed and held what was to come; they held them only in their Minds, as Figures of future things, but we in an open Profeſſion, Vows and Declaration of things paſt, under the Signification of ſenſible Sacraments, as thoſe two who carried one Cluſter of Grapes upon a Staff, did indifferently do the ſame Work, only that the one of them had it behind his Back, and the other before his Face.</q>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50988:52"/>
It will be ſufficient for us to obſerve, that the <hi>Romiſh Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius,</hi> hath forbid this Book, as well as the reſt, till its Errors be expunged: and indeed it did deſerve no leſs; for it maintains, according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that we ought not to adore any Image of God, but only that which is God himſelf, even his eternal Son; and that it is a piece of Folly and Sacriledg, to vouchſafe any Worſhip to Images, and to call them Holy, as the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had done. He refutes the Excuſe of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which only conſiders thoſe as Idolaters, that attribute ſomething of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Image. He maintains it to be mere Paganiſm to have Images for any other uſe than that of a Memorial; and at the ſame time aſſerts, that Images are of as little Uſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as the Picture of a Mower, or of ſome Hero in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, can advantage a Mower or Souldier, who looks upon thoſe Pictures. In a Word, he ſpeaks exactly like a true <hi>Iconoclaſt</hi>; for after he had ſaid, that it was impoſſible any longer to bear with the Abuſes againſt which he had taken Pen in hand, he adds:
<q>From whence we may plainly infer, that if <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a Godly and Religious King, brake the brazen Serpent, made by God's expreſs Command, becauſe the miſtaken Multitude began to worſhip it as an Idol, for which his Piety was very much commended; much more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly may and ought the Images of the Saints (they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves approving it) be broken and ground to Pouder, which were never ſet up by God's Command, but are abſolutely human Inventions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides this, there are four other Articles, which are as diſreliſhing to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Pag. 1267.</note> He maintains that there is no other Mediator between God and Men, ſave Jeſus Chriſt God and Man, which he proves by the Authority of St. <hi>Auguſtin, de Civ. Dei,</hi> l. 9. c. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He looks upon thoſe as worthy to be anathematized and excommunicated from the Church of God, who ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to dedicate a Church to the moſt excellent of Saints or Angels.
<q>If any of us, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Pag. 1272.</note> ſhould make a Temple of Wood or Stone to any, though the moſt excellent of Saints, we ought for doing that to be anathematized from the Truth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50988:53"/>
of Chriſt, and from the Church of God, becauſe by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould give that Worſhip to the Creature, which is only due to the Creator.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Having given a Relation of the manner how the Faithful gathered up the Bones of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 1275.</note> and interr'd them in a place where they intended to meet and celebrate his Memory, to encourage Believers to imitate the conſtancy of that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; he declares that all manner of Worſhip or Honour done to them over and above this, is unlawful, religious Worſhip being due to God alone.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 1281, &amp; 1282.</note>4. He proves that his Judgment concerning theſe Points is founded upon the Example of the antient Doctors, up-their Opinions, and upon the Book of the Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was the ground of the antient Doctors of the Church, who rejected the Worſhip which the <hi>Arians</hi> gave to Jeſus Chriſt as idolatrous, tho they owned him to be no more than a Man.</p>
               <p>The Reader needs not take much pains to apprehend why <hi>Rome</hi> thought fit to condemn theſe Books of <hi>Agobardus</hi>; tho he may be at a loſs, how it comes to paſs, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, he is at this day held for a Saint, and publickly ador'd at <hi>Lions</hi> under the Name of St. <hi>Agobo.</hi> This is a Riddle which has ſtrangly perplexed the Learned Jeſuit, <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Raynaldus,</hi> as well as <hi>le Cointe,</hi> in his Annals of the Church of <hi>France.</hi> But he is not the only Perſon that has oppos'd the Belief and Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is publickly ador'd by her.</p>
               <p>I have another Author to produce, who gives us ſo clear an Idea of the belief of this Dioceſs, wherein he was born, concerning the Euchariſt, that the Papiſts have never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to return any pertinent Anſwer to it, ſave only this, that the Paſſage we quote is ſuppoſititious. The Perſon we ſpeak of, is <hi>Chriſtianus Druthmarus,</hi> Monk of <hi>Corbie,</hi> whom it ſeems God was willing to oppoſe to the corrupt Notions of <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus,</hi> his Abbot. The Paſſage is this, [<hi>And as they were at ſupper, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed it and brake it.</hi>]
<q>After that he had fulfilled the Command concerning the old Paſſover, and put an end to the old Shadows, he makes a beginning of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50988:53"/>
new Grace, and of a new Sacrifice. He took Bread which ſtrengthens the Heart of Man, and which doth moſt of all ſupport Mens Bodies, and in it placeth the Sacrament of his Love: but much more doth that ſpiritual Bread fully ſtrengthen and comfort all ſorts of Creatures; becauſe in him we move and have our Being: Firſt, he bleſſed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in himſelf <hi>who was Man,</hi> he bleſſed all Mankind; for having taken humane Nature upon him from the Bleſſed Virgin, he thereby demonſtrated that the Bleſſing and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Divine Immortality, was really therein. He brake the Bread himſelf, becauſe he voluntarily offer'd up himſelf to ſuffer; and that he might fill and ſatisfy us, he made no difficulty to break the Manſion of his Soul, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid: I have Power to lay down my Life, and have Power to take it up again. [<hi>And gave it to his Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body</hi>] He gave to his Diſciples the Sacrament of his Body for the Remiſſion of Sins, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Charity, that they remembring this Act of his, might always perform that in a Figure, which he was now about to do for them, and might not forget that, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is in the Sacrament. [<hi>And he took the Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying</hi>;] Foraſmuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ſorts of Food, Bread and Wine are found to be the moſt effectual to ſtrengthen, and refreſh our weak Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; he with good reaſon thought fit by theſe two, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and confirm the Miniſtry of his Sacrament; for Wine not only exhilarates, but alſo encreaſes Blood, and therefore is the Blood of Chriſt very properly typified thereby; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever comes to us from him, doth enliven us with a true Joy, and encreaſeth all our good. And laſtly, As when a Perſon that is to take a far Journey, leaves to his Friends that love him, ſome Pledg or Token of his Love upon this Condition, that they uſe it every day, that they may not forget him: So likewiſe hath God commanded us, having ſpiritually changed his Body into Bread, and the Wine into Blood, by theſe two, to remember what he hath done for us with his Body and Blood, and not to be unthankful to his moſt endearing Love and Charity.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50988:54"/>
And becauſe Water is mingled with the Sacrament of his Blood, it repreſents his People, for whom he was pleaſed to die. And neither is the Wine without Water, nor the Water without Wine; becauſe as he died for us, ſo muſt we die for him, or for our Brethren, that is, for the Church. Wherefore alſo Water and Blood came forth from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; this is added in contradiſtinction to that of the Old Teſtament, which by the Blood of Goats, could not purge away Sin from thoſe who were ſtill in bondage to Sin. [<hi>But I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I ſhall drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom.</hi>] The Vine is <hi>Judaea,</hi> the Wine that of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and other Elect. For till that time, <hi>Judaea</hi> had brought forth Cluſters of Grapes, from whence Wine flowed forth, that is, Works done in Faith; but from the Death of our Lord wild Grapes only, until the time that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall carry them up into the Kingdom, that is, the Church of Chriſt, at the end of the World. Or elſe more ſimply the Words may be thus taken, That from the hour of his ſupping with his Diſciples, he would drink no more Wine, until he was become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and incorruptible after his Reſurrection. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as alſo he was pleaſed not to adminiſter the Sacrament of his Body and Blood to his Diſciples till after they had ſupp'd, and that we are not commanded to take it Faſting; this may be the reaſon, the Lord had a mind to ſhew that the figurative Teſtament was only commanded till the true was come, and he had now put an end to the Old Teſtament, and inſtituted a New One, and therefore it was that he celebrated the Old before the New. The Apoſtles alſo for a long time continued the ſame Cuſtom, and after their other Food, took this by the Lord's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; but afterwards when many Jews came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, it was enjoined in a Synod, that every one (if he was cleanſed from other Sins) ſhould firſt take the Repaſt of Spiritual Bread, before he took that of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</q>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:50988:54"/>This place, which contains an exact Commentary upon the Inſtitution of the Holy Supper, has much enrag'd the Papiſts; and they have wreſted it into all Senſes, to avoid the threatning Blow. <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> tells us, that in another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, after the words, <hi>This is my Body, that is in a Sacrament,</hi> was added, <hi>truly ſubſiſting.</hi> But this Copy was never yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, though they who reprinted the Work of <hi>Druthmarus</hi> in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> of the <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition, have been pleas'd to put this Falſification of <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who was as able as any Man of <hi>France</hi> to juſtify the fair dealing of <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> in the buſineſs of this Manuſcript of <hi>Lions,</hi> but did not care to concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about it, hath boldly maintained, that he might with the more eaſe ſlip his Neck out of the Collar, that this Paſſage of <hi>Druthmarus</hi> had been corrupted by the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> But it hath already ſhewn, that the Edition publiſhed in 1514, by <hi>Wimfelingius,</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi> begun to write againſt <hi>Leo</hi> X. of which the Reverend Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> hath a Copy in his Library, with the Priviledg of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the Arms of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. contains this Paſſage whole and entire. So that it is obvious to judge, that <hi>Druthmarus</hi> who was born in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> taught nothing at <hi>Corbie,</hi> but what he had learned from his Infancy, and that which was the common Doctrine, before <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> had undertaken to publiſh his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, which he did not till the year of our Lord 835.</p>
               <p>We ought alſo here, to take notice of an Action that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Century concerning the Euchariſt. In the year 844, <hi>Bernard</hi> Earl of <hi>Barcelona</hi> and Duke of <hi>Septimania,</hi> made a Treaty with King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> near the City of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> in the Abby of St. <hi>Saturninus,</hi> where they mingled the Blood of the Euchariſt with ſome Ink, to ſign the Treaty they had agreed upon.

               <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter, with giving an account of that courageous Oppoſition which the Biſhops of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon</hi> made in the year 876, in the Council of <hi>Pontyon,</hi> againſt the Enterprizes of Pope <hi>John</hi> VIII; who being back'd by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> had a mind to ſubject all the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Anſegiſus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> as their Primate; but at the ſame time as to his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, that he might execute his Decrees, and inform him of the moſt important Affairs of thoſe Churches, which he pretended, ought to be decided and ended at <hi>Rome,</hi> which if ſo, would have aboliſhed the Power of Synods and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans.

I own that we find in the Writings of <hi>Odo,</hi> the firſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> who was born in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> ſome Expreſſions which import that he inclin'd to the Opinions of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> as appears in his Collations; which might make one judg that this Notion began then already to be propagated in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain,</hi> whoſe Duke <hi>William</hi> was the Founder of <hi>Clugny.</hi> But we muſt here take notice of two things: The firſt is, That the antient Cuſtoms of this Monaſtry do plainly ſhow, that when this Congregation was founded, thoſe who were the Authors of theſe Cuſtoms, were not of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s Opinion. This is evident from <hi>chap.</hi> 30. of the ſecond Book, and from <hi>chap.</hi> 28. of the third. The ſecond is, That though <hi>Odo</hi> might have entertained this Opinion of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> concerning the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we may eaſily obſerve that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50988:56"/>
he never owned the Conſequences of it. For we find in the Relation of the Death of this <hi>Odo,</hi> who died at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 942, that he received the Euchariſt, but there is no mention made of any Adoration that he paid at his receiving it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to obſerve, that in this Deſcription of <hi>Odo</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, which was made by one of his Diſciples, we meet with neither Confeſſion before the receiving of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, nor the receiving of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, which are ſufficient Proofs that he knew nothing of theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears by the Writings of <hi>Gerbertus,</hi> who was educated in the Monaſtery of <hi>Aurillac,</hi> what was the Faith of this Dioceſs. He had been the Tutor of <hi>Robert</hi> Son to <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Rheims</hi> in the year 991, in the room of <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> who was depoſed. He hath writ an Apology for the Council which depoſed <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> wherein he gives full evidence what eſteem he had for the Pope, and how little he believ'd the Papacy neceſſary to the Church, not only becauſe of the Vices of the Popes of his time, but alſo for ſeveral political Reaſons, which engage every Church not to ſubject themſelves to a foreign Power.<note place="margin">Tom. 10. Baron. Pag. 899. n. 30.</note>
                  <q>Suppoſe, ſaith he, that by the warlike Incurſions of barbarous Nations, there be no way open for us to go to <hi>Rome</hi>; or that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, being become ſubject to ſome barbarous Prince, be at his Pleaſure made part of his Kingdom, ſhall we in this caſe be reduc'd to the neceſſity of having no Councils at all? or ſhall the Biſhops of the World, to the loſs and ruin of their own Kings, expect the Advice and Counſels of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for the Management of the Affairs of Church and State.</q>

               <p>We may ſee another Aſſertion of his in a Letter to <hi>Seguinus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 905.</note>
                  <q>I do reſolvedly affirm, That if the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf ſhould ſin againſt his Brother, and being often admoniſhed, ſhould not hear the Church, that this ſame Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to be look'd upon as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Publican.</q>
Whereupon <hi>Baronius</hi> exclaims, <hi>Here is a Sentence indeed, worthy only to proceed from the Mouth of ſome great Heretick, or of ſome moſt impudent Schiſmatick, which abrogates all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50988:56"/>
ſacred Councils at once, cuts the Throat of Canons, ſtrangles Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and treads under foot all the Rights of the Church, that it ſeems impoſſible that a Catholick ſhould ever dream of ſuch things, much leſs, ſo ſaucily utter and aſſert them.</hi> We may alſo gather from the ſubſequent Words, whether or no he conceiv'd Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
<q>If he (the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) do therefore judg us unworthy of his Communion,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> becauſe none of us will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with him in his Anti-evangelical Sentiments, yet he cannot ſeparate us from the Communion of Chriſt; ſeeing a Prieſt ought not to be removed from his Function, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he have confeſt, or be convict of the Crime laid to his charge: eſpecially when the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> And again, <hi>I am certain that neither Death nor Life,</hi> &amp;c. And what greater Separation can there be, than to debar any Believer from the Body and Blood of the Son of God, which is daily offer'd up for our Salvation? And if he be a Murtherer, that takes away the Bodily Life from himſelf or his Neighbour, he that robs himſelf or another of Eternal Life, by what Name ſhall we call him?</q>
               </p>

               <p>If we enquire into the reſt of his Opinions, we ſhall find, that he did not believe that the Popes had received the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, in any other manner, than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops.

               <p>He ſhews that he did not believe the neceſſity of the Prieſts Intention in the Sacraments, when he ſaith in the ſame piece, ſpeaking to thoſe that were guilty of Simony, <q>I do once more enquire of my Brother Biſhop,<note place="margin">Pag. 233.</note> leſt we ſhould ſeem to have omitted any thing that belongs to a true Proof and Trial, Who is it, Brother Biſhop, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Epiſcopal Grace? is it God or Man? God without doubt, but yet by Man. Man lays on his Hand, and God confers Grace; the Prieſt ſerves God with his ſuppliant Hand, and God bleſſeth with his powerful Right-hand: The Biſhop admits thee into the Order, but God makes thee worthy of it. O Juſtice! O Equity! If Money be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Man, who in Ordination does no more but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a piece of Service laid upon him, why is the whole denied to God, who beſtows the Order it ſelf upon thee? Doth it ſeem juſt to thee, to honour the Servant, whilſt thou doſt affront the Lord? And whilſt the Prieſt unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly takes Money, ſhall God be injured by Man? And ſeeing God expects nothing from thee, for the Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee, why doth the Prieſt impudently look for Money? God is willing to beſtow it upon Man for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the ravenous Biſhop demands Money. God of his Kindneſs and Love vouchſafes it for nought, but the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prieſt captivates him and ties him to Terms: For what haſt thou that thou haſt not receiv'd? And if thou
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50988:57"/>
have received it, why doſt thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, We ſee in his 26<hi>th</hi> Epiſtle the Confeſſion of Faith that he makes, which contains nothing beſides the Symbol or the Apoſtles Creed, to which he adds only what follows:
<q>I do not forbid Marriage . . . . I do not condemn ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages; I do not blame the eating of Fleſh; I own that reconciled Penitents ought to be admitted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. I believe that in Baptiſm all Sins whether ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or actual, are forgiven; and do profeſs that out of the Catholick Church no Body can be ſaved; and I confirm and ratify the four holy Univerſal Synods, which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church confirms and approves of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis worth obſerving, that he doth not ſpeak one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Romiſh Traditions; ſo far was he from autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing the Definitions of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been pleaſed to authorize in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, We may take notice, that <hi>Leuthericus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> who died in the year 1032, had been the Diſciple of this <hi>Gerbertus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 45.</note> which is atteſted by the Continuator of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moinus:</hi> and <hi>Clarius</hi> Monk of St. <hi>Peter le Vif</hi> at <hi>Sens,</hi> has accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Leuthericus</hi> of having laid the Beginning, and caſt the Seeds of <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Hereſy.</p>
               <p>I don't believe any one will think ſtrange that I have quoted <hi>Gerbertus</hi> amongſt the Writers of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> under pretence, that probably he might have chang'd his Opinions, after that he was elevated to the Papacy, under the Name of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> II. It is but too well known to be cuſtomary, for thoſe who us'd to ſpeak according to their own Judgment, and the Opinions of the Place where they were educated, as ſoon as they have been elevated to the Papal Dignity, to change their Notes. Of this we have an illuſtrious Example in <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> whom we find quite transform'd into another Man as ſoon as he had taken upon him the Name of <hi>Pius</hi> II. the Papal Diadem having chang'd him from White to Black. And I am much miſtaken if the 11<hi>th</hi> Century doth not furniſh us an Example every whit as remarkable, in the Perſon of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> who having
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50988:58"/>
been before Prior of the Monaſtry of <hi>Clugny,</hi> the Cuſtoms whereof, as I have hinted, did not ſuit well with the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> ſeems thence to have deriv'd his Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Euchariſt; for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſpergenſis</hi> takes notice that the Council of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> where he was depoſed by 30 Biſhops, laid to his charge, That he was of <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Opinion, as being his antient Diſciple; and we ſhall find this Accuſation not to be without ground, if we caſt our Eyes on his Commentary on St. <hi>Matthew</hi>; of which I have elſewhere given an Extract. Yet for all this, we ſee, that this Pope, complying with his own Intereſt, became afterwards one of the moſt furious Perſecutors of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe theſe few Remarks will be ſufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: tho I might add, that St. <hi>Fulbert</hi> as well as <hi>Leutherick,</hi> having been the Diſciple of <hi>Gerbert,</hi> had deriv'd the ſame Doctrine concerning the Euchariſt from him; this is ſo certain, that a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> named <hi>Villiers,</hi> found no other means, about the beginning of this Century, to make him ſpeak to his mind, in publiſhing of his Works, than by inſerting ſome Words in the Text, which might make it to be look'd upon as the Objection of Hereticks; whereas indeed it is an Anſwer of his own, wherein he ſets down his Opinion, and he doth it in the ſelf-ſame Terms us'd by St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> But I keep my ſelf within the Bounds of what concerns thoſe Dioceſſes, whoſe Hiſtory I am upon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only take leave to add one thing, which is, that tho <hi>Gerbertus</hi> ſeems in his 26<hi>th</hi> Letter, which contains his Confeſſion of Faith, to make an Alluſion to ſome of the Opinions of the <hi>Manichees</hi>; yet we may be ſure, that he did not expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this manner, to ſhow, that he held nothing of their Tenets; no, he had other Reaſons for it, which it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to unfold here. Beſides, it is notorious that the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> did not ſpread themſelves in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> till he was a very old Man: at leaſt, it is true, that <hi>Ademarus</hi> doth not make them to appear in <hi>Aquitain</hi> till the year 1011, and that the firſt Synod held againſt them, did not meet at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> till the year 1019, that is to ſay, 16 years after his Death, which hapned in 1003.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. The beginning of the <hi>Manichees</hi> in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and the State of thoſe Churches as to Religion in that Age.</head>
               <p>THere appeared in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and in <hi>France</hi> ſome <hi>Manichees</hi> chaſed from the Eaſt by the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople. Ademarus Cabannenſis</hi> Monk of St. <hi>Eparque</hi> at <hi>Limoges,</hi> ſays, that they firſt were taken notice of in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> a little after the Year 1010. and he afterwards ſpeaks of a Council aſſembled at <hi>Charoux,</hi> againſt them. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> makes no Queſtion, but that this gave riſe of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>; and to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Solidity of his Conjecture, he accuſeth, beſides ſome Writers of the 11<hi>th</hi> Century, the Canons whom <hi>Robert</hi> cauſed to be burnt at <hi>Orleans,</hi> to have been the firſt Diſciples of theſe <hi>Manichees,</hi> ſuppoſing all this while that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive themſelves from the ſame ſource, and that they defended the ſame Opinions.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it is a matter of ſmall Importance to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whether the Canons of <hi>Orleans</hi> were <hi>Manichees</hi> or not, I might very well excuſe my ſelf from entring upon that Enquiry. They may have been <hi>Manichees,</hi> and yet the Churches of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon</hi> not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the matter. Neither do I think my ſelf obliged to repeat here, what I have already delivered, concerning the differing Opinions of the ancient and modern <hi>Manichees</hi> in the 15<hi>th,</hi> 16<hi>th,</hi> and 17<hi>th</hi> Chapters of my Remarks upon the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Churches of the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſuppoſing that my Reader may eaſily have Recourſe to them. Our Buſineſs is to ſee what was the Faith of theſe Dioceſſes, and queſtion not but we ſhall make it appear in the Sequel, that thoſe whom the Biſhop pretends to convict of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> are falſly charged therewith; the Romiſh Party having beſtowed that Name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50988:59"/>
them, only to make them the more execrable to thoſe of their Communion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe <hi>Ademarus Cabannenſis</hi> teſtifies, that theſe Canons of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been inſtructed, not by a Woman, come from <hi>Italy,</hi> as their Hiſtory records the Story, but by a Country-fellow (as ſome MS. Copies of <hi>Ademarus</hi> tell us) of <hi>Perigueux,</hi> I am not unwilling to enquire a little into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Hiſtory. <hi>Glaber</hi> relates it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 308.<note place="margin">Tom. 2. <hi>Spicileg.</hi>
                  </note> but beſides his Relation <hi>D' Achery</hi> hath given us, though not the very Acts of the Synod that condemned them, but the account of a private Man of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who profeſſeth that he ſet down in Writing what paſs'd in that Synod, which ſeems to be of ſufficient Authority. Be it as it will, they ſuppoſe from theſe Proofs, that theſe Canons were <hi>Manichees,</hi> and I own they are very like them, in the Relation that is given of this Synod, as well as in <hi>Ademarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet after all, there are ſeveral things which ſeem to give us ground to doubt of the Truth of this whole Relation. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> It ſcarcely ſeems probable, that a Woman, who was a Stranger, or a Peaſant, ſhould have been able in ſo ſhort a time to make ſo many Proſelytes amongſt the Canons and Citizens of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> as to be able to form ſecret Conventicles amongſt them, and to propagate ſuch monſtrous Doctrines as thoſe of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> were. Neither can we, with any appearance of reaſon, ſuppoſe, that one of theſe Canons, who formerly had been Confeſſor to the Queen, was ſo ſtupid a Fellow, as all on a ſudden to fall into the Enthuſiaſm of the <hi>Manichees.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> It is evident, that in peruſing theſe pretended Acts, we find that all the Witneſſes which are produc'd againſt them, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to one only, and he too of no credit, becauſe himſelf had been engag'd once of their Communion. I ſay all their Proceedings were founded upon the Depoſitions of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Man, and then afterwards they make the Men once execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſpeak what they pleaſe. It will be objected perhaps, that the Interrogatories were made in publick, in the Preſence of the People; but then let us conſider, that all this was writ after the Death of <hi>Robert,</hi> to juſtify ſo bloody an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. 3<hi>dly,</hi> We do not find in theſe Acts the ſame Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50988:59"/>
one accuſeth them of one thing, and another of another, though it be evident that the Deſign of all theſe Authors is equally to defame them, and make them execrable. 4<hi>thly,</hi> We find in thoſe Acts, that theſe pretended <hi>Manichees</hi> juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the capital Accuſations of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> chiefly upon the Article of the Creation. 5<hi>thly,</hi> We find that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt at their Martyrdom a Hope directly oppoſite to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> 6<hi>thly,</hi> Their very Enemies themſelves are oblig'd to give them a moſt illuſtrious Teſtimony, as to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of their Lives and Manners.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the accuſing them of denying Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and rejecting Baptiſm, cannot juſtly be look'd upon as a Badg of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> if we conſider on the one hand, that the Queſtion, Whether the Bread be changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? hath no relation to the Doctrine of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> but reſpects only thoſe novel Doctrines which <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> had introduc'd: and on the other hand, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> accuſeth all thoſe for being Enemies to Baptiſm, who in that Point do not eſpouſe all the Opinions ſhe teacheth, in holding, as ſhe did at that time, the abſolute neceſſity of that Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And as for their being charged with celebrating horrible Feſtivals, full of Inceſt and Abominations, we know that the ſame hath been imputed to ſome Hereticks of old, but falſly. It was laid to the charge alſo of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> but was never prov'd to be other than a meer Calumny: Our firſt Reformers have been accuſed of the ſame, but with an Impudence, for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought ſtill to bluſh, if that were a poſſible thing.</p>
               <p>In a word, I find nothing in all this Relation that makes it look probable, but only two or three Characters, which agree with the barbarous Maxims of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt is, That it attributes to Queen <hi>Conſtance</hi> an unuſual Action, that with a Stick ſhe put out the Eye of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who had been her Confeſſor. The ſecond is an Action, much reſembling the courſe that is taken now adays to ſurprize Hereticks, and to diſcover them; for according to the Practice of the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot find fault with the Method made uſe of by this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50988:60"/>
                  <hi>Arefaſtus,</hi> who feigned himſelf willing to become a <hi>Manichee,</hi> that he might the better diſcover their Opinions. It ſeems this Caſuiſt of <hi>Chartres</hi> had not much ſtudied St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells us, <hi>We ought not to do Evil, that Good may come of it.</hi> The third is, The manner of their taking up the dead Body of <hi>Theodatus</hi> the Canon, out of his Grave, who died three years before, and examining it by the trial of Water, that they might be certain whether he was an Heretick when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. This is an Action well becoming this barbarous Age, very like the Inquiſitors; and accordingly this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Method which St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> put in practice for the trial and diſcerning of Hereticks. I don't remember ever to have read any thing that might authorize this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and extravagant Cuſtom, ſave only the ſecond Canon of the 2<hi>d</hi> Council of <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> held in the year 592, where it is ordained, <hi>That the Relicks which ſhould be found in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that had been poſſeſſed by the Arians, ſhould be carried to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that he might try them by Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> might have been as ſenſible of moſt of theſe things as we, in peruſing theſe Acts, and then it would have been eaſy for him to judg whether the Authority of <hi>Vignier,</hi> who ſimply relates what he met with in Hiſtorians did deſerve to be preſſed againſt us. But it ſeems it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to delude his Reader, and the Name of <hi>Vignier</hi> (though otherwiſe he does not accuſe theſe Perſons of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm</hi>) ſeem'd to make for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever Judgment a Prudent Reader may paſs on this Accuſation of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> upon which theſe Canons of <hi>Orleans</hi> were burnt in the year 1017, it will be eaſy for us to ſhow that the Dioceſſes of <hi>Narbon</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> where ſome of thoſe Eaſtern <hi>Manichees</hi> took refuge, did never quit the Faith or Worſhip of their Anceſtors. This is what we ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make out in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ademarus</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Eparque</hi> at <hi>Limoges,</hi> hath writ a Chronicle from the beginning of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy until the year 1030, wherein he informs us, what was the Faith of the Churches of <hi>Aquitain</hi> at the Beginning of the Eleventh Century.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is a moſt convincing Proof of the Judgment of the Churches of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> concerning the Controverſies that <hi>Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius</hi> had kindled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find here that they followed the Opinions of <hi>Bede,</hi> whoſe Homilies <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> had inſerted in his Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the uſe of the Paſtors of <hi>Gaul,</hi> together with thoſe of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Maximus,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others.

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50988:61"/>2. They followed <hi>Alcuinus</hi>'s Notions who had a great hand in all the Writings of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and eſpecially in that concerning Images, where we find alſo his Judgment concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Euchariſt, oppoſite to that of <hi>Paſchaſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We find they followed the Opinions of <hi>Theodulphus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in whom we ſee a hundred things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Opinions of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Ademarus</hi> proves beyond conteſt, that they did not adore the Euchariſt in their Communion; when on the one hand, ſpeaking of thoſe of <hi>Narbon</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 177.</note> he ſaith,
<q>That to prepare themſelves to oppoſe the <hi>Mores</hi> of <hi>Corduba,</hi> who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded their Coaſts, they received the Euchariſt at the hands of their Prieſts, without mentioning any Adoration paid to the Sacrament, in ſo extream and threatning a Danger:</q>
and on the other,<note place="margin">Pag. 183.</note> ſpeaking of the Death of Earl <hi>William; Whereupon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Earl accepting of the Penance laid upon him by the Biſhops and Abbots, and diſpoſing of all his Goods, and particularly bequeathing his Eſtate and Honour amongſt his Sons and his Wife; he was reconciled and abſolved, and the whole time of Lent frequented Maſs and Divine Worſhip, till the Week before</hi> Eaſter, <hi>when after he had received the holy Oil and Viaticum, and ador'd and kiſs'd the Croſs, he yielded up the Ghoſt in the Hands of the Biſhop of</hi> Roan <hi>and his Prieſts after a very laudable Manner.</hi> It is a thing ſingular and obſervable, that this Earl pays his Adoration to the Croſs, though at the ſame time he forgets to worſhip the Sacrament, which yet is the chief Object of Adoration. Moreover, We are to obſerve, that the Latin word <hi>Adorare,</hi> when ſpoken of the Croſs, imports only a Reverence, which we own was practis'd on theſe Occaſions long before this time, becauſe the Croſs being no Image, there was no fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the Sin of Idolatry in ſaluting of it. This Count died in the year 1028.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50988:61"/>But ſince this Eleventh Century was in a manner wholly taken up by the Papiſts, in oppoſing <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who, upon ſeveral Attaques maintained the Intereſt of Truth, againſt <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> and his Followers; it will be our Buſineſs to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent how far theſe Diſputes were ſerviceable in hindring the Opinions of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> from getting the upper-hand in the Dioceſſes of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon,</hi> and how this prepar'd their Minds for a Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Never was any Man ſo often condemned as <hi>Berengarius,</hi> never was any Man more back'd than he, nor ever did any Man give more trouble to thoſe who endeavour'd to cruſh him, than he did. An Author of the 12<hi>th</hi> Century hath writ a Book, <hi>Concerning</hi> Berengarius<hi>'s manifold Condemnation</hi>;<note place="margin">De Multiplici Berengarij Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> and <hi>Mabillon</hi> hath taken care to collect the Names, and the Times of all thoſe Aſſemblies wherein he was condemned; but withal we may aſſert, that the Reaſons and Authorities he produc'd, gave his Enemies a terrible deal of Trouble. His Adverſaries have employ'd their utmoſt Efforts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the Memory of his Works; but a ſufficient part of them have been preſerv'd by their own care, to enable us to judg of the Injuſtice of their Calumnies againſt him, and of the Purity of his Faith in the Matter of the Euchariſt. And for as much as he was of conſiderable uſe to the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> in their oppoſing of the Doctrine of the Carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which the Faction of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> and his Followers endeavoured to introduce and eſtabliſh under the ſhelter and favour of that groſs Ignorance, which reigned at this time, I ſuppoſe I may affirm, that his Works, whereof <hi>Lanfrank</hi> hath given us an Extract, were of no ſmall Service to oblige thoſe, who undertook his Defence, to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Communion of the Pope, or rather, to hinder him from ſubjecting them to his Yoak; ſeeing it was at this very time, that the Popes began to make them ſelves Maſters of the Churches of the Weſt.</p>
               <p>It will be of great moment to prove that the Popes had not as yet made themſelves abſolute Maſters of this Part of the Church, which was always careful to maintain its Rights againſt their Encroachments and Uſurpations. My intent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50988:62"/>
therefore, is to employ the following Chapter upon this Subject, before I proceed to enquire how the Faith was preſerved in theſe Dioceſſes in the next Age, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit themſelves to the Authority of the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. That theſe Dioceſſes continued independent of the Popes, until the Beginning of the Twelfth Century.</head>
               <p>I Acknowledg, that were the buſineſs to be decided by the modern Pretenſions of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Empire of all the Churches of the World, and in particular to a Patriarchate over all the Churches of the Weſt, we ſhould be forced to own, that they had been ſubject to them ever ſince the time that the Goſpel was firſt preached in <hi>Gaul,</hi> in both theſe reſpects. They have made it their buſineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade Mankind that the whole World is but the Pope's Pariſh; and that more particularly, the Churches of the Weſt, which have been founded by their Anceſtors, who ſent them the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, do belong to their Patriarchate; as if theſe Envoys of the antient Popes, in their Endeavours to propagate the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt throughout the World, had deſign'd to eſtabliſh the Papal Empire over all the New Conqueſts that they acquired to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe new-found Claims and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the Popes, we can prove, that nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd more vain, or more deſtitute of any Ground or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than they are. For it is not true that thoſe Churches, which have received the Goſpel from another, are therefore ſubject to it, as we can demonſtratively evince by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Churches of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> which were founded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50988:62"/>
by Perſons ſent from the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was, that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſent them a Relation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution they ſuffered. Neither is it true, that the antient Popes, how careful ſoever otherwiſe they might be to promote their own Authority, did ever pretend to be the Patriarchs of all the Weſt, or of <hi>Gaul</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>This is a Truth we can unanſwerably prove, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which aſſigns no other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Pope, ſave that which he enjoyed in thoſe which <hi>Rufinus</hi> calls the <hi>Suburbicarian Regions,</hi> and which the Learned Men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent own to have been comprehended within the ten Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> to which the Papal Ordination did belong, as we ſee it was under <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> and which were diſtinguiſh'd from the Dioceſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> properly ſo called, that is to ſay, the ſeven Provinces, which conſtituted the Dioceſs of <hi>Milan.</hi> This Canon therefore looks upon it as a thing not to be queſtioned, that <hi>Gaul</hi> was a Dioceſs diſtinct from that of the Popes, having its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within it ſelf, governed by its own Synods, without having the Ordination of its Clergy, the Determination of its Affairs, or the Authority of its Aſſemblies ſubjected to the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as their Superiour.</p>
               <p>If we had not this Canon of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which diſtinctly determines the Pope's Dioceſs, yet would it be very eaſy to prove it by other Arguments, ſuch as theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find that the Churches of <hi>Gaul</hi> convocated a Synod, upon the conteſt about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> towards the end of the 2<hi>d</hi> Century, without receiving any Orders from Pope <hi>Victor</hi> for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find,<note place="margin">Optat. Lib. 1.</note> that when the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were condemned by the Pope, they deſired the Emperor that they might be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Biſhops of <hi>Gaul:</hi> and accordingly we find that <hi>Marinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> preſided in the great Council of <hi>Arles</hi> in the year 314, at which were preſent 83 Biſhops, twenty One of <hi>Italy,</hi> eleven of <hi>Spain,</hi> eleven of <hi>Africa,</hi> five of <hi>Britain,</hi> and thirty five of <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:50988:63"/>Since the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> we find the Churches of <hi>Gaul</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning themſelves with the ſame Independency, under the Conduct of their ſeveral Metropolitans.</p>
               <p>We are to obſerve in general, that theſe Churches had their peculiar Code of Canons, made by themſelves, and that theſe Canons continued to have the force of a Law till the 8<hi>th</hi> Century, when their Diſcipline began to receive a great Alteration, by the cares of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and his Succeſſors.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>T.</hi> 1. Bibl. Jur. Can. pag 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> This is amply proved by <hi>Juſtel,</hi> in the Preface to his Collection of the antient Canons. Now it is viſible, that a Church which had its particular Rules, could not be dependent on the Pope, whoſe Dioceſs had its own particular Rules and Canons.</p>
               <p>We can truly affirm, that the Biſhops of <hi>Gaul</hi> were ſo far from acknowledging the Pope as their Patriarch, that his Name was not ſo much as ever recited in the Churches of <hi>Gaul</hi> till the year 529, as may be clearly collected from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Vaiſon</hi>; where it was firſt determin'd, that the Pope ſhould be mention'd in their publick Prayers.</p>
               <p>And indeed if we enquire into the conſtant Conduct of the Biſhops of <hi>Gaul,</hi> throughout the ſeveral Centuries that are paſt ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> we ſhall eaſily perceive, that they never conceiv'd themſelves to be ſubject to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 337, <hi>Maximinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> defends St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> alſo did, and admits to his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and writes in favour of him to the Council of <hi>Sardica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 356, <hi>Saturninus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> convened the Council of <hi>Beziers,</hi> which condemned St. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> in conſequence of which he was ſent into Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>In 358, The Biſhops of <hi>Gaul</hi> condemned the Confeſſion of Faith of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> as we are informed by <hi>Sulpicius Severus.</hi>

               <p>And it was upon the ſame account, that he ſent them the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> againſt the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the 7<hi>th</hi> Century, we find that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops confirmed the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council that was aſſembled under <hi>Martin</hi> I.</p>
               <p>We find Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> inviting the Biſhops of <hi>Gaul</hi> to come to a Council that he intended to call, whither alſo they ſent their Deputies at his Requeſt.</p>
               <p>The 8<hi>th</hi> Century being in a manner wholly ſpent in Wars, affords us little or nothing conſiderable in this matter; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may eaſily diſcern that this Dioceſs did even then maintain its Authority, in ſpite of all the Popes Endeavours to the contrary: whereof we have two moſt evident Inſtances. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> I. was ſo little informed of what paſs'd in <hi>France,</hi> that he knew not whether the City of <hi>Bourges</hi> was ſubject to the Juriſdiction of another Archbiſhop or no; as appears from the <hi>Codex Carolinus, Epiſt.</hi> 87. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency clearly appears from the ſeveral Councils aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about the Controverſy of Images, contrary to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50988:64"/>
Deſigns of the Popes, and particularly from the Council of <hi>Francfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find the ſame Spirit alſo in the following Century. And to ſpeak truth, what-ever Change the antient Diſcipline un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-went by occaſion of the new Decretals, which the Pope's Emiſſaries had publiſhed, in order to ſubjugate all the Weſt, and <hi>France</hi> in particular; yet we find that the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> hindred the Popes from concerning themſelves with their Affairs: The Buſineſs of <hi>Hincmar</hi> of <hi>Laon</hi> alone, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews, that they did not acknowledg that new Right, invented to make them buckle to the Papal Yoak; for we ſee that they maintain'd that the Determinations of their Synods, were not to be alter'd by the Popes, they having no power to concern themſelves about their Ordination, or any part of their Juriſdiction. About the end of the 10<hi>th</hi> Century, in the year 991, we find the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> that were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Rheims,</hi> maintaining themſelves by the Canons of the <hi>African Code,</hi> in oppoſing the Pope's Encroachments, who would, in purſuance of thoſe ſpurious Decretals of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Popes, arrogate to himſelf a Right of reviewing and altering the Determinations that were made by the Synods of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I own, that ſince the middle of the 5<hi>th</hi> Century, we find the Popes granted a kind of Vicarſhip to ſome of the Biſhops of South-<hi>Gaul</hi>; but withal, we know that this Power was ſo extreamly wavering, that it ſtood in need of being confirmed at the Inſtance of <hi>Leo</hi> I. by the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> III. 2<hi>ly,</hi> That theſe were in a manner of no Efficacy at all, theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars having ſcarcely had the Power of convening Synods, but in virtue of the Right they had as they were Metropolitans, and little or no Authority as to the Ordination of Biſhops in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and of Metropolitans in particular.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied alſo, but that the Popes ſince the 8<hi>th</hi> Century, began to grant divers Priviledges, to the violating of the antient Diſcipline, though under the pretence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it in the Monaſteries, againſt the Attempts of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, becauſe moſt of the Biſhops, being turn'd Souldiers, thought of nothing elſe but Robbing them, under colour

of holding their Viſitations. But it is worth our while, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the eſteem that <hi>Hincmar</hi> of <hi>Rheims</hi> had of theſe ſort of Priviledges in his Letter to <hi>Nicholas</hi> I.
<q>Now I did not, ſaith he, deſire the Priviledges of the Apoſtolical See, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Holy Canons and Decrees which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> grants to every Metropolitan, were not ſufficient; neither did I, nor do I deſire any other or ampler Priviledges, than what have been formerly granted to the Church of <hi>Rheims</hi>; but becauſe not only my Dioceſs, but alſo my Province, is divided between two Kingdoms, belonging to two ſeveral Kings; and becauſe the Concerns of the Church, committed to my Charge, ſeem to lie under the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral Princes, from whom our Church can reap lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Advantage; becauſe the antient Conſtitutions being already condemned by ſome carnal and brutal Men, they might at leaſt be frightned by theſe new Decretals, into a more reverential Carriage towards the Church, which is committed to the Care of me, though unworthy.</q>
From whence we may ſee what it was that <hi>Hincmar</hi> meant.</p>
               <p>We may make the ſame Reflection upon thoſe Vicarſhips afore-mentioned: We have an illuſtrious Example to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the Caſe of <hi>Anſegiſus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> xi <hi>Kalend. July,</hi> Indiction IX.
<q>After the Biſhops were met together, and the Goſpels were read before the Synod, and in view of the Imperial Throne, (which were afterwards laid up at <hi>Pontyon</hi>) the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> came with the Legats of the Apoſtolical See, and after the ſinging of ſeveral Hymns, and a Prayer pronounced by <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> the Emperor took his Seat in the Synod. After which, <hi>John</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> read ſome Letters ſent from the Pope, and amongſt them one, recommending to them <hi>Anſegiſus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens</hi> for their Primate; that as oft as the Intereſt of the Church ſhould require it, either in calling of Synods, or in the managing of other Concerns in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> he might be look'd upon as the Apoſtolical Vicar; and ſo by his means, the Decrees of the Apoſtolical See, might be made known to the Biſhops; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, that any Matters of importance might by him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50988:65"/>
be communicated to the Apoſtolick See, and that all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of moment and difficulty, might by his Suggeſtion be recommended to the Apoſtolick See, to be cleared and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Whereupon, the Emperor demanded of the Biſhops, what Anſwer they deſigned to return to theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Letters: who anſwer'd to this effect, That ſaving the Right and Priviledges of each Metropolitan, according to the ſacred Canons, and the Decrees of the Popes of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> promulg'd from the ſaid ſacred Canons, they would obey the Apoſtolical Commands of Pope <hi>John.</hi> And when the Emperor, and the Apoſtolical Legats had done their utmoſt Endeavours to perſwade the Biſhops to an abſolute Anſwer, that they would obey without reſerve, in accepting of <hi>Anſegiſus</hi> for their Primate, as the Pope had written; yet could they never draw from them any other Anſwer. Then the Emperor commanded a Chair to be ſet above all the Biſhops of his <hi>Ciſalpine</hi> Kingdom, next to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> who ſat at his Right-hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Anſegiſus</hi> to take place of all the Biſhops that had been ordained before him, and to ſit down in that Chair; the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims</hi> proteſting againſt it, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them all, as a thing directly contrary to the ſacred Canons. In like manner, the day before the Ides of <hi>July,</hi> the ſame Letter concerning the Primacy of <hi>Anſegiſus,</hi> was read a ſecond time, at the Emperor's Command, and the Biſhops Anſwer demanded thereupon. Whereupon, the Archbiſhops anſwered ſeverally for themſelves, That as their Predeceſſors had been regularly obedient to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, ſo would they be to his Decrees. So likewiſe, at the Command of the Apoſtolical Legats, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould meet the 17<hi>th</hi> day before the Kalends of <hi>Auguſt</hi>; the Emperor entred the Synod at nine a Clock in the Morning — being accompanied by the Apoſtolical Legates — and all took their Places as before. Then <hi>Johannes Aretinus</hi> read a certain Paper, which had neither Reaſon nor Authority. Afterwards <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais</hi> read ſome Articles ſet down by the Apoſtolical Legats, and by <hi>Anſegiſus</hi> and <hi>Odo,</hi> without the Knowledg of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50988:65"/>
Synod, between — containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe; and beſides, void of all Reaſon and Authority, which for that reaſon, are not here added. And then again, a Motion was made concerning the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Anſegiſus,</hi> who after all, could obtain no more this laſt time, than he did at the firſt day of the Synod.</q>
From which account; it is moſt evident, that notwithſtanding all the pains <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> took to oblige the Pope, whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he had occaſion for, and whoſe Ambition he maintain'd, by trampling upon the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and the Rights of the Prelats of <hi>France</hi>; yet the Biſhops continued firm in their Judgments, and would not ſuffer themſelves to be enſlaved, as the Pope would fain have had them. This hapned in the year 876.</p>
               <p>In particular we may juſtly obſerve concerning theſe Parts, where the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> have appear'd with the greateſt luſtre, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That the greateſt part of theſe Dioceſſes, being rent off from the Empire after the year 409, when <hi>Alaric</hi> made <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> the Seat of the Kingdom of the <hi>Viſi-Goths,</hi> it continued ſo divided, till it was again reduc'd under the Power of the <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Clovis,</hi> in the year of our Lord 507. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That ſince that time, we find that theſe parts of <hi>France,</hi> have been almoſt always united with the Churches of <hi>Spain,</hi> as appears from the Subſcriptions of the Synods held in <hi>Spain.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> That they were never, to ſpeak properly, re-united with the Body of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> till the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Charlemain.</hi> 4<hi>thly,</hi> That the Power of the Popes in <hi>France,</hi> hath been ſo very inconſiderable, that a Legat of the Pope having undertaken to conſecrate a Chappel in <hi>Anjou</hi> by the Duke's Order, but without conſent of the Biſhop; <hi>Radul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Glaber,</hi> who relates this Hiſtory, could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt this Encroachment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> on the other hand, ſtorms againſt <hi>Glaber,</hi> but the one of them writ what thoſe of his time thought and ſpoke concerning it; whereas the other gave himſelf entirely up to the Power of Prejudice, and followed the Deſign he had undertaken of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting antient Hiſtory with the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> on which he had his Dependance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:50988:66"/>But we are eſpecially to obſerve, that the Popes never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exerciſe their abſolute Power there, till they had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Legats in thoſe Parts, and had brought all Cauſes to be tried at their Tribunal. Thus <hi>Paſchal</hi> II. appointed <hi>Girard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> to be his Vicar in the Provinces of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Bourdeaux, Tours</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> in the year 1107, as appears by the Commiſſion granted by <hi>Paſchal</hi> II.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thus the Legantine Power in the Dioceſs of <hi>Auſch</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after the year 1102, to <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Auſch,</hi> as <hi>De Marca</hi> ſhews,<note place="margin">Pag. 278.</note> on the Council of <hi>Clermont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I have juſt now obſerved, is ſo certain, that <hi>Mezeray</hi> hath publickly own'd it in his <hi>Chronological Abridgment.</hi> From the time of the 8<hi>th</hi> Century, the Popes found ways to leſſen the Power of Metropolitans, by obliging them by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a Council held at <hi>Mentz</hi> by St. <hi>Boniface,</hi> which forced them to receive the <hi>Pallium</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſubject themſelves, and be canonically obedient in all Points to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which Profeſſion was afterwards changed into an Oath of Fidelity, under <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. They alſo attributed to themſelves, excluding all others, the Power of annulling the Spiritual Marriage, which a Biſhop contracts with his Church, and to give him the liberty to eſpouſe another. They had extended their Patriarchal Juriſdiction all over the Weſt, by obliging the Biſhops to take Confirmation from them, for which they paid certain Dues, which in proceſs of time, were changed into what they call <hi>Annates,</hi> and by taking cognizance of thoſe things, which belonged to the Biſhops only. Nay what is more, they had in a manner wholly aboliſhed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils, in taking away their Soveraignty, by nulling of their Decrees; ſo that theſe Aſſemblies were at laſt wholly left off as uſeleſs, becauſe they afforded nothing to thoſe who aſſiſted at them, ſave the Diſpleaſure of frequently ſeeing their Determinations made void at <hi>Rome,</hi> without once hearing their Reaſons. <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. eſtabliſhed it for a Rule of Common Right, that no Body ſhould dare to condemn any Perſon, who had appeal'd to the Holy See. But they never made a greater Breach upon the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, than when
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50988:66"/>
they introduced this Opinion, that no Council could be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled without their Authority; and when after ſeveral Attempts to eſtabliſh perpetual Vicars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> they found the way of having their Legats received there. To this purpoſe, they firſt made uſe of a Canon of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which gave them Power to ſend Legats into the Provinces, to examine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and the Depoſitions of any Biſhops, in Caſes where any complaint was made. After that they had thus accuſtomed the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops to admit their Legats in this Caſe, they by little and little gain'd another Point, when the Princes were weak, which was to ſend ſome amongſt them without any Complaint or Appeal at all; and at laſt, after they had ſubmitted to the Yoak, <hi>Alexander</hi> II. eſtabliſhed it as a Rule, that the Pope ought to have the Government and Adminiſtration of all Churches.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Legats, ſome had a whole Kingdom under their Juriſdiction, others ſome part only: they came thither with full Power to depoſe Biſhops, yea, the Metropolitan himſelf, when ever they pleaſed to aſſemble the Councils of their Diſtrict, and to preſide therein with the Metropolitan; but taking place of him, to make Canons, to ſend the Deciſion of thoſe Matters to the Pope, to which the Biſhops would not give their Conſent, as likewiſe all the Acts of the Council, whereof he diſpoſed at his Will and Pleaſure. And it is to be obſerved, that their Suffrages outweigh'd thoſe of all the Biſhops together, and that oftentimes by their ſimple Authority, they judg'd and determin'd the Cauſes of the Elections, of Biſhops, of Benefices, of the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Lay-men, and the like. Inſomuch, that theſe Aſſemblies which before were ſo Sacred and ſo Soveraign, for the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and maintaining of Diſcipline, having no Power any longer, were, to ſpeak properly, rather Councils to authorize and ratify the Will and Pleaſure of the Pope, than any lawful or free Councils.</p>
               <p>So that it was not till the Papacy of <hi>Alexander</hi> II. and <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. that the Churches of <hi>Aquitain</hi> ſaw themſelves in danger of loſing their Liberty, by ſubmitting to the Papal Yoak, as well as the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. We are now to ſee how they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided this Yoak, which was thus impoſed upon them in ſome meaſure.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Oppoſition that was made by a Part of theſe Churches, to the Attempts of the Popes, and of their Separation from the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Peter Waldo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is difficult preciſely to ſet down the Year, wherein a conſiderable Part of theſe Dioceſſes, rejected the Power of the Pope's Legats, and lowdly condemned the Errors which they would have introduced, under the Name of Councils, which the Popes had ſo often aſſembled againſt <hi>Berengarius.</hi> But we have great reaſon to conclude, that it happened under <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. when he undertook to oblige the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> to ſwear an Oath of Fidelity to him, in much a like Form as Vaſſals ſwear to the Lords of the Fee, for in reality it is the very ſame; this ſtrange Piece of Novelty, which at one Blow deſtroy'd all the Rights of the Church, excited both Paſtors and People to defend their Liberties, and to reject this imperious Yoak. Then it was alſo, that he endeavour'd to change the Common Service of the Church, by ſtriking out all that was not agreeable to the Roman Service, which was very proper to inflame the Minds of the People, and make them more watchful for the Preſervation of the Doctrine and Ceremonies of Religion, which they had received from their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, It is certain that in the 11<hi>th</hi> Century, they changed the Collects which concern'd the Prayer for the Dead. We have an Example of it that was inſerted in the Decretal of <hi>Gregory</hi> IX.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Tit. 41. cap. 6.</note> 'Tis an Anſwer of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. to <hi>John de Beaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> who at that time was retired in the Abby of <hi>Clairvaux.</hi> It contains the Queſtion which that Archbiſhop, who was the Perſecutor and Condemner of <hi>Peter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50988:67"/>
Waldo,</hi> propounds to <hi>Innocent</hi> III. together with the Pope's Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your Brotherſhip has enquir'd why there was a Change made in the Service of Saint <hi>Leo</hi>; ſo that whereas the antient Books expreſs the Prayer thus, Grant to us, Lord, that this Offering may be of advantage to the Soul of thy Servant <hi>Leo</hi>; in the modern Books it is expreſt thus, Grant to us, O Lord, we beſeech thee, that by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> this Offering may be of advantage to us?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To which we anſwer, ſaith the Pope, That ſince the Authority of Scripture aſſures us, that he doth an Injury to a Martyr, who prays for a Martyr, we are by a Parity of Reaſon to judg the ſame of other Saints, becauſe they need not our Prayers, as being perfectly happy, and enjoying all things according to their Wiſhes: but it is we rather that ſtand in need of their Prayers, who being miſerable, are in continuable trouble, by reaſon of the Evils that ſurround us. Wherefore ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, <hi>That ſuch an Offering may be of advantage to this or that Saint, for their Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> which we meet with in moſt Prayers, are thus to be underſtood, That it may conduce to this end, that he may be more and more glorified by the Faithful here on Earth. Though moſt ſuppoſe it a thing not unworthy of the Saints, to aſſert that their Glory is continually encreaſed until the Day of Judgment; and therefore that the Church may in the mean time, lawfully wiſh for the encreaſe of their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification. But whether in this Point that Diſtinction may take place, which teacheth us, that of thoſe who are dead, ſome are very good, others very bad, others indifferently good, and others indifferently bad; and therefore whether the Suffrages of Believers in the Church for the very good, are Thankſgiving; for the very bad, Comforts to the Living; for thoſe who are indifferently good, Expiations; and for the indifferently bad, Propitiations; I leave to your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to enquire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the Popes, <hi>Nicholas</hi> II, and his Succeſſors, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to defend the Celibacy of the Clergy, by which means
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50988:68"/>
a great many Paſtors were depriv'd of the Functions of their Miniſtry, which obliged alſo a vaſt number of them to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the Communion of the Pope, whoſe Creatures, after the Decree was paſt for authorizng Celibacy, look'd upon the married Clergy to be no more than ſimple Lay-men; not to mention now that the Multiplicity of Schiſms and Anti-popes, had reduc'd moſt of the Dioceſſes of <hi>France</hi> into a ſtrange Confuſion, ſome holding for one Pope, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for another.</p>
               <p>But though we cannot aſſign the preciſe Epocha of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this couragious Oppoſition to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had no other Original, but the juſt Defence of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and the Deſire of preſerving their antient Truths; yet thus much ſeems to be certain, as far as we can gather from the poor Remainder of Records which the Barbarity of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors hath ſuffer'd to come down to us;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this publick Oppoſition againſt the Efforts of Popery, was made about the beginning of the 12<hi>th</hi> Century.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That without great Ignorance both in Hiſtory and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, it cannot be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> and that conſequently they are to be look'd upon as a Colony of the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is neceſſary, that we prove both theſe Articles with the greateſt clearneſs that may be; as well, on the one hand, to make it appear, that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath no ground to ſuppoſe that theſe Dioceſſes were peaceably united to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in dependence upon it, before the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> appeared amongſt them; and on the other hand, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe ſome of our own People, who too lightly have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> are eſteemed by ſome to be the ſame with the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that they borrowed their Light from <hi>Peter Waldo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Article can be very ſolidly proved by an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſeems beyond all Exception; I obſerve therefore, that <hi>Radulphus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Tron,</hi> about the year 1125, would not return from <hi>Italy</hi> through the Southern Parts of <hi>France, Audiebat pollutam eſſe inveterata Haereſi de Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini:</hi>
                  <q>Becauſe he heard they were polluted with an
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50988:68"/>
inveterate Hereſy concerning the Body and Blood of our Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee clearly that the Hereſy that reigned in theſe Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, was that of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who had beſtowed the Title of <hi>Myſtical Babylon</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not that of the <hi>Manichees.</hi> This Paſſage of <hi>Radulphus</hi> of <hi>Tron,</hi> agrees per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with what <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis,</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> after him tell us, that <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> had preached in the Dioceſs of <hi>Arles</hi> about the beginning of the 12<hi>th</hi> Century. Now it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to ſuppoſe, that one can declare a Country to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with an inveterate Hereſy, except there be great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men who publickly profeſs it.</p>
               <p>True it is, that they beſtow the Name of <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> upon the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> as if he had been the Author of that Sect; but this doth not overthrow what we have ſaid, and only ſhows that the Papiſts are uſually ready to beſtow upon the Diſciples the Name of their Maſters, thereby to reflect upon them as Innovators. Thus they called the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Berengarius, Berengarians,</hi> as if he had been an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator, who indeed took upon him the Defence of the old Notions, againſt the Innovations of <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus.</hi> In like manner, they called thoſe <hi>Henricians,</hi> who followed the Doctrine of <hi>Henry,</hi> who yet followed and preached the Doctrine of <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> and <hi>Berengarius</hi>; ſo that it doth not follow from thence, that <hi>Henry</hi> was the firſt that ever preached that Doctrine. Thus afterwards they gave the Name of <hi>Eſperonites</hi> to the Diſciples of <hi>Eſperonus,</hi> as if he had been the firſt Author of that Sect. And is not this very conformable to that antient Method, whereby <hi>Lindanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,</hi> made as many Heads of the Reformation as there were Men of note that had a hand in that great Work? A different Method, or the leaſt Article wherein they did not agree with their Brethren, ſerving him for a ſufficient Pretence to make them ſo many different Heads of diſtinct Parties.</p>
               <p>The Proofs I am about to produce in Confirmation of the ſecond Article, do no leſs ſhow the Truth of what I have laid down, that theſe Dioceſſes had a long time ſince a great number of People and Paſtors, who were of different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I do acknowledg that towards the end of the 12<hi>th</hi> Century, there may have been ſome of the Diſciples of <hi>Peter Waldo</hi> in theſe Dioceſſes of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon,</hi> which has occaſion'd that ſeveral Popiſh Writers have almoſt perſuaded ſome Proteſtants, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were the Authors of the Reformation amongſt the <hi>Albigenſes. Perrin</hi> takes it for granted in the beginning of his Hiſtory, which he was the more eaſily perſuaded to believe, ſince he had obſerved that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> have maintained the ſame Faith with the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>

               <p>But it is not true that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> ever carried their Faith into theſe Countries, but they found it there already eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and they join'd themſelves to thoſe who defended the ſame, before ever any of <hi>Waldo</hi>'s Diſciples came thither to ſeek refuge for themſelves.</p>
               <p>This is a Matter of Fact which it is eaſy to prove beyond controverſy; for ſeeing that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was in that Country in the year 1147, to preach there, and that he made but ſmall progreſs in it, (ſo firmly were they grounded in their Faith) we muſt neceſſarily infer from hence, that they had for a long time been engaged in the ſame. And indeed, it appears from the manner of St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s expreſſing himſelf in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and in his Epiſtle to the Count of St. <hi>Gilles,</hi> that theſe Opinions ſo oppoſite to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had of a long time been entertained in theſe Countries.</p>
               <p>We have the 4<hi>th</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> in the year 1163, which declares the Antiquity of this pretended He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy in <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> and the Country about <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and ſpeaks of their Meetings, which the Title of the Canon juſtly refers to the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi>

<q>In the Country about <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> there ſprung up long ago a damnable Hereſy, which by little and little, like a Cancer, ſpreading it ſelf to the neighbouring Places in <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> hath already infected many other Provinces; which whilſt, like a Serpent, it hid it ſelf in its own Windings and Twinings, crept on more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and threatned more Danger to the Simple and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary. Wherefore we do command all Biſhops and Prieſts, dwelling in theſe Parts, to keep a watchful Eye upon theſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50988:71"/>
Hereticks, and under the pain of Excommunication, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all Perſons, as ſoon as theſe Hereticks are diſcover'd, from preſuming to afford them any Abode in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or to lend them any Aſſiſtance, or to entertain any Commerce with them in Buying or Selling; that ſo at leaſt by the loſs of the Advantages of human Society, they may be compell'd to repent of the Error of their Life. And if any Prince, making himſelf Partaker of their Iniquity, ſhall endeavour to oppoſe theſe Decrees, let him be ſtruck with the ſame Anathema. And if they ſhall be ſeized by any Catholick Princes, and caſt into Priſon, let them be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by Confiſcation of all their Goods: and becauſe they frequently come together from divers Parts into one hiding-place, and becauſe they have no other ground for their dwelling together, ſave only their Agreement and Conſent in Error; therefore we will, that ſuch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles be both diligently ſearch'd after, and when they are found, that they be examined according to Canonical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Canon expreſly declares; 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That this pretended Hereſy had appeared a long time before. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That it had infected ſeveral Provinces of theſe Dioceſſes. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That moſt ſevere Methods were made uſe of to reduce them. This appears by the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the year 1179, in the laſt Chapter. And it is plain alſo from the Letters of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon</hi> to King <hi>Lewis</hi> VII;<note place="margin">Epiſtolae diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorum de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Francicis.

                  <q>My Lord the King, we are extreamly preſſed with many Calamities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which there is one that moſt of all affects us, which is, that the Catholick Faith is extreamly ſhaken in this our Dioceſs, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Boat is ſo violently toſſed by the Waves, that it is in great danger of ſinking.</q>
Now ſince <hi>Lewis</hi> VII died in the year 1180, having reigned ever ſince the year 1137, it appears clearly that <hi>Languedoc</hi> was full of the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> a long time before ever <hi>Waldo</hi> or any of his Diſciples had begun to preach.</p>
               <p>We may gather the ſame from what is related by <hi>Henry</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clairvaux</hi> in the Annals of <hi>Hoveden, Anno</hi> 1178, where he ſaith; <hi>That this Plague was come to ſuch a Head in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50988:72"/>
that Country, that they had not only made themſelves Prieſts and Popes, but alſo had their Evangeliſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I own that <hi>Hoveden</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe, that the Faith of theſe <hi>Albigenſes</hi> came from <hi>Italy,</hi> by his calling them <hi>Paterines</hi>; for as for the name of <hi>Publicans,</hi> it was like that of <hi>Cathari,</hi> given them on purpoſe to blacken them, and is the ſame with that of <hi>Bulgarians</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonians,</hi> all relating to the Original of the <hi>Manichees</hi> who came out of thoſe Countries at firſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> It appears from the Edicts quoted by <hi>Hoveden,</hi> that they were made againſt People of a more antient ſtanding than the Diſciples of <hi>Waldo.</hi>

<q>For whereas the Heretical Peſtilence, which of old time hath been ſown in thoſe Parts, was now grown to that height, that Divine Worſhip was ſcorned and derided, and the Hereticks on one hand, and the Robbers on the other, haraſſed the Clergy and the Churches Revenue, and that both Prince and People being given over to a reprobate Mind, ſwerved from the true Faith, now by means of your Armies, by which you have moſt wiſely deſigned to purge away the Infection and Noiſomneſs of this Peſtilence, and their moſt Chriſtian Leader, the Earl of <hi>Montfort,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Warriour, and unconquered Fighter of the Lord's Battels; the Church which was ſo miſerably ruinated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins again to lift up her Head, and both Enemies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors being for the moſt part deſtroyed, the Land which hath ſo long been waſted by the Followers of theſe Opinions, will at length accuſtom it ſelf again to the Worſhip of God.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ſame thing appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> a Monk of <hi>Veaux Cernay,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Hiſtory:
<q>In the Province of <hi>Narbon,</hi> where formerly the Faith flouriſhed, the Enemy of the Faith has begun to ſow his Tares. The People there are diſtaſted with the Sacraments of Chriſt, who is the Savour and Wiſdom of God, being become profane and unwiſe, by forſaking the Wiſdom of true Godlineſs.</q>
And after having repreſented how the Monks, <hi>Petrus de Caſtro Novo</hi> and <hi>Radulphus,</hi> the Pope's Legats, had forced thoſe of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> to abjure their Faith for fear of Puniſhments, but that ſoon after they returned again to their former Opinions; he adds,
<q>For being perjured, and relapſing into their former Calamity, they conceal'd the Hereticks that preached at Midnight in their Conventicles. O how difficult a thing it is to pluck up a deep-rooted Cuſtom! This treacherous City of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> from its very firſt Foundation (as 'tis ſaid) hath ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never been clear of this deteſtable Plague; this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50988:73"/>
Poiſon of Heretical Pravity, and ſuperſtitious Infidelity, having been ſucceſſively diffuſed from Father to Son. Wherefore ſhe alſo, as a due Vengeance for ſo great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, has endur'd the Effects of avenging Hands, and the Ruin of a juſt Deſolation. — Yea what is more, ſhe has ſuffered this Heretical Nature, and home-bred Hereſy, after it had been driven out by a well-deſerved Severity, to return again upon her; being deſirous to imitate her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and refuſing to degenerate.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Opinions of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and their Diſciples, and whether they were <hi>Manichees</hi> or not.</head>
               <p>WE find that tho ſome <hi>Manichees</hi> ſetled themſelves in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> yet it ſeems they have only ſerv'd to give the Papiſts a colour, to accuſe thoſe whom their Errors, and their falſe Worſhip obliged them to look upon as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Church. This will appear yet more clearly, by the account we are about to give here of the Opinions of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> of <hi>Henry,</hi> and of their Diſciples, whom the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> would willingly have thought to have been <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees. Baronius</hi> was not ſo quick-ſighted as the Biſhop; but becauſe it happens oft, that thoſe who ſtand upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a tall Man can ſee a little further than he, we muſt enquire, by examining this Matter carefully, whether we are to believe <hi>Baronius,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The care of the Inquiſition, has ſcarely left us any record of <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi>; ſo that we know ſcarce any thing of what concerns him, but what we have from the report of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thoſe Enemies too to that degree, that they us'd Fire and Sword to deſtroy him; which alone is ſufficiently a ſtrong Preſumption, that they had little or no Inclination to extenuate the Horridneſs of his Opinions, nor to put a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Senſe upon them, when according to the Rules of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they could have given them a good one. Be it as it will, <hi>Peter</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> bears witneſs that <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> from whom the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> have been called <hi>Petrobuſians,</hi> had taught almoſt 20 years in the Dioceſſes of <hi>Arles, Embrun,</hi> and in <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> whither the Perſecution, which he ſuffer'd from the Biſhops and Archbiſhops of thoſe Dioceſſes, ſtirr'd up againſt him by <hi>Peter de Clugny,</hi> had forc'd him to take refuge. He
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50988:74"/>
declares that he had made a great number of Diſciples, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts theſe Prelats to oppoſe themſelves againſt the Progreſs of his Doctrine, by forcing him in this his Retreat, not only by preaching againſt him, but alſo if it were needful, <hi>Vi armatâ per Laicos,</hi> with armed Force by Lay-men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Biſhops anſwered theſe Exhortations of <hi>Peter de Clug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> perfectly well; ſo that after they had obliged him to keep more private, they watched him ſo cloſely by their Votaries, that at laſt they ſeized him at St. <hi>Gilles,</hi> where they caus'd him to be burnt in the year 1126, to the great ſatisfaction of <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> and of <hi>Baronius,</hi> who highly extol the Zeal of thoſe, who by this means had avenged the Injury he had done to Croſſes, in burning them to boil his Meat on Good-Friday.</p>
               <p>This is one of the Crimes laid to his Charge by <hi>Peter de Clugny,</hi> a Crime of ſuch a Nature, that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may upon the ſame account, be look'd upon as a moſt profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though we know that his Zeal herein was approved by God himſelf. At this rate alſo, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be look'd upon as a very negligent Prelate for not burning St. <hi>Ephiphanius,</hi> who at <hi>Anablatha,</hi> had torn the Hangings of a Church in which he found the Pictures of Jeſus Chriſt, and of ſome other Saints. And <hi>Gregory</hi> I, muſt paſs for a negligent ignorant Perſon for not burning <hi>Serenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> who broke down the Church-Images, as well as <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> in a Time when Idolatry was not yet come to its height. For as for his boiling Meat with the Wood of the Croſs on Good-Friday, and eating of the ſame, ſuppoſing he had indeed done ſo, (though there be great probability to the contrary, and that it was only one of thoſe ſlanderous Imputations the Monks make uſe of to ſtir up the Fury of the ignorant Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) it would at the moſt have been no more than a notable Action to awaken theſe Idolaters, by ſetting before them their own Pagan Folly, deſcribed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the 44<hi>th</hi> Chapter of his Prophecy.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only Crime of <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi>; he was not only an Image-breaker, but he had beſides, during theſe twenty Years of his Miniſtry, preached up many Hereſies: the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50988:74"/>
chiefeſt of which <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> reduceth to five Articles, as being more horrid than the reſt.
<q>And becauſe, ſaith he, the firſt Seeds of this erroneous Doctrine were ſown and propagated by <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> for almoſt 20 years together, they brought forth chiefly five poiſonous Shoots, againſt which I oppos'd my ſelf as much as I was able.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Firſt conſiſted in denying that Infants could be ſaved by Baptiſm, when they are under the Age of Reaſon; and that the Faith of the Parents can be available to thoſe who are not of Age to believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Second conſiſted in maintaining that no Temples or Churches ought to be built, and that thoſe already built, ought to be deſtroyed; and that Chriſtians did not need holy, that is, conſecrated Places to worſhip God in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Third conſiſted in aſſerting that they ought to break down and burn the holy Croſſes, becauſe that Figure, and that Inſtrument wherewith Jeſus Chriſt had been ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly tormented and put to Death, was ſo far from being worthy of Adoration, Veneration, or any other kind of Supplication, that it ought to be diſhonoured with Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, broke to pieces and burnt, to revenge our Saviour's Torments and his Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fourth conſiſted, not only in denying the Truth of the Body and Blood of our Lord, which is offer'd up every day, and continually by the Sacrament of the Church; but alſo in maintaining that it was nothing, and ought not to be offered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fifth conſiſted in deriding all the Offerings, Prayers and Alms, and other good Works done by the Faithful that are living, for thoſe that are dead, becauſe they could not by any of theſe means, afford them the leaſt Comfort.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the Hereſies which <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> had taught for 20 Years together, which is time enough to know the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of one Man. And though <hi>Peter de Clugny,</hi> by his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being a Monk, and his mortal Enemy, was eaſily perſuaded to indulge his Credulity ſo far as to believe ſome Reports ſpread abroad concerning the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> that they did not own the Old Teſtament, which put

him upon proving the Divinity thereof, yet he inſiſted ſo little upon it, that he ſhows he was not perſuaded in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> were <hi>Manichees:</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ought to have imitated his Diſcretion in the ſame Matter.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith the Biſhop, they rejected Baptiſm, which is one of the Characters of the <hi>Manichees.</hi> If he had ſaid that <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> had revived the Error of the <hi>Hieracites,</hi> whom St. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> ſpeaks of, he would have had more Reaſon on his ſide; for the firſt Article, as <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> hath expreſſed it, comes very near the Opinion of the <hi>Hieracites:</hi> but it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe, that it agrees with the Belief of the <hi>Manichees</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Sacrament. The <hi>Manichees</hi> abſolutely rejected Baptiſm; whereas, if we will believe <hi>Peter de Clugny,</hi> the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſians</hi> did not look upon it as needleſs, but only to Infants. In a word, <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> attributes to them a kind of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, which maintain'd, that Infants were not capable of Baptiſm, and that it was only to be conferr'd upon ſuch as were full grown, becauſe at the receiving of it, they were to make Profeſſion of their Faith for themſelves. At this rate we might as well accuſe <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> We ſhall find hereafter, that this Error was not general amongſt them, becauſe the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> reject it as a ſlanderous Imputation, and becauſe the Malice which appears in the wording of this Calumny, is nothing but the effect of that Hatred wherewith <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> was inflamed againſt theſe pretended Hereticks.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Article is viſibly nothing elſe, but a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence drawn from the Averſion the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> had for the Popiſh Churches, becauſe of the Idolatries there committed, and of their Conſecrations to the honour of Saints. It is no ſuch ſtrange thing to ſee Men condemn Temples to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, which they believe to have been profaned by Idolatry. <hi>Gregory</hi> I was one of the firſt that ever conſecrated Pagan Temples into Meeting-Places for Chriſtians; whereas before, the Emperors had ordered them to be ſhut up, and caus'd ſome of them to be pull'd down. It is very ordinary for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50988:76"/>
thoſe who deteſt the Idolatry reigning in Churches, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to remove all the Objects of it at the greateſt diſtance from thoſe whoſe Salvation they endeavour to procure. Laſtly, We know that the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> judg'd the Pope to be the Antichriſt, which might very well prompt them to ſo great an Averſion for theſe kind of Buildings, in which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt had his Throne, as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> had diſtinctly foretold. But let Men think what they pleaſe, this Article has nothing of <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>The third Hereſy of the <hi>Petrobuſians,</hi> hath ſtill leſs of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm</hi> than the former. It is evident that this alſo is nothing but a popular Conſequence againſt the Worſhip of the Croſs, which was then practiſed upon diverſe occaſions, of which we have before ſeen an Example, at the Death of a great Lord of that Country. But whereas he ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſians</hi> did acknowledg, that Jeſus Chriſt hath endured the Croſs, and that he died upon it; in ſo doing he fully acquits them of being <hi>Manichees,</hi> ſince they did not own that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt truly died upon the Croſs. Moreover it muſt be confeſs'd, that no Man could better have renewed the Doctrine of St. <hi>Agobardus,</hi> than <hi>Peter de Bruys,</hi> when he maintained that neither Veneration, Adoration, nor Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were due to the Croſs, and that they were to be broken in caſe People were found to beſtow any ſuch Worſhip upon them. For this was the Doctrine of <hi>Agobardus,</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Pictures.</p>
               <p>The fourth Hereſy is expreſs'd in very odious terms,<note place="margin">Tom. 9. Bib. Patr. Pariſ. p. 1278.</note> and after the Popiſh manner, who own nothing to be real in the Sacrament, if the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt and his Blood be not there in Subſtance, and who do not believe he is preſent in the Sacrament upon any other account, but as he is offered up to God before he is eaten. But yet here there is nothing in this double Article of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> On the contrary we may aſſert that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Opinion rather is a Branch of <hi>Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> than theirs: for is not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Bread? and doth not the Subſtance of the Bread become the Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt? and the Prieſt, or the Faithful when they digeſt it, do they not reſtore the Body of Chriſt to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50988:77"/>
in freeing it of its Bonds, by which the Charm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration tied it up?</p>
               <p>The Act of Oblation which the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> blamed in the Maſs, is more clearly explained by their Diſciples, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. In the mean time, it is worth obſerving, that they oppoſed the Change, which then began to be made in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which being accompliſhed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that Addition in the Liturgy, where they make the Prieſt ſay, <hi>Et pro quibus tibi offerimus,</hi> And for whom we offer up to thee; whereas before the whole Offering reſpected only the People, <hi>Qui tibi offerunt,</hi> Who offer up unto thee, in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to that Cuſtom of the People's offering the Bread and Wine which was uſed at the Communion. As ſoon as the Faith of the Real Preſence was once entertained, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inquired what uſe might be made of it, and they found that it might be offered up to God, before it was offered to the People: and when they were once confirmed in the Belief of this Cuſtom, they found it was neceſſary for the Prieſt to expreſs a Sacerdotal Act; whereas therefore the People before ſimply offered the Bread and Wine to God, in order to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Communion with it, after Conſecration they thought good to ſubſtitute the Prieſts offering of them up for the People. This was more diſtinctly practiſed in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century, as <hi>Menardus</hi> the <hi>Benedictine</hi> informs us in his Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Sacramentarium</hi> of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> though before that time we find ſome Footſteps of this Opinion.</p>
               <p>The fifth Article which rejects Purgatory, and maintains, that the Living cannot help the deceaſed Believers by their Prayers, Alms or good Works, nor by any Maſſes deſignedly ſaid for them, has as little <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> as the former: For as the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Manichees,</hi> for condemning the Uſe of Infant-Baptiſm; ſo neither can they be eſteemed <hi>Manichees</hi> for denying Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead. Let the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> turn over as long as he pleaſeth the Catalogue of Hereſies, he will no-where be able to find that the rejecting of Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead, are Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:50988:77"/>Is not the Biſhop therefore, think we, very judicious, in taking <hi>Peter de Bruys</hi> and his Diſciples for <hi>Manichees</hi>? whereas he ought to have taken notice of two things in <hi>Peter de Clugny:</hi> The 1<hi>ſt,</hi> is that <hi>Peter de Bruys,</hi> whom they accuſe of having boiled Meat on Good-Friday with broken pieces of the Croſs, eat of it when he had done, with thoſe who aſſiſted at that Execution. The 2<hi>d</hi> is, that he maintained,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 2.</note> that Prieſts and Monks ought rather to marry,<note place="margin">Theſ. Cath. Tom. 2. l. 8. Art. 6.</note> than to live in a ſingle State defiled with Impurity: <hi>Coecius</hi> makes this Article one of the Hereſies of <hi>Peter de Bruys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One clearly ſees what ſolid Grounds the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> had to accuſe <hi>Peter de Bruys</hi> of <hi>Manicheiſm:</hi> Let us now ſee whether he hath any better Succeſs with <hi>Henry</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Peter de Bruys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Burning of <hi>Peter de Bruys</hi> at St. <hi>Gilles,</hi> did not ſtifle the Doctrine that he maintained, it had taken too deep Root in theſe Dioceſſes: On the contrary it encreaſed very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, after it was once watered with the Blood of that Martyr. The Oppoſition which the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruys</hi> made to the falſe Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they indeavoured to introduce into theſe Dioceſſes, after that they had made them ſubmit to her Yoak, was very uſeful to awaken the People. Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the Diſciple of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> being then in <hi>France</hi> (where he was more exactly informed of theſe Difficulties than the <hi>Roman</hi> Emiſſaries) took the Alarm very hotly.

                  <q>How great Evils have we heard and known that <hi>Henry</hi> the Heretick hath done and does every Day in the Churches of God? He wanders up and down in your Country in Sheeps Clothing, being indeed a ravenous Wolf: But according to the Hint given by our Lord, we know him by his Fruits. The Churches are without People, People without Prieſts, Prieſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Reverence; and laſtly, Chriſtians without Chriſt. The Churches of Chriſt are looked upon as Synagogues, the Sanctuary of God is denied to be holy; Sacraments are no longer eſteemed ſacred; holy Feaſts are deprived of feſtival Solemnities; Men die in their Sins; Souls are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50988:78"/>
ſnatch'd away to appear before the terrible Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who are neither reconciled by Repentance, nor armed with the ſacred Communion: The Life of Chriſt is denied to Chriſtian Infants, by refuſing them the Grace of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; nor are they ſuffered to draw near unto Salvation, though our Saviour tenderly cries on their Behalf, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</hi>—This Man is not of God, who acts and ſpeaks things ſo contrary to God; and yet alas he is liſtned to by many, and has a People that believe him. O moſt unhappy People! at the Voice of an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick all the Voices of the Prophets and Apoſtles are ſilenced, who from one Spirit of Truth, have declared that the Church is to be called by the Faith of Chriſt out of all the Nations of the World: So that the Divine Oracles have deceived us, the Eyes and Souls of all Men are deluded, who ſee the ſame thing fulfilled, which they read before to have been foretold: which Truth, though it be moſt manifeſt to all, he alone by an aſtoniſhing and altogether <hi>Judaical</hi> Blindneſs, either ſees not, or elſe is ſorry to ſee it fulfilled; and at the ſame time, by I know not what Diabolical Art, perſwades the fooliſh and ſenſeleſs People not to believe their own Eyes, in a thing that is ſo manifeſt; and that thoſe that went before have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thoſe that come after have been deceived; that the whole World, even after the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood, ſhall be loſt, and that all the Riches of the Mercies of God, and the Grace of the Univerſe, are devoted upon thoſe alone whom he deceives.</q>

Baronius</hi> in his Annals gives us an Account of this <hi>Henry,</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Peter de Bruys,</hi> and his Death, in the Year 1147, which ſeems to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 240.</note> becauſe St. <hi>Bernard</hi> writ to the Count of St. <hi>Gilles,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to drive <hi>Henry</hi> out of his Country, where he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Doctrine very freely: But the Earl died in the Holy Land, having been poiſoned there (as it was ſaid) by the Queen: Wherefore in the Year 1147, <hi>Henry</hi> ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the Sollicitation of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clairvaux,</hi> by

the Cruelty of <hi>Albericus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> Cardinal and Legate of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> II at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> where he cauſed him to be burnt, after they had brought him thither loaden with Irons. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſets down with great Care, whatever he thought might blemiſh the Reputation of the Martyr. He relates all that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote againſt him to <hi>Aldephonſus</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Gilles.</hi> He quotes St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who calls <hi>Henry</hi> an Apoſtate Monk, and accuſeth him of having made uſe of the great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he had in Preaching, as a means to get Money to ſpend at Gaming, and upon his Luſts. He ſays, that <hi>Henry</hi> was a Man defiled with Adulteries, who for his frequent Crimes, durſt not appear in ſeveral Parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and who by Conſequence was not to be indured in the Territories of the Count of St. <hi>Gilles</hi>: but yet he doth not lay any thing of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm</hi> to his Charge, no more than <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> and St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>: Nay, <hi>Baronius</hi> does more, for he formally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from thoſe Hereticks whom St. <hi>Bernard</hi> oppoſed under the Name of <hi>Apoſtolicks,</hi> in his 66<hi>th</hi> Homily upon the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
               <p>How then could the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> make a <hi>Manichee</hi> of him? Perhaps the looſe Life, whereof St. <hi>Bernard</hi> accuſeth him, may be a Character of it. But not to undervalue the Vanity of this looſe Accuſation, without any Proof, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ſworn and cruel Enemy, which was quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the couragious Martyrdom of <hi>Henry</hi>: At this rate the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were ſo generally guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter Damian</hi> writ a Book, intituled, <hi>Gomorrhaeus,</hi> muſt have been <hi>Manichees</hi>; and upon the ſame Ground <hi>Johannes Cremenſis,</hi> a Cardinal, the Pope's Legate in <hi>England,</hi> for aboliſhing the Marriage of the Prieſts, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been a <hi>Manichee</hi>; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians ſay that this Holy Cardinal, having aſſembled a Synod at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein he repreſented to the Prieſts, that it was the worſt of Crimes to riſe from a Whore to conſecrate the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, was himſelf ſurprized in Bed with a common Whore, the ſame Day that he had ſaid Maſs. Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count alſo the Legats of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> the Competitor of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> II, muſt have been <hi>Manichees,</hi> for they are taxed with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50988:79"/>
carrying Women along with them in Mens Habits, probably to avoid the Inconvenience that <hi>Johannes Cremenſis</hi> fell into in <hi>England,</hi> for want of taking this Care before-hand.</p>
               <p>They charge <hi>Henry</hi> with the ſame Hereſies which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Peter de Bruys</hi>; ſo that what I have already ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Hereſies of the <hi>Petrobuſians,</hi> I need not repeat here. <hi>Baronius</hi> adds, I confeſs, that <hi>Henry</hi> had ſuperadded to theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies this Propoſition, <hi>Additis irrideri Deum Canticis Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> That the Singing in Churches was but a mocking of God. And accordingly <hi>Peter de Clugny</hi> refutes this pretended Hereſy with a great deal of Earneſtneſs: But if I may ſpeak my Opinion in this matter, neither did this Propoſition contain any great Crime.<note place="margin">De Offic. pag. 184. &amp; cap. 10.</note> For 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Singing in general was owned by <hi>Iſidore</hi> as an Innovation. It was about 70 Years before, that the Popes had aboliſhed the ancient Liturgies, to ſubſtitute the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy. The <hi>Gothick</hi> Liturgy, which was uſed in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and other neighbouring Dioceſſes, which at that time depended on the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, becauſe it was not over-favourable to the Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> They had at the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a ſort of riming Verſes, which they call <hi>Proſes,</hi> ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, ſo fooliſh, and ſo full of Novelties, both as to the Worſhip of Saints, and as to the fabulous Stories they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that it was very difficult for thoſe who looked for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their Prayers, not to take them for Profanations. The Hymn compoſed by King <hi>Robert,</hi> in Honour of Queen <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,</hi> may give us an hint what ſort of things they were, <hi>O Conſtantia Martyrum, &amp;c.</hi> And now let any one judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> was a <hi>Manichee,</hi> becauſe he condemned this ſort of Profanations.</p>

<q>That there were two ſorts of Hereticks, the one ignorant and looſe, who were a ſort of <hi>Manichees</hi>; the other more learned and remote from ſuch Filthineſs, who held much the ſame Opinions as the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and were called <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

               <p>HAving thus juſtified <hi>Peter de Bruys, Henry,</hi> and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from the Imputation of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> has endeavoured to faſten upon them: We will yet further endeavour to clear this Point, by examining the Conference of <hi>Alby,</hi> from whence the Biſhop thinks that he has drawn a ſolid Argument to confirm his Imputation. Let us ſee how this Conference is related by <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> in his Annals upon the Year 1176.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It was in this Year that the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy was condemned, which had well nigh infected all the Province of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> There were, ſaith he, certain Hereticks in the Province of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who called themſelves <hi>the Good Men</hi>; they were ſupported by the Militia of <hi>Lombez,</hi> and preached and taught the People contrary to the Chriſtian Faith, profeſſing themſelves not to own the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Prophets, nor the Pſalms, nor any part of the Old Teſtament, nor the Doctors of the New Teſtament, ſave only the Goſpels and the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with the ſeven Canonical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Acts of the Apoſtles and the Revelation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Being queſtion'd concerning their Faith, <hi>proceeds he,</hi> and concerning the Baptiſm of Infants, and whether they were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50988:80"/>
ſaved by Baptiſm; and concerning the Body and Blood of our Lord, where it was conſecrated, or by whom, and who were thoſe that received it; and whether it were more or better conſecrated by a good Man, than by a wicked Man; and concerning Marriage, if a Man and Woman could be ſaved, that knew one another carnally. They anſwered, That they would ſay nothing of their Faith, nor of the Baptiſm of Infants; neither were they obliged to ſay any thing of thoſe Matters. Concerning the Body and Blood of our Saviour they ſaid, That he who received it worthily, was ſaved; and that he who received it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, procured his own Condemnation. Concerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage they ſaid, that a Man and Woman join themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to avoid Fornication, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. They alſo declared many things, without being queſtioned; as that they ought not to uſe any Oaths whatſoever, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid in his Goſpel, and St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle. They ſaid alſo that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had foretold that they ought to ordain Biſhops and Prieſts in the Church, and that if theſe Orders were not conferred upon ſuch as he there commands, that then they were neither Biſhops nor Prieſts, but ravening Wolves, Hypocrites and Deceivers, who loved the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Market-places, the firſt Places, and the firſt Seats at Feaſts; who love to be called Maſters, againſt the the Commandment of Jeſus Chriſt; who wear white and ſhining Garments; who wear Rings of Gold, and precious Stones on their Fingers, which their Maſter never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. Accordingly they maintained, that ſince the Biſhops and Prieſts were like to thoſe Prieſts who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they ought not to obey them, becauſe they were wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After divers Reaſons alledged on both ſides in Preſence of the Biſhop of <hi>Alby,</hi> they choſe and ſetled Judges on both ſides, with Conſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Alby.</hi> After this, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Hoveden</hi> obſerves, that the Prelates cited divers Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of the New Teſtament (for theſe Hereticks, ſaith he, would not be determined but by the New Teſtament) and that afterwards the Biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> pronounced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50988:80"/>
Sentence, drawn from the New Teſtament in theſe terms, I <hi>Giſlebert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> at the Command of the Biſhop of <hi>Alby</hi> and his Aſſeſſors, do judg that they are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and I condemn the Opinions of <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, where-ever they are: And we judg this from the New Teſtament: I bring therefore for this Reaſon, Proofs to confirm the Divinity of the Old Teſtament, drawn from the New, and thereby oppoſe theſe Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they owned, that they received <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and the Pſalms, only in thoſe Particulars, which Jeſus and his Apoſtles had by their Teſtimony approved, and not in others: whereupon he maintains with reaſon, that if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Teſtimony in Writing is allowed of in one part, the whole muſt needs be owned, or elſe wholly caſt aſide.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the ſecond place, ſaith he, We convict them, and judg them to be Hereticks, by the Authorities of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for we ſay, that he has not the Catholick Faith, who doth not confeſs it when he is required, and when it is expoſed to any Danger; whence it is that our Lord in the Acts of the Apoſtles, ſaith to <hi>Ananias,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Paul,</hi> For he is to me a choſen Veſſel, to carry my Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Hereticks alſo boaſt themſelves, that they do not lie; whereas we maintain that they lie manifeſtly, for there is Deceit in holding ones Peace as well as ſpeaking; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo <hi>Paul</hi> boldly reſiſted <hi>Peter</hi> to his Face, becauſe he gave way to the Circumciſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the third place, ſaith he, We convict and judg them to be Hereticks by the Authorities of the New Teſtament; for we ſay that God will have all Men to be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which he produces the Proofs for Infant-Baptiſm, and ſolves the Objection, taken from Infants wanting Faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God: We ſay that it is by the Faith of the Church, or of their God-fathers, as the Man ſick of the Palſy was healed by the Faith of thoſe who preſented him, and let him down thorow the Tiling of the Houſe.</q>

                  <q>In the fourth place, ſaith he, We do convict and judg them as Hereticks by the Authorities of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Body of our Lord cannot be conſecrated but by a Prieſt, be he good or bad; which he proves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſecration is made by the Words of Jeſus Chriſt. Moreover, he proves that the Conſecration of the Body of our Lord muſt be celebrated in the Church, and by the Miniſters of the Church only, whoſe Authority he aſſerts from Paſſages of Scripture.</q>

                  <q>In the fifth place, We convict and judg them to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by the Authority of the New Teſtament, becauſe they will not own that Man and Wife, if carnally joined, can be ſaved; and yet they are wont to preach in publick, that Man and Wife cannot be ſaved if they know one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother carnally: by ſtriving to preach up the Study of Virginity, ſaith he, they ſeem to derogate from the State of Marriage, and to condemn it; which he refutes by the common Proofs.</q>

                  <q>In the ſixth place, ſaith he, We convict and judg by the Authorities of the New Teſtament, that they are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and ſeparated from the Unity of the Church; for we ſay, that the Lord hath given the Power to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of binding and abſolving, ſaying, Whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, If any one among you be ſick, let him call for the Prieſts of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and again, Behold, I ſend unto you wiſe Men and Scribes; but as our Lord ſaith, All Men cannot comprehend this Saying.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Moreover, We ſay, that they ought to have ſtood up, in Anſwering and Diſputing concerning the Goſpel, becauſe all Chriſtians ſtand when the Goſpels are read; now if we ought to ſtand when they are read, much more ought we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50988:81"/>
to ſtand when they are read and expounded together. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought they to have ſat down after that they had once choſen to ſtand. Beſides, We have many Authorities, by which it plainly appears, that we ought to be ſtanding when the Goſpel is reading, as that, where it is ſaid, <hi>And Jeſus ſtood in the Plain</hi>; and again, <hi>Jeſus ſtood and cry'd, ſaying</hi>; and again, <hi>There ſtands one in the midſt of you, whom ye know not.</hi> Moreover, Jeſus was in a ſtanding Poſture, when, after his Reſurrection, he confirmed his Diſciples, and preached unto them; as it is written, <hi>Jeſus ſtood in the midſt of his Diſciples, and ſaid, Peace be with you.</hi> And as for them, ſaith the Biſhop, they have no right to judg, but only to anſwer; for the Lord ought to ſit, to whom all Judgment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Father. But as for them, they judg not, but are judged, and it is not permitted to them to preach in the Churches. Theſe Hereticks are ſuch, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> foretels of, when he ſaith, that there ſhall be wicked Men and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who will go on to grow worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived; for the time ſhall come, that they will not bear ſound Doctrine, but will turn their Ears away from the Truth to Fables. And again, From which ſome going aſtray, have given themſelves to vain things, who deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtand not what they ſay or affirm. He maintains, that they ought to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Diſobedience of thoſe Hereticks, and to give them publick Correction, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, That Sinners ſhould be reproved openly in the Preſence of all for their Amendment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaking to Biſhops, ſaith, Being always ready to reprove every Diſobedience, and having Power to confute thoſe that gainſay; and again, <hi>Exhort, rebuke, and reprove with all Authority</hi>; and again, <hi>I have delivered them to Satan,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover, <hi>Being abſent, I have already judged,</hi> &amp;c. And laſtly, <hi>Who ever ſhall preach any other thing, let him be accurſed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the ſeventh place, the ſaid Biſhop queſtioned them concerning Repentance, whether it were ſaving when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the laſt Gaſp, or whether Souldiers mortally wounded, may be ſaved if they repent at laſt; or whether
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50988:82"/>
every one ought to confeſs their Sins to the Prieſt and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, or to ſome Lay-man, or to thoſe of whom St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Confeſs your Sins one to another?</hi> To which they anſwered, that it was ſufficient for thoſe that were ſick, to confeſs to whom they would. As for Souldiers, they would anſwer nothing, becauſe St. <hi>James</hi> there ſpeaks only of the Sick. It was alſo asked them, whether one ſingle Act of Contrition of Heart, and one Confeſſion of the Mouth were ſufficient, or whether Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction were neceſſary, after Penance had been enjoined, in deploring their Sins, by Faſting, Alms, and Affliction, if they had opportunity. To which they anſwered, ſaying, that St. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>Confeſs your Sins one to another, that you may be healed</hi>; ſo that by theſe Words, they knew that the Apoſtle did not enjoin any thing elſe, but only to confeſs to one another; and that ſo they ſhould be ſaved, and that they would not be better than the Apoſtle, by adding any thing thereto of their own, as the Biſhops do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Hereticks added beſides, that the Biſhop who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence, was an Heretick, and not they; and that he was their Enemy, and a ravening Wolf, a Hypocrite, and an Enemy of God, and that he had not judged rightly, and that they would not anſwer any thing concerning their Faith, becauſe they miſtruſted him, as our Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in the Goſpel; <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, who come unto you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves.</hi> And that he was their malicious Perſecutor, and they were ready to make it appear from the Goſpels and the Epiſtles, that he was not a good Paſtor, neither he, nor all the reſt of the Biſhops and Prieſts, but rather Hirelings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Biſhop anſwered, That the Sentence had been duly pronounced againſt them, and that he was ready to verify the ſame either in the Court of Ld. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pope, or in the Court of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> or of <hi>Raimond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> or of his Wife who was preſent, or in the Court of <hi>Frenkwel,</hi> who was there preſent, that he had paſſed a right Judgment, and that they were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50988:82"/>
Hereticks, and branded as ſuch. He promiſed alſo that he would indict them for Hereſy, and that he would denounce them to be ſuch in all Catholick Courts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Hereticks ſeeing themſelves convicted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, turned themſelves towards all the People, ſaying, Good People, the Faith which we now confeſs, we confeſs for your Sakes. The Biſhop anſwered, You ſay, That you ſpeak for the Sake of the People, and not for God's Sake.</q>
And they ſaid,
<q>We believe that there is one only God, in three Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; and that the Son of God hath taken our Fleſh upon him, that he was baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he faſted in the Wilderneſs, that he hath preached our Salvation; that he ſuffered, died, and was buried; that he deſcended into Hell, that he roſe again the third Day, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, that he ſent the Holy Ghoſt on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that he ſhall come at the Day of Judgment to judg both the Quick and the Dead, and that All ſhall riſe again. We know alſo, that what we believe with our Heart, we ought to confeſs with our Mouth. We believe, that he is not ſaved, who doth not eat the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated but in the Church, and by the Prieſt be he good or bad; and that it is no better conſecrated by a good than by a bad one. We believe alſo, that none can be ſaved but thoſe that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and that little Children are ſaved by Baptiſm. We believe alſo, that Man and Wife are ſaved, though they be carnally joined; and that every one muſt repent with his Mouth and Heart, and be baptized in the Church by a Prieſt; and that if they could ſhow them more from the Goſpels and Epiſtles, they would believe and own it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſaid Biſhop told them alſo, That if they ſhould ſwear, they would be obliged to keep the Faith, and if there were any thing elſe, that they ought to confeſs it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before they had maintain'd wicked Opinions, and had ſpoken ill. They anſwered, That they could not ſwear at all, becauſe in ſo doing, they ſhould ſin againſt the Goſpel and the Epiſtles. Whereupon, they produced againſt them Authorities out of the New Teſtament; and after they had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50988:83"/>
been cited and heard on both ſides, one of the Biſhops ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, paſt his Judgment in this manner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I <hi>Gozelin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lodeve,</hi> by permiſſion and command of the Biſhop of <hi>Alby</hi> and his Aſſeſſors, do judg and declare openly, That theſe Hereticks are in a wrong Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter of Oaths: they muſt ſwear, if ſo be they deſire to be received: for in Matters of Faith, Men ought to ſwear; and foraſmuch as they are infamous and ſtain'd with Hereſy, they muſt clear their Innocence; and returning to the Unity of the Church, they muſt confirm their Faith by an Oath, as the Catholick Church holds and believes; that ſo the weak ones that are in the Church be not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and that the infected Sheep may not ſpoil the whole Flock. Neither is this contrary to the Goſpel, or to the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; for though it be ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>Let your Communication be yea, yea, nay, nay; and thou ſhalt not ſwear neither by the Heaven, nor by the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. yet it is not forbidden to ſwear by God, but only by the Creatures; for the Heathens worſhipped the Creature; and if it were permitted to ſwear by Creatures, we ſhould give to the Creatures the Reſpect and Honour which is due to God alone; and thus Idols and Creatures would be ador'd as God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After ſeveral Arguments to prove the Lawfulneſs of Swearing, he added; Or it may be thoſe Expreſſions in the Goſpel and the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> are only by way of Advice, and not by way of Precept, becauſe if Men did not ſwear, they would not be forſworn; and whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of Evil; that is, of Sin or of the Devil, who perſuades Men to ſwear by Creatures. Finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they were convicted in this Point alſo, they ſaid that the Biſhop of <hi>Alby</hi> had agreed with them, that he would not force them to ſwear; which the Biſhop of <hi>Alby</hi> denied, and ſtanding up, ſaid, I confirm the Sentence which <hi>Gozelin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lodeve</hi> hath pronounced, which was given by my Order, and I give notice to the Militia of <hi>Lombez,</hi> not to protect them. This was ſign'd by the nine Biſhops,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50988:83"/>
Clerks, Abbots, and Laymen, with this Concluſion, We approve this Sentence, and we know they are Hereticks, and we reject their Opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Subſtance of what paſt at the Conference of <hi>Alby,</hi> according to the Relation of <hi>Roger Hoveden.</hi> One ſees that he repreſents to us theſe three Things; 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations laid to the charge of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>; they are accuſed of ſeveral Articles, which are pure <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> The Arguments they brought to convict them. 3<hi>dly,</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> in oppoſition to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</p>
               <p>As for their Accuſations, we are to obſerve, that they are only Conſequences of their being look'd upon as Hereticks, ſuch as they pretended had been long ſince condemned in the Councils held againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi>; and accordingly they make a Recapitulation of the Errors, either defended by the <hi>Cathari,</hi> or commonly attributed to them, and with theſe they charge the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> without further Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>They produce indeed ſome Witneſſes who accuſe them, and maintain, That they have heard ſome of them maintain <hi>Manichean</hi> Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>But the manner of their juſtifying themſelves, confounds this Accuſation, and theſe Witneſſes. 1. They declare, That the Silence they kept, was like that of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſometimes held his Peace, without anſwering the Queſtions of the Phariſees. 2. They call'd the Perſons appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them, falſe Witneſſes and Impoſtors, in as handſom a Manner as could be ſhown to Perſons of their Quality, who appeared againſt them. 3. They propound their Confeſſion of Faith, in Terms wholly Orthodox, addreſſing themſelves to the People, who had been Witneſſes of theſe horrid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</p>
               <p>Probably ſome will ſay, Here is a Company of Men actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accus'd of abominable Hereſies, and here are Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to prove it really upon them. To this, I have three things to anſwer. 1. That we have this Conference from the hand of their Enemies only. 2. That what is inſiſted on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50988:84"/>
the Authority of their Witneſſes, is overthrown by a very natural Reflection; which is, That the Integrity of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> was ſo well known, and their Adverſaries ſo much noted for their Inclinations to Calumny, that the Princes and all the People favoured them. This is obſerved by <hi>Puylaurens</hi> in his Chronicle, and it is taken notice of by <hi>Ribera</hi> in his Antiquities of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and yet their Enemies have ſtill gone on to accuſe them of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. The <hi>Albigenſes</hi> juſtified by a Conference, whereof we have an Account written by <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Foncaud.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHat I have here repreſented in general, might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to clear the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> from the charge of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheiſm,</hi> which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> after ſo many Ages, hath improv'd againſt them, but that we have ſomething more to ſay. This Biſhop, who makes the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> only Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though he looks upon them as another ſort of Schiſmaticks than the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> hath pretended to prove this buſineſs infallibly, by the Conference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Bernard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Foncaud</hi> hath given us the Relation, and which was held in Preſence of <hi>Bernard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon.</hi> He obſerves therefore, that it appears from the ſaid Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that thoſe againſt whom the Diſpute was maintain'd, differ'd from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only in the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Diſpute, ſaith he, chiefly concern'd the Obedience that is due to Paſtors, which we find that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> denied, and that notwithſtanding all Prohibitions to the contrary, they believ'd they had power to preach, both Men and Women; and ſince this their Diſobedience could not be grounded but upon the Unworthineſs of the Paſtors,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50988:84"/>
the Catholicks in proving Obedience to be due unto them, prove it to be due even to thoſe that are wicked; and that whatſoever the Channels be, Believers do not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Grace through them. For the ſame reaſon, they ſhew, that this ſpeaking againſt of their Paſtors, whence the pretence of diſobeying them was taken, is forbidden by the Law of God. Afterwards they confute the Liberty that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took to themſelves of Preaching without leave of their Paſtors, and indeed in oppoſition to their Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and they ſhew that this ſeditious kind of Preaching, tends to the Subverſion of the Weak and Ignorant. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, they prove from Scripture, that Women, to whom Silence only is recommended, muſt not undertake to teach. Laſtly, They repreſent to the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that they do ill in rejecting Prayer for the Dead, which hath ſo much Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Scripture, and ſo clear a Succeſſion in Tradition. And as theſe Hereticks abſented themſelves from the Churches, to pray amongſt themſelves in private in their Houſes, they tell them, that they ought not to leave the Houſe of Prayer, the Holineſs whereof was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in Scripture, and even by the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we may ſee the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> in caſe they be the Perſons concern'd, (though the Biſhop pretends they are the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>) ſufficiently cleared from all the Accuſations of <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> that can be formed againſt their Faith. For according to theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, if we believe the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> they cannot be charged with any thing of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot perfectly agree to what the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, from their examining only theſe pretended Differences, in the Conference held before the Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon,</hi> that there was no other Difference betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe againſt whom the <hi>Papiſts</hi> diſputed at this Conference. There are ſolid Reaſons that hinder me from being of the Biſhop's Opinion: but however it be, he cannot defend himſelf from having furniſhed his Adverſaries with the moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way in the World, to overthrow without much enquiry,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50988:85"/>
all that he had done to prove that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were guilty of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in truth this Diſpute, whereof the Abbot of <hi>Foncaud</hi> gives us an account, was not maintain'd againſt the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> For 1. the Biſhop might eaſily have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd as much, from the Preſence of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> the Matter in queſtion relating to the Intereſt of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. 2. Becauſe the Abbot of <hi>Foncaud,</hi> who is the Relator, was one of the principal Actors, his Abby being in the Dioceſs of <hi>Narbon.</hi> 3. Becauſe this Conference, with ſome others, ſerved as a Prologue to the Cruelties exerciſed againſt the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Miniſters, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made uſe of theſe Ways of Sweetneſs, before they came to the Extremities of a <hi>Croiſade,</hi> which interrupted their other Projects towards <hi>Greece</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It follows clearly from hence, that according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Biſhop, the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> cannot be more juſtly accuſed of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> than the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> concerning whom he pretends, that the Abbot of <hi>Foncaud</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>I cannot imagine how the Biſhop can anſwer the Force of this Argument, except only by denying that he is miſtaken, and pretending that this Conference was held with ſome of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> who had fled into the Dioceſs of <hi>Narbon,</hi> and had ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably propagated their Doctrine there, that a publick Diſpute was judg'd neceſſary to ſtop the progreſs of it.</p>
               <p>But 1<hi>ſt,</hi> it would be very ſtrange, that they ſhould be able in ſo ſhort a time to make themſelves more conſiderable than the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> and the <hi>Henricians,</hi> with whom we know that the Dioceſſes of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Narbon</hi> were already fill'd, according to the Teſtimony of their Enemies. 2<hi>dly.</hi> Were it ſo, it would be neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Bernard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon,</hi> who died the ſecond of <hi>October</hi> 1191, made it his Buſineſs to ſtop the Progreſs of ſome of <hi>Waldo</hi>'s Diſciples, who at that time, could ſcarcely be known, (<hi>John de Beaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> who condemned <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> not having poſſeſſed his See above 10 Years, as far as we can judg, which he then quitted to retire to <hi>Clairvaux,</hi>) whilſt in the mean time, he took no notice of the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:50988:85"/>
3<hi>dly.</hi> It is ridiculous to ſuppoſe, againſt the Credit of all Hiſtorians, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> compos'd a diſtinct Body from the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, clearly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there were no <hi>Vaudois</hi> that had Churches, and that made a diſtinct Body. 4<hi>thly.</hi> Neither do we find that the cruel Inquiſition made any ſuch like diſtinction about this Matter, in uſing more or leſs Cruelty, according to the Degrees of Schiſm and Hereſy, as 'tis pretended they ought to do, in caſe they would act juſtly.</p>
               <p>But whatever Anſwer the Biſhop may invent to defend his Opinion, we have a ſure Way to overthrow it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and 'tis the ſame which he himſelf hath furniſh'd us with; for he owns that the Conference of 1206, mentioned by the Monk of <hi>Vaux Cernay,</hi> was a Conference with the <hi>Vaudois.</hi> Beſides,<note place="margin">Pag. 222.</note> that which <hi>Bernard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Foncaud</hi> hath ſet down, we have another, ſaith he, in <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Vaux Cernay,</hi> about the year 1206, where the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were confounded: now all Men know, that the Conference of 1206, was held with the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Vaux Cernay,</hi> who lived at that time, aſſures us in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why then will the Biſhop ſay, Did not they diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbon,</hi> but only upon theſe four Points? The Queſtion is eaſily anſwered: They diſputed about many other Articles, but either he who wrote the Conference, did not give us a Relation of the whole, as not ſuppoſing it convenient to publiſh their Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe other Opinions and Superſtitions, which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes</hi> oppos'd; or elſe they wanted time to examine the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles of the Roman Faith which they rejected.</p>
               <p>What I ſay now, is not a Conjecture at random, produced only to ſtop the Biſhop's Anſwer, but is Matter of Fact groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Relation which we have of the Conference of <hi>Montreal,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>All this will lead us to paſs a true Judgment on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations which the Popes, King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> II, iſſued out againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> in their Bulls and Edicts. They endeavour'd in ſhort, to make them be look'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50988:86"/>
upon as infamous <hi>Manichees,</hi> as a Company of <hi>Arians,</hi> and as the moſt execrable Hereticks. The Popes prepoſſeſſed the Kings and Emperors with theſe Notions, by the reproachful Names which they faſtned upon them, after they had gotten the power to lead them by the Noſe as ſo many wild Beaſts: hence proceeds that heap of Names which we find in the Bulls and Edicts of that time.</p>
               <p>The Reflection we ought to make on all theſe Terms of Obloquy, is this, that excepting only the Names of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Cathari,</hi> particularly given to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> it appears from theſe Edicts, that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> did both believe the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But if what I have ſaid is ſufficient to ſhew the Injuſtice of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in making the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> paſs for <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi>; the matter may be ſtill further cleared, if we turn over the Books of <hi>Alanus Magnus,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Doctor</hi>;<note place="margin">Contra Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Paganos &amp; Judaeos Opus quadripartitum.</note> for it appears clearly from his Treatiſe againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks of his time, and above all againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which he dedicated to <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Montpellier</hi>; that it was the Faſhion at that time to treat the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> as <hi>Manichees</hi>; and to confound them with thoſe Hereticks, whereas their Faith was very oppoſite to that of the <hi>Manichees</hi>; for in his Refutation he huddles them altogether, without almoſt any Diſtinction, though their Principles were very different. It ſeems he made uſe of this way, that he might make uſe of his common places the better; or elſe he did it to avoid frequent Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place therefore <hi>Alanus</hi> refutes the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who aſſerted that there were two Principles, whereof the one was Good, the other Evil; and maintained that the evil God had created the World; of whom alſo ſome affirmed, that the Souls of Men were Apoſtate Angels, who ſhould be ſaved after their Abode in humane Bodies; and that the Souls of the Patriarchs had no ſhare in the Salvation of Jeſus Chriſt. They held likewiſe that Jeſus Chriſt did not take upon him a true Body, and that he never eat or drunk. They believed that the Body of Man was the Workmanſhip of the Devil, and that it ſhould not riſe again, and they ſeemed to think that Souls periſhed with their Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:50988:86"/>He refutes ſome, who though they believed the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, yet denied him to be the Son of God: others who maintained that Jeſus Chriſt had taken a celeſtial Body; that the Virgin had been created in Heaven, and had neither Father nor Mother. He takes up the firſt 34 Chapters of his firſt Book in confuting theſe Opinions.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in his 35<hi>th</hi> Chapter, he refutes the Opinion of thoſe who pretended that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was publiſhed by the Devil, and that the Fathers of the Old Teſtament were all damned.</p>
               <p>As to the Sacraments, whereof he treats from the 39<hi>th</hi> Chapter, he owns that ſome of thoſe Hereticks, whom he oppoſeth in general, abſolutely rejected Baptiſm; theſe were <hi>Manichees</hi>; that others denied the Efficacy of it to Infants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Original Sin; that others again believed it unprofitable to Children, and only uſeful for thoſe of riper Years; and he diſputes againſt every one of theſe Opinions.</p>
               <p>In Chapter 45, he diſputes againſt thoſe who denied Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be uſeful without the Impoſition of Hands. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he confutes thoſe that maintained, that we ought not, after having obtained the Pardon of our Sins in Baptiſm, hope to obtain the ſame Grace a ſecond time by Repentance, which obliged them to excommunicate thoſe who relapſed into their Sins after Baptiſm, which they proved from the 6<hi>th</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and becauſe Penance was no more to be reiterated than Baptiſm or Orders. It ſeems that theſe <hi>Albigenſes</hi> had a Diſcipline like that, which prevailed in the Church, before the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, where they never admitted to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thoſe who had committed any great Crimes after their Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>In the 50<hi>th</hi> Chapter he attacks other Hereticks, who aſſerted that Penance did not procure Remiſſion of Sins, becauſe it is God alone that can pardon Sins. One ſees plainly enough what they meant, eſpecially becauſe he adds, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was ſufficient to confeſs their Sins to God, which they proved by the Authorities of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Maximus,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi>

Item, cum forma illa ſub quâ latet corpus Chriſti dividatur in partes, ſub illa formâ deſinit corpus Chriſti: quomodo ergo ſub ſingulis portionibus illius Hoſtiae datur corpus Chriſti? Item, ſi corpus Chriſti latet ſub illâ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguá formâ, ubi eſt Chriſti caput vel pes? Et ita indiſtincta ſunt membra illius. Item, Chriſtus dedit ſuum corpus diſcipulis ante Paſſionem: ſed dedit eis mortale vel immortale: ſi immortale dedit, ſed tunc erat mortalis; ergo quando erat mortalis immortalis erat, quod eſt impoſſibile. Item, ponatur quod aliquis celebraverit divina tempore paſſionis Chriſti, corpus exiſtens Romae, paſſum fuiſſet Romae, quia ubicunque erat, patiebatur tempore paſſionis, &amp; ſic non patieba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tantum in Hieruſalem, ſed in multis aliis locis.

Item, cum ſanguis Chriſti glorificatus ſit, nec faciat localem diſtantiam, videtur quod Calice repleto ſanguine, alius liquor poſſit infundi. Item, Chriſtus ait in Evangelio, Omne quod in os in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat, in ſeceſſum emittitur. Ergo Chriſti corpus non intrat, quando

                  <q>And this they endeavour to prove thus: If the Bread every Day ſhould be changed into the Body of Chriſt, it would be infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. They inquire alſo whether the Bread ceaſe to be: If it ceaſeth to be, then is it annihilated, and ſo it is ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Alſo they ask, How a Body of ſo great a Bulk can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Mouth of a Man? Whether the Body of Chriſt be eaten, chew'd with Teeth, and conſequently divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts? Whether the Bread becomes the Body of Chriſt, becauſe then it will be the Body of Chriſt, that is to ſay, ſomething elſe than it is? Whether the Bread becomes the Body; and if ſo, then Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and ſo Bread will be the matter of Chriſt's Body? Alſo after Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation the Accidents do remain; if ſo, they muſt be in another Subject, in the Air, for Inſtance; but if there, then ſome part of the Air muſt be round, ſavoury and white; and as this Form is carried through divers places, ſo the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents change their Subject. Again, theſe Accidents abide in the ſame part of the Air, and thus Solidity will be in the Air, becauſe they are ſolid, and conſequently the Air will be ſolid. Hence it appears that theſe Accidents are not in the Air; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they in the Body of Chriſt; neither can any other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be aſſigned, in which they are, ſo that the Accidents do not ſeem to remain. Again, when the Form or Figure, in which the Body of Chriſt lieth hid, is divided into Parts, the Body of Chriſt continues no longer in that Figure which it had before: how therefore can the Body of Chriſt be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of that Hoſt. Again, if the Body of Chriſt be hid in that little form, where is the Head or Foot? and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Members muſt be indiſtinguiſh'd. Again, Chriſt gave his Body to his Diſciples before his Paſſion: Now he gave it them either mortal or immortal; if he gave it immortal, yet it is certain that then it was mortal: and conſequently whilſt it was mortal, it was immortal, which is impoſſible. Again, ſuppoſe we that ſome one or other had celebrated the Communion at the time that Chriſt ſuffered; the Body that was (ſuppoſe) at <hi>Rome,</hi> would have ſuffered there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whereſoever it was, it ſuffered at the time of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50988:88"/>
Paſſion; and ſo Chriſt would have ſuffered not only at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but in many other places. Again, ſuppoſe that a Mouſe ſhould come to the Pix, in which the Body of Chriſt is, and eat ſome part of it; the Mouſe would eat ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Air, or Accidents, or the Body of Chriſt; but it is abſurd to ſay, that the Mouſe ſhould eat either Air, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and much more abſurd it is to ſay, that it eats the Body of Chriſt. Again, Seeing that the Blood of Chriſt is glorified, and does not fill a Place, it ſeems to follow, that when the Cup is full of Blood, ſome other Liquor may be poured into it. Again, Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, whatſoever enters in at the Mouth, is caſt forth into the Draught; whence it will follow, that the Body of Chriſt doth not go in at the Mouth when it is given to be eaten, or if it does, it muſt be caſt forth into the Draught.</q>
In the 59<hi>th</hi> Chapter,<note place="margin">Pag. 246. col. 2.</note> he relates this Objection of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> concerning the ſame Matter: <hi>Quaerunt etiam Haeretici, utrum ſit Articulus fidei Chriſtianae panem tranſubſtantiari in Corpus Chriſti, cum de hoc non fiat mentio in aliquo Symbolo: non enim in Symbolo Apoſtolico: ſcilicet,</hi> Credo in Deum; <hi>vel in Nicaeno,</hi> Credo in Unum, <hi>&amp;c. vel in Symbolo Athanaſii,</hi> Quicun<expan>

                  <q>The Hereticks alſo demand, whether it be an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, that the Bread is tranſubſtantiated into the Body of Chriſt, ſeeing there is no mention made of it in any Creed; for we do not meet with it in the Apoſtles Creed, that is, <hi>Credo in Deum</hi>; nor in the Nicene, that is, <hi>Credo in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num</hi>; nor in the Athanaſian, <hi>Quicun<expan>

               </p>
               <p>I have ſet down theſe Arguments in order, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> becauſe it is viſible to any one that will take the pains to examine them, that they are the ſame that were urged by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> as appears by the Extracts of his Book, which <hi>Lanfrank</hi> has preſerv'd, and afterwards by thoſe, who in the 12<hi>th</hi> Century endeavour'd to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50988:88"/>
qualify and defend the Abſurdities of the Confeſſion, which they made <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſign. 2<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe it plainly appears that thoſe who admitted the three Creeds, the Apoſtles, the Nicene, and the Athanaſian, did not reject the uſe of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which yet he lays to their charge,<note place="margin">Chap. 63.</note> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remote from <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> Neither doth he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, ſave only to ſome of theſe Hereticks, which makes it manifeſt, that he hath confounded all theſe People together, and that he only purſued his Matter, and his common Places, without giving us particularly the Opinions of every one of theſe Hereticks.</p>
               <p>We find, that he charges them with rejecting the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confirmation,<note place="margin">Chap. 66.</note> becauſe there is no mention made of it, neither in the Goſpel, nor in the other Books of the New Teſtament, as an Inſtitution of Chriſt. They rejected alſo the Sacrament of Orders, as it was believed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> See what <hi>Alanus</hi> ſaith of it:<note place="margin">Ch. 67. p. 251.</note> 
                  <hi>Dicunt etiam fidei Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae inimici, Ordinem, ut Diaconatum vel Sacerdotium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> non eſſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum, quod ſic probare conantur: Non legitur in aliquâ Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicâ Scripturâ Apoſtolos ordinatos fuiſſe in Sacerdotes, cur ergo corum Vicarios ſic ordinari oportet.

                  <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Adverſaries of the Catholick Faith affirm, that the Order of Deacons or Prieſts, is not a Sacrament, which they endeavour to prove thus. We do not read in any part of Canonical Scripture that the Apoſtles were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Prieſts, and therefore what neceſſity is there that their Vicars ſhould be ſo. Again, The Apoſtles who are ſaid to be the higher Prieſts, were never anointed, and why then are their Vicars anointed? It is forepaſt Merit and true Worth that makes one fit for any Function, what need therefore is there of Orders?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning extream Unction, they believe after this manner: <hi>Dicunt etiam extremam olei <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctionem, quae datur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmis, nec eſſe Sacramentum, nec aliquem habere effectum, quia hoc Sacramentum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctionis infirmorum ab Apoſtolis inſtitutum non le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As to Churches, we find that they follow'd the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Peter de Bruis:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>Non deſunt qui dicant locum materialem non eſſe Eccleſiam, ſed conventum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delium ſanctum: quia, ut aiunt, locus ad orationem non pertinet; ſicut enim ubique eſt Deus, ſic ubique adorari vel orari poteſt. Hoc autem probare nituntur Authoritate Chriſti, dicentis Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanae, Mulier crede mihi, venit hora, quando nec in Monte hoc, nec in Hieroſolymis, adorabitis Patrem: Sed venit hora &amp; nunc eſt, quando veri adoratores adorabunt in Spiritu &amp; Veritate. Item, Si locus facit ad Orationem, cur Heremitae antiquitus in locis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis habitantes, Eccleſias non habebant? Cur etiam Sacramenta ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum ſuum habent, etſi non celebrantur in loco qui dicitur Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia? Item, quid operantur Parietes ad ſupplicandum ei qui ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que eſt, cum in uno loco non magis ſit quam in alio? Chriſtum etiam in montibus &amp; locis deſertis legimus oraſſe, non in locis orationi dedicatis. Item, eſtne fructuoſior oratio quae fit in Templo, quam illa quae fit in agro, ſi par fuerit devotio?</hi>
                  <q>There be ſome who affirm, that the Church is not a material Place, but an holy Aſſembly of Believers; for, ſay they, Place is not of any concern to Prayer, becauſe as God is every where, ſo he may every where be worſhip'd and pray'd to. This they endeavour to prove by the Authority of Chriſt, ſaying to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman; <hi>Woman, believe me, the hour comes when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>worſhip the Father; but the hour comes and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Again, If the Place be any furtherance to Prayer, why had not the Hermits of old, who liv'd in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Places, their Churches to pray in? Or how can the Sacraments be of any efficacy, when they are not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Place call'd a Church. Again, What do Walls help us to pray to him who is every where, and not more in one Place than he is in another. We read alſo, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50988:89"/>
Chriſt went aſide to Mountains and deſert Places to pray, and not to Places appointed for Prayer. Again, Is the Prayer that is perform'd in the Church of more efficacy than that which is offer'd up in the Field, ſuppoſing the Devotion of both to be alike?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt the Prayers that are made to Saints, they objected as follows: <hi>Dicunt etiam Heretici quidam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>Orationes Sanctorum non prodeſſe vivis, nec vivorum orationes mortuis: probare etiam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur; quod Sancti non orant pro vivis, qui ſciunt qui ſint ſalvandi vel damnandi; pro illis autem quos ſciunt ſalvandos non orant, quia ſuperflua eſſet eratio, quia ſive orent, ſive non, ſalvabuntur: Si vero orarent pro damnatis non aſſequerentur quod petunt, &amp; ita beati non eſſent; beatus enim eſt, cui omnia optata ſuccedunt. Item, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet judicabitur ſecundum opera ſua, &amp; non aliena merita, nec pro alienis meritis reddetur ei: &amp; ideo orationes Sanctorum non proſunt; vel quantum ad meritum, vel quantum ad praemium; quia non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent merita vel praemia. Item, Sancti non ſunt in loco merendi, ſed recipiendi; ergo orationibus nec aliis bonis merentur ſibi vel aliis. Item, In Evangelio Lucae legitur, Quod Abraham dixit animae Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitis quae erat in inferno, Magnum Chaos firmatum eſt inter nos &amp; vos; ubi Chaos nihil aliud vocavit, niſi diſſimilitudinem bonorum &amp; malorum tantam, ut etiam ſancti damnatis non compatiantur. Si vero non compatiantur, nec orant pro eis.</hi>
                  <q>Some Hereticks alſo aſſert, that the Prayers of Saints are of no uſe to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor thoſe of the Living to the Dead. That the Saints do not pray for the Living, they prove thus: Becauſe the Saints knowing who ſhall be ſaved, and who damned, they can not pray for thoſe they know ſhall be ſaved, ſince their Prayers would be ſuperfluous, ſeeing whether they pray or no, they will be ſaved: but ſhould they pray for thoſe that ſhall be damned, they would not obtain what they pray for, and ſo would not be happy; for he is only happy, who has all his Deſires. Again, Every one ſhall be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Works, and not according to the Merits of another, neither ſhall any Man receive according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of other Men; and therefore the Prayers of the Saints profit nothing, either in regard of Merit or Reward, becauſe they cannot encreaſe either a Man's Merit or Reward. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50988:90"/>
The Saints are not in a Place where they can merit, but only where they receive; and therefore by their Prayers or other good Works, can neither merit any Good for themſelves or for others. Again, We read in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the Soul of the rich Man that was in Hell, There is a great Gulf fixed between us and you; where by Gulf he means nothing elſe but the Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement there is between the Good and the Wicked, which is ſo great, that the Saints are neither ſenſible, nor have any compaſſion for the Damned; now if ſo, neither can we ſuppoſe that they pray for them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt, He attributes to ſome of them, the Belief that it is unlawful to eat Fleſh, upon very ridiculous Grounds, but ſuch as have nothing common with the Doctrine of the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems to me to be evident from this Book of <hi>Alanus,</hi> 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That he owned there were ſeveral ſorts of Hereticks in the Country of the <hi>Albigenſes, Manichees,</hi> or <hi>Cathari,</hi> who rejected the principal Articles of the Chriſtian Religion. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of People who renounced all the chief Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> rejected afterwards. And ſince he quotes no Author in particular, it is obvious to judg, that he made but ſmall Diſtinction of the Nature of the ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which he pretends to refute, and which he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſigned to the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in general; which without doubt, ought not to be attributed but to ſome of them, and which poſſibly, and very probably too, was only taken up from the Mouths of the common People amongſt them, by thoſe who had a Deſign to expoſe them.</p>

Whoever reads the Writings of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, ſhall find that they have accuſed our Reformers of the ſame Hereſies which the Devil rais'd to put a ſtop to the progreſs of Chriſtianity. The Jeſuit <hi>Gauthier</hi> alone may be a ſufficient Witneſs hereof, in his Chronological Table; and we may well ſay that in this Point, he hath at leaſt equaliz'd the Impudence of <hi>Feuardentius,</hi> if he hath not out done him. Why ſhould any Man therefore think ſtrange, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Adorers, ſhould take the ſame courſe againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which ſhe practis'd in our days; and which ſhe hath not yet left, becauſe ſhe believ'd it would not fail of certain Succeſs? ſo prodigious is the Stupidity of the People of her Communion. And truly the Managers for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were no leſs diligent to employ theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Artifices againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> than againſt us. Here are ſome Inſtances of it, for it is impoſſible to relate all; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with ſome of the more general Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:50988:91"/>1. They accuſed them of Novelty, ſometimes ſuppoſing them to have been only known ſince the time of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> or of <hi>Henry</hi> his Diſciple, though the contrary be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Hiſtory of this Church, as we have ſet it down; and by the Publick Liturgy, which the Papiſts themſelves have publiſhed not long ſince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They accuſed them of being the Diſciples of <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> and from thence rais'd this Accuſation, that they were only a Company of Lay-men, without either Miniſtry, or right to adminiſter the Sacraments; whereas it is certain, that they had a lawful Miniſtry, and indeed a thouſand times more lawful than that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They accuſed them in general of being <hi>Manichees,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe formerly the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> who were a Branch of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> had had a Party in that Province, or near it, as <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> tells us, and of whom ſome were ſcattered through <hi>Languedock,</hi> after the year 1010, though indeed the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes</hi> diſputed againſt them, and ſolidly confuted them, as we are informed by <hi>William Puylaurens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They endeavour'd to make them own the Opinions and Crimes, that were proper to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> by producing falſe Witneſſes to convict them thereof. We have an illuſtrious Example of this, in the Hiſtory of the Earls of <hi>Tholouſe. William Catel,</hi> Counſellor for the King in the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> tells us, that two Hereticks, whereof the one was called <hi>Raymond,</hi> the other <hi>Bennet,</hi> having appear'd before the Pope's Legate, it was witneſs'd againſt them, that they had been heard to preach that there were two Gods, the one good, and the other evil; that Prieſts could not conſecrate the Holy Hoſt; that married Perſons could not be ſaved if they had to do with their Wives; that Baptiſm is not neceſſary to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and many other Hereſies, which they would never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, notwithſtanding all the Witneſſes that appear'd againſt them; but ſaid, they were falſe Witneſſes, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what the Catholick Religion engageth us to believe. But notwithſtanding theſe their ſolemn Proteſtations, they further object againſt them all the Conſequences of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:50988:91"/>
as natural Inferences from the former Opinions, of which they pretended that they had convicted them by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. This probably was the riſe of thoſe fine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies we find in <hi>Alanus Magnus,</hi> and other Polemical Writers who copied him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have been charged with forſwearing themſelves before a Court of Juſtice without ſcruple, though at the ſame time they are accuſed for maintaining that every Lie is a mortal Sin. This is done by <hi>Alanus,</hi> who falls upon them very heavily upon that account.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are accuſed of being <hi>Arians,</hi> though <hi>Alanus</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth them, and that the Popiſh Prieſts ought rather to be accuſed of favouring <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> and <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> than the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> who ſubtilly diſputed againſt theſe Hereſies.</p>
               <p>But it will be eaſy to refute theſe Calumnies, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of <hi>Montreal,</hi> in the year 1206, related by the Monk of <hi>Vaux Cernay.</hi> It was offer'd to the Biſhops by the <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> under certain Conditions, That there ſhould be Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors appointed on both ſides, Men of Authority, able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Tumult or Sedition: Alſo, that the Place where the Conference was to be, might be free and ſafe for all thoſe that ſhould aſſiſt at it: Moreover, that the Subjects to be diſputed upon, ſhould be agreed to by joint conſent, and not to be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till they were wholly diſcuſs'd; and that thoſe that could not maintain their Opinions by the Word of God, ſhould be look'd upon as overcome. The Biſhops and Monks accepted of all theſe Conditions. The Place they agreed upon, was <hi>Montreal</hi> near <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> in the year 1206; the Moderators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on on both ſides, were B. of <hi>Villeneufve,</hi> and B. of <hi>Auxerre</hi> for the Biſhops, and for the <hi>Albigenſes, R. de Bot,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Riviere; Arnoldus Hot</hi> the Paſtor of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> accompanied with thoſe that were thought fit for this Action, appear'd firſt at the Place and Time aſſigned; and afterwards came the Biſhop of <hi>Ozma,</hi> and the Monk <hi>Dominic</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with two of the Pope's Legats, <hi>Peter Caſtel,</hi> and <hi>Radulphus de Luſt,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Candets, P. Bertrand</hi> Prior of <hi>Anterive,</hi> as alſo the Prior of <hi>Palat,</hi> and ſeveral other Prieſts and Monks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:50988:92"/>The Theſes propounded by <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> were, That the Maſs and Tranſubſtantiation were the Invention of Men, and not the Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Spouſe of Chriſt, but the Church of Confuſion, drunk with the Blood of the Martyrs.</p>
               <p>That the Polity of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was neither good nor holy, nor eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſent theſe Propoſitions to the Biſhop, who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fortnight to prepare his Anſwer, which was granted. At the Day appointed the Biſhop fail'd not to appear with a large Writing; whereupon <hi>Arnaud Hot</hi> deſired leave to be heard upon the Spot, <hi>extempore,</hi> declaring that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the Particulars contained in the ſaid Writing, deſiring the Auditors not to be tired, if he took up ſome time in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſo long a Diſcourſe; they promiſed he ſhould be heard with Attention and Patience, without the leaſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. He diſcourſed at ſeveral Hours, for four days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſo much Admiration of the Aſſiſtants, and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity on his Part, that all the Biſhops, Abbots, Monks and Prieſts, could have been willing to have been farther off; for he deduced his Anſwer according to the ſeveral Points laid down in that Writing, with ſo much Order and Perſpicuity, that he made his Auditors perceive, that though the Biſhop had writ much, yet he had concluded nothing that could be made uſe of, to the Advantage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Arnaud</hi> demanded, that ſince the Biſhops and he ſtood ingaged to one another at the beginning of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to prove their Aſſertions by the Word of God alone, the Biſhops and Prieſts might be commanded to prove the Authority of the Maſs, as it was ſung in Churches, piece by piece, that it was inſtituted by the Son of God, and ſung in the ſame manner by his Apoſtles, beginng at the <hi>Introit,</hi> as they call it, to the <hi>Ite miſſa eſt:</hi> but the Biſhops could not prove that any of thoſe Parts had been inſtituted for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Chriſt or by his Apoſtles. Here it was that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were covered with Shame and Regret, for <hi>Arnaud</hi> had
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50988:92"/>
reduced them to the ſingle Canon, which they pretended was the beſt Piece of the Maſs; where he proved that the Holy Supper of the Lord was not the Maſs, ſaying, that if the Maſs were the Lord's Supper, there would be all after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, that there was before in the Lord's Supper: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſaid he, in your Maſs there is no Bread, for by Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation the Bread vaniſheth; wherefore the Maſs being without Bread, cannot be the Supper of the Lord, wherein all know there is Bread. Jeſus Chriſt brake Bread, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> brake Bread, the Prieſt breaks the Body, not Bread, therefore the Prieſt neither doth what Jeſus Chriſt, nor what St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. As <hi>Arnaud</hi> was about to proceed in theſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes, between the Lord's Supper and the Maſs, to prove that it was neither of Chriſt's nor of the Apoſtles Inſtitution, the Monks, Biſhops, Legats and Prieſts thought fit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves, being reſolved to hear no more, for fear they might fix Impreſſions on thoſe that were by, which might extreamly ſhake their Belief of the Maſs.</p>
               <p>The Monk of <hi>Vaux Cernay</hi> indeavoured to render this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpected, in ſaying, that when theſe heretical Judges per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Weakneſs of their Cauſe, and the Misfortune of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in ſuch a Diſpute, they refuſed to pronounce any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it, as likewiſe to reſtore us our own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, for fear, adds he, they might come to be publiſhed, but reſtored the Hereticks theirs. But how could two of the Pope's Legats, and ſo many Biſhops, Abbots, Monks and Prieſts ſuffer themſelves to be drawn into a Place, there to be thus abuſed and trick'd? The Monk himſelf ſaith in the ſame place, that the Heads of the Hereticks came to meet with the Catholicks at the Caſtle of <hi>Montreal,</hi> to diſpute with them: the Catholicks therefore were in Poſſeſſion of the Caſtle; there could be therefore no Opportunity of foul Play, nor of any ſuch Violence; neither was it neceſſary, that the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators ſhould pronounce their Judgment in a Caſe of Diſpute, ſeeing they hold that no other Judgment is neceſſary, but that of the Pope, who cannot err. Beſides, how could this Monk know that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were overcome, ſeeing that no Sentence was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50988:93"/>
                  <hi>Perrin</hi> could have given us a faithful Extract of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, becauſe himſelf obſerves, that it had been brought to him from the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Rafur,</hi> Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Montreal,</hi> in an old Manuſcript: From whence, though he doth not expreſs it in ſo many Words, I judg that he reduced the Points in Queſtion between the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſix Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Article. The Doctrines which they aſſerted in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Holy Church, nor the Spouſe of Chriſt, but that it was a Church which had drunk in the Doctrine of Devils; the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the Mother of Fornications and Abominations, covered with the Blood of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the Maſs was neither inſtituted by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, but a humane Invention.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Prayers of the Living are unprofitable for the Dead.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That the Purgatory maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no better than a human Invention, to ſatisfy the Avarice of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That the Saints ought not to be prayed unto.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That Tranſubſtantiation is a human Invention, and erroneous Doctrine; and that the worſhipping of the Bread is manifeſt Idolatry.</p>
               <p>That therefore it was neceſſary to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which the contrary was ſaid and taught, becauſe one cannot aſſiſt at the Maſs, without partaking of the Idolatry there practiſed, nor expect Salvation by any other means than by Jeſus Chriſt, nor transfer to Creatures the Honour which is due to the Creator; nor ſay concerning the Bread that it is God, and worſhip it as ſuch, without incurring the Pain of eternal Damnation, becauſe Idolaters ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. For all theſe things therefore which they aſſerted, they have been hated and perſecuted to Death.</p>
               <p>This Account of the Conference of <hi>Montreal,</hi> which I have copied from <hi>Perrin,</hi> is enough in my Judgment fully to refute any Scruple that might remain in the Mind of a Reader,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50988:93"/>
who reads in <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> the Letters of <hi>Peter</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Chryſogon,</hi> writ in the Year 1178, which teſtify, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> had been convicted by the Confeſſion which many of them had made of the greateſt part of the Articles of that Hereſy. It is very viſible that it was upon the Authority of theſe Letters, or upon ſome Informations of this Nature, that <hi>Alanus,</hi> who was born at <hi>Liſle</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and who had ſpent the greateſt part of his time at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> has built his Catalogue of the Hereſies which he refutes in his Treatiſe againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whereof I have given an Extract in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>So that it is neceſſary to ſuppoſe one of theſe three things, Either that the Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and thoſe whom he protected, were really <hi>Manichees,</hi> as they are accuſed to be by the Pope's Legats, by the Biſhops, and by <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Vaux Cernay,</hi> who ſets down this Accuſation and the forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who own themſelves to be <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi>; or that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> who were the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruys,</hi> and of <hi>Henry,</hi> that were no <hi>Manichees,</hi> had gone over to that Sect towards the End of the 12<hi>th</hi> Century, and afterwards again become <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> and <hi>Henricians</hi> at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 13<hi>th,</hi> as it plainly appears they then were, from the Conference of <hi>Montreal,</hi> where they freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Opinions, intirely oppoſite to <hi>Manicheiſm</hi>; or that the Legats and Monks that perſecuted them with Fire and Sword, were great Impoſtors, in taking Advantage againſt them from ſome Confeſſions extorted from <hi>Manichees,</hi> who were here and there ſcattered in thoſe Dioceſſes, and which they made uſe of to animate the People of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to ingage the Princes and Biſhops of all places to exterminate without Mercy a ſort of People, who utterly ſubverted all the Rules of Morality, which is the Band of Society, and all the Principles of both natural and Chriſtian Religion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Reflections on the Convictions of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> which were ſaid to be proved upon the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ONE of the moſt plauſible Objections that can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Purity of the Faith of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> is the Teſtimony of the Inquiſitors, who have filled their Trials with plain Confeſſions which ſeveral <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them, have made of ſundry Errors of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees.</hi> I ſhall produce an Extract of the Acts of the Inquiſition of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> which are in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Wetſtein</hi> Bookſeller at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as it was ſent me out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and which was made by a Man of great Reputation.
<q>The <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> ſaith he, held ſome Opinions, in common with the <hi>Vaudois</hi>; as, That to a Chriſtian all Oaths are unlawful; that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins, made to the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is wholly unprofitable; and that neither the Pope, nor any one elſe in the Romiſh Church, can abſolve any Man of Sin: but that they have power to abſolve all thoſe from their Sins, who will join themſelves to their Sect, by the Laying on of Hands. This laſt Clauſe is alſo laid to the charge of the <hi>Vaudois; viz.</hi> That they have Power from God alone, as the Apoſtles had, to hear Confeſſions both of Men and Women that believe them; and of impoſing Penance upon ſuch as confeſs to them, as Faſting, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, whereupon they abſolve their Penitents: and that this Abſolution and Penance is as available to the Salvation of their Souls, as if they had been confeſſed to their own Prieſt. (That here is ſome wreſting or mutilation of the Opinion of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> is manifeſt from the Confeſſion of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, as we read, declared her Faith to this purpoſe; That God alone forgives Sin, and that he to whom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins is made, gives only his Advice what the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50988:94"/>
Perſon ought to do, and ſo enjoins Penance, which any wiſe and prudent Man may do, whether he be a Prieſt or no.) That the Opinions of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> that were proper to them were, that there be two Lords, the one Good and the other Evil: That the Body of Chriſt is not in the Euchariſt, but only meer Bread: That Baptiſm is of no uſe. One of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> was ſaid to believe, that the Baptiſm of Water celebrated by the Church, ſtands In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in no ſtead, becauſe they did not conſent to the Sacrament, but cried at the receiving of it. (<hi>I believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who examined theſe Acts,</hi> that they denied Baptiſm to be the Inſtrument of Regeneration; or perhaps they might be againſt Infant-Baptiſm.) That an external A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of the Sick, with material Oil, was of no uſe. That the Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had no Power of binding and looſing, ſince they themſelves, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them, were great Sinners. That Marriage is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways join'd with Sin, and never can be without Sin, and that it could never have been inſtituted by the good God. That our Lord did not aſſume a real humane Body, and true Fleſh of our Nature, and that he did not truly, but only in Likeneſs, riſe again in the ſame, and perform the other Works of our Salvation; and that he never really aſcended to the right-hand of the Father. They deny the Reſurrection of the Body; (but in the Declaration of <hi>Petrus Anterius,</hi> a chief Teacher amongſt them; this is more clearly and diſtinctly explained; that they feign that certain ſpiritual Bodies, and a certain internal Man, ſhould riſe again in ſuch ſort of Bodies. And elſewhere, they expreſs themſelves, that though the Souls of Men ſhall come to Judgment, yet they ſhall not come in their own Bodies). They ſaid, that the Souls of Men were Spirits, which fell from Heaven for their Sins; ſo that they ſeem to have believ'd the pre-exiſtence of Souls. Man (they ſay) muſt not worſhip what he eats. Moreover, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them, that they believe Man is ſaved, by the Laying on of Hands, which they confer on their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50988:95"/>
and that by the ſame means, all Sins are forgiven without Confeſſion and Satisfaction. That they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the Holy Ghoſt for Salvation, upon thoſe whom they receive. That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> never was a carnal Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but their Church, which they ſay is true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that this is the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> (The very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of theſe Words, ſhews that this Opinion is wreſted; becauſe it is better expreſt in another place thus, That God never entred the Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and that he only is the Mother, Brother, and Siſter of God, who keeps the Commandments of God the Father.) Theſe are ſaid to be the Doctrines of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none are aſcribed to the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> but others different from theſe, whereof we find no mention made in the Opinions of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>; and they are theſe; That all Judgment is forbid by God, and that it is contrary to the divine Prohibition, for any Judg, in any Cauſe whatſoever, to judg or ſentence any Man to Puniſhment or Death. That Indulgencies granted by the Prelats of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are of no uſe or efficacy. That there is no Purgatory for Souls after this Life; and that conſequently the Prayers and Suffrages of Believers for the Dead, are of no uſe to them. That the Soul when it departs from the Body, goes either to Paradiſe or Hell. That there are no more than three Orders in the Church, of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe Acts, it appears how much the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> differed from thoſe practis'd by the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
                  <q>Beſides, <hi>ſaith the Author of the Extract,</hi> the Rites and Inſtitutions of them both were very different. Of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> there were two Sorts, ſome who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their Faith and Rites, and they were called <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>comforted:</hi> others who had entred into a Covenant with the former Sort, called <hi>Perfect,</hi> which they call <hi>la Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenza,</hi> the Agreement, that at the end of their Life, they ſhould be received by them into their Sect. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is frequently called by them Exerciſe, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50988:95"/>
in this manner; <hi>The</hi> Benedicite <hi>or the</hi> Bleſſing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon one</hi> Molinerius <hi>when he was ſick. Bernard Goes</hi> one of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> held the Hands of the ſick Perſon between his own Hands; and beſides, held a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Book over him, wherein he read the Goſpel of St. <hi>John, In the Beginning was the Word</hi>; and deliver'd to the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a fine Thread to tie about him as a Mark that he was admitted into their Hereſy: upon ſome others it is ſaid, that they laid a white Linen Cloath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that many Genuflections were performed by the Bed-ſide. This Reception was ſuppoſed to ſave the Soul of him who was received, and was call'd a Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm or Conſolation, a Reception, and a good End, and ſometimes a Melioration, by means of which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that the Perſon was ſanctified; ſo that it was not lawful for a Woman to touch any one that was thus received. Now, becauſe it might ſometime happen that the Perſon thus received, after his recovery, might relapſe into his former Defilements, therefore they always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd this Reception till the extreameſt Weakneſs, when there was no longer hopes of Life, for fear they might afterward loſe the Good they had received. For which reaſon alſo ſome ſick Perſons amongſt them, though the Perſon who thus initiated them was already come, yet were not received, becauſe they were not believed to be at the point of Death. But they who were thus received in their Sickneſs, were commanded to put themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hardſhip, that is, to haſten their own Death, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from all Meat: and there are ſeveral Examples of thoſe, who are ſaid to have kill'd themſelves, not only with Faſting, but by opening of a Vein, wounding of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea and ſometimes too, by drinking Poiſon. But others who had no mind to ſubmit themſelves to ſo hard a Law, refuſed to be received, though this their Teacher was come for that purpoſe. They had alſo a peculiar Way of ſaluting, by way of embracing one another, laying their Hands on each ſide of one another, and turning their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50988:96"/>
Head to both Shoulders, ſaying each time <hi>Benedicite:</hi> which kind of Salutation ſeems to have been uſual amongſt them, becauſe it is to be met with in ſeveral Accounts of their Opinions; and ſometimes it was perform'd with bended Knees, ſometimes with their Hands let down to the Ground. Which Salutation was ſometimes call'd <hi>Melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Neither did they only require this Salutation from thoſe who were received, but from them alſo who were called <hi>Perfect</hi> amongſt them, and received others, obſerved the ſame way of Salutation. We read alſo in many of their Books, that ſuch a one did <hi>eat of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Bread of the Hereticks</hi>; and in ſome it is added, <hi>And ſaw the Manner of bleſſing it</hi>; but what that Manner was, is no where deſcribed, neither is any Circumſtance added, from whence it might be gathered, whether they bleſs'd the common Bread at their Dinners and Suppers, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was only a Ceremony uſed by them at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating of the Lord's Supper. Though it is added in one place, that they call this bleſſed Bread, the Bread of Prayer. Three days in the Week they keep a Faſt with Bread and Water. But we do not read that any of theſe things were obſerved by the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> but what was vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different, as, That they had ſome Elders of their own: That even Lay-men bleſs the Table before and after Meat; they pray kneeling, and bowing themſelves to the Ground. It is uſual for them to bleſs the Table. They profeſs to obſerve Apoſtolical Poverty. And beſides, they are ſaid to differ from the common Converſation of other Believers in their Life and Manners. Theſe are the chief things we meet with in this Book concerning the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi>; for there is no mention made of the Opinions of any other Party.</q>
This is the Extract which was ſent me, with ſome Paſſages, wherein the Author gives his own Judgment.</p>
               <p>One would think, that nothing could be of greater force to convict the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> eſpecially if we conſider, that <hi>Emericus</hi> in his Directory for the Inquiſitors,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50988:96"/>
aſcribes almoſt the very ſame Opinions to the <hi>Manichees</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But I have three Things to ſay, to take off this Prejudice; the firſt is, That nothing ought to be more ſuſpected by us than theſe Acts of the Inquiſition; for he that is a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, is certainly a Liar and a Knave. I have ſhewed in my <hi>Remarks upon the Hiſtory of the Valleys of</hi> Piedmont, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be conceived more falſe than the Carriage of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, and that they never pretended to any thing leſs than to Faithfulneſs in their Accounts of things.</p>
               <p>This appears from the Trials of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> whom the Monks have indeavoured to make the moſt infamous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and yet in the mean time, if we will believe the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> they were very far from being <hi>Manichees.</hi> What Authority therefore can the Teſtimonies of the Inquiſitors have againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> ſince the Biſhop himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that they can be of no Authority againſt the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who have been no leſs accuſed of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> than the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> themſelves?</p>
               <p>Now that the Reader may be throughly convinced of the Juſtice of this our denying to admit theſe Teſtimonies of the Inquiſitors, and <hi>Emericus</hi> in particular, I might alledg here what <hi>Emericus</hi> hath ſaid of the <hi>Eternal Goſpel,</hi> attributed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Crema,</hi> the ſeventh General of the <hi>Cordeliers.</hi>

                  <q>In the Year of our Lord 1283, the 8<hi>th</hi> of the Ides of <hi>July, William</hi> of <hi>Maunhaco,</hi> formerly the Son of <hi>William Arloyer</hi> of <hi>Maunhaco,</hi> of the Dioceſs of <hi>Anecy,</hi> being brought out of the Priſon of the Inquiſitors, and ſet in the Preſence of Brother <hi>John Vigoroſus,</hi> of the Order of Preachers, an Inquiſitor of heretical Pravity, being demanded by the ſaid Inquiſitor to ſwear by the Holy Goſpels, that he would declare the Truth concerning his Faith: he anſwered, that he would not ſwear. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether it were lawful for him to ſwear upon the Holy Goſpels? he anſwered, No. Being demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord <hi>Martin,</hi> the preſent Pope of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath the Power of binding and looſing: he anſwered, No. Being demanded, whether the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> over which the Pope preſides, be the Head of the Faith? he anſwered, That neither the Pope, nor the Church he preſides over, is Head of the Faith, or of the Chriſtian World: neither doth he own or believe that any carnal Man can be Pope, but only Jeſus Chriſt. Being demanded, whether Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Prelates of Churches, ordained by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were true Prelates, and whether they have the Power of binding and looſing? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No. Being demanded, whether if any one be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the Baptizer ſaying, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen</hi>; whether this be of Efficacy to the Party baptized; and whether by ſuch Baptiſm he can obtain Remiſſion of his Sins? he anſwered, That he did not believe that any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man can baptize, but God alone. Being demanded, whether the Sacrament of Confirmation, which the Biſhop confers, be of any Uſe to the Perſon confirmed? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50988:98"/>
That it was of no Uſe at all; neither is it a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither is he who confers it a Biſhop, nor hath the Power to do any thing. Being demanded, whether the Sacrament of extream Unction, be of any Uſe to the Sick, when it is adminiſtred to him by a Prieſt? he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he did not believe that it did him any good, or that it is a Sacrament. Being demanded, whether the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Orders conferred by the Biſhop, were of any Uſe, and whether it be a Sacrament? he anſwered, That it is of no Uſe; neither is it a Sacrament; neither can a Biſhop confer any Sacrament. Being demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bread which the Prieſt holds in his Hands, whilſt he celebrates, after he hath pronounced the Words of Conſecration, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſtill remains Bread? he anſwered, That it was Bread before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Bread ſtill, and that it was a great Injury to God, to ſay that the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt. Being examined, whether the Words of a Prieſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he abſolves one that hath confeſſed his Sins, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I abſolve thee of all thy Sins,</hi> be of any Uſe to the Party confeſſed? he anſwered, That they were of no Uſe, neither is it a Sacrament. Being examined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawful to ſwear upon the Holy Goſpels of God, in any Caſe? he anſwered, No. Being examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the King of <hi>France</hi> that now is, by burning, or cauſing any one to be burnt for the Crime of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or by hanging any other Criminal, doth Sin? he anſwered, He doth; and that it is not lawful for him to execute Vengeance, or do Juſtice. Alſo being examined, whether he was willing to believe the Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we believe, and as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preaches and obſerves? he anſwered, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing but what he had ſaid before. Theſe things he depoſed at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> before Brother <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the foreſaid Brother <hi>John Vigoroſus</hi> the Inquiſitor; in the Preſence of the Witneſſes Brother <hi>Arnold Del Gras,</hi> Brother <hi>Bertrand James,</hi> and Brother <hi>Raymond Navarr,</hi> of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50988:98"/>
the Order of Friars Preachers; and of <hi>Julian Vaſcon,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notary of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who wrote this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Letter which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> writ to my Friend, concluded with theſe Words.
<q>I muſt not forget to tell you, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Copy, the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> ſaid of themſelves, that they were <hi>de illis qui non reddebant malum pro malo, of thoſe who did not render Evil for Evil</hi>; that <hi>boni homines, good Men</hi> were their Miniſters. The Formality they obſerved when they made a Proſelyte, was this, <hi>Haereticaverunt eum ponentes librum &amp; manus ſuper caput ejus, &amp; interrogantes eum ſi volebat ſe reddere Deo &amp; Evangelio. They made him a Heretick by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Book, and their Hands upon his Head, and asking him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were willing to ſurrender himſelf to God and the Goſpel?</hi> I have obſerved from ſeveral Paſſages, that on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they were uſed to read more particularly the Goſpel according to St. <hi>John,</hi> and that after theſe Solemnities the Proſelytes <hi>adorabant dictos bonos homines, flexis ter genibus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo, Benedicite; Haereticis reſpondentibus, Deus vos benedicat</hi>; Paid their Reverence to theſe good Men, by thrice bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Knee, ſaying, <hi>Give us your Bleſſing</hi>: the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks anſwering, <hi>God bleſs you.</hi> The Inquiſitors call the Proſelytes and thoſe that are born <hi>Albigenſes, Hereticks.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſy to judg by this Specimen, that it is almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give any Credit to the Depoſition of Inquiſitors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Matters, which they ſay, they have made the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> confeſs; and that therefore this pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> by the Regiſters of the Inquiſitors, is abſolutely null.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I am to repreſent to the Reader, is, that the Teſtimony of the Inquiſitors cannot be ſet againſt the contrary Confeſſions of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which thoſe who have read, find very conformable to the Faith of the Proteſtants. This is that which <hi>Paradin</hi> affirms in his Annals of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where he confeſſes that he has read ſome Hiſtories, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> with their Princes and Lords, of all thoſe Crimes which many have caſt upon them, affirming them to be wholly innocent, as having never done any thing elſe, but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50988:99"/>
reprove the Vices and Abuſes of the Prelats of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is alſo acknowledged by <hi>James de Ribera,</hi> in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections concerning the City of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Catal. Teſtium veritat. pag. 446.</note>
                  <q>In theſe times there were frequent Diſputes held with the Hereticks ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times at <hi>Viride Folium,</hi> and at <hi>Pamiers</hi>; but the famous Diſputation was at <hi>Montreal,</hi> where two Noble-men were choſen Arbitrators, <hi>Bernardus de Villa nova,</hi> and <hi>Bernardus Arrenſis</hi>; and two of the Commons, <hi>Raimond Godius,</hi> and <hi>Arnoldus Ribera</hi>; but they who were accounted Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, could not agree about any thing; the Names of the chiefeſt of them were theſe, <hi>Ponticus Jordanus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus Auriſanus, Arnoldus Othonus, Philibertus Caſlienſis, Benedictus Thermus.</hi> They all conſtantly affirmed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Holy Church, nor the Spouſe of Chriſt, but a Church that had imbibed the Doctrine of Devils; that ſhe was that <hi>Babylon</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes in the Revelation, the Mother of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Abominations, cover'd over with the Blood of the Saints: That what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approved of, was not approved by the Lord: That the Maſs was neither inſtituted by Chriſt, nor by his Apoſtles, but was meerly a human Invention.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame hath been owned by <hi>Carolus Molineus</hi> the Glory of the Bar of <hi>France,</hi> who declares that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> taught this very thing expreſly, in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XII, which was afterwards taught by thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France.</hi> This Teſtimony is alledged by <hi>Camerarius</hi> in his Hiſtorical Account of the Brethren of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> This obliged <hi>Vignier,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtorical Library,</hi> to contemn all the Calumnies caſt upon the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> In his Account of the year 1206, he relates, that a <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> a Man of Reputation, aſſured him, that he had read one of their Confeſſions in the old <hi>Gaſcon</hi> Language, which was preached before the late Chancellor <hi>de l' Hoſpital,</hi> a little before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Troubles of <hi>France,</hi> which had not one word of theſe Opinions, but only thoſe Articles, which we formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50988:99"/>
to the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> Amongſt which they expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they received the Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, and that they rejected every Doctrine that was not grounded upon, or authorized by them, or was contrary to any one Point of Doctrine that may be found there. According to which Maxim, they confeſſed that they rejected and condemned all the Ceremonies, Traditions, and Ordinances of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they declared to be a Den of Thieves, and the Whore that is ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Upon which account alſo, the Colloquies, Diſputes, and Conferences, which the Legats of the Pope, and their Commiſſioners, had together, were only upon theſe Points, as we ſhall prove by the Teſtimony of <hi>James de Ribera,</hi> in his Book entituled,<note place="margin">Collectanea Tholoſae.</note> 
                  <hi>His Collections about the City of Tholouſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Thing that we are to obſerve, is, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Faith between the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> has made many People take them for the very ſame.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe there is no Reader that is ever ſo little juſt, but will allow me to make a very great difference between the Accounts of the Inquiſitors, and the Truth. The Inquiſitors make the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> guilty of the Errors of the <hi>Cathari</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> as if they had been all one, and that they had exactly anſwered the Deſcription which is given us of them in the Directory of the Inquiſitors, by <hi>Emericus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Par. 2. p. 13.</note> But we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways of knowing, from their own Confeſſions of Faith, that they were not at all polluted by <hi>Manicheiſm</hi>; and the moſt part of thoſe Authors, that have writ with any degree of Honeſty, call them <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> becauſe they held the ſame Faith and Opinions.</p>
               <p>The ſame Authors acknowledg, that it was againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> preached in <hi>Languedock</hi>; and that it is with them, whom they promiſcuouſly call <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> that thoſe Conferences were held, which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> owns to have been held with the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>James de Ribera</hi> Counſellor of State, in his <hi>Collections concerning the City of</hi> Tholouſe, that are ſet down

Cardinal <hi>Hoſius</hi> alſo had the fame Notion of them, in his Book concerning the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Henricians</hi> and <hi>Petrobuſians.</hi> This was the Opinion of <hi>Andrew Favin</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Navarre,</hi> where he ſaith, that the Hereſy of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> is otherwiſe termed the Hereſy of the <hi>Waldenſes.

               <p>AS one Day gives Light to another, ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath at laſt diſcover'd that the Accuſation charged upon the Pope by the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as being the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, was a Character of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> He thought fit to reveal this great Secret to the World, in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations,</hi> and afterwards he makes it an expreſs Character of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> in his Explication of the Revelation.

                  <note place="margin">Hiſtoria de or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, progreſſu, &amp; occaſu Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeorum. Bibl. Patr. Edit. Lugd. Tom. 16.</note> whoſe Opinions he ſets down?</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors which ſpeak of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the 9<hi>th</hi> Century, and all the <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, without ſo much as excepting one only, know of no ſuch thing; who could therefore diſcover this Character of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm</hi> to the Biſhop?</p>
               <p>We muſt conclude that the Biſhop, who hath made a Diſcovery which none of the Antients, no nor Modern Writers neither, whether Papiſts or Proteſtants, have been able to make, muſt have had it from the Revelation of ſome Angel, <hi>albus an ater neſcio</hi>; ſince he ſpeaks ſo very poſitively of this new Character of the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſaith he, the caſe is plain, the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> and they called the Pope the Antichriſt, and with an invincible Obſtinacy have maintain'd that this Title belongs to him; wherefore it muſt follow, that this Accuſation of the Pope muſt be a Character of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Biſhop had reflected never ſo little upon what he here aſſerts, this ſingle Character of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Pope of being the Antichriſt, would have made him draw a quite contrary Conſequence, that is to ſay, that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> could not be <hi>Manichees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> never taught any ſuch thing; this Hereſy which ſprung up in the Eaſt, never attack'd the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, but the whole Body of Chriſtians, who received the Books of the Old Teſtament, and who owned the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be the Creator of the World.</p>
               <p>But whence comes it then, may ſome ſay, that the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> have peculiarly affected to call the Pope Antichriſt? which certainly muſt be look'd upon a Character of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes,</hi> unleſs we ſhould find it to be a Character of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> pretends.</p>
               <p>The queſtion would not have been ſo difficult to reſolve, had not the Biſhop affected to appear ignorant in a Queſtion which he ought to have enquired into, ſince he hath undertaken to handle it in a Commentary on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50988:104"/>In a word, <hi>France,</hi> which firſt beſtowed upon the Popes the temporal Dominions they now enjoy, long ſince owned the Pope to be the Antichriſt. For <hi>Gregory</hi> I, having declared in twelve ſeveral Letters written againſt the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> who aſſumed the Title of Univerſal Biſhop, that whoever claimed that Title for himſelf, was either the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, or the Forerunner of him: It was not long after, that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> III, perſuaded <hi>Phocas</hi> to give him the Title of Univerſal, which all his Succeſſors took up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with joy, and affected to uſe it: For which reaſon the <hi>French,</hi> fearing leſt they ſhould fail of the reſpect which they had for St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> if they ſhould accuſe themſelves of having ſo often made uſe of a falſe Way of reaſoning, at laſt called the Pope Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>They were not therefore <hi>Manichees</hi> that were come from the Eaſt, in the 11<hi>th</hi> Century, to ſettle themſelves in the Weſt, who firſt ſet on foot this Accuſation: but they were the <hi>French,</hi> who in a full Council at <hi>Rheims,</hi> after the 10<hi>th</hi> Century, called the Pope Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seguinus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> having maintained that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> could not be depoſed without the conſent of the Pope; <hi>Arnulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had the greateſt Reputation of any Man of his Time, ſolidly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Canons and Cuſtoms of the Church, that the Pope's Sentence was not to be waited for in that Caſe; <hi>Ab eo reſponſa petere, marmora conſulere eſt</hi>; <q>To deſire an Anſwer from him, is to conſult the Stones;</q> ſpeaking to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Council. He further ſaith,
<q>Who do you think that Man is, who ſits in his high Chair? he is, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers he, the Antichriſt, who ſits in the Temple of God, and ſhews himſelf as God.</q>
And the reſt of his Diſcourſe is a ſufficient Evidence, that he took the Pope to be the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and that he acknowledged that the Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was then coming in upon the Church. It was <hi>Gerbertus,</hi> afterwards Pope, that digeſted the Acts of that Council, and who in an Epiſtle to <hi>Seguinus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in his time they were not much concerned for the Pope's Excommunications, and that it was not pretended
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50988:105"/>
that he was the Center of Chriſtian Communion. <hi>Non eſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> (ſays he) <hi>danda occaſio noſtris aemulis, ne Sacerdotium quod ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que unum eſt, ſicut Eccleſia una eſt, ita uni ſubjici videatur, ut eo pecuniâ, gratiâ, metu, vel ignorantiâ corrupto, nemo ſacerdos eſſe poſſit, niſi quem hae virtutes commendaverint:</hi>
                  <q>We ought not therefore to give an Opportunity to our Rivals, leſt the Prieſthood, which is every-where one and the ſame, as the Church is one, ſhould come to be ſo ſubjected to one, as that he being corrupted with Money, Favour, Fear, or Ignorance, no Man ſhould be able to obtain that Order, except he had theſe Vertues to recommend him.</q>
Here we ſee the true Stile of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> before ever any <hi>Manichee</hi> was come from the Eaſt into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after this was once ſet on foot, it was maintained from Century to Century, by thoſe who were brought up, and that died in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It would be an eaſy matter to give a Catalogue of thoſe who have ſpoke at this rate, to ſhow what heed there is to be given to the moſt poſitive Aſſertions of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in the leaſt deſired to undeceive himſelf, he need only read what <hi>Aventinus</hi> ſays in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, who there is termed Antichriſt, by Perſons who were very far from being <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees:</hi> he need only read in the Acts of the Life of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> II, what the Biſhop of <hi>Florence</hi> openly preached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter;<note place="margin">Cent. 12. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg.</hi>
                  </note> or to read in the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> I, written by <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> what Abbot <hi>Joachim</hi> maintained before <hi>Richard</hi> I, without being ever accuſed of <hi>Manicheiſm</hi>; or he may take notice in <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> upon the year 1253, what Notions <hi>Robert Groſthead</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> one of the greateſt Biſhops of his time, maintained: or he may peruſe the Revelations of St. <hi>Brigit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 41.</note> and the 16<hi>th</hi> Epiſtle of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi> in his ſecond Tome. And yet never were any of theſe Perſons accus'd of <hi>Manicheiſm.</hi> But this has been treated of at large already by <hi>Wolfius</hi> in his <hi>Various Lections</hi>; and beſides, this would lead us too far from the Subject we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:50988:105"/>I ſhall content my ſelf therefore with obſerving three things concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>The 1<hi>ſt</hi> is, That nothing was more common with the Popes and Anti-Popes, than mutually to brand each other with the Title of Antichriſt: And the Writers of both Parties kept always cloſe to this Stile, and yet all of them lived and died in the Boſom of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and never were thought to be the Diſciples of the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That there are many Authors, and even ſeveral of thoſe that have been canonized, who have made uſe of the ſame Notions, in ſpeaking and writing of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet none have ever condemned them of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 3<hi>d</hi> is, That ever ſince the Reformation, though the Biſhop pretends that the Prophecy concerning the Beaſt hath been already fulfilled; there is ſcarcely (if you except the Biſhop) any one Popiſh Author, who doth not own that <hi>Rome</hi> is to be the Seat of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>What I ſay now, deſerves to be conſidered, becauſe in the Year 1516, <hi>December</hi> the 19<hi>th,</hi> in the 11<hi>th</hi> Seſſion of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> Council, under <hi>Leo</hi> X, in whoſe time <hi>Luther</hi> began to preach, we find that there was a Prohibition againſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Queſtion of Antichriſt in the Pulpit, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pretence of advancing ſome new Revelation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, without having obtained leave from the Holy See, or from the Biſhop. The Words of the Canon which oblige all thoſe who ſhould ever undertake to preach on this Subject, are theſe:
<q>And we command all who bear this Charge, or who ſhall bear it for the future, that they preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Evangelical Truth, and the Holy Scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Expoſition and Interpretation of thoſe Doctors, whom the Church or long Tradition has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and has hitherto allowed to be read, or which ſhall be ſo for time to come, without adding any thing that is contrary to, or diſagreeing from the proper ſenſe of them, but that they always inſiſt upon ſuch Matters as do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with the Words of the Scripture, nor with the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the foreſaid Doctors. Neither let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50988:106"/>
to fix in their Sermons any certain time of the Evils to come, of the coming of Antichriſt, or of the Day of Judgment; foraſmuch as Truth aſſures us, that it is not for us to know the Times and Seaſons. Moreover, if the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to reveal to any of them in the Church of God, future things by ſome Inſpiration, as he hath promiſed by the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi>; and ſeeing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying,</hi> &amp;c. we will not have ſuch as theſe reckoned amongſt Impoſtors and Liars, or that they ſhall be any ways hindred: But becauſe it is a matter of great Moment, and that we are not upon light Grounds to believe every Spirit, but are to try them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God; we command that by a conſtant Law any ſuch aſſerted Inſpirations, before they be publiſhed or preached to the People, be henceforward underſtood to be reſerved to the Examination of the Apoſtolical See: but in Caſe this cannot be done without the Danger of too long a Delay, or that urgent Neceſſity ſhould otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade; then obſerving the ſame Order, it may be ſignified to the Ordinary of the place, who taking along with him three or four learned and grave Men, and diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the matter with them, if they ſee it expedient (which we charge upon their Conſciences) they may grant them Liberty: but whoſoever preſumes to commit any thing contrary to the Premiſes, ſhall incur Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the which he ſhall not be abſolved but by the Pope himſelf; that ſo by their Example others may be deterred from preſuming to do any ſuch thing, for which Reaſon we decree that they be for ever made incapable of the Office of Preaching, any Priviledges whatſoever to the contrary notwithſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not our Buſineſs to examine the Queſtion, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath exactly followed the Rules that this Canon preſcribes, in his Explication of the Scripture, and eſpecially about the matter of Antichriſt, though they be Rules by which Biſhops are no leſs bound, than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Divines. It may be the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> finds the Biſhop's new Syſtem ſo much for her Intereſt, that it inclines her to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50988:106"/>
ſuſpend the Severity of her Canons, in Favour of a Perſon, who has ſo dexterouſly pluck'd a Thorn out of her Foot, which hath troubled her ſo long, and which hath always cauſed new Pains to her, as oft as any of her Doctors have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to pluck it out.</p>
               <p>But I fear I have inſiſted too long upon ſo vain a Conjecture, and which ſcarce deſerved to be confuted. There are able Men of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have taken the Pains to refute the Conjecture of ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> who would needs have <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be the Antichriſt: This was the <hi>Chimaera</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> a Monk famous for his Impoſtures; this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the Whimſy of <hi>Fevardentius</hi> and ſome others, whom <hi>Pererius</hi> the Jeſuit hath refuted ſo ſolidly, as that he has put the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> to the trouble of inventing a new Syſtem to oppoſe the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> I hope his Syſtem will meet with the ſame Deſtiny amongſt his own Party, that ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants may not be put to the trouble of giving it a formal Confutation. For indeed, though the Politicks of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do bear with ſeveral Opinions that differ from the common Hypotheſes of their Society, yet the Divines of that Party are not patient enough to diſſemble the Diſlike they have to ſee their old Opinions which have been maintained for ſeveral Ages, trod under-foot. The Biſhop himſelf has an Example hereof, which he cannot well have forgot in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Cardinal <hi>Capizucchi,</hi> who having given his Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Expoſition of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, made by the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in which he ſweetens the Worſhip of Images ſo very much, for Fear of incenſing the Proteſtants, whom he deſigned to bring over to his own Side, was not wanting ſome Years after to publiſh a Treatiſe, wherein he ſhews that he gave that Approbation, only upon the Account of Reaſon of State, and not becauſe he ſincerely approved the way which the Biſhop had taken to make the Worſhip of Images appear more tolerable to the Proteſtant Party.</p>

               <p>HAving thus juſtified the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as to their Doctrine and Worſhip, it is time now to proceed to ſhew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their Diſcipline, by repreſenting the Nature of their Church-Government, and Conduct of thoſe Churches in matters that related to their Manners. This will not be a matter of any Difficulty; for it is eaſily conceived that theſe Dioceſſes being ſtored with People, who maintained the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> as the Abbot of <hi>Tron</hi> tells us, they had a great Party of the Clergy at the Head of them. I do not ſay this without good Grounds; for 1<hi>ſt,</hi> We ſee that in the Councils held againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> there were very great Conteſts about this Matter, and that the oppoſite Party carried their Point only by down-right Violence. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Teſtimony of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> if many Perſons wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> many alſo wrote in favour of him, and who can doubt of their being Church-men? 3<hi>dly,</hi> That his own Biſhop <hi>Bruno,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angers,</hi> where he was Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, declared himſelf for him. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That in <hi>Aquitain</hi> in the Year 1075, <hi>Giraldus</hi> Legat of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to call a Council at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where <hi>Berengarius</hi> narrowly eſcaped being murthered, as we are aſſured by the Chronicle of St. <hi>Maixant,</hi> the Circumſtances whereof there ſet down, they that publiſhed it took care to leave out. 5<hi>thly,</hi> That five Years after they were obliged to convocate another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where <hi>Berengarius</hi> gave an Account of his Faith, as the ſame Chronicle acquaints us. We ought natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to obſerve that from the Year 1050, wherein <hi>Berengarius</hi> appeared at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he maintained his Opinions with ſo much Courage, that <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Mont-Caſſin,</hi> owns that there was no Body able to oppoſe him, until the Year 1080,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50988:107"/>
in which the Council of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> met; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could not overthrow <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Party, though ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by turns, both Councils and Violence, which ſhows that there were amongſt <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Followers, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Party of the Clergy, and of thoſe of <hi>Aquitain</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Neither was it only this Difference in Point of Doctrine that ſtrengthned the <hi>Berengarian</hi> Party, but alſo the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> II, and his Succeſſors, and above all thoſe of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, in the Council of <hi>Rome,</hi> in 1074, and 1075. We may ſee the Effect of his prohibiting Matrimony to Prieſts, as <hi>Sigebert</hi> has recorded it upon the Year 1074.
<q>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> at a Synod held by him, anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd all that came into Preferments by Simony, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all married Prieſts from their Functions, and forbad Laymen to aſſiſt at their Maſſes, by not only an unheard-of Precedent, but alſo (as ſeveral People thought at that time) by an inconſiderate Prejudice, contrary to the Opinion of the Holy Fathers, who have written, that the Sacraments uſed in the Church, to wit, Baptiſm, Chriſm, and the Body and Blood of our Lord, have the ſelf-ſame Efficacy by the ſecret Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, be the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of them good or bad. Wherefore then ſince they are quickned by the Holy Spirit, ſo that they are neither amplified by the Worthineſs of the good Diſpenſers, nor leſſened by the Sins of the Wicked, whence is this Man that baptizes? which thing hath given ſo great occaſion of Scandal, that never was the Holy Church rent with a more dangerous Schiſm at any time by a prevailing Hereſy, than it is now, whilſt ſome act for Righteouſneſs, others againſt it; ſome openly are guilty of Simony, others cover the Stain of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs with an honeſt Name, ſelling that under the Name of Charity, which they pretend to give freely, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> whilſt under the Name of Offerings, they more artificially receive Bribes. By this means alſo things are brought to that paſs, that there are very few that practiſe Continence, whilſt ſome make only an hypocritical Shew of it for Gain and Boaſting; and

others aggravate their Incontinence by forſwearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by multiplied Adulteries. Beſides, upon this occaſion Laymen riſe up in Rebellion againſt the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, ſhaking off the Yoak of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subjection; Laymen prophane Holy Myſteries, and diſpute about them, baptize Infants, uſing the filthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the Ears inſtead of the Holy Oil and Chriſm; on their Death-Beds they ſcorn to receive at the Hands of married Prieſts the Lord's Proviſion for their laſt Journey, and the uſual Service of Church-Burial. The Tithes that are aſſigned to the Prieſts they conſume with Fire: and that by one horrid Profanation you may make an Eſtimate of the reſt, Laymen have been often ſeen to trample the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord, that had been conſecrated by married Prieſts, under their Feet, and wilfully ſpill his Blood upon the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many ſuch things againſt the Laws of God and Man are daily committed in the Church. By this means alſo many falſe Teachers riſe in the Church, who by their prophane Innovations alienate the Minds of the common People from the Diſcipline of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore was the great occaſion that was given to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Clergy and People of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> not to entertain any Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Yoak which ſhe was preparing for all the Weſtern Churches.</p>
               <p>I have in my Remarks upon the Hiſtory of the Churches of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> given an Account of the Riſe of the Opinion of thoſe who believed that the Popes Excommunications de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived ſuch as had been duly ordained, of all Power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Functions, and did incapacitate them to confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon other Miniſters. This was the true Reaſon that made all that maintained the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> look upon the Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, who had thus renounced the Roman Communion, as a Company of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to conſider their Ordinations as null. I need not repeat the ſame here, it being ſufficiently confirmed by the Paſſage of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> which I juſt now quoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:50988:108"/>It appears therefore that the Diſcipline of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> was the ſame that had been practiſed in the Primitive Church: They had their Biſhops, their Prieſts and their Deacons, whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at firſt held for Schiſmaticks, and whoſe Miniſtry ſhe at laſt abſolutely rejected, for the ſame Reaſons, that made her conſider the Miniſtry of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> as null and void. We find in <hi>Peter</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> that he reproacheth the <hi>Petrobuſians,</hi> for being join'd with Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; whereas they took the Name of Apoſtolical Men.

Who were theſe Schiſmaticks but the <hi>Berengarians?</hi> It is manifeſt that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being become impoſſible, by reaſon of the Errors ſhe had defined, and the Tyranny ſhe had uſurped over the State and Church: there was even before his time a Separation made of the greateſt Part of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of <hi>Narbon, Tholouſe, Agen,</hi> and other places; and that <hi>Peter Bruys</hi> and his Diſciples were of his Party, appears from his 2<hi>d</hi> Epiſtle, which is conſiderable, to this purpoſe.

<q>So far, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> hath this noiſom heretical Infection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that almoſt all cloſing with it, believe that in ſo doing they do God good Service; and the wicked one who is now exerting the Myſtery of Iniquity in the Children of Unbelief, doth ſo transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, that the Wife ſeparates from her Husband, the Son from his Father, and the Daughter-in-Law from her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law.

<q>Yea ſo far had this Plague prevailed in the Land, that they had not only made to themſelves Prieſts and Biſhops, but had alſo their Evangeliſts, who having depraved and cancell'd the Truth of the Goſpel, had copied to themſelves new Goſpels, and from their wicked Hearts, preached to the deceived People new Doctrines. I lie if there was not amongſt them a Man of a great Age, of a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtate, who had ſeveral Brethren and Friends, and who had the Reputation of a great Man amongſt the greateſt of the City, whom, in Puniſhment for his Sins, the Devil had ſo blinded, that he declar'd himſelf to be <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and he diſtinguiſhed the Word that was in the Beginning with God, from another Principle of things, as from another God: he was the head of theſe miſerable Wretches, and the Ring-leader of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in this City; who, though a Lay-man and an Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and ſo knew nothing, yet as a Fountain of diabolical Wiſdom, the bitter Waters of Perdition and Death flowed from him amongſt them.

the Preacher to theſe Fools. He had fill'd the whole City with his Diſciples and Doctrine; no Body daring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, becauſe of his Power and Riches. Yea, ſo great was the Licentiouſneſs of theſe Hereticks, that at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Town, as we paſſed through the Streets and Lanes, they mocked us, and pointed at us with their Finger, calling us Apoſtats, Hypocrits, and Hereticks.</q>

                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> in his Chronicle, at the Beginning, ſpeaks of the great Reſpect that was given to theſe Miniſters of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> becauſe of the Holineſs of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We ſee in the Acts of the Inquiſition of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> ſeveral Names of thoſe that were Paſtors of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and who had been ordain'd to the holy Miniſtry, by Men of their own Communion. This therefore was the Government of theſe Churches, the Succeſſion whereof we cannot diſtinctly ſet down; but this ought not to ſurprize any Body, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the <hi>Croiſade,</hi> and the Inquiſitors, can beſt ſatisfy the World in this Point, wherein we muſt acknowledg our Inability.</p>
               <p>As for their Morals and Behaviour, who ever will but reflect upon the Debauchery and general Corruption which reigned in the 11<hi>th</hi> Century, will eaſily judg, that thoſe who renounced the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who call'd her the Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe of her falſe Worſhip, and the horrid Corruption of her Miniſters, muſt needs be more pure in their Morals, and more orderly in their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and indeed we find it true in the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as well Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors as People.</p>
               <p>The Paſtors recommended to the People, the having of the Books of the New Teſtament in their Mother-Tongue, and preſſed the Reading thereof with ſo much Care and Application, that <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> never ſtirred any whither without taking that holy Book with him. This was the certain Badg and Mark of all theſe Hereticks, and that whereby they defended themſelves. For which reaſon, the Council of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> fearing leſt their <hi>Croiſades</hi> ſhould not be able to exterminate the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as long as they had the Bible in the vulgar Tongue, took care to prohibit the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50988:111"/>
having of it, in theſe Terms;
<q>We prohibit the Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament to Laymen, except perhaps they might deſire to have the Pſalter, or ſome Breviary for the Divine Service, or the Hours of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> for Devotion; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidding their having the other Parts of the Bible tranſlated into the Vulgar Tongue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was by means of this Purity of their Morals, that, as <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> witneſſeth, the <hi>Petrobuſians</hi> found ſo much favour with many of the Clergy, of the Biſhops, of the Princes, and of the Laity, at the ſame time when they preached openly, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Church; but that they were the true Church, as being truly Apoſtolical.</p>
               <p>Indeed a curſory Reflection upon the Nature of the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes laid to their Charge, as if thoſe Abominations had been the general Character of their Religion, is ſufficient to diſcover the Impoſture of their Accuſers: For they are Crimes that overturn the Foundations of all Society, by deſtroying the Honour of Families, and filling every Place with abominable Adulteries and Inceſts. Can any Man i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that ſuch a Sect as this, could ever have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to propagate it ſelf throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Wilhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Newbrigenſis</hi> declares the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> did, if the Manners of thoſe that profeſs it, had been founded upon Principles that trample upon the Laws of Nature, which have always been reſpected even amidſt the thickeſt Darkneſs of Paganiſm? We do not find that <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> went ſo far, even then when it caus'd the greateſt Diſturbance in the World, nor that the Corruption into which it plunged thoſe that were tainted with it, had any very great influence upon others; whereas we find, that the Religion of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> hath ſpread its Roots far and near, and even procur'd Eſteem and Affection from thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party, that were not wholly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Nature of Brutes and Madmen, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequences of that inſulting Spirit which has animated the Popes and the Clergy in theſe latter Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:50988:111"/>What I ſay here, is evident from the Teſtimony of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> in his Chronicle, who owns that the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes</hi> had a ſhew of Godlineſs, though, ſaith he, they deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of it; that they were had in extream Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the People; and that more Legacies were left to them than to Church-men: whereas on the other hand, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy were fall'n to that extream Contempt, that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men inſtead of the common Wiſh, <hi>I had rather be a Jew,</hi> us'd to ſay, <hi>I had rather be a Chaplain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caſe muſt needs have been very evident, ſince Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III, who left nothing unattempted to root it out, yet could not but do them the juſtice to own, that they were very free from ſeveral Vices.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 149.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed we may eaſily judg of their Morals and Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by their Conſtancy in ſuffering the moſt cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the defence of the Truth. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> tells us, of one <hi>Robert</hi> an Inquiſitor, who buried alive, or burnt 50 of them in two Months time, and yet not one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renounced his Faith, in the midſt of the greateſt Violence of their Torments. <hi>Perrin</hi> and <hi>Chaſſagnon</hi> give us great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of parallel Examples, as well as the Acts of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Tholouſe. Lucus Tudenſis,</hi> who endeavours to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule this Conſtancy of their Martyrs, is at the ſame time a Witneſs for it beyond all manner of Controverſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mezeray</hi> was juſter than the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>; for though he was not ignorant of the Slanders caſt upon them, yet he hath given this Teſtimony of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Waldenſes</hi>; he ſaith,
<q>There were two principal Sorts of them; the one of them were very ignorant, and given to Lewdneſs and Villany; theſe Men maintain'd groſs and filthy Errors; and theſe were indeed a kind of <hi>Manichees.</hi> The others were more learned, and leſs diſorderly, and keeping themſelves at the greateſt diſtance from the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes now mention'd, maintain'd much the ſame Opinions with the Calviniſts, and to ſpeak properly, were <hi>Henricians</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>In 1181, <hi>Henry,</hi> who from Abbot of <hi>Clairvaux,</hi> had been made Biſhop of <hi>Alby,</hi> having as Legate gathered together ſome conſiderable Forces by his Preaching, went to viſit them with armed Force, but they to avoid the Storm that threatned them, pretended to abjure their Errors; but no ſooner was the Storm blown over, but they liv'd as they did before. So that the Contagion ſpread it ſelf through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces, on both ſides of the <hi>Loire:</hi> and one of their falſe Apoſtles called <hi>Terric,</hi> who had hid himſelf a long time in a Cave at <hi>Corbigny</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Nevers,</hi> was taken and burnt, and many more ſuffered the ſame Puniſhment in ſeveral other places.</p>
               <p>This was that Sweetneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſo much boaſts of, and which ſhe put in practice long before ſhe came to Conferences, which ſerved only for a Prelude to the utter ruin of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which the Popes had deſigned long before.</p>
               <p>Accordingly <hi>Innocent</hi> III, as <hi>Mezeray</hi> tells us in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 616.</note> finding himſelf unable to reduce the Hereticks of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who had almoſt gained that whole Province, reſolv'd to make an Example of <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> becauſe he was their chief Favourer, and becauſe he had caus'd <hi>Peter de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> a Ciſtertian Monk, and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50988:113"/>
firſt that ever exerciſed the Function of Inquiſitor, to be put to Death: He excommunicated the Earl, abſolved his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Oath of Allegiance, and gave his Lands to the firſt that ſhould ſeize them, yet ſo as without Prejudice to the Right of Soveraignty of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Earl was ſo frighted, that being come to <hi>Valence,</hi> to meet with <hi>Milo</hi> the Pope's Legate, he wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him, and gave eight ſtrong Places for ever to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Security of his Converſion: and the Year following, to obtain Abſolution, he ſuffered himſelf to be laſh'd with Rods before the Gate of the Church of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> where <hi>Peter de Chaſteau-Neuf</hi> was buried, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be dragg'd to the Tomb of that Monk by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who put a wooden Yoak about his Neck, before twenty Archbiſhops, and an infinite multitude of People: after this he took upon him the Croiſade, and the Year following joined himſelf with thoſe that took his own Cities, and thoſe of his Confederates.</p>
               <p>But it was not his Repentance that ingaged him to endure ſo dreadful a Diſgrace, but the Apprehenſion he had of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Tempeſt, that was juſt then breaking over his Head, for the Pope turning his Torrent of Zeal againſt the Hereticks, which puſh'd the People on to the Deliverance of the Holy Land, had this ſame Year ordered the Croiſade to be preached up againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and a great number of Noblemen, Biſhops and common People, had already liſted themſelves in that Service, the King himſelf furniſhing 15000 Men, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his own Charges.</p>
               <p>It is worth our taking notice, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III, to encourage the Lords and People to the Holy War, granted a Plenary Remiſſion of all their Sins to all thoſe who took up the Badg of the Croſs, vouchſafing alſo the Protection of the Holy See to their Perſons and Goods, as may be ſeen in his Epiſtles. He abſolved the Cities that had ſworn to the Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> from their Oath of Allegiance, upon that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Principle of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, becauſe they do not keep theirs with God or the Church.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> was not guilty of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50988:113"/>
Murder of <hi>Peter de Chaſteau Neuf</hi>; for we read that Earl <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> went to meet King <hi>Philip,</hi> to obtain of him Letters of Recommendation from the Pope, that he might be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of the Murder of the Monk <hi>Peter de Chaſteau Neuf,</hi> whereof they had moſt unjuſtly obliged him to confeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty, only becauſe the ſaid Murder had been committed in his Territories, for which the Legate <hi>Milo</hi> had impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him a moſt unjuſt and unheard of Penance. From the Court of the King of <hi>France</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Abſolution immediately from the Hands of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> III; this being a Caſe reſerved to him, the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him very civilly, preſented him with a rich Robe, and a Ring of great Value, and granted him plenary Remiſſion and Abſolution from the ſaid Murder, declaring that he look'd upon him as ſufficiently cleared upon that Account.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1209, the Army of theſe Croſs'd Souldiers, which conſiſted of no leſs than 500000 Men, entred <hi>Languedock,</hi> and attack'd the City of <hi>Beziers,</hi> being one of the ſtrongeſt Places the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> had, took it by Force, and put all they found in it to the Sword; ſo that above 60000 Perſons were kill'd there, as <hi>Mezeray</hi> informs us.</p>
               <p>There happened one thing very remarkable at the taking of this City, which was, That the Zeal of theſe conſecrated Souldiers was ſuch, that they put to the Sword all the Papiſts and Romiſh Clergy that were in the City. The Earl of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers</hi> came out of the City, and caſt himſelf at the Feet of the Legate <hi>Milo,</hi> begging his Grace in Behalf of his City of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and intreating him, that he would not involve the Innocent in the Puniſhment of the Guilty, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to paſs, in caſe the City ſhould be taken by Force, (which would ſoon be done by ſuch a great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army, that was ready to ſcale the Walls in every Part round the whole City) that it could not be otherwiſe, but that in this Caſe much Blood would be ſpilt on both ſides, which he might prevent. That there were in <hi>Beziers</hi> great Numbers of good Catholicks, who would be involved in the ſame Ruin, contrary to the Pope's Intention, whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was only to chaſtiſe the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> That if he did not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50988:114"/>
think fit to ſpare his Subjects, for their own ſakes, that at leaſt he would be pleaſed to take pity of his Age and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince the Loſs would be his, who was under Age, and an obedient Servant of the Pope, as having been educated in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the which he was reſolved to live and die. That if he was offended that ſuch Perſons as were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Pope, had been tolerated in his Territories, that this ought not to be imputed to him, becauſe he had no other Subjects, but ſuch as his deceaſed Father had left him; and that in this his Minority, and during the ſhort time that he had been Maſter of his Eſtate, he had neither been able by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Incapacity to diſcern the Evil, or to ſuit a Remedy to it; though indeed this was his Intention, and that he hoped for the time to come, to give all manner of Satisfaction to the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as became an obedient Son of both.</p>
               <p>The Pope's Legat's Anſwer was, That all his Excuſes ſhould be of no Uſe to him, and that he might ſhift for himſelf the beſt he could.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> being returned to the City, called the People together, and repreſented to them, that after having ſubmitted himſelf to the Pope's Legate, he had interceded for them, without being able to obtain any thing, but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, upon condition that thoſe who profeſſed the Faith of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> ſhould abjure their Religion, and promiſe to live according to the Laws of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> beſeeched them to give way to this extream Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and not to be the cauſe of their Death, becauſe the Legate was reſolved not to pardon one of them, except they all unanimouſly reſolved to live under the ſame Laws. To which the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> anſwered, That they would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Faith, for the baſe Price of this frail Life: That they were well aſſured that God could protect them, if it ſeemed good unto him; but withal, neither were they ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that if he rather choſe to be glorified by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith, it would be an exceeding Honour to them to die for Righteouſneſs ſake. That they had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpleaſe the Pope, who could only deſtroy their Bodies,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50988:114"/>
than offend God, who could deſtroy Body and Soul together. That they deteſted the Thought of being aſhamed of, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Faith by which they had learn'd to know Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; and for fear of eternal Death to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Religion which intirely takes away the Merit of Jeſus Chriſt, and deſtroys his Righteouſneſs; that therefore they might make the beſt terms for themſelves they could, without promiſing any thing that was contrary to the Duty of true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> underſtood this, they ſent their Biſhop to the Legate, to beſeech him not to comprehend them in the ſame Puniſhment with the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> they having always adhered to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of whom he who was their Biſhop had good Knowledg; judging alſo that the reſt had not gone ſo far from the ways of Repentance; but that they might be reduced by a Sweetneſs well becoming the Church, which takes no Delight in ſhedding Blood.</p>
               <p>The Legate being enraged at this, with horrible Threats and Oaths proteſted, That except all that were in the Town did acknowledg their Fault, and ſubmit themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhould all be put to the Sword, without any regard had to Catholicks, to Sex or Age; but that all ſhould be expoſed to Fire and Sword: and immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the City to be ſummoned to ſurrender at Diſcretion, which being refuſed, he commanded all the warlike Engines to play, and to diſcharge their Inſtruments, and to caſt Stones, ordering them at the ſame time to give a general Aſſault, and to ſcale the City round, ſo that it was impoſſible for thoſe within to ſuſtain the ſhock; for being preſs'd upon by above 100000 Pilgrims, they at laſt, ſaith the Compiler of the <hi>Treaſure of Hiſtories,</hi> diſcomfited thoſe within the City, and entring in all at once, killed vaſt numbers of all ſorts, and afterwards putting Fire to the City, they burnt it to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>When the Town was taken, the Prieſts, Monks and Clerks, came in Proceſſion out of the great Church of <hi>Beziers,</hi> called St. <hi>Nazari,</hi> with the Banner, Croſs, and Holy Water, bare-headed, clothed in their Eccleſiaſtical Veſtments, ſinging <hi>Te Deum,</hi> in token of their rejoicing for the City's being taken
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50988:115"/>
and purged of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> But the Pilgrims, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an expreſs Order from the Legate to kill all, ruſhed in amongſt this Proceſſion, cutting off the Heads and Arms of the Prieſts, ſtriving who could do moſt, till they were all cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Theſe Cruelties exerciſed upon the City of <hi>Beziers,</hi> upon the Papiſts themſelves, yea, and upon their very Clergy, having opened the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> his Eyes, to ſee that the Pope under the Pretence of Religion, had a mind to ruin the Earl of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> his Uncle, as well as himſelf, he ſhut up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his City of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> with a Reſolution to defend it againſt the Legate and his Pilgrims. The King of <hi>Arragon</hi> his Kinſman having diſcourſed with him, the Earl plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That he knew this to be the Pope's Deſign, becauſe when he was treating for his Subjects of <hi>Beziers,</hi> he refuſed to receive his Catholick Subjects into his Favour, nay, would not ſo much as ſpare the Prieſts, who were all cut in pieces in their Sacerdotal Ornaments, under the Banner and the Croſs; that this Example of cruel Impiety, joined with what they exerciſed upon the Village of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> where they had expoſed all to Fire and Sword, without any Diſtinction of Age or Sex, had fully convinced him that there was no Mercy to be look'd for from the Legate or his Pilgrims, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he would chooſe rather to die with his Subjects, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves, than to be expoſed to the Mercy of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable Enemy, ſuch as he had found the Legate to be: and though there were in the City of <hi>Carcaſſon</hi> many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of a Belief contrary to that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet that they were Perſons that had never done any Injury to any one; that they had always aſſiſted him in time of need, and that for this their good Service, he was reſolved never to abandon them, as they on their Parts had promiſed him to hazard Life and Eſtate in his Defence: That he hoped that God, who is the Reliever of thoſe who are oppreſſed, would aſſiſt them againſt this great Multitude of ill-adviſed Men, who under the Pretence of meriting Heaven, had quitted their own Habitations to come and burn, pillage, ravage and murder in the Habitations of others, without either Reaſon, Judgment or Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:50988:115"/>The King of <hi>Arragon</hi> returned with this Remonſtrance to the Legat, who aſſembled a great number of Lords and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats to hear what he had to ſay, who declared to them, that he had found the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> his Ally, extreamly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at their inhuman Proceedings againſt his Subjects of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers,</hi> and of the Village of <hi>Carcaſſon</hi>; and that he was fully perſwaded, ſeeing they had neither ſpared the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, nor the Prieſts themſelves, that it was not a Religious War, as was pretended, but a kind of Robbery under the Colour of Religion: That he hoped God would be ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him, as to make his Innocence, and the juſt occaſion he hath had to defend himſelf, ſufficiently known: That they muſt not hope now to have them ſurrender at Diſcretion, ſince they had found that there was no other to be expected from them, but that of killing all they met with. That it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been found good Policy to drive an Enemy to Deſpair: wherefore if the Legate would be pleaſed to afford any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Compoſition to the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> and his Subjects, that Mildneſs would be a better Method to reduce the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than extream Severity: and that he ought alſo to remember that the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> was a young Man, and a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> who might be very ſerviceable in reducing his Subjects, who had ſo great Confidence in him, to their Obedience to the Church.</p>
               <p>The Legate told the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> that if he would withdraw a little, they would adviſe what were beſt to be done. The King being called in again, the Legate told him, That in Conſideration of his Interceſſion, he would receive the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> to Mercy, and therefore if it ſeemed good to him, he might come forth, and eleven with him, with his Goods and Baggage; but that as for the People that were in the City of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> they ſhould only deliver to his Diſcretion, of which they ought to have a very good Opinion, he being the Pope's Legate; and that accordingly they ſhould come forth all ſtark-naked, Men, Women and Children, without Shirts or any other Covering on their Bodies. Alſo that the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> ſhould be delivered into ſure Hands, and that all his Eſtate ſhould be ſurrendred up to the future Lord of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50988:116"/>
who ſhould be choſen for Conſervation of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Arragon</hi> having indeavoured to bring the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to eaſier terms for the young Earl: the Legate told him, that theſe Conditions were very favourable; and yet what follows, is ſtill more infamous. The Legate employes a Perſon of Quality to indeavour to draw the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> out of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> and to bring him to him, with Aſſurance under Oath, that he would ſend him back to his City of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> in caſe he ſhould not be ſatisfied with the Legat's Propoſals. The Count of <hi>Beziers</hi> upon this Aſſurance comes to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and repreſents to him, That if he would think fit to treat his Subjects with more Kindneſs, he would eaſily induce them to comply with his Deſire, and recal the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> from their Error to the Church: That the Terms which had been mentioned to him, were ſhameful and undecent for thoſe who were to keep their Eyes chaſte as well as their Thoughts: That he knew his People would rather die than ſee themſelves reduced to ſo ſcandalous an Ignominy, and therefore entreated him to come to eaſier Terms, and that he did not queſtion but to make his Subjects accept of any other more tolerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The Legate's Anſwer was, That the People of <hi>Carcaſſon</hi> might conſider what they had to do; that he would concern himſelf no further, ſince the Earl was his Priſoner, and ſhould continue ſo till the City were taken, and his Subjects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their Duty.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort</hi> was made General for the Church, he was ſo careful to deſtroy the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> that he ſeized upon all the places belonging to Popiſh Lords, that lay convenient for him, ſo that the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was forced to complain to the Pope of theſe his Proceedings, in ſome Letters yet extant, to oblige him to make Reſtitution. And for the merciful temper of this renowned Earl, take but this one Inſtance of it: After a Siege of ſix Months the City of <hi>Lavaur</hi> was taken by Storm, and ſcaling of the Walls, and all that were found in it were put to the Sword, except fourſcore Gentlemen whom the Earl cauſed to be hanged and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50988:116"/>
ſtrangled, and <hi>Almericus</hi> was hanged on a Gallows higher than the reſt. The Lady of <hi>Lavaur</hi> was caſt alive into a Pit, and there ſtoned to Death.</p>
               <p>The Conduct of the Pope, and the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, in the year 1215, is worth taking notice of, becauſe it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Confirmation of all theſe Proceedings. <hi>Mezeray</hi> gives this Account of it. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> took upon him the Badg of the Croſs to go againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and aſſiſted in the Expedition of <hi>Languedoc</hi>; the Earl of <hi>Montfort</hi> met him at <hi>Vienne,</hi> and the Legate at <hi>Valence</hi>; when he was come to St. <hi>Gilles, Montfort,</hi> who accompanied him, received Bulls from the Pope, who, purſuant to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Montpellier</hi> held ſome Months before, had given him the whole Territory of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and all the reſt he had conquer'd with his croſs'd Pilgrims, provided he could get Inveſtiture from the King, and would pay him the accuſtomed Homage: So that we may ſay, that the Pope nominated him to his Dignity, and the King in compliance with the ſaid Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conferr'd it upon him. From thence <hi>Lewis</hi> went to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and then to <hi>Beziers,</hi> where he gave order for the demoliſhing of the Walls of <hi>Narbon</hi> and <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> In the mean time, the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> notwithſtanding the pitiful Remonſtrances of the Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who was preſent there in Perſon with his Son, adjudged the Propriety of his Lands to <hi>Montfort,</hi> reſerving only the Lands he had in <hi>Provence</hi> for his Son, and 400 Marks of Silver a Year for his own Subſiſtence, and that too upon condition of his being obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Church. Afer this, <hi>Montfort</hi> aſſumed the Title of Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and came and received his Inveſtiture from the King in the City of <hi>Melun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould never have done, ſhould I barely mention all the Cruelties and Barbarities which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party exerciſed for near twenty Years together by their continual Croiſades, againſt a People who were taken to be Hereticks as ſoon as they found a New Teſtament in the vulgar Tongue about them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with ſetting down the Laws which the King of <hi>France</hi> enacted in the year 1228, againſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50988:117"/>
the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
                  <q>Wherefore becauſe the Hereticks have now of a long time ſpread their Poiſon in your Parts, polluting our Mother the Church after ſeveral Manners; we do in order to their utter Extirpation decree, that all Hereticks deviating from the Catholick Faith, by what Name ſoever they are called, as ſoon as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of Hereſy by the Biſhop of the Place, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Eccleſiaſtical Perſon that hath Power to do it, be without delay puniſhed; Ordaining alſo, and firmly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, That no Man do preſume to harbour or protect the ſaid Hereticks, or favour or truſt them; and that if any one do preſume to commit any thing contrary to theſe Premiſes, he be made incapable of being a Witneſs, or of any Honour whatſoever, as alſo of making a Will, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting any thing. Moreover, We enact, That all his Goods, real or perſonal, be <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> confiſcated, never to return to him or any of his Poſterity. We alſo enact and command, That all Barons of the Land, and our Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, and other our Subjects preſent and future, be careful and diligent to purge the Land of Hereticks, and heretical Contagion, commanding them to be very induſtrious in ſearching them out, and faithful in diſcovering them, and as ſoon as they have found any of them, to preſent them without delay before the Perſons above named, that ſo being convict in their Preſence of Error and Hereſy, they may, ſetting aſide all Hatred, Entreaties, Rewards, Fear, Favour and Love, give Sentence againſt them. And that thoſe who are diligent and careful in the ſearching for, and ſeizing of Hereticks, may not want the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Honour and Reward, We do enact, will and command, that our Bailiffs, in whoſe Bailiwicks the ſaid Hereticks ſhall be ſeized, pay to the Taker for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Heretick, two Marks in Silver, for the Term of two Years, and after that time expired, one Mark only.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have taken a View of what was charged upon the Magiſtrates and Lords, to whom the Execution of theſe Laws was committed. Let us now conſider what
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50988:117"/>
other means the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made uſe of; which was, the erecting the Tribunal of the Inquiſition, the Maxims and Conduct whereof, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, thought good to make known to the World, by publiſhing the Directory for Inquiſitors. This Tribunal erected by the Popes for the Extirpation of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> is a Thing in it ſelf ſo very horrid, that it ſtrikes the Papiſts themſelves with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that are not us'd to it; and yet ſuch as it is, it hath juſtly been eſteemed, and is ſtill to this day thought to be the right Hand of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> One may ſee from ſome of the publiſhed Regiſters of theſe Inquiſitors, and by ſome of their Trials of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the horrid Impoſtures of theſe Inquiſitors, and the terrible Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have inflicted upon the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in all Places, where from Age to Age they have been able to diſcover them.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50988:118"/>
afterwards given to the <hi>Wicklefites,</hi> as is evident from the Writings of <hi>Walfingham</hi> and <hi>William Thorn.</hi> They ſeem to have come from the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> by what <hi>Kilianus</hi> tells us; <hi>Lollardus quoque dicitur Hereticus Waldenſis:</hi> 
                  <q>A Lollard is alſo called a Waldenſian Heretick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I need only therefore ſpeak of their Numbers, which as <hi>Knighton</hi> aſſures us, covered all <hi>England:</hi> but ſince they have been charged with moſt horrid Crimes, becauſe they ſpoke againſt the Images of the Saints, and the reſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, as well as the Vices of the Clergy; it will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to clear them from theſe falſe Imputations, in the moſt authentick Manner that may be.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore examine the Calumnies charged upon them by <hi>Trithemius</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Hirſauge,</hi> on the year 1316,<note place="margin">Saecul. 13. p. 1. p. 387, &amp; 388.</note> as they were copied by <hi>Natalis Alexander,</hi> a Jacobite Friar, in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.

               <p n="1">
                  <q>I. That Maſſes were vain Things, to which neither any Reverence was due, nor were they of any uſe or profit.</q>

               <p n="2">
                  <q>II.

               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>III. That the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if ſhe continued a Virgin after her Delivery, muſt have brought forth not a Man, but an Angel.</q>

               <p n="4">
                  <q>IV.

               <p n="5">
                  <q>V. They derided the Sacrament of Baptiſm; ſaying, If Baptiſm be a Sacrament, then every Bath is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p n="6">
                  <q>VI. They ſhamefully abuſed the Sacrament of Penance, by confeſſing their Sins not to Prieſts but Laymen, and expreſſing them only in general, and not in particular, and yet they hoped by this their Confeſſion, to obtain full and perfect Forgiveneſs both of Guilt and Puniſhment.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <q>VII. The Sacrament of the Lord's Body, they did not believe at all, calling the conſecrated Hoſt, a God made with Hands.</q>

               <p n="8">
                  <q>VIII. They called the Sacrament of Matrimony that was ſworn to, Fornication.</q>

                  <q>IX.

               <p n="10">
                  <q>X.

               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <q>XI. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the Church of Chriſt, but of infidel Heathens; and they deſpiſed all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws, together with all the Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church.</q>

                  <q>XV. They deny'd that the Merits or Interceſſions of the Saints, could prevail with God for the Pardon of Mens Sins. And he ſays, that beſide theſe they profeſſed many other Errors, which he omits, for fear of being tedious to his Readers. He adds alſo, That this Hereſy did ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, that in <hi>Auſtria, Bohemia,</hi> and the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,

there were above four-ſcore Thouſand Men who were ſworn to the Profeſſion of this Sect. From theſe Dregs of Hereſy, ſaith he, <hi>Bohemia</hi> being then infected, continues tainted with the ſame to this Day. He ſubjoins, that many of theſe Hereticks were at the ſame time burnt in divers places of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who all of them continued ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately in their Hereſy, with great Chearfulneſs until Death. <hi>Walter,</hi> a chief Man of that Sect, was burnt at <hi>Collen</hi> in the Year 1323, as <hi>Trithemius</hi> tells us in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Monaſtery of <hi>Hirſaugen,</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Spires.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nothing can be imagined more horrid than theſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and we need not doubt but they were ſupported by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretended Convictions made by the Inquiſitors of <hi>Germany:</hi> but it is eaſy to demonſtrate, that there is ſcarce any ground for all theſe Accuſations, which therefore is a plain Proof of what I have elſewhere maintained concerning theſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Perſons, who uſed it for a Proverb in <hi>England, He lies like a Monk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have an authentick piece of the <hi>Lollards,</hi> which <hi>Roger Dimmock</hi> a Jacobite Friar hath confuted in a Manuſcript, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are two Copies at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the one in the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and another older than that, in <hi>Trinity Colledg.</hi> They preſented this Confeſſion of theirs to the Parliament, which gave occaſion to this Monk to inſert it in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> together with his Latin Tranſlation, into a Book which he dedicated to King <hi>Richard</hi> II.

Another Skil for ſpecial Praier, mad for Men, dampned to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Payne, is to God gretly diſpleſant, and thow it be dowt, it is likli to trewe Chriſtes Peple, that the Fownders of Almes-Howſes, for her venymous Dotation ben for the moſt part paſſed the brode Wey.

               <p>I ſuppoſe it is not neceſſary, after the Peruſal of this Piece, to obſerve that the <hi>Romiſh Clergy</hi> caſt thoſe Crimes upon the <hi>Lollards,</hi> whereof themſelves were guilty, and which the <hi>Lollards</hi> laid to their Charge in the Face of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid perhaps that this Petition contains ſeveral Errors: I own it: but we are to obſerve, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That it is part of the Frailty of Mankind, to fall into the contrary Extream, whilſt we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid thoſe things that appear to us to be mortal. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That theſe Failings may be eaſily extenuated by the ſame Charity which we commonly make uſe of, when we ſpeak of the Ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fathers of the Church.</p>
               <p>But this will ſome object, reſpects only the <hi>Lollards</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and cannot be extended to the juſtifying of the <hi>Lollards</hi> of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> who might have been guilty of the Crimes whereof they are accuſed. To this Objection I anſwer: 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That ſince the <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Kilianus,</hi> reported by M. du <hi>Cange,</hi> were the ſame with the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>; the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath already drawn up their Apology, by maintaining that they differed only in a very few things from the Papiſts. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That if one ſhould reject the Biſhop's Opinion, yet ſufficient Matter for their Juſtification may be found in the Writings of the more honeſt Authors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, ſuch as <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas Sylvius</hi> and ſome others, without ſpeaking of their own Writings or Apologies, whereof we have ſome few Remnants printed.</p>
               <p>Be it as it will, to return to our Engliſh <hi>Lollards; Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tom. 1. p. 574, &amp; 575.</note> gives us a Bull of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> IX, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> to oblige him to put King <hi>Richard</hi> II, upon perſecuting of them. As likewiſe the Bull ſent to King <hi>Richard</hi> on the ſame Subject, which imports,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50988:127"/>
that he had commanded the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> to proſecute them with the utmoſt Rigor and Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and afterwards ſets down the Commiſſion of <hi>Richard</hi> II, for the Trial of one <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> one of that Party.</p>
               <p>He hath alſo given us the Hiſtory of the Manner of their being hang'd and burnt by the King's Order in 1414.

There is no doubt but that there are many of them in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and of ſeveral other Sees, which could demonſtrate, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till the very Reformation, omitted their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards the Extirpation, by Fire and Fagot, of all thoſe that rebuked them for their Vices, and for the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Doctrine.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. Of the Doctrine of <hi>Wicklef</hi> and his Diſciples, in <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUT whether the <hi>Lollards</hi> maintain'd the Doctrine of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> or no, certain it is, that it received new Luſtre from the Learning of <hi>Wicklef,</hi> and thoſe who joined with him in the defence of the Truth, againſt the Friars and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> My Deſign is not to examine the whole Hiſtory of <hi>Wicklef,</hi> and of his Diſciples, to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath done his Endeavours to blacken them, and to load them with the fouleſt Calumnies; I only ſay in ſhort, that the Biſhop did not take the pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> hath writ on this Subject, in his <hi>Hiſtory of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxford; where he cites the Regiſters of the Univerſity, which refute the greateſt part of thoſe Slanders that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party have publiſhed againſt <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, thus much is evident, that <hi>John Wicklef</hi> was the moſt renowned Man of that Age, both for Learning and Piety. He had been Educated at the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where Scholaſtical Divinity had eſtabliſh'd its Empire, by the Care of <hi>Robert Groſthead, John Duns, Occam, Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and divers others. He there publickly profeſs'd Divinity, and was at laſt made Rector of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> where he died peaceably, after great and long Troubles, which he ſuffered for the defence of the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Pope had at this time uſurped almoſt the whole Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority, and more eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> where, after King <hi>John</hi> had made himſelf a Vaſſal of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III, the Popes commanded the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at pleaſure. We ſee by the Writings of <hi>Herveus Brito,</hi> who wrote at <hi>Paris</hi> about the Beginning of this Century,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50988:128"/>
where he was Profeſſor, that the temporal Power over all the World was directly attributed to the Pope, neither did any Kings oppoſe themſelves againſt it. It is well known that the Canoniſts, who had then the Reputation, had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Song in their Mouths but that of the Pope's Divinity, his Succeſſion to the Rights of Jeſus Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his abſolute Empire over all the World. This we meet with in all their Writings, and more eſpecially in thoſe who writ in defence of the Popes, againſt the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Friars Mendicants, whom Cardinal <hi>Albizi</hi> did very truly call the Pope's Souldiers, had uſurped all the Rights of the Secular Clergy, and advanc'd their Conqueſts for the Pope to that Degree, that the Authority of the Princes and Biſhops ſignified nothing any longer in <hi>England,</hi> except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they acted in favour of the Monks. From the time of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> who gives us ſo ſtrange a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Inſolence, and of their Attempts againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Clergy, things were carried to that height, that nothing was any longer able to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>Without doubt there was great need of Courage, as great as <hi>Wicklef</hi>'s was, and Learning too as vaſt as his, to ſtop ſo impetuous a Torrent. This great Man ſet himſelf againſt it, and carried on his Deſign after ſuch a manner, that the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Conſequences of it, continued to the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. It would take up a Volume to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account of what he wrote in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> III, and <hi>Richard</hi> II. I ſhall content my ſelf to take notice only of ſome few Particulars, and I ſhall afterwards treat of his Doctrine, which diffus'd it ſelf through <hi>Germany,</hi> and brought about a great Reformation there.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He publickly oppos'd in his Profeſſor's Chair, ſeveral Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Monks and Popes by their Authority, endeavour'd to maintain and countenance; in which Undertaking, he was always back'd by the Body of that Univerſity, where he had taught ſo long time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:50988:129"/>2. He maintain'd his Doctrine by the Favour of the Court, and the moſt illuſtrious and learned Members thereof, and with ſo great a Satisfaction of the People, that <hi>Knighton</hi> is obliged to acknowledg, that one half, yea, the greater Part of the People, owned his Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He had made ſo great Progreſs amongſt the Clergy, that he writes himſelf, that above a third Part of the Clergy were ready to defend his Doctrine with the hazard of their Lives: Accordingly, he appeared boldly at the Synod of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1377, to give an account of his Doctrine; where he defended himſelf with that Vigor, that none durſt gainſay him. He appeared there again the ſame Year in <hi>May,</hi> neither durſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop then decide any thing againſt him. And when in the year 1382, they in his Abſence, condemned ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which he maintain'd, yet he was there defended by the Deputies of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who gave a publick and authentick Teſtimony of his Piety, and his Purity in the Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> had eſpouſed his Quarrel with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo far, that after his having been attack'd by a Council at <hi>London,</hi> in 1382, and after having maintain'd his Doctrine from the year 1367 with publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, his Writings continued recommended by a Decree of the Univerſity, to all the Students both in the Publick Schools and Colledges, and were not forc'd from them, till after his Condemnation, which happened at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> 28 years after his Death. We ſee the Eſteem <hi>Wicklef</hi> had in that Univerſity, by the Teſtimony they gave in 1406, againſt thoſe that endeavour'd to blemiſh the Memory of this great Man: for after they had ſpoken of his Piety and Probity, as of a Thing known to all Men, after they had declared that he was a couragious Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith,<note place="margin">P. 203. Hiſt. &amp; antiq. Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
                  </note> they add, <hi>Qui ſingulos mendicitate ſpontaneâ Chriſti Religionem blaſphemantes, ſacrae Scripturae ſententiis catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licè expugnavit:</hi>
                  <q>That he had in a Catholick Way, by Texts of Scripture, overthrown all thoſe, who by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Poverty blaſphemed the Religion of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:50988:129"/>And ſince the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party had not at that time a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemy than <hi>Wicklef,</hi> they were not wanting to muſter all their Forces in order to ſuppreſs his Doctrine. In the Year 1396, <hi>William Woodeford,</hi> a Cordelier, was choſen by <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to write againſt <hi>Wicklef</hi>'s Trialogue, which he did accordingly, refuting 18 Articles of his Doctrine. This Book is printed in the <hi>Faſciculus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1411, <hi>Thomas Walden</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> deputed to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> dedicated his <hi>Doctrinal</hi> to Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V, againſt <hi>Wicklef,</hi> where he accuſeth him of above 800 Errors. This Monk, as able as he was, was really one of the moſt paſſionate Diſputers that ever writ: but withal it is true alſo, that to follow his Meaſures, we can ſcarcely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a more particular Diſcuſſion of the Errors, Superſtitions and falſe Suppoſitions, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes uſe of to maintain her Errors and falſe Worſhip, than that which <hi>Wicklef</hi> made uſe of. In the Account that <hi>Walden</hi> gives of it, we meet with a great Knowledg of Holy Scripture, and great Skill in Antiquity, whoſe Authority he makes uſe of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Novelties; we diſcover there a great ſtrength in his way of reaſoning, and an extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in his Conſequences; ſo that he ſeems to have fully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the Weakneſs of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cauſe, and overthrown its whole Foundations.</p>
               <p>One may plainly diſcover this, by running over the Titles of the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> of <hi>Thomas Walden,</hi> upon Matters of Faith, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacraments, upon thoſe which he calls ſacramental things, or that belong to Sacraments; for we ſcarcely meet with any Articles controverted between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which <hi>Wicklef</hi> hath not touched and handled, and that with ſufficient Exactneſs too. This hath obliged the Papiſts with ſo much Care to reprint <hi>Walden</hi>'s Works againſt <hi>Wicklef,</hi> as containing a Body of their Controverſies againſt the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Walden</hi> objects ſome very harſh and impious Opinions to him, and that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> has mingled ſeveral of that Nature amongſt the 45 Articles of <hi>Wicklef,</hi> which are there condemned. But here I muſt deſire
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50988:130"/>
my Reader to call to mind four things. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That <hi>Woodeford</hi> hath objected no ſuch thing to <hi>Wicklef,</hi> which ſhews that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught any like Doctrine, but that they are only Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn by a ſcholaſtical Divine, who was uſed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things too far. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That <hi>Walden</hi> wrote at a time when the Popiſh Party had the upper-hand in the Court of <hi>Henry</hi> V, who had condemned the <hi>Wicklefites</hi> as guilty of high Treaſon, which <hi>Walden</hi> takes notice of in his Dedication to <hi>Martin</hi> V. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That it is very probable that this Catalogue of 45 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles was drawn up by <hi>Walden</hi> himſelf, who was preſent at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> on purpoſe to promote <hi>Wicklef</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was the firſt, where by publick Conſent that Maxim, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> was ever put in Practice. Now let any one judg what Equity or Truth can be expected from Villains of ſuch profligate Principles, who think it an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to act in every thing according to them?</p>
               <p>After all this I might well excuſe my ſelf from ſetting down the Opinions of <hi>Wicklef,</hi> or from ſaying any thing for his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but I am willing to do both the one and the other, for the Honour of this great Man, and for the Readers Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The Opinions of <hi>Wicklef</hi> with relation to the Doctrine of Proteſtants, are theſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. Of the Calumnies that have been unjuſtly charged upon <hi>Wicklef</hi> by the Papiſts.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>WIcklef</hi> owns but 22 Canonical Books of Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the reſt, which he calls Apocryphal <note n="(a)" place="margin">De ver. ſcript. pag. 110.</note>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He teaches that the Scripture contains all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation.
<q>Foraſmuch, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> as in Scripture all Truth is contained, it is evident that all Diſputes that take not their Riſe thence, are prophane <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 39.</note>.

<q>God hath appointed the common ſenſible Scripture, to the comprehending of the Catholick Senſe, whereof God can never be wanting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he always enlightneth ſome particular Men, to which Illumination Holineſs of Life conduceth very much, and it is the Duty of Divines to continue it in our Mother the Church, which ought to keep within her Bounds; ſo that it is not lawful for Divines to frame ſtrange Doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Faith of Catholick Scripture.</q>
For which End he lays down ſeveral Rules for the Underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He aſſerts that the Scriptures ought to be tranſlated into the vulgar Tongue.

               <p>They object againſt him, that he deſpiſed temporal Things too much, for the Love which he had for thoſe that are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that he join'd himſelf to the Mendicant-Friars, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Poverty, and commending their Perfection. A ſtrange Crime indeed!</p>
               <p>It is a ſurprizing Thing to ſee them accuſe <hi>Wicklef</hi> upon this account; but it is no leſs aſtoniſhing to hear them aſſert, that he had great inclination for the Begging-Friars: to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Falſity whereof, we need only read the complaint he made to the Parliament, and his Treatiſe againſt the Order of Begging-Friars.</p>
               <p>He held, ſay they, that Church-men ought to beg.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary, he maintained that God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Beggary, in the Old and New Teſtament. See the fifth Chapter of his Book againſt the Order of Friars Mendic.</p>
               <p>They accuſe him for condemning lawful Oaths.</p>
               <p>But this is for want of having read his Works; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Latin <hi>Expoſition of the third Commandment,</hi> and by his Book <hi>of the Truth of Scripture,</hi> that he condemns all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Equivocations, and ambiguous Expreſſions, whether with Oaths or without.

               <head>CHAP. XXV. That the Doctrine of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it continued there till the Reformation.</head>
               <p>WHatever Perſecutions have been exerciſed againſt the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> by their Enemies, yet we are not to think that they were ever utterly deſtroy'd. We find that this Perſecution continued in a manner without Interruption, until the time of the Reformation. <hi>Friſon,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Spondanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> reports, that that Biſhop found a Church of them in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains, where they had found a ſafe Retreat from the Violence of their Perſecutors, and where they liv'd apart by themſelves.</p>
               <p>We find the ſame thing alſo in <hi>Spain,</hi> where they ſpread themſelves in great Numbers. I grant indeed that there they were very cruelly perſecuted under the Reign of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> whoſe Edicts againſt them, and the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> are ſtill to be ſeen: but their Calamities were doubled upon them after the Inquiſition was ſet up, which was not long before the middle of the 13<hi>th</hi> Century.</p>
               <p>But with all this, it was thought neceſſary to employ the Pen againſt them, as well as Fire and other Torments. This appears from the Writings of <hi>Lucas Tudenſis,</hi> who wrote under <hi>Gregory</hi> IX, and under his Succeſſor, and who jumbles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds them with other Hereticks, and with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> to countenance the Method of the Inquiſition, and to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize their bloody Executions. It appears from the Writings of this <hi>Lucas Tudenſis,</hi> that they diſputed vigorouſly againſt moſt of thoſe Articles which we find fault with in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that to convince them, they were obliged to uſe other Methods than thoſe of Diſputing, that is, direct Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50988:136"/>
which indeed they employ'd in very good earneſt; and we perceive by <hi>Emericus</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>The Directory of the Inquiſitors,</hi> that they ſpared neither Craft not Cruelty to ſurprize them, and bring them to Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rainaldus</hi> tells us, that in the year 1344, one <hi>John du Moulin</hi> Inquiſitor of the Province of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> proſecuting the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> violently that were ſetled there, they retired from thence, ſome into <hi>Bearn,</hi> and others into <hi>Arragon,</hi> where they were perſecuted at the Sollicitation of this Inquiſitor, who made the Biſhop of <hi>Pampelona</hi> take up Arms to ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>But yet after all this, we find that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd there, and gave no ſmall Trouble to the Inquiſitors. We have an illuſtrious Teſtimony hereof in the Work of a Friar Inquiſitor, of the Order of <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who wrote in the year 1461, his <hi>Fortalitium Fidei</hi>; In the 11<hi>th</hi> Book, which he entitles,<note place="margin">Pag. 82, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>De Bello Haereticorum,</hi> he ſets down theſe Hereſies, which he afterwards refutes.</p>
               <p>The third Hereſy is, that which ſome Enemies of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity do profeſs, who pretend, that Confeſſion has no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its own to procure the Remiſſion of his Sins to any Man. This they prove after this following Manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt; They ſay it is clear, that when God pardons Sin, he doth it not with any reſpect to the Merit of any Man, but of meer Grace; whence it follows evidently, that the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins cannot be attributed to a Man's confeſſing of them; for if it were ſo, we muſt own that the Remiſſion is no longer of Free-gift, but that it is a Recompence given by God to the Merit of him that confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly; They ſay, if it be Confeſſion that procures a Man the Pardon of his Sins, what will become of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the third Chapter of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where it is expreſly declared, <hi>That God hath ſaved us of his Mercy, and not according to the Works of Righteouſneſs that we have done?</hi> Or, how ſhall we explain that in the ninth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> That <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy?</hi> We know, that the firſt Grace that God works in us, is the Remiſſion of Sins: now if this Grace be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50988:136"/>
the Effect of the Mercy of God, it cannot be the Effect of Confeſſion, which by Conſequence is not neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>And having thus endeavoured to defend their Opinion by Reaſon, they endeavour alſo to back it by the Authority of the Fathers, and quote St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who ſaith upon <hi>Luke, St.</hi> Peter <hi>wept, becauſe his Sorrow was ſo great, that it did not permit him to ſpeak; we find that he wept, but not that he ſaid any thing; I read his Tears, but I find nothing of his Confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Hereſy is of thoſe who acknowledg that we ought to confeſs, but add, that we are not to confeſs to Man. What need is there, <hi>ſay they,</hi> to confeſs to a Man, now under the Covenant of Grace, ſeeing that even under the Law it was ſufficient to confeſs to God, by a ſingle Act of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They alledg alſo the Authority of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who ſaith, upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, It is not ſaid, that you need publiſh what your Sins are to the World, neither need you accuſe your ſelf before all Mankind; you are only enjoined to practiſe the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of</hi> David <hi>in the</hi> 136<hi>th</hi> Pſalm, <hi>That you ſpread all the Parts of your Life in the Preſence of God, that you confeſs to him who is your true Judg, and that you rather expreſs your Repentance by the ſecret Groans of your Conſcience, than by the abundance of Words: this is the true way to obtain Grace from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They make uſe alſo of another Paſſage of the ſame Father, where he ſaith, <hi>If thou deſireſt to have thy Sins blotted out, confeſs them; but if thou beeſt aſhamed to diſcover them to any Body, repeat them every Day in the ſecret of thine Heart: It is not neceſſary to tell them to Men, they might, it may be, afterwards reproach thee with them, but declare them rather to God, who only can give thee ſuch a Remedy as thou wanteſt; and though thou ſhouldeſt not confeſs them to him, yet he ſtill ſees thee, he was preſent, and look'd upon thee whilſt thou didſt commit them.</hi> From all which he concludes, <hi>That we ought to confeſs our Sins only to God.</hi> And this deteſtable Hereſy, which is practiſed in ſecret Aſſemblies, hath already infected a great number of People.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Hereſy is of thoſe, who maintain that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to confeſs to a Prieſt, when a Man can confeſs himſelf to a Layman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:50988:137"/>The ſeventh Hereſy is, That we ought to obey none but God alone. This is the Error of a certain Arch-Heretick called <hi>Waldo,</hi> from whom the Hereticks that we now call <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> derive their Name. This miſerable Wretch without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent from God, took upon him of his own Head to form a new Sect; and without the Permiſſion of any Biſhop, without Inſpiration, without Knowledg or Learning, ſet up for a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; ſo that we may well ſay of him, as <hi>Alanus</hi> doth in his Book againſt Hereticks, that he is a wiſe Man without Reaſon, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet without a Viſion, an Apoſtle without being ſent, and a Doctor who never had Inſtruction. See here how his Followers undertake to defend his Hereſy.
<q>We ſee, <hi>ſay they,</hi> in the 5<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking to the Scribes and Phariſees, tell them, <hi>Judg ye-whether it be reaſonable to obey you rather than God,</hi> and not to do what he commands us, becauſe you forbid us?</q>
Moreover, theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks maintain,
<q>That if we obey a Man, when we ought not to obey him, we commit a Sin, becauſe then we don't obey God: <hi>Samuel, ſay they,</hi> ſaith to <hi>Saul,</hi> in the 15<hi>th</hi> of the 1<hi>ſt</hi> Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>Diſobedience (or Rebellion) is as the Sin of Witchcraft:</hi>
                  </q>
Now he that addicts himſelf to Witchcraft, doth in a manner renounce God; but he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to obey a Man, doth not therefore commit the Sin of Witchcraft, which Sin is not committed but where a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to obey God. We ought therefore to obey God and not Man, becauſe in diſobeying Man we are not guilty of that Sin, but only when we diſobey God.</p>
               <p>The eighth Hereſy is what theſe ſame <hi>Waldenſes</hi> profeſs, that ſuppoſing we ought to obey any Man, it muſt be ſuch a Man as is not under Sin himſelf, and that good Prieſts only have the Power of binding and looſing. This alſo was one of the Errors of <hi>John Havel,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Wicklef,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who amongſt many others which he taught, maintained, that a temporal Lord, a Biſhop or Prelate, have no Authority as long as they are under mortal Sin. And he hath been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by another Fox, who aſſerted the ſame thing, <hi>John Huſs</hi> a <hi>Bohemian</hi>; and by another Viper, <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were both of them condemned for Hereticks in the Council
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50988:137"/>
held at <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the Year 1414, in the Preſence of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> V. They ſay therefore that we ought to be obedient to good Prelats, that is to ſay, to thoſe who are no leſs Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles in their Lives and Converſation, than in their Charge and Function; but as for thoſe whoſe Life and Converſation has nothing in it Apoſtolical, they are Hirelings, and no true Shepherds: They endeavour to ſupport this their Error firſt, by the Words of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Book of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
<q>That God pardons Sins either immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by the Members of his Dove, and that the Saints can either abſolve us of our Sins, or retain them.</q>
He ſaith alſo upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſpeaking of the Plate of Gold, which was to be always upon the Fore-head of the High Prieſt:
<q>This Plate was the Teſtimony of a good Life, and that he only who hath the Teſtimony of a good Life, not in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but in Truth and Reality, can forgive Sins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe St. <hi>Gregory</hi> declares,
<q>That they only in this World have the Power of binding and looſing, ſo as the Apoſtles had, who retain their Doctrine, and imitate their Examples.</q>
And <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaking of the Power of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſaith, That the ſame is alſo granted to thoſe who imitate him, becauſe all thoſe that follow the Foot-ſteps of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> can alſo lawfully bind and looſe. Laſtly, It is ſaid in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>I will curſe your Bleſſings</hi>: And in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 13. <hi>Wo to thoſe that quicken the dead Souls, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thoſe dead that don't die.</hi> If God, ſay the Hereticks, do curſe the Bleſſing of wicked Paſtors, and declares that the Souls which they pretend to quicken, do not live; how can he communicate his Grace through their Channel?</p>
               <p>The ninth Hereſy is profeſſed by the ſame Hereticks, who maintain that it is neither the Office nor the Order, but only the Merit of a good Life, which confers the Power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing, of conſecrating and bleſſing; ſo that this is their Concluſion, the Merit of a good and holy Life, <hi>ſay they,</hi> is of greater Efficacy to confer upon any one the Right of conſecrating and bleſſing, of binding and looſing, than the Order or Office: and therefore they have not received any Orders; yet they believe themſelves to be juſt, and to have
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50988:138"/>
the Merits of the Apoſtles, and ſo they take upon them to bleſs as the Prieſts do, and ſay, That they can conſecrate, bind and looſe; becauſe it is the Merit and not the Office that confers this Power. And becauſe they pretend to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Vicegerents, they ſay, that their Merit, gives them this Charge. In this it is that they chiefly oppoſe the Faith of the Church, and declare themſelves to be Hereticks. But they endeavour to defend their Hereſy, by the Authority of <hi>Eſicius,</hi> who ſaith, That the Prieſts do not bleſs by their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only becauſe they repreſent Jeſus Chriſt; and that it is becauſe Chriſt is in them, that they can beſtow their plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Benediction. And they ſay, moreover, that not only a Prieſt, but every one that hath Chriſt in himſelf, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him in his Life, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, has the Power of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>The tenth Hereſy is likewiſe taught by the ſame Hereticks, who maintain that the Diſpenſations or Indulgences which a Biſhop grants at the Conſecration of a Church, or upon any other occaſion, are not of any Value. Their Reaſon is this; Suppoſe, ſay they, that a Man be obliged to a Penance of three Years, at the Conſecration of a Church, and one Biſhop releaſes him of a third part of his Penance; a ſecond and third Biſhop may do the like, and thus for three Half-pence a Man ſhall be releaſed of this three Years Penance: And which is more, theſe ſorts of Diſpenſations are unjuſt, for there is no Proportion between a Half-penny or a Crown, and one whole Years Penance.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Hereſy is, That the Prayers which are made for the Dead, by thoſe who are in any mortal Sin, are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For, <hi>ſay theſe Hereticks,</hi> how can theſe Prayers do any Service to the Dead, ſince they can do none at all to thoſe who make them? Can Prayers which are hurtful to them that make them, be of any Advantage to the Perſon for whom they are deſigned? <hi>Item, in</hi> 3 <hi>q. in gravioribus,</hi> it is ſaid, When a Judg is ſollicited for his Favour to a Malefactor, by any one that he hath no liking to, it ſerves only to incenſe him ſo much the more, and to make him pronounce a more ſevere Sentence: So in like manner, if any Man prays without
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50988:138"/>
Devotion, it is the ſame thing as if he deſired his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; for how can any Man whoſe very Prayer is Sin, obtain by that Prayer any good thing for his Neighbour? Or, how can he whoſe Prayer deſerves nothing at the Hand of God but Puniſhment, pray profitably for another, ſeeing God ſaith to the Sinner, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or why doſt thou take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</hi> They call alſo Reaſon to their Aſſiſtance; When a Prieſt, <hi>ſay they,</hi> celebrates the Maſs, he being in mortal Sin, the Action that he doth is evil, and deſerves eternal Puniſhment, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he cannot merit for another the Pardon of his Sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible to merit Good and Evil, Reward and Puniſhment by the ſelf-ſame Action. They quote the Canon-Law alſo, which forbids us to aſſiſt at the Maſs of a Prieſt, who we are ſure keeps a Concubine. They prove likewiſe by another Authority, that Men ought not to pray or ſing Pſalms in the Church, as long as they are under mortal Sin.</p>
               <p>The twelfth Hereſy is of thoſe who deny Purgatory, and who ſay that it is a meer Invention of the Church to make the People give Alms and Offerings, and to be at the charge of pompous Funerals for the Souls of the deceaſed, or other things of that Nature.</p>
               <p>I confeſs he does not mention the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> by Name, and that he confounds theſe pretended Hereſies of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> with others that are much more hainous, and ſome that were peculiar to ſome few Monks, and that he attributes ſome of them in particular to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> as if they had been proper to them only.</p>
               <p>But one may juſtly imagine that this Monk, who compiled this Work from the Writings of other Monks or Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had his Eye upon the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> becauſe he acquaints us that he follows <hi>Alanus,</hi> and that he copies his Arguments. Now we know that <hi>Alanus</hi> wrote againſt the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as the manuſcript Titles of his Books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, though like the Author of the <hi>Fortalitium fidei,</hi> he confounds them in his Treatiſe with the <hi>Arians, Manichees,</hi> and other pernicious Hereticks, to render the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſuſpected of defending all thoſe Hereſies which he oppoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:50988:139"/>It may be thought ſtrange perhaps that this Monk did not imitate <hi>Alanus,</hi> in attributing to the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> the rejecting of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Conſequents thereof; but the Wonder will ceaſe, if we conſider, that he deſigned hereby to deprive the Jews, againſt whom he diſputes, of an Advantage which they might reaſonably draw from ſome Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting that Opinion, though they owned Jeſus Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the Books of the New Teſtament to be of Divine Authority at the ſame time; and therefore he rather choſe to refute the Arguments againſt Tranſubſtantiation, as coming from the Mouths of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than as Objections made by the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, except the tenth Argument of the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tranſubſtantiation, which ſuppoſes the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who teach this Doctrine to be no better than brute Beaſts, as not having Senſe enough to know that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> being a <hi>Jew</hi> by Birth, could not by the Circumſtances of his Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, intend any thing but a figurative meaning, as oppoſed to a real, and that his Apoſtles being <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe, could not form any other meaning in all this Ceremony, but ſuch as was figurative; there is ſcarce any other which this Monk hath not borrowed from the Diſputes which the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> and <hi>Vaudois</hi> have held with thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party.</p>
               <p>We cannot but look upon <hi>Petrus Oxonienſis,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> in the Year 1479, as a Diſciple of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> in divers Points, eſpecially thoſe nine Concluſions which this Author was forced to retract by <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV<hi>th</hi>'s Order, who authorized the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> to condemn them. Any Man that reads theſe nine Propoſitions which <hi>Caranza</hi> ſets down,<note place="margin">Caranza, pag. 880, <hi>and</hi> 881.</note> would think that it was only theſe Opinions that offenced the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi>; but if we will but read the Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV,<note place="margin">De Haereſibus, lib. 4. voce confeſſio, p. 310.</note> which has been publiſhed by <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro,</hi> we ſhall find that this Doctor oppoſed many other Points of Popery: The Pope's Words which are very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable are theſe. <hi>Et alias propoſitiones, quas propter earum enormitatem, ut illi qui de eis notitiam habent obliviſcantur earum, &amp; qui de eis notitiam non habent, ex praeſentibus, non inſtruantur in eis, ſilentio praetermittendas duximus.</hi>
                  <q>And there are other Propoſitions,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50988:139"/>
which are of ſo foul a Nature, that we think it convenient to paſs them over in ſilence, that ſo thoſe who know them, may forget them, and thoſe that do not know them, may not be inſtructed in them by theſe our Letters.</q>

                  <p>THeſe are the Remarks I thought fit to make upon the Hiſtory of the Churches of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Reader will own that I have deduced their Succeſſion from the Apoſtles, and their Independence on the See of <hi>Rome</hi> with care enough, tho the Barbarity of the Enemies of the Truth, has done its utmoſt Endeavours to aboliſh all the Monuments, which theſe illuſtrious Witneſſes of it had left in theſe Dioceſſes.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I believe, that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> will have any pretence for the future, to accuſe them of <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> nor to reproach the Proteſtants, that they can find no other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in Antiquity, but a parcel of Men, whoſe Doctrine and Lives were equally execrable. Nothing but a Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with ſuch a Rage and Fury as produc'd thoſe <hi>Cruſades,</hi> can obſtinately maintain ſuch horrid Calumnies, after all that we have here alledged for their Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>I might perhaps have been more particular in the Accounts which I have given of the bad Conſtruction the Inquiſitors have put upon their Belief; but beſides, that I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered the Injuſtice of theſe Miniſters of Hell; who is there amongſt the Proteſtants, nay amongſt the very Papiſts themſelves, that is not fully convinc'd of the Iniquity and profound Malice of theſe Hearts of Tygers; who under the name of Defenders of the Chriſtian Faith, have rack'd their Brains to blacken the moſt innocent Lives of the moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50988:140"/>
Chriſtians; and who have made it their Diverſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate them by the moſt diſmal Torments?</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> may write as long as he pleaſes to maintain theſe diabolical Calumnies: I am perſuaded, that if any equitable Members of his Communion will take the pains to compare the Carriage of the Heathens towards the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, with the Behaviour of his Church under <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> III, and <hi>Gregory</hi> IX, againſt the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>; and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> ſlandered and perſecuted by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Condition of the Primitive Church, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and ſlandered by the Heathens, they will find it as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to look upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Daughter of the Primitive Church, as it will be eaſy for them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> as the genuine Off-ſpring of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I did not think it neceſſary for my Deſign, to tie my ſelf Step by Step to every particular, which I might juſtly have found fault with in the Book where the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> handles the Hiſtory of the <hi>Albigenſes:</hi> It is an endleſs Labour to trace a Man that follows falſe Guides, and who hath nothing new beſides the Art and turn of Expreſſion: and becauſe the naked Truth hath always the better of Works of this nature, it is ſufficient to ſet it in a clear Light, for the extinguiſhing that falſe Luſtre which Men beſtow upon Lies, by Ornaments put upon them only to hide their Deformity.</p>
                  <p>And it is my Hope after all, that as God hath illuſtriouſly diſplayed the Care of his Providence, in raiſing the Church of <hi>Piedmont</hi> from thoſe Ruins, under which the Spirit of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution thought for ever to have buried it; ſo he will be pleaſed to vouchſafe the ſame Protection to thoſe deſolate Flocks, whom the Violence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to diſſemble their Faith, by making a Show of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, to avoid the Extremities of their Perſecution.</p>
                  <p>One would think that that God, who hath wrought ſo many Wonders for their Preſervation, ſo many Ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and who even then, when they ſeem'd reduc'd to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50988:140"/>
nothing by the bloody Vigilance of the Inquiſitors, who Age after Age have gleaned this Field, after the barbarous Rage of the Cruſades was over, ſhould be unwilling to ſuffer this oppreſſed Light to be wholly extinguiſhed, but that he will make theſe his Witneſſes riſe from their Graves, now after the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſignaliz'd her Joy for their Death and Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>God of his great Mercy be pleaſed to reſtore to theſe afflicted Flocks the ſame Joy and the ſame Comfort which their Anceſtors felt at the time of the Reformation, when they gave ſuch publick Evidence of their Zeal, and entred by Crowds into the Boſom of the Reformed Church, whoſe Principles they had maintained ſo many Ages before the Reformation; and to open the Eyes of their Perſecutors, giving them Grace to acknowledg, that they fight againſt God, whilſt they ſtrive to force Mens Conſciences, and to engage the People to own that Religion as Divine, which is only the Product of human Policy, the very Sink of the Corruptions of theſe laſt Times, and the Off-ſpring of the Spirit of Error.</p>
