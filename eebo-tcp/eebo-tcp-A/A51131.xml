            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Expedition Your MAJESTY Undertook into <hi>England,</hi> to Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue these Nations from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, and those Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Invasions that were made
<pb facs="tcp:47044:3"/>
on our Religion, Laws, Rights and Liberties, was an Action in it Self so <hi>Great,</hi> and of such Immense Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to our Distressed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that 'tis Impossible to give it a Representation so <hi>Glorious</hi> as it Deserves. Of all Your Majesty's Kingdoms, none was more Sensible of the Happy Effects thereof, than Your <hi>Kingdom of Ireland,</hi> which from the Depth of Misery and Despair, is Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by your Majesty to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous and Flourishing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And we presume most humbly to Implore the Continuance of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Graces to us, by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb facs="tcp:47044:3"/>
and Defending those <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> which we have Enjoy'd under the Crown of <hi>England</hi> for above Five Hundred Years, and which some of late do En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Violate. Your most Excellent Majesty is the <hi>Common Indulgent Father</hi> of all your Countries; and have an <hi>Equal</hi> Regard to the <hi>Birth-Rights</hi> of all Your <hi>Children;</hi> and will not permit the <hi>Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> because the <hi>Strongest,</hi> to Encroach on the Possessions of the <hi>Younger:</hi> Especially considering with what Duty, Loyalty, and Filial Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we have ever behav'd our selves to Your Majesty:
<pb facs="tcp:47044:4"/>
Insomuch that I take leave to Assert, That Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty has not in all Your Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions a People more <hi>United</hi> and <hi>Steady</hi> to Your Interests, than the <hi>Protestants of Ireland:</hi> Which has manifestly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in all our Actions and Parliamentary Proceedings, since Your Majesty's Happy Accession to the Throne. To Relieve the Distress'd, has ever been the Peculiar <hi>Character</hi> of Your Majesty's <hi>Glorious Family.</hi> The <hi>United Provinces</hi> have found this in Your <hi>Famous Ancestors:</hi> And all <hi>Europe</hi> has been Sensible of this in Your <hi>Royal Person.</hi> To this End more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb facs="tcp:47044:4"/>
You came into these Kingdoms, as Your Majesty has been pleas'd to Declare: And as You have Establish'd the <hi>Rights and Liberties of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on a Foundation that, we hope, can <hi>never be shaken;</hi> So we doubt not but Your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty will have a Tender Care of Your Poor <hi>Subjects of Ireland,</hi> who are <hi>Equally</hi> Your Subjects, as the rest of Your People.</p>
            <p>Pardon, I most Humbly beseech Your Majesty, my Presumption, in Appealing to You on this Occasion: Nothing but the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> of the Subject, can
<pb facs="tcp:47044:5"/>
Excuse my Boldness herein: But if That be Consider'd, it Deserves the Regard of the <hi>Greatest Prince;</hi> 'Tis no less than the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> of one of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, on which their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, their Property, their <hi>All</hi> Depends; and which they have Enjoyed for Five Hundred Years past. This, I think, I have clearly shewn in the following Leaves: I am sure, if my <hi>Management</hi> thereof, were suitable to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of our Cause, our <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>England</hi> can no longer Doubt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47044:5"/>
At Your Majesty's Feet therefore, I throw it; and with it the Unworthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof,</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I Have nothing to Offer in this Preface, more than to let the Reader know, how</hi> Unconcern'd <hi>I am in any of those Particular Inducements, which might</hi> seem
<pb facs="tcp:47044:7"/>
               <hi>at this Iuncture to have Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd the following Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have not any Concern in</hi> Wooll, <hi>or the</hi> Wooll-Trade. <hi>I am no wise Interested in the</hi> Forfeitures, <hi>or</hi> Grants. <hi>I am not at all Solicitous, whether the</hi> Bishop, <hi>or</hi> Society <hi>of</hi> Derry <hi>Recover the Land they Contest about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that, I think, I am as</hi> Free <hi>from any</hi> Personal Prejudice <hi>in this Cause, as 'tis possible to Expect any Man should be, that has an</hi> Estate <hi>and</hi> Property <hi>in this Kingdom, and who is a</hi> Member of Parliament <hi>there in. I hope therefore 'tis a</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:47044:7"/>
Principle <hi>that has mov'd me to this Undertaking: I am sure, I am not Conscious to my Self of any other Intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have heard it has been said, That perhaps I might run some</hi> Hazard <hi>in Attempting this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; But I am not at all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of any such Danger: We are in a Miserable Condition indeed, if we may not be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to</hi> Complain, <hi>when we think we are Hurt; and to give our Reasons with all</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty <hi>and</hi> Submission. <hi>But were it otherwise, it would not in the least Affect, or Discourage me in an Attempt, where I think my Cause Good, and my Country</hi>

            <p>I HAVE ever been se <note place="margin">Introduction, and Occasion of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</note> fully perswaded of the strict Justice of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> that I could never think that any of Their Proceedings, which might seem to have the least Tendency to Hardship on their Neighbours, could arise from any thing but want of Due Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and a right State of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47044:10"/>
Business under their Consideration. The want of which, in Matters wherein another People are chiefly Concern'd, is no Defect in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> but is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blameable in the Persons whose Affair is Transacting, and who permit that Illustrious Body of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators to be Mis-inform'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them that Light that might Rectifie them.</p>
            <p>I could never Imagine that those Great <hi>Assertors</hi> of their <hi>Own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> could ever think of making the least Breach in the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> unless they thought that they had <hi>Right</hi> so to do; and this they might well surmise, if their Neighbours quietly see their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures Invaded, without <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulating</hi> the Matter at least, and shewing Reasons, why they may think that Hardships are put upon them therein.</p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof has Excited me to undertake this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, which I do with all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Diffidence of my own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and with the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

Respect and Deference to that August Senate.

            <p>If what I Offer herein seems to carry any Weight, in relation to my own Poor Country, I shall be abundantly happy in the Attempt: But if after all, the Great Council of <hi>England</hi> Resolve the contrary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

By Letters Patents he granted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to all his Subjects through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Dominions, to Assist the said Prince to Recover his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

            <p>I come now to Enquire into our Second Particular proposed, <hi>Viz.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd.</note> Whether <hi>Ireland</hi> might be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be <hi>Conquer</hi>'d by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, or by any other Prince in any succeeding Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And here we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by <hi>Conquest,</hi> an <hi>Acquisition of a Kingdom by Force of Arms, to which, Force likewise has been Opposed,</hi> if we are to understand Conquest in any other sense, I see not of what Use it can be made against <hi>Irelands</hi> being a Free Country. I know <hi>Conquestus</hi> signifies a Peaceable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, as well as an Hostile
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47044:15"/>
Subjugating of an Enemy. <hi>Vid. Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Glos.</hi> And in this sense <hi>William</hi> the First is call'd the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi> and many of our Kings have used the Epocha <hi>post Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum.</hi> And so likewise <hi>Henry</hi> the Second stiled himself <hi>Conquestor &amp; Dominus Hiberniae;</hi> but that His Conquest was no violent Subjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kingdom, is manifest from what foregoes: For here we have an Intire and Voluntary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all the Ecclesiastical and Civil States of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. without the least Hostile Stroke on any side; We hear not in any of the Chronicles of any Violence on either Part, all was Transacted with the greatest Quiet, Tranquility, and Freedom, imaginable. I doubt not but the Barbarous People of the Island at that time were struck with Fear and Terror of King <hi>Hen.</hi> Il's Powerful Force which he brought with him: but still their Easie and Voluntary Submissions Exempts them from the Consequents of an <hi>Hostile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> whatever they are; where there is no Opposition, <hi>such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> can take no place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47044:16"/>
I have before taken Notice of <hi>Henry</hi> the Il's using the Stile of <hi>Conquestor Hiberniae;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will not allow that ever <hi>H.</hi> 2. used this Stile. <hi>Tit. Hon. Par.</hi> 2. G. 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 26.</note> I presume no Argument can be drawn from hence, for <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Country; for we find that many of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have used the Aera of <hi>post Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum; Edward</hi> the Third was the first that used it in <hi>England,</hi> and we frequently meet with <hi>Henricus post Conquestum Quartus,</hi> &amp;c. as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Norman</hi> Invasion of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the First, for a <hi>Conquest.</hi> But I believe the People of <hi>England</hi> would take it very ill to be thought a <hi>Conquer'd Nation,</hi> in the sense that some impose it on <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And yet we find the same Reason in one Case, as in t'other, if the Argument from the King's Stile of <hi>Conquestor</hi> prevail. Nay, <hi>England</hi> may be said much more properly to be <hi>Conquer</hi>'d by <hi>William</hi> the First, than <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: For we all know with what Violence and Opposition from <hi>Harrold,</hi> K. <hi>William</hi> obtain'd the Kingdom, after a Bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel nigh <hi>Hastings.</hi> Whereas <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47044:16"/>
the Second receiv'd not the least Opposition in <hi>Ireland,</hi> all came in Peaceably, and had large Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made them of the like Laws and Liberties with the People of <hi>England,</hi> which they gladly Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, as we shall see hereafter. But I am fully satisfy'd, that neither King <hi>William</hi> the First, in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> II. in his Acquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> obtain'd the least Title to what some would give to <hi>Conquerours.</hi> Tho' for my own part, were they <hi>Conquerours</hi> in a sense never so strict, I should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Prerogative very little or nothing thereby, as shall appear more fully in the Sequel of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>Another Argument for <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's <hi>Hostile Conquest</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> is taken from the Opposition which the Natives of <hi>Ireland</hi> gave to the first Adventurers, <hi>Fitz-Stephens, Fitzgerald,</hi> and <hi>Earl Strongbow,</hi> and the Battles they sought in assisting <hi>Mac-Morogb</hi> Prince of <hi>Leinster,</hi> in the Recovery of his Principality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47044:17"/>
'Tis certain there were some Conflicts between them and the <hi>Irish,</hi> in which the Latter were constantly beaten; but certainly the Conquests obtain'd by those Adventurers, who came over only by the King's <hi>License</hi> and <hi>Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and not at all by his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Command</hi> (as is manifest from the words of the Letters Patents of License recited by <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis, Hib. Expug.</hi> pag. 760. <hi>Edit. Francof.</hi> 1603. <hi>Angl. Norm. Hiber. Camd.)</hi> can never be call'd the Conquest of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second especially considering that <hi>Henry</hi> the Second himself does not appear to have any Design of Coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Obtaining the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, when he gave to his Subjects of <hi>England</hi> this License of Assisting <hi>Mac-Morrogh.</hi> But I conceive rather the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the Stipulations between <hi>Mac-Morrogh</hi> and the Adventurers, and especially between him and <hi>Strongbow,</hi> who was to succeed him in his Principality.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47044:18"/>
From what foregoes, I presume <note place="margin">Suppressing Rebellions, whether a Conquest.</note> it Appears that <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said <hi>so to be Conquer'd</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, as to give the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> any Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over us; it will much more easily Appear, that the <hi>English Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories</hi> in any succeeding <hi>Rebellions</hi> in that Kingdom, give no <hi>Pretence</hi> to a <hi>Conquest:</hi> If every Suppression of a Rebellion may be call'd a <hi>Conquest,</hi> I know not what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will be excepted. The Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in <hi>England</hi> have been frequent; in the Contests between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> one side or other must needs be Rebellious. I am sure the Commotions in King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, are stiled so by most Historians. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence therefore of <hi>Conquest</hi> from <hi>Rebellions,</hi> has so little Colour in it, that I shall not insist longer on it: I know <hi>Conquest</hi> is an hateful word to English Ears, and we have lately seen a Book <note n="*" place="margin">Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Letter.</note> undergo a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere Censure, for offering to broach the <hi>Doctrine of Conquest</hi> in the <hi>Free Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

But, to take off all Pretence from <note place="margin">What Title is obtain'd by Conquest.</note> this Title by <hi>Conquest,</hi> I come in the third Place to enquire, <hi>What Title Conquest gives by the Law of Nature and Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this particular I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <note place="margin">No Title gain'd by an Unjust Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> that if the Aggressor or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulter invades a Nation <hi>Unjustly,</hi> he can never thereby have a Right over the Conquered: This I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will be readily granted by all men: If a Villain with a Pistol at my Brest, makes me convey my Estate to him, no one will say that this gives him any Right: And yet just such a Title as this has an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> Conquerour, who with a Sword at my Throat forces me into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; that is, forces me to part with my <hi>Natural Estate,</hi> and Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, of being govern'd only by Laws to which I give my <hi>Consent,</hi> and not by his Will, or the Will of any other.</p>
            <p>Let us then suppose a <hi>Just</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, <note place="margin">What Title by a Just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> one that has <hi>Right</hi> on his side to Attack a Nation in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile manner; and that those who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47044:19"/>
oppose him are in the <hi>Wrong:</hi> Let us then see what Power he gets, and over whom.</p>
            <p>First, 'Tis plain he gets by his <note place="margin">None over the Assisters in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> Conquest no Power over those who <hi>Conquered with him;</hi> they that fought on his side, whether as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Soldiers or Commanders, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suffer by the Conquest, but must at least be as much Freemen, as they were before: If any lost their Freedom by the <hi>Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> (supposing King <hi>William</hi> the First had <hi>Right</hi> to Invade <hi>England)</hi> it was only the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and not the <hi>Normans</hi> that Conquered with him. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner supposing <hi>Hen.</hi> II. had <hi>Right</hi> to Invade this Island, and that he had been opposed therein by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, it was only the <hi>Antient Race</hi> of the <hi>Irish,</hi> that could suffer by this Subjugation; the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> that came over and Conquered with him, retain'd all the Freedoms and Immunities of <hi>Free-born</hi> Subjects; they nor their Descendants could not in reason lose these, for being Successful and Victorious; for so, the state of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47044:20"/>
               <hi>Conquerours</hi> and <hi>Conquered</hi> shall be equally <hi>Slavish.</hi> Now 'tis manifest that the great Body of the present People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are the Progeny of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> that from time to time have come over into this Kingdom; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but a meer handful of the Antient <hi>Irish</hi> at this day; I may say, not one in a thousand: So that if I, or any body else, claim the like Freedoms with the Natural Born <hi>Subjects of England,</hi> as being Descended from them, it will be impossible to prove the contrary. I conclude therefore, That a <hi>Just Conquerour</hi> gets no Power, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over those who have <hi>Actually Assisted</hi> in that <hi>Unjust</hi> Force that is used against him.</p>
            <p>And as those that joyned with <note place="margin">None over the Non-Opposers</note> the Conquerour in a Just Invasion, have lost no Right by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; so neither have those of the Country who <hi>Oppos'd him not:</hi> This seems so reasonable at first Proposal, that it wants little Proof. All that gives Title in a <hi>Just</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, is the <hi>Opposers</hi> using <hi>Brutal Force,</hi> and quitting the Law of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47044:20"/>
Reason, and using the Law of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; whereby the Conquerour is entitled to use him as a <hi>Beast;</hi> that is, Kill him, or Enslave him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us consider what <note place="margin">Just Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intitled to the Lives of the Opposers.</note> Power that is, which a <hi>Rightful Conquerour</hi> has over the Subdued <hi>Opposers:</hi> And this we shall find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends little farther than over the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Conquer'd;</hi> I say, <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther</hi> than over their Lives; for how far it extends to their <hi>Estates,</hi> and that it extends not at all to Deprive their <hi>Posterity</hi> of the <hi>Freedoms</hi> and <hi>Immunities</hi> to which all <hi>Mankind</hi> have a <hi>Right,</hi> I shall shew presently. That the <hi>Just Conquerour</hi> has an Absolute Power over the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Conquer'd, appears from hence, Because the Conquer'd, by putting themselves in a <hi>State of War</hi> by using an Unjust Force, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>forfeited</hi> their <hi>Lives.</hi> For quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Reason,</hi> (which is the Rule between Man and Man) and using <hi>Force</hi> (which is the way of <hi>Beasts)</hi> they become liable to be destroy'd by him against whom they use <hi>Force,</hi> as any savage wild <hi>Beast</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47044:21"/>
that is Dangerous to his Being.</p>
            <p>And this is the Case of <hi>Rebels</hi> in a settled Commonwealth, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Lives on this Account. But as for forfeiting their Estates, it depends on the Municipal Laws of the Kingdom. But we are now Enquiring what the Consequents will be between two Contesting Nations.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to Consider how far a Just Conquerour has Power over the <hi>Posterity</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> of the Conquer'd.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Posterity,</hi> they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Just Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour how far impower'd over the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of the Opposers.</note> Joyn'd or Assisted in the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Opposition</hi> of the Conquerours <hi>Iust</hi> Arms, can lose no Benefit thereby. 'Tis unreasonable any Man should be punish'd but for his own fault. Man being a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, is only Answerable for his own Demerits; and as it would be highly Unjust to Hang up the Father for the Sons Offence, so the Converse is equally Unjust, that the Son shou'd suffer any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience for the Fathers Crime.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47044:21"/>
A Father hath not in himself a power over the Life or Liberty of his Child, so that no Act of his can possibly forfeit it. And tho we find in the Municipal Laws of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kingdoms, that the Son loses the Fathers Estate for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or other Demerit of the Father, yet this is Consented and Agreed to, for the Publick Safety, and for deterring the Subjects from certain Enormous Crimes that would be highly prejudicial to the Commonwealth. And to such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions the Subjects are bound to submit, having consented to them, tho' it may be unreasonable to put the like in Execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> in the <hi>State of Nature:</hi> For in Settled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, Property in Estates is Regulated, Bounded and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Laws of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, consented to by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so that in these, 'tis no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the Son to lose his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for his Fathers Rebellion or other Demerit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47044:22"/>
If therefore the <hi>Posterity</hi> of the <note place="margin">How far over their Estates.</note> Conquer'd are not to suffer for the Unjust <hi>Opposition</hi> given to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor by their <hi>Ancestors,</hi> we shall find little place for any Power of the Conquerours over the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> of the Subdued. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by his Miscarriages and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence can forfeit but his own Life, he involves not his <hi>Children</hi> in his Guilt or Destruction. His <hi>Goods,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> (that willeth the Preservation of all <hi>Mankind</hi> as far as possible) hath made to belong to his <hi>Children</hi> to sustain them, do still continue to belong to his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, it usually happens that <hi>Damage</hi> attends Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Force; and as far as the <hi>Repair</hi> of this <hi>Damage</hi> requires it, so far the Rightful Conquerour may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Estate</hi> of the Conquer'd; but when this Damage is made up, his Title to the Goods ceases, and the Residue belongs to the <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>It may seem a strange Doctrine, that any one should have a Power over the <hi>Life</hi> of another Man, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47044:22"/>
not over his <hi>Estate;</hi> but this we find every day, for tho' I may <hi>Kill</hi> a Thief that sets on me in the High-way, yet I may not <hi>take away his Money;</hi> for 'tis the <hi>Brutal Force</hi> the Aggressor has used, that gives his Adversary a Right to take away his <hi>Life,</hi> as a noxious Creature. But 'tis only <hi>Damage sustain</hi>'d, that gives Title to another Mans <hi>Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be confess'd that the <note place="margin">Practise of Conquerors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</note> Practice of the World is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and we commonly see the Conqueror (whether <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Unjust)</hi> by the Force he has over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, compels them with a Sword at their Brest to stoop to his Conditions, and submit to such a Government as he pleases to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them. But we Enquire not now, what is the <hi>Practice,</hi> but what <hi>Right there is to do so.</hi> If it be said the Conquer'd sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit by their own <hi>Consent:</hi> Then this allows <hi>Consent</hi> necessary to give the Conquerour a Title to Rule over them. But then we may En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether Promises Extorted by <hi>Force</hi> without <hi>Right,</hi> can be thought <hi>Consent,</hi> and how far they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47044:23"/>
are <hi>Obligatory;</hi> And I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they <hi>Bind not at all.</hi> He that <hi>forces</hi> my Horse from me, ought presently to <hi>Restore</hi> him, and I have still a <hi>Right</hi> to retake him: So he that has <hi>forced</hi> a Promise from me, ought presently to <hi>Restore</hi> it, that is, quit me of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of it, or I may chuse whether I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it or not: For the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> obliges us only by the <hi>Rules</hi> she prescribes, and therefore cannot oblige me by the <hi>Violation</hi> of her Rules; such is the Extorting any thing from me by <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been said, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it pretty clearly appears that an <hi>Unjust</hi> Conquest gives <hi>no Title</hi> at all; That a <hi>Iust</hi> Conquest gives Power only over the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> of the <hi>Actual Opposers,</hi> but not over their <hi>Posterity</hi> or <hi>Estates,</hi> otherwise than as before is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and not at all over those that did <hi>not Concur</hi> in the Opposition.</p>
            <p>They that desire a more full Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of this Matter, may find it at large in an Incomparable <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> concerning the <hi>True Original,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47044:23"/>
               <hi>Extent and End of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Chap. 16. This Discourse is said to be written by my Excellent Friend, <hi>IOHN LOCKE,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be so or not, I know not; This I am sure, whoever is the Author, the Greatest Genius in <hi>Christendom</hi> need not disown it.</p>
            <p>But granting that all we have said in this Matter is <hi>Wrong,</hi> and granting that a Conquerour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Unjust,</hi> obtains an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> Arbitrary <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Persons, Estates, Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of all those whom he finds in the Nation, their Wives, Posterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so as to make perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Slaves</hi> of them and their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come; Let us next Enquire whether <hi>Concessions</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Concessions granted by a Conquerour, whether Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</note> by such a Victorious <hi>Hero,</hi> do not bound the Exorbitancy of his Power, and whether he be not Obliged strictly to Observe these Grants.</p>
            <p>And here I believe no Man of Common Sense or Justice, will Deny it; None that has ever Consider'd the Law of Nature
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47044:24"/>
and Nations, can possibly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate on this matter; the very Proposing it, strikes the Sense and Common Notions of all Men so forcibly, that it needs no farther proof. I shall therefore insist no longer on it, but hasten to consider how far this is the Case of <hi>Ireland:</hi> And that brings me natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the fourth Particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, <hi>vizt.</hi> To shew by Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Records, and History, what Concessions and Grants have been made from time to time to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by what steps the Laws of <hi>England</hi> came to be introduced into this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We are told by <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer <note place="margin">What Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions have been made from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> to <hi>Hen.</hi> III. that <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, a little before he left <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a Publick Assembly and Council of the <hi>Irish</hi> at <hi>Lismore,</hi> did cause the <hi>Irish</hi> to Receive, and swear to be Govern'd by the Laws of <hi>England: Rex Henricus</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>By</hi> Henry II.</note> 
               <hi>antequam ex Hibernia Rediret apud Lismore Concilium Congregavit ubi Leges Angliae sunt ab omnibus gratan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receptae, &amp; Iuratoriâ cautione prestitâ Confirmatae,</hi> Vid. Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ad An. 1172. Vit. H. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47044:24"/>
And not only thus, but if we <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Irish</hi> Modus Tenendi Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentum.</note> may give Credit to Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> in the 4th Instit. Cap. 1. and 76. and to the Inscription to the <hi>Irish Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> it will clearly Appear, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Second did not only settle the the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Jurisdiction Eclesiastical there, by the <hi>Voluntary Acceptance</hi> and <hi>Allowance</hi> of the Nobility and Clergy, but did likewise Allow them the Freedom of <hi>Holding of Parliaments</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and distinct Kingdom from <hi>England;</hi> and did then send them a <hi>Modus</hi> to Direct them how to Hold their Parliaments there. The Title of which <hi>Modus</hi> runs thus: <q>Henricus Rex Angliae Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questor &amp; Dominus Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mittit hanc formam Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitibus, Baronibus, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciariis, Vicecomitibus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus, Praepositis, Ministris &amp; omnibus. Fidelibus suis Terrae Hiberniae Tenendi Parliamentum.<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47044:25"/>
                  <hi>In primis Summonitio Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amenti praecedere debet per Quadraginta Dies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And so forth.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Modus</hi> is said to have been sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Hen.</hi> II. for a Direction to Hold their Parliaments there. And the sense of it agrees for the most part with the <hi>Modus Tenendi Parl.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> said to have been Allowed by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour;</hi> when he obtain'd that Kingdom; where 'tis alter'd, 'tis only to fit it the better for the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well the Antiquity of this <hi>Modus,</hi> so said to be Transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Hen.</hi> II. is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by some Learned Antiquaries, particularly by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. Hon. Par. 2. <hi>C.</hi> 5. Sect. 26. Edit. Lond.

But on the other hand, my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> in the 4th Instit. pag. 12. and 349. does strenuously As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them both. And the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Learned Dr. <hi>Dopping</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47044:25"/>
of <hi>Meath,</hi> has Published the <hi>Irish Modus,</hi> with a Vindication of its Antiquity and Authority in the Preface.</p>
            <p>There seems to me but two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of any Moment raised by Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> against these <hi>Modi.</hi> The One relates both to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish Modus;</hi> the other chiefly strikes at the <hi>Irish.</hi> He says the Name <hi>Parliament,</hi> so often found in these <hi>Modi,</hi> was not a name for the great Council of <hi>England</hi> known so early as these <hi>Modi</hi> Pretend to. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I am not prepared to Disprove this Antiquary in this Particular: But to me it seems reasonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Imagine that the Name <hi>Parliament,</hi> came in with <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror:</hi> 'Tis a Word per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly French, and I see no reason to doubt it's Coming in with the <hi>Normans.</hi> The other Objection affects our <hi>Irish Modus,</hi> for he tells us, That <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> II's. time, when this <hi>Modus</hi> was pretended to be sent hither, yet we find the Word <hi>Vicecomes</hi> therein. To this I can only Answer, That <hi>Hen.</hi> II.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47044:26"/>
intending to Establish in <hi>Ireland</hi> the English form of Government, as the first, and Chief step thereto, he sent them Directions for Holding of Parliaments, Designing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by degrees and in due time to settle the other Constitutions agreable to the Model of <hi>England.</hi> If therefore <hi>England</hi> had then <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,</hi> we need not wonder to find them named in the <hi>Irish Modus,</hi> tho they were not as yet establish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, for they were designed to be appointed soon after, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Modus</hi> could be put regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in execution; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find them establish'd in some Counties of <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>King Iohns</hi> Time.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Irish Modus</hi> is said to have been in the Custody of Sir <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Preston</hi> of <hi>Clane</hi> in <hi>Ireland, An.</hi> 6. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and by Sir <hi>Iohn Talboi</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under King <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. It was Exemplified by <hi>Inspeximus</hi> under the great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Exemplification was sometimes in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Hackwel of Lincolns</hi> Inn, and by him was Communicated to Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> The Tenor of which Exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion runs thus.</p>

            <p>Now we can hardly think it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, (says the Bishop of <hi>Meath)</hi> that an <hi>Exemplification</hi> could have been made so solemnly of it by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and that it should refer to a <hi>Modus</hi> transmitted into <hi>Ireland</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> II. and Affirm that it was produced before the Lord Lieutenant and Council at <hi>Trym,</hi> if no such thing had been Done: This were to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Truth of all former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47044:27"/>
and Transactions, and make the Exemplification contain an Egregious Falshood in the body of it.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Bishop of <hi>Meath,</hi> in his fore-cited Preface does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he had obtain'd the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Original Record, said by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> to have been in the Hands of Sir <hi>Christopher Preston:</hi> It came to that Learned Prelates Hands amongst other Papers and Manuscripts of Sir <hi>William Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles,</hi> late Attorney General in this Kingdom, who in his Life-time, upon an occasional Discourse with the Bishop concerning It, told him that this Record was bestow'd on him (Sir <hi>W.

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47044:28"/>
Whilst I write this, I have this very Record now before me, from the Hands of the said Bishop of <hi>Meath</hi>'s Son, my Nephew, <hi>Samuel Dopping;</hi> and I must confess it has a Venerable Antient Appearance, but whether it be the True Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Record, I leave on the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced for its Credit by the said Bishop.</p>

            <p>Let us now see by what farther Degrees the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> grew up Conformable to that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Twenty-third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, (which was <note place="margin">King <hi>Iohn</hi> made King of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> within Five years after his Return from <hi>Ireland)</hi> he created his younger Son <hi>Iohn, King of Ireland,</hi> at a Parliament held at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Soon after <hi>King Iohn</hi> being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve Years of Age, came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>Milford</hi> to <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as his Father had formerly done. The <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility and Gentry immediately repaired to him; but being Received by him and his Retinue with some Scorn and Derision, by reason of their long rude Beards, <hi>quas more Patrio grandes habebant &amp; prolixas,</hi> (says <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis, Hib. Expug. Cap.</hi> 35.) they took such Offence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47044:30"/>
thereat, that they departed in much Discontent; which was the occasion of the young Kings stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so short a time in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he did this his first time of being here.</p>
            <p>And here, before we proceed any farther, we shall observe, That <note place="margin">By this <hi>Ireland</hi> made an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute separate Kingdom.</note> by this Donation of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>King Iohn, Ireland</hi> was most eminently set apart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as a <hi>Separate</hi> and <hi>Distinct Kingdom</hi> by it self from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England;</hi> and did so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, until the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Descended and came unto <hi>King Iohn,</hi> after the Death of his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> the First, King of <hi>England,</hi> which was about Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years after his being made King of <hi>Ireland;</hi> during which space of Twenty two years, both whilst his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> the First, were living and Reigning, King <hi>Iohn</hi> made divers Grants and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which are yet in being in this Kingdom; wherein he stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>Dominus Hiberniae,</hi> (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Stile till <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47044:30"/>
time) and in others, <hi>Dominus Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae &amp; Comes Meritoniae.</hi> By which Charters both the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and divers other Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enjoy many Priviledges and Franchises to this day. But after the said Grant of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> neither his Father <hi>Henry</hi> II. nor his Brother King <hi>Richard</hi> I. Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ever stiled themselves, during their Lives, <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for the <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Regality</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> was wholly and separately vested in K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> being absolutely Granted unto him without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. And he being Created King in the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> under the Stile and Title of <hi>Lord of Ireland,</hi> Enjoy'd all manner of <hi>Kingly Iurisdiction, Preheminence,</hi> and <hi>Authority Royal,</hi> belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Imperial State</hi> and <hi>Majesty of a King,</hi> as are the Express words of the <hi>Irish</hi> Statute, 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. c. 1. by which Statute the Stile of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> was changed to that of <hi>Rex Hiberniae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then suppose that <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the First, King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Elder
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47044:31"/>
Brother, had not died without Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, but that his Progeny had sat on the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> in a Continued Succession to this Day: Let us suppose likewise the same of King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Progeny, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Throne of <hi>Ireland;</hi> where then had been the <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or even to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> Certainly no such thing could have been then pretended: Therefore if any such <hi>Subordination</hi> there be, it must arise from something that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>after</hi> the Descent of <hi>England,</hi> to King <hi>Iohn;</hi> for <hi>by</hi> that <hi>Descent England</hi> might as properly be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the converse; <hi>Ireland</hi> being vested in the Royal Person of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> Two and Twenty years before his Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and being a more <hi>Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> than the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> As the English Orators in the Council of Constance, <hi>An.</hi> 1417 <note n="a" place="margin">Seldens Tit.

more is Effected by these Statutes Than that <hi>Ireland</hi> shall not be <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd</hi> or <hi>Separated</hi> from the King of <hi>England,</hi> who cannot hereby dispose of it otherwise than in <hi>Legal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> along with <hi>England;</hi> and that whoever is <hi>King of England,</hi> is <hi>ipso facto King of Ireland,</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Ireland</hi> are oblig'd to Obey him as their Liege Lord.</p>

By what foregoes, I presume it plainly appears, that by three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Establishments under the three first Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> of the <hi>Norman Race,</hi> the <hi>Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People of England, were granted to the People of Ireland.</hi> And that neither of these three Kings Established those Laws in <hi>Ireland</hi> by any <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but by the free <hi>Consent, Allowance</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hen.</hi> II. first introduced the Laws <note place="margin">Recapitula tion.</note> of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assembly of the <hi>Irish</hi> at <hi>Lismore,</hi> and Allowed them the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> to be held in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they were held in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>John</hi> at the <hi>Request,</hi> and by the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Irish,</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to be of Force in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and tho' he did not this till the Twelfth year of his Reign of <hi>England,</hi> yet he did it not as <hi>King of England,</hi> but as <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> For the Crown of <hi>England</hi> came to him by <hi>Descent</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:47044:37"/>
from his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> who had <hi>no Regal Power</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and what his Brother had not, could not descend to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Third in the first year of his Reign gave <hi>Ireland</hi> a <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and in the Twelfth year of his Reign did provide, That all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> should be observ'd in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the Charter granted to the <hi>Irish</hi> by his Father King <hi>Iohn</hi> under his Seal, when he was in that Kingdom, should be kept inviolably.</p>
            <p>And from the Days of these Three Kings, have <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> been both Govern'd by the like Forms of Government under one and the same Supreme Head, <hi>the King of England;</hi> yet so, as both Kingdoms remain'd Separate and Distinct in their several Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions under that <hi>One Head,</hi> as are the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> at this day, without any <hi>Subordination</hi> of the One to the Other.</p>
            <p>It were endless to mention all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47044:38"/>
Records and Precedents that might be quoted for the Establishment of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> I shall therefore enter no farther into that Matter, but therein refer to Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Fourth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</note>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now we Enquire, <hi>What were those Laws of England that became thus Established in Ireland?</hi> Surely we must first reckon the Great <hi>Law of Parliaments,</hi> which <hi>England</hi> so <note place="margin">Law of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</note> justly Challenges, and all <hi>Mankind</hi> have a <hi>Right</hi> to. By the <hi>Law of Parliament,</hi> I mean that Law where by all Laws receive their Sanction, <hi>The Free Debates and Consent of the People, by Themselves, or their Chosen Representatives.</hi> That this was a main Branch of the English Law Established in this Kingdom, and the very Foundation of our Future Legislature, appears manifest from Parliaments being so early con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Precedents express.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> acknowledges one in <hi>Hen.</hi> II's time, <hi>(pag.</hi> 259. against the 4th <hi>Instit.)</hi> but makes a very false
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47044:38"/>
Conclusion, that there appears no Footsteps of a Parliament after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till the third year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Second, because the Acts of that Parliament are the first that are Printed in our Irish Statute-Book: For so we may argue the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> to be of later Date than pretended, when we find the first Printed Acts in <hi>Keeble</hi> to be no older than the 9th of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. Whereas 'tis most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Parliaments have been held in <hi>England</hi> some Ages before that.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Great Law of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Common Law.</note> we may reckon the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whether it relates to Regulating and Setling of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> and Estates in Goods or Land, or to the <hi>Iudiciary</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> parts of the Law, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Process thereof, or to <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> Cases. These surely were all Establish'd in this Country, by the three first Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider the state of <note place="margin">Statute Law.</note> the <hi>Statute Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> under
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47044:39"/>
these three Kings, and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors: For by the Irish Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Submission to, and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> we must repute them to have submitted themselves to these likewise; till a Regular Legislature was Establish'd amongst them, in pursuance of that Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Voluntary Acceptance.</p>
            <p>And here we shall find, that in <note place="margin">Statute-Law of <hi>England</hi> from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conquest to <hi>Hen.</hi> III.</note> those Times, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Conquest to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time inclusive, the Statute-Laws of <hi>England</hi> were very few and slender. 'Tis true, that before the 12th of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. we find amongst the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Historians frequent mention of the Laws of <hi>Edward the Confessor, William the Conquerour, Hen.</hi> I. <hi>Hen.</hi> II. <hi>King Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> III. All which are only <hi>Charters,</hi> or several Grants of <hi>Liberties</hi> from the King; which nevertheless had the force of Acts of Parliament, and laid as great Obligations both upon Prince and People, as Acts of Parliament do at this day: Whereof we may read several Proofs in the <hi>Princes Case, Cook</hi>'s 8th <hi>Report.</hi> But these were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47044:39"/>
only so many <hi>Confirmations</hi> of each other, and all of them <hi>Sanctions of the Common Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People of <hi>England, ab Antiquo Usitatae &amp; comprohatae per totam ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram &amp; in quibus ipsi &amp; eorum Patres nati &amp; nutriti sunt,</hi> as the words of the Manuscript <hi>Chronicle of Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> express it.</p>

               <hi>And in the 10th of</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth, it was Enacted in this Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, That the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made in England should not be of force in this Kingdom, unless they were Allow'd and Publish'd in this Kingdom by Parliament. <hi>And the like Statute was made again in the 29th of</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth. These Statutes are not to be found in the</hi>

Thus far the Note. If we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the frequent Troubles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we shall not wonder that these, and many other Rolls and Records, have been lost in this Kingdom: For from the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1310. through the whole Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Henry</hi> V. and so to the Seventh year of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1428. which is about 118 years, there are not any <hi>Parliament Rolls</hi> to be found, <note n="a" place="margin">Annals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the End of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s <hi>Britan.</hi> Edit. 1637. page 196, 197, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> yet certain it is, that divers Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were held in <hi>Ireland</hi> in those times. <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 160. <hi>Pryn</hi> against the 4th Instit. Chap, 76.</note> The same may be said from <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's coming into <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 1172. to the third year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1310. about 138 years.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be said, That if here were such Statutes of <hi>Ireland</hi> as the said Acts of the 10th of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47044:43"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the 29th of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; As they shew, that the Parliaments of <hi>Ireland</hi> did think that English Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not bind <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet they shew likewise, that even in those days the Parliaments of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did claim this Superiority; or else, to what purpose were the said Acts made, unless in denial of that Claim?</p>
            <p>All which I hope may be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted without any prejudice to the Right of the Irish Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: There is nothing so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as to have one Man claim another Mans Right: And if bare <hi>Pretence</hi> will give a <hi>Title,</hi> no Man is secure: And it will be yet worse, if when another so <hi>Pretends,</hi> and I insist on <hi>my Right,</hi> my Just Claim shall be turn'd to my Prejudice, and to the Disparagement of my Title.</p>
            <p>We know very well that many of the Judges of our Four Courts have been from time to time sent us out of <hi>England;</hi> and some of them may easily be supposed to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47044:43"/>
come over hither <hi>Prepossess'd</hi> with an Opinion of our Parliaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subordinate to that of <hi>England.</hi> Or at least, some of them may be <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> and desirous of full <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> in this Point; and on their Account, and for their Satisfaction, such Acts as aforesaid, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, and Enacted in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But then, God forbid, that these Acts should afterwards be laid hold of to a clear other intent than what they were framed for; and instead of Declaring and Securing our Rights, should give an Handle of Contest, by shewing that our Rights have been question'd of Antient Time.</p>
            <p>In conclusion of all, If this <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been <hi>Doubted</hi> a great while ago, so it has been as great a while ago Strenuously <hi>Opposed,</hi> and Absolutely <hi>Denied</hi> by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And by the way, I shall take Notice, That from whencesoever this Antient <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s <hi>Subordination</hi> proceeded in those days, it did not arise from the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47044:44"/>
it self: For we have not one single Instance of an English Act of Parliament <hi>Expresly Claiming</hi> this Right of Binding us: But we have several Instances of Irish Acts of Parliament, <hi>Expresly Denying</hi> this <hi>Subordination,</hi> as appears by what foregoes.</p>
            <p>Afterwards by a Statute made in <hi>Ireland</hi> the 18th of <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. All the Statutes made in <hi>England</hi> against the <hi>Extortions</hi> and <hi>Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Purveyors,</hi> are Enacted to be <hi>holden and kept in all Points, and put in Execution in this Land of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 32d year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. by a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 'tis Enacted, <hi>That all the Statutes made against</hi> Provisors <hi>to the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>as well in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>as in</hi> Ireland, <hi>be had and kept in force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, in a Parliament at <hi>Drogheda</hi> the 8th of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it was Ratify'd, That the <hi>English</hi> Statute against <hi>Rape,</hi> made the 6th of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47044:44"/>
should be of Force in <hi>Ireland</hi> from the 6th day of <hi>March</hi> last past: <hi>And that from henceforth the said Act, and all other Statutes and Acts made by Authority of Parliament within the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>be Ratify'd and Confirm'd, and Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Authority of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Force and Strength, from the said sixth day of March.</hi> We shall hereafter have occasion of taking farther Notice of this Statute upon another Account.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In a Parliament held at <note place="margin">All English Statutes before the 10th of <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. in force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Irish Stat.</note> And in the 14th year of the same Kings Reign, in a Parliament held at <hi>Tristle-Dermot,</hi> it was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That all Acts of Parliament

            <p>Thus we see by what Steps and Degrees all the Statutes which were made in <hi>England</hi> from the time of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to the 10th of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which did concern the Common Publick Weal, were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, Confirm'd, Allow'd, and Authoriz'd to be of Force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> all which was done by <hi>Assent</hi> of the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ireland</hi> Assembled, and <hi>no Otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall next Enquire, Whether <note place="margin">English Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Common Law in force in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> there are not other Acts of the English Parliament, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>since</hi> the 10th of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which <hi>were</hi> and <hi>are</hi> of Force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tho' not Allow'd of by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in this Kingdom.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47044:45"/>
on of our best Lawyers, <hi>there are divers such;</hi> but then they are only such as are <hi>Declaratory</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Common Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not <hi>introductive</hi> of any <hi>New Law:</hi> For these become of Force by the first <hi>General Establishment</hi> of the <hi>Common Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this Kingdom, under <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; and need no particular Act of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for their Sanction.</p>
            <p>As to those English Statutes <note place="margin">English Acts introductive of a New Law, not of force in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p>I say, <hi>Till of very late years;</hi> for the <hi>Antient</hi> Precedents which we have to the contrary, are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. Amongst many, we shall mention the following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47044:46"/>
In the 21th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th an Act was made in <hi>England</hi> making it Felony in a Servant that runneth away with his Masters or Mistresses Goods. This Act was not receiv'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> till it was Enacted by a Parliament held here in the 33d of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. c. 5. Ses. 1.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. c. 19. there was a Law made in <hi>England,</hi> That all Lords might Distrain on the Lands of them holden, and make their Avowry not naming the Tenant, but the Land. But this was not of force in <hi>Ireland</hi> till En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted here in the <hi>33d</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. C. 1. Ses. 1.</p>
            <p>An Act was made in <hi>England, anno</hi> 31. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. That Joint-Tenents and Tenents in Common should be compelled to make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as Coparceners were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable at Common Law. But this Act was not Receiv'd in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till Enacted here <hi>An.</hi> 33. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VIII. c. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47044:46"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 27. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. c. 10. The Statute for Transferring Uses into Possession was made in <hi>England;</hi> but not admitted in <hi>Ireland</hi> till 10. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Ses. 2.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the English Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 33. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. c. 1. directing how Lands and Tenements may be dispos'd by Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not of force in <hi>Ireland</hi> till 10. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Ses. 2.</p>
            <p>The Act of Uniformity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments was made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the 1st. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 2. but was not establish'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> till the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 2. And so that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 14. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 14. was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> till 17. &amp; 18. <hi>Car.</hi> 2 c. 6.</p>
            <p>The Statute against Wilful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury made in <hi>England</hi> 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 9. was not Enacted in <hi>Ireland</hi> till 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1.</p>
            <p>So the English Act against Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Sorcery made 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 16.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47044:47"/>
And another Act against Forgery 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 14. were neither of them in force in <hi>Ireland</hi> till the <hi>28th</hi> of Her Reign, Cap. 3 and 4.</p>
            <p>The English Statutes against Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates was made the 28th of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 15. but not in <hi>Ireland</hi> till the 12th of King <hi>Iames,</hi> c. 2.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> an Act was made the 27th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 4 against Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conveyances; but it was not in force in <hi>Ireland</hi> till Enacted here the 10th of <hi>Charles,</hi> c. 3. Ses. 2.</p>
            <p>In the 15th year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1st. in a Parliament held at <hi>Dublin</hi> there were Six English Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made Laws of this Kingdom, with such Alterations as best fitted them to the State thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21 <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 14. For pleading the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Issue in Intrusions brought by the King, by Chap. 1. of the Irish Statutes.</p>
            <p>31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 2. For Abridging of Proclamations on Fines, by Chap. 2.

            <p>24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 5. Concerning Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Robber, by Chap. 9.</p>
            <p>There are Six English Statutes likewise passed in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. upon and soon after the Restoration, some of which were not passed into Laws in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till a year, two or three, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: As will appear by consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Statute Books. <note n="a" place="margin">Irish Stat. 13 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 13 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. 14 &amp; 15 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 14 &amp; 15 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 19. 17 &amp; 18 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. 17. &amp; 18 <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.

            <p>And thus I presume we have pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty clearly made out our <hi>Fourth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> forementioned: and shewn plainly <hi>the several steps by which the English form of Government, and the</hi> English Statute Laws <hi>were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this Kingdom;</hi> and that this was wholly by the <hi>Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Parliament,</hi> to which we have had a very <hi>antient Right,</hi> and as full a Right as our next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours can pretend to or challenge.</p>
            <p>I shall now consider the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Difficulties that are mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Objections Answer'd.</note> on this Head drawn from Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and Passages in our Law-Books that may seem to prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47044:49"/>
First 'tis urg'd, That in the Irish <hi>Act concerning Rape</hi> passed <hi>anno</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Objection from the Stat. of Rape.</note> 8 <hi>Edward</hi> 4, c. 1. 'tis expressed, That a Doubt was conceiv'd whether the English Statute of the 6th of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. c. 6. ought to be of force in <hi>Ireland</hi> without a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which shews (as some alledg) that even in those days it was held by some, That an Act of of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> might bind <hi>Ireland</hi> before it be consented to in Parliament here.</p>
            <p>But I concieve this Gloss is rais'd meerly for want of Expressing the Reason of the said Doubt in the Irish Statute of the 8th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. c. 1. which we may reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably judge was this. By the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d. c. 34. a Woman that eloped from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and lived with the Adulterer, or a Wife that being first Ravish'd did afterwards consent, and lived with the Ravisher, she should loose her Dower. This Statute of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> the 2d, was made of force in <hi>Ireland</hi> by an Act passed here
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47044:49"/>
the 13th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d, as we have seen before, pag. 68, 69. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the English Statute of the 6th of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2d. c. 6. there was a farther addition made to the said Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d. to this effect, That a Maiden or Wife being Ravished, and afterwards consenting to the Ravishers, as well the Ravisher as she that was Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished shall be disabled to claim all Inheritance or Dower after the death of her Husband or Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>On this account the Doubt was here raised in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the 8th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. c. 1. Whether this latter English Statute of the 6th of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. c. 6. were not in force in <hi>Ireland</hi> by virtue of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Statute of the 13th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d. which confirmed the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d. c. 34. And for setling this Doubt the said Statute of the 8th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th c. 1. was passed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and we find very good reason for the said Doubt. For the English Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 6th of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. c. 6. contained but a small addition
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47044:50"/>
to the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d c. 34. and we see that even this ad dition it self was judged not to be of force in <hi>Ireland</hi> till Enacted here. For the said Irish Statute of the 8th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. c. 1. makes the said Statute of the 6th of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2d. <hi>c.</hi> 6. of Force in <hi>Ireland</hi> only from the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> then last past.</p>
            <p>'Tis urg'd secondly, That tho' perhaps such Acts of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> which do not <hi>Name Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> shall not be construed to Bind <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet all such English Statutes as <hi>mention Ireland,</hi> either by the <hi>General Words</hi> of <hi>all his Majesty's Dominions,</hi> or by <hi>particularly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are and shall be of Force in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This being a Doctrine first broach'd Directly (as I conceive) by <hi>Will. Hussey,</hi> Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench in <hi>England,</hi> in the first year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh and of late Revived by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> and strongly urged, and much rely'd upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First therefore, As to such Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <note place="margin">Object.

            <p>Of this I shall give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Examples, amongst many others.</p>

And truly I see no more Reason <note place="margin">By the same Reason <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may be bound.</note> for Binding <hi>Ireland</hi> by the English Laws under the <hi>General Words of all his Majesties Dominions or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> than there is for Binding <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the same; for <hi>Scotland</hi> is as much his <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Scots-men</hi> as much his <hi>Subjects</hi> as <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Irish-men:</hi> If it be said, That <hi>Scotland</hi> is an Antient <hi>Separate</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> Kingdom from <hi>England;</hi> I say, So is <hi>Ireland:</hi> The Difference is, <hi>Scotland</hi> continued <hi>separate</hi> from the Kings of <hi>England</hi> till of <hi>late years,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> continued <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from <hi>England</hi> but a very <hi>little while</hi> in the Person of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> before the Death of his Father, and of his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> the First, without issue. But then 'tis to be considered, that there was a <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> or even a <hi>Probability,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi> might have continued <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> even to this very day, if <hi>Richard</hi> the First had left behind him a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Progeny.</p>

Secondly, As to such English <note place="margin">English Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes naming <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> Statutes as particularly <hi>Name Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and are therefore said to be of Force in this Kingdom, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Enacted here; I shall consider only the more <hi>Antient Precedents</hi> that are offered in Confirmation of this Doctrine: For as to those of <hi>later Date,</hi> 'tis these we complain of, as bearing hard on the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of this Country, and the <hi>Rights</hi> of our Parliaments, and therefore <hi>these</hi> ought not to be produced as Arguments against us.

            <p>The <hi>Antient</hi> Precedents of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Statutes, particularly <hi>Naming Ireland,</hi> and said to be made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a Design of Binding <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are chiefly these three:

                  <item>2. <hi>Ordinatio pro Statu Hiberniae,</hi> 17 Edw. 1.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These Statutes, especially the two first, being made for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as their Titles import, have given occasion to think, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> have a <hi>Right</hi> to make Laws for <hi>Ireland,</hi> without the <hi>Consent</hi> of their Chosen <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives.</hi> But if we Enquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this matter, we shall find this Conclusion not fairly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Statutum Hiberniae,</hi> 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. as 'tis to be found in the Collection of English Statutes, is plainly thus: The Judges in <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47044:53"/>
conceiving a Doubt concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances devolved to Sisters or Coheirs, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the younger Sisters ought to hold of the Eldest Sister, and do Homage unto her for their Portions, or of the Chief Lord, and do Homage unto him; therefore <hi>Girald Fitz Maurice,</hi> the then Lord Justice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcht four Knights to the King in <hi>England,</hi> to bring a Certificate from thence of the <hi>Practice</hi> there used, and what was the <hi>Common-Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in that <hi>Case.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. in this his Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate or Rescript, which is called <hi>Statutum Hiberniae,</hi> meerly informs the Justice what the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> was in <hi>England, viz.</hi> That the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to hold of the Chief Lord, and not of the Eldest Sister. And the close of it commands, that <hi>the foresaid Customs that be used within our Realm of</hi> England <hi>in this Case, be Proclaimed throughout our Dominion of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and be there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. Teste meipso apud</hi> Westminst. 9. Feb. <hi>An. Reg.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>From whence 'tis manifest, that this <hi>Statutum Hiberniae</hi> was no
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47044:54"/>
more than a Certificate of what the <hi>common Law of England</hi> was in that Case, which <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Original Compact</hi> was to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by. And shews no more, that therefore the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may bind <hi>Ireland,</hi> than it would have proved, that the Common Wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was subject to <hi>Greece,</hi> if, after <hi>Rome</hi> had received the Law of the <hi>Twelve Tables,</hi> they had sent to <hi>Greece</hi> to know what the Law was, in some Special Case.</p>
            <p>The Statute call'd <hi>Ordinatio pro</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Or dinatio pre Statu Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae.</note> 
               <hi>Statu Hiberniae,</hi> made at <hi>Notingham</hi> the 17th of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and to be found in <hi>Pultons</hi> Collection <hi>pag.</hi> 76. <hi>Edit. Lond.</hi> 1670. was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never Received, or of Force, in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This is Manifest from the very first Article of that Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which Prohibits the <hi>Iustice of Ireland or others the Kings Officers, there to Purchase Land in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or within their respective Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liwicks without the Kings Licence, on pain of Forfeitures.</hi> But that this has ever been Otherwise, and that the Lords Justices, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47044:54"/>
here have Purchas'd Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at their own Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, needs no Proof to those who have the least knowledge of this Country. Nor does it appear by any Inquisition, Office, or other Record, that any one ever Forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Account.</p>
            <p>Moreover this <hi>Ordinatio pro Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Hiberniae,</hi> is really in it self <hi>No Act of Parliament,</hi> but meerly an Ordinance of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as well from the Preamble to the said Ordinance, as from this Observation likewise, That King <hi>Edward</hi> the First held no Parliament in the 17th year of his Reign: Or if this were a Parliament, this <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio pro Statu Hiberniae,</hi> is the <hi>only Act</hi> thereof that is Extant: But 'tis very improbable, that only this <hi>single Ordinance</hi> should Appear, if any such Parliament were call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to the <hi>Staple-Act,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Staple-Act,</note> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. c. 4. which expresly names <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Hussey</hi>'s Opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Case, as we find it in the

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47044:56"/>
the Judges Opinion in the second of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for <hi>within</hi> the Land of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they are all positive, That the Authority of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> will not Affect us. They seem at the utmost reach to extend the Jurisdiction of the English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament over the Subjects of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, only</hi> in relation to their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beyond Seas, out of the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they are the <hi>King of England</hi>'s <hi>Subjects;</hi> but <hi>even This</hi> will Appear Unreasonable, when we consider, that by the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, <hi>Scotland</hi> it self may be bound by English Laws, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Foreign Trade, as they are the <hi>King of Englands Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> The Question is, Whether <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be two Distinct Kingdoms, and whether they have each their Respective Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither of which will be deny'd by any Man: And if so, there can be no Subordination on either side, each is compleat in its own Jurisdiction, and ought not to interfere with t'other in any thing. If <hi>being the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s <hi>Subjects,</hi> be a Reason why
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47044:57"/>
we ought to submit to Laws, (in relation to our Trade abroad, in places where the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> has no Jurisdiction) <hi>which have not receiv'd our Assent;</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> will consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they also are not the King's Subjects, and may therefore (by this way of Reasoning) be bound by Laws which the King may As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign them without their Assent, in relation to their Actions <hi>Abroad</hi> or Foreign Trade: Or whether they had not been Subjects to the <hi>King of France,</hi> had our Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd their Possession of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and there kept the Seat of the Monarchy; and then, had <hi>France</hi> been stronger than <hi>England,</hi> it might seem that the Subjects of these Kingdoms might have been bound by Laws made at <hi>Paris,</hi> without their own Consent. But let this Doctrine never be mention'd amongst the <hi>Free-born</hi> Subjects of these Nations.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>Three Principal</hi> Instances that are usually brought against us, on the Stress that is laid on English Acts of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47044:57"/>
Parliament, particularly <hi>Naming Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been other Statutes <note place="margin">Members from <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> or Ordinances made in <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which may reasonably be of force here, because they were made and Assented to by our own Representatives. Thus we find in the <hi>White Book</hi> of the Exchequer in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the 9th year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First, a Writ sent to his Chancellour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein he mentions <hi>Quaedam Statuta per nos de Assensu Prelatorum Comitum Baronum &amp; Communitates Regni no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri Hiberniae, nuper apud Lincoln &amp; quaedam alia Statuta postmodum apud Eborum facta.</hi> These we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were either Statutes made at the Request of the States of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to <hi>Explain</hi> to them the <hi>Common Law of England;</hi> or if they were introductive of <hi>New Laws,</hi> yet they might well be of force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being Enacted by the Assent of our own Representatives, The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>Ireland;</hi> as the Words afore-mention'd do shew: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, these are Instances so far
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47044:58"/>
from making <hi>against</hi> our Claim, that I think nothing can be more plainly <hi>for</hi> us; for it manifestly shews, that the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> would not Enact Laws to Bind <hi>Ireland,</hi> without the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of the Representatives of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Formerly, When <hi>Ireland</hi> was but thinly Peopled, and the English Laws not fully currant in all parts of the Kingdom, 'tis probable that then they could not frequently Assemble with conveniency or safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make Laws in their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments at home; and therefore during the Heats of Rebellions, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Confusion of the Times, they were forced to Enact Laws in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But then this was always by their proper <hi>Representatives.</hi> For we find that in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, (and by what foregoes, 'tis plain 'twas so in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First's Time) Knights of the Shire, Citizens, and Burgesses, were Elected in the Shires, Cities and Burroughs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to serve in Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and have so served accordingly. For amongst
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47044:58"/>
the Records of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Rot. Claus.</hi> 50. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 2. Membr. 23. We find a Writ from the King at <hi>Westminster,</hi> directed to <hi>Iames Butler,</hi> Lord Justice of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to <hi>R.</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> his Chancellour, requiring them to issue Writs under the Great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the several Counties, Cities and Burroughs, for satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Expences of the Men of that Land, <hi>who last came over to serve in Parliament in England.</hi> And in another Roll the 50th of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. Membr. 19. On Complaint to the King by <hi>Iohn Draper,</hi> who was Chosen Burgess of <hi>Cork</hi> by Writ, and served in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and yet was deny'd his Expences by some of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Care was taken to re-imburse him.</p>
            <p>If from these last mention'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, it be concluded that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi> may <hi>Bind Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> it must also be Allow'd that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> ought to have their <hi>Representatives</hi> in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England.</hi> And this, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we should be willing enough
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47044:59"/>
to embrace; but this is an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we can hardly hope for.</p>
            <p>This sending of Representatives out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> on some occasions, was found in process of time to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Troublesome and Inconvenient; and this, we may presume, was the Reason, that afterwards, when Times were more settled, we fell again into our old Track, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular course of Parliaments in our own Country: and hereupon the Laws afore-noted, pag. 64. were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, Establishing that <hi>no Law made in the Parliament of England, should be of force in Ireland, till it was Allow'd and Publish'd in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have said before, pag. 85. that <note place="margin">Modern Acts of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> naming <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> I would only consider the <hi>more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Precedents</hi> that are offered to prove, That Acts of <hi>England parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Naming Ireland,</hi> should bind us in this Kingdom; and indeed it were sufficient to stop here, for the Reason above alledged. However, I shall venture to come down low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to enquire into the <hi>Modern</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47044:59"/>
Precedents of English Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament alledged against us: But still with this Observation, That 'tis these we <hi>Complain against</hi> as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and therefore they <hi>ought</hi> not to be brought in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against us.</p>
            <p>I do therefore again assert, that before the Year 1641. there was no Statute made in <hi>England</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory of a <hi>New Law</hi> that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the Right which the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> have to make Laws for themselves, except only those which we have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and which we have discuss'd at large, and submit to the Readers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>udgment.</p>
            <p>But in the Year 1641. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, and since that, in King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and again very lately in King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, some Laws have been made in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to be of <hi>Force</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But how this came to pass, we shall now Enquire.</p>
            <p>In the 17th Year of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. <note place="margin">Acts in favour of Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in 1641.</note> which was in the Year 1642. there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47044:60"/>
were three or four Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in <hi>England</hi> for incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging <hi>Adventurers</hi> to raise Money for the speedy suppression of the Horrid Rebellion which broke out in <hi>Ireland</hi> the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1641<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Titles of these Acts we have in <hi>Pulton's Collection of Statutes:</hi> But with this Remark, <hi>That they are made of no Force by the Acts of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement and Explanation</hi> passed in King <hi>Charles</hi> Il's. time in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> So that in these we are so <hi>far</hi> from finding Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for <hi>England</hi>'s Parliament bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they plainly shew, that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> may <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> an Act passed in <hi>England,</hi> in relation to the Affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For 'tis very well known, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were to have Interests and Titles in <hi>Ireland</hi> by virtue of those Acts passed in <hi>England,</hi> are cut off by the <hi>Acts of Settlement and Explanation.</hi> And indeed there is all the Reason in the World that it should be so, and that Acts made in a Kingdom by the Legal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of the People, should take place of those made in another Kingdom. But however, it will be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47044:60"/>
said, that by those Acts 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that <hi>England</hi> did presume they had such a <hi>Right</hi> to pass Acts binding <hi>Ireland,</hi> or else they had ne'er done it. To which I answer, That consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition <hi>Ireland</hi> was in at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> under an horrid <hi>Intestine Rebellion,</hi> flaming in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of the Kingdom; 'twas impossible to have a Parliament of our own; yet it was absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that something should be done towards suppressing the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences then raging amongst us: And the only means could then be practised, was for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to interpose, and do something for our Relief and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; these were the best Assurances could be had at that juncture: But when the Storm was over, and the Kingdom quieted, we see new Measures were taken in a Legal Parliament of our own.</p>
            <p>As to what was done for <hi>Ireland</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> time.</note> in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, besides the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Irregularity of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in those days, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any of them to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47044:61"/>
Precedent in these times; We shall find also that then there were <hi>Representatives</hi> sent out of this Kingdom, who sate in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> which then was <hi>only</hi> the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> We cannot therefore argue from hence, that <hi>England</hi> may bind us; for we see they allow'd us <hi>Representatives,</hi> without which, they rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they could not make Laws <hi>Obligatory</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>I come now to King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2ds time: And in it we shall find the following English Statutes made, in which the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is concerned.</p>
            <p>The first is an <hi>Act against Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cattle Act.</note> 
               <hi>Cattle from</hi> Ireland <hi>or other Parts beyond Seas.</hi> It was only temporary by 18 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 2. but made perpetual 20 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 7. and 32 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 2. This Act, however prejudicial to the Trade that was then carried on between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> does not <hi>properly Bind us,</hi> more than it does any other Country of the World. When any thing is Imported, and Landed in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47044:61"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> it becomes immediately subject to the Laws thereof, so that herein we cannot be said <hi>properly</hi> to be <hi>bound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Acts against Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Tobacco Act.</note> 
               <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> 12 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 34. and 15 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 7. and 22 and 23 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. c. 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do <hi>positively Bind Ireland.</hi> But there has never been an Occasion of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting it here; for I have not heard that a Rood of Tobacco was ever Planted in this Kingdom. But however that takes not off the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation</hi> of the Law: 'Tis only want of our Consent, that I urge against that. I see no more Reason for sending a Force to Trample down an Acre of <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> by these Statutes, than there would be for Cutting down the Woods of <hi>Shelela,</hi> were there an Act made in <hi>England</hi> against our Planting or Having <hi>Timber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Act for Encouraging</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Navigation Act.</note> 
               <hi>Shipping and Navigation, by express name</hi> Mentions and Binds <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by the last Clause in the Act, Obliges all Ships belonging thereto
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47044:62"/>
importing any Goods from our Foreign Plantations, to touch first at <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Acts Prohibiting <note place="margin">Note, Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wooll from <hi>Ireland,</hi> is made penal by the Irish. Stat. 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 2. 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 17. But both these Statutes are obsolete: The like may we observe of the 11 Eliz. c. 10. &amp; 13 El. c. 4.</note> the Exportation of Wooll from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to any Country except to <hi>England,</hi> do likewise <hi>strongly Bind us,</hi> and by the 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 32. it was made highly penal on us, and by the 14th of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 18. 'tis made Felony.</p>
            <p>To these three last Acts, I must confess, I have nothing to urge, to take off their Efficacy; <hi>Name</hi> us they do most certainly, and <hi>Bind</hi> us so, as we do not transgress them. But how <hi>Rightfully</hi> they do this, is the matter in Question. This I am sure of, that before these Acts in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Time, (the Eldest of which is not over Thirty-Seven years) <hi>there is not one positive full Precedent to be met with in all the Statute-Book, of an English Act Binding the Kingdom of Ireland.</hi> And on this Account we may venture to assert, That these are at least <hi>Innovations</hi> on us, as not being warranted by any former Precedents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47044:62"/>
And shall <hi>Proceedings only of Thirty-Seven Years standing,</hi> be urg'd against a Nation, to Deprive them of the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> which they Enjoy'd for Five Hundred Years before, and which were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded without and against their <hi>Consent,</hi> and from that day to this have been constantly complain'd of? Let any English Heart that stands so <hi>Iustly</hi> in Vindication of his own <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this Question, and I have done.</p>
            <p>I am now arriv'd at our Present <note place="margin">English Acts Binding <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> since King <hi>William's</hi> Reign.</note> Days, under the Happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Majesty King <hi>WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM</hi> the Third; and I am sorry to reflect, That since the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in these Kingdoms, when the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> have more strenuously than ever Asserted their own <hi>Rights,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of Parliaments, it has pleased them to bear harder on their Poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, than has ever yet been done in many Ages foregoing. I am sure what was then done by that Wise and Just Body of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47044:63"/>
was perfectly out of Good Will and Kindness to us, under those Miseries which our Afflicted Country of <hi>Ireland</hi> then suffered But I fear some Men have since that, made use of what was then done, to other Purposes than at first intended. Let us now see what that was, and consider the Circumstances under which it was done.</p>
            <p>In the year 1689. when most o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the Protestant Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of that Kingdom by the Insolencies and Barbarities of the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> who were then it Arms throughout the Kingdom and in all Places of Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>Iames,</hi> newly Return'd to them out of <hi>France;</hi> the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge we had to fly to was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where Multitudes continued for many Months, destitute of all manner of Relief, but such as the Charity of <hi>England</hi> afforded, which indeed was very <hi>Munificent, and never to be forgotten.</hi>

The Protestant Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi>

Intituled, <hi>An Act for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Protestant Irish Clergy.</hi> And this was the first Attempt that was made for <hi>Binding Ireland</hi> by an Act in <hi>England,</hi> since his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Happy Accession to the Throne of these Kingdoms.</p>

Neither do we complain, of it, as hindring us from corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding with the King's Enemies, for 'tis the Duty of all Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to abstain from that. But as <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' the King's Subjects, Claims an Exemption from all Laws but what they Assent to in Parliament; so we think this our Right also.</p>

should please God to re-establish us in our own Country: For we well knew our own Constitution under <hi>Poynings Law,</hi> That no Act could Pass in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> till approved of by the King and Privy Council of <hi>England.</hi> And we knew likewise, That all the Lords and others of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Privy Council in <hi>England</hi> are Members of the Lords or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons House of Parliament there. And that by obtaining their Assent to Acts of Parliament in Favour of the Irish Protestants, they had in a manner pre-engaged their Assent to the like Bills when they should hereafter come before them as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellors, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Transmitted to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there to be passed into Laws of that Kingdom. But instead of all this, to meet with another Construction of what was done herein, and to have it pleaded against us as a Precedent of our Submission, and absolute Acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the Jurisdiction of the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> over this Kingdom, is what we complain of as an Invasion (we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47044:65"/>
of that <hi>Legislative Right</hi> which our Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> claims within this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The next Act pass'd in the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament <note place="margin">Act appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing New Oaths</note> of <hi>England,</hi> Binding <hi>Ireland,</hi> is that for <hi>Abrogating the Oath of Supremacy in Ireland, and Appointing other Oaths,</hi> 3 and 4 <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> c. 2. To this the Parliament convened at <hi>Dublin, Anno</hi> 1692. under Lord <hi>Sydney,</hi> and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Anno</hi> 1695. under Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> paid an intire Obedience. And by this ('tis alledged) we have <hi>given up our Right,</hi> if any we had, and have for ever acknowledged our <hi>Subordination to the Parliament of England.</hi> But let us a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the force of this Argument.</p>
            <p>I readily grant, that this and the other fore-mentioned Acts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> since the Revolution, when they were made, were look'd upon highly in our Favour, and for our Benefit; and to them as <hi>such,</hi> we have conform'd our Selves. But then, in all Justice and Equity, our Submission herein is to be deem'd <hi>purely voluntary,</hi> and not at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47044:66"/>
from the <hi>Right</hi> we conclude thereby in the Legislators. If a Man, who has <hi>no Iurisdiction</hi> over me, <hi>command</hi> me to do a thing that is <hi>pleasing</hi> to me, and I do it; it will not thence follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he obtains an <hi>Authority</hi> over me and that ever hereafter I must O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him of <hi>Duty.</hi> If I <hi>voluntarily</hi> give my Money to a Man when <hi>I please,</hi> and think it <hi>convenient</hi> for me; this does not Authorize him at any time to <hi>command</hi> my Money from me when <hi>he pleases.</hi> If it be said, this allows Subjects to Obey only whilest 'tis <hi>convenient</hi> for them. I pray it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether any Men Obey <hi>longer,</hi> unless they be <hi>forced</hi> to it; and whether they will not <hi>free</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from this <hi>Force</hi> as soon as they can. 'Tis impossible to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men from desiring to <hi>free</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from <hi>Uneasiness,</hi> 'tis a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Nature, and cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radicated. If Submitting to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience be a <hi>less</hi> Evil than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Throw it off, Men will Submit. But if the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience grow upon them, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>greater</hi> than the hazard of getting

rid of it, Men will Offer at puting it by, let the Statesman or Divine say what they can.</p>
            <p>But I shall yet go a little further, and venture to Assert, That the Right of being subject <hi>Only</hi> to such Laws to which Men give their <hi>own Consent,</hi> is so inherent to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and founded on such Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Laws of Nature and Reason, that 'tis not to be <hi>Alien'd,</hi> or <hi>Given up,</hi> by any Body of Men whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: For the End of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws being the Publick Good of the Commonwealth, in the Peace, Tranquility and Ease of every Member therein; whatsoever Act is contrary to this End, is in it self void, and of no effect: And therefore for a Company of Men to say, <hi>Let us Unite our selves into a Society, and let us be absolutely Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by such Laws, as such a Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ator, without ever Consulting us, shall devise for us;</hi> 'tis always to be understood, <hi>Provided we find them for our Benefit:</hi> For to say, We will be Govern'd by those Laws, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Good or Hurtful to us,</hi> is absurd in it self: For to what End
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47044:67"/>
do Men joyn in Society, but to avoid Hurt, and the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the State of Nature?</p>
            <p>Moreover, I desire it may be considered, whether the General Application of the Chief part of the Irish Protestants, that were at that time in <hi>London,</hi> to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for obtaining these Laws, may not be taken for their <hi>Consent,</hi> and on that Account, and no other, these Acts may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their <hi>Binding Force.</hi> I know very well, this cannot be look'd upon as a Regular and Formal <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> such as might be requisite at another more favourable Juncture: But yet it may be taken <hi>talis qualis,</hi> as far as their Circumstances at that time would allow, till a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Opportunity might present it self.</p>
            <p>I am sure, if some such Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as these, may not plead for us, we are of all his Majesties Subjects the most Unfortunate: The <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greatest Corroborations
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47044:67"/>
since his Majesties Accession to the Throne; and so have the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the other hand, have received the greatest Weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Reign, by our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (as 'tis alledg'd) to these Laws that have been made for us.</p>
            <p>This certainly was not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Majesty's Glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into these Kingdoms; That, we are told by Himself, (whom we cannot possibly mistrust) was to Assert the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of these Nations; and we do humbly presume that his Majesty will be graciously pleased to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to Enjoy the Benefits thereof.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <note place="margin">The Opinions of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers thereon.</note> 
               <hi>Fourth Article</hi> proposed. As to the <hi>Fifth,</hi> viz. <hi>The Opinions of the Learned in the Laws relating to this Matter;</hi> 'tis in a great measure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd by what I have offered on the Fourth Head; I shall therefore be the more brief thereon. And I think indeed the only Person of Note that remains to be considered
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47044:68"/>
by us, is the Lord Chief Justice <note place="margin">Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi>'s Opinion Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss'd.</note> 
               <hi>Cook,</hi> a Name of great Veneration with the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, and therefore to be treated with all Respect and Deference.</p>
            <p>In his Seventh Report in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case, he is proving that <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Dominion Separate and Divided from <hi>England;</hi> for this he quotes many Authorities <note n="a" place="margin">20 H. 6. 8. Pilkington'<hi>s Case.</hi> 32 H. 6. 25. 20 Eliz. Dyer. 360. Flowd. Com. 360.</note> out of the Year-Books and Reports; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, he has that which I have before mention'd, pag. 91. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. f. 12. which he Transcribes in this manner, <hi>Hibernia habet Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentum, &amp; faciunt Leges,</hi> &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra Statuta non ligant eos, <hi>quia non mittunt Milites ad Parliamentum;</hi> and then adds, in a Parenthesis, <hi>(which is to be understood, unless they be specially named) sed Personae eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sunt subjecti Regis sicut inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes in Calesia, Gasconia, &amp; Guyan.</hi> The first thing I shall observe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the very <hi>unfaithful</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> Citation of this Passage, as will manifestly appear by comparing it with the true Transcript I have given thereof before, pag. 91. Were this all, 'twere in some measure
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47044:68"/>
pardonable. But what cannot be excused, is the Unwarrantable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in his Parenthesis, without the least colour or ground for it in his Text. Herein he concludes down right Magisterially, <hi>So it must be, this is my Definitive Sentence;</hi> as if his <hi>Plain Assertion,</hi> without any <hi>other Reason,</hi> ought to prevail; nay, even point blank against the irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Reason of the Book he quotes. I confess in another place of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case, <hi>viz.</hi> fol. 17. b. he gives this Assertion a Colour of Reason, by saying, <hi>That tho' Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land be a Distinct Dominion from England, yet the Title thereof being by</hi> Conquest, <hi>the same by Iudgment of Law might by Express Words be bound by the Parliaments of England</hi> How far <hi>Conquest</hi> gives a Title, we have Enquired before: But I would fain know what Lord <hi>Cook</hi> means by <hi>Iudgment of Law:</hi> Whether he means the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or of <hi>Nations;</hi> or the <hi>Civil Laws</hi> of our <hi>Commonwealths;</hi> in none of which Senses, I conceive, will he, or any Man, be ever able to make out his Position.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:47044:69"/>
Is the Reason of <hi>England</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not Binding <hi>Ireland, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do not send thither Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives?</hi> And is the Efficacy of this Reason taken off, by <hi>our being Named</hi> in an English Act? Why should sending Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Parliament, Bind those that send them? Meerly because thereby the <hi>Consent</hi> of those that are Bound, is obtain'd, as far as those sort of Meetings can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly permit; which is the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of all Laws. And is <hi>Ireland</hi>'s <hi>being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in an English Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the least step towards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>People of Ireland?</hi> If it be not, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s Parenthesis is to no purpose. And 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to me, that so many Men have run upon this vain Imagination, meerly from the Assertion of this Judge: For I challenge any Man to shew me, that any one <hi>before</hi> him, or any one <hi>since,</hi> but <hi>from him,</hi> has vended this <hi>Doctrine:</hi> And if the <hi>bare Assertion</hi> of a Judge, shall Bind a <hi>whole Nation,</hi> and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47044:69"/>
the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> thereof, We shall make their Tongues very powerful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute them greater Lawgivers than the greatest Senates. I do not see why my <hi>Denying</hi> it, should not be as <hi>Authentick</hi> as his <hi>Affirming</hi> it. 'Tis true, He was a great Lawyer and a powerful Judge; but had no more Authority to <hi>make a Law,</hi> than I or any Man else. But some will say, He was a Learned Judge, and may be supposed to have <hi>Reason</hi> for his Position. Why then does he not give it us? And then what he Asserts would Prevail, not from the <hi>Authority of the Person,</hi> but from the <hi>Force of the Reason.</hi> The most Learned in the Laws have no more power to make or alter a Constitution, than any other Man; And their Decisions shall no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevail, than supported by Reason and Equity. I conceive my Ld. Ch. Justice <hi>Cooke</hi> apply'd himself so wholly to the Study of the <hi>Common Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that he did not enquire far into the <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> if he had, certainly he could never have been Guilty of such an Erroneous Slip;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47044:70"/>
He would have seen demonstrably, that <hi>Consent only</hi> gives Humane Laws their Force, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reason in the Case he quotes is unanswerable, <hi>Quia non mittunt Milites ad Parliamentum.</hi> Moreover, the Assertion of <hi>Cooke</hi> in this point is directly contrary to the whole tenour of the Case which he cites: For the very Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on which the Debate of the Judges did arise, and which they deemed not to be of Force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> particularly names <hi>Ireland.</hi> So that here again Ld. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror appears most plainly. For this I refer to the Report, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly delivered it before pag. 90, 91. By which it appears clearly to be the unanimous Opinion of all the Judges then in the <hi>Exchequer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> That <hi>within the Land of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> have no Jurisdiction, whatever they may have over the Subjects of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the <hi>open Seas:</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is given, <hi>Quia Hibernia non mittit Milites ad Parliamentum in Angliâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:47044:70"/>
This Assertion likewise is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with himself in other parts of his Works. He tells us in his 4th. Inst. pag. 349. <hi>That 'tis plain that not only King</hi> John <hi>(as all Men allow) but</hi> Henry <hi>the Second also, the Father of King</hi> John, <hi>did Ordain and Command, at the Instance of the Irish, That such Laws as had been in</hi> England <hi>should be Observ'd and of Force in</hi> Ireland. <hi>Hereby</hi> Ireland <hi>being of it self a distinct Dominion, and no part of the Kingdom of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>was to have Parliaments hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there as in</hi> England. And in pag. 12. he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>the Second sent a Modus into</hi> Ireland, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them how to hold their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi> But to what end was all this, if <hi>Ireland</hi> nevertheless were subject to the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> The King and Parliaments of these Kingdoms are the supream Legislators; If <hi>Ireland</hi> be subject to Two (its Own, and that of <hi>England)</hi> it has <hi>Two Supreams;</hi> 'tis not impossible, but they may Enact <hi>different or contrary</hi> Sanctions; which of these shall the People O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? He tells us in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Case
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47044:71"/>
fol. 17. b. <hi>That if a King hath a Christian Kingdom</hi> by Conquest, <hi>as</hi> Henry <hi>the Second had</hi> Ireland, <hi>after King</hi> John <hi>had given to them, being under his Obedience, and Subjection, the Laws of</hi> England <hi>for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Country, no succeeding King could alter the same without Parliament.</hi> Which, by the way, seems directly contradictory to what he says concerning <hi>Ireland</hi> six lines below this last cited passage. So that we may observe my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> enormously stumbling at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn in this Point.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <note place="margin">Opinions of other Judges, in Favour of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> Judge; and, in him, with the only <hi>Positive Opinion against us</hi> I shall now consider what our Law-Books offer in our <hi>Favour</hi> on this Point.</p>
            <p>To this purpose we meet a Case fully apposite, reported in the Year-Book of the 20th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, fol. 8. between one <hi>Iohn Pilkington</hi> and one <hi>A.</hi>

and that therefore his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was void, and that the King had granted the said Office to him the said <hi>A.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Pilkington</hi> Demurr'd in Law; and it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the Judges, <hi>Yelverton, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescue, Portington, Markham,</hi> and <hi>Ascough,</hi> whether the said Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in relation to the State and Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be <hi>good</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

But I conceive 'tis so far from proving this, that 'tis very much in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. The Case was briefly thus. The Prior of <hi>Lanthony</hi> brought an Action in the <hi>Com. Pleas</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> against the of Prior <hi>Mollingar,</hi> for an Arrear of an Annuity, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment went against the Prior of <hi>Mollingar;</hi> hereon the Prior of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingar</hi> brought a Writ of Error in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Judgment was affirmed. Then the Prior of <hi>Mollingar</hi> Appeal'd to the Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> held 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. before <hi>Iames Butler</hi> Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and the Parliament Revers'd both Judgments.

               <hi>Bench</hi> refused to intermeddle, <hi>as having no Power over what had pass'd in the Parliament of Ireland.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prior of <hi>Lanthony</hi> Appeal'd to the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> And it does not appear by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Roll <note n="a" place="margin">Rot.

            <p>Now whether this be a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proving the Subordination of our Irish Parliament to that of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> I leave the Reader to judge. To me it seems the <hi>clear contrary.</hi> For first we may observe, the <hi>King's Bench</hi> in <hi>England</hi> absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming any Cognisance of what had passed in the Parliament of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And next we may observe, That nothing at all was done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in upon the Appeal to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England:</hi> Certainly if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had thought themselves to have a Right to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into this Matter, they had so done, one way or t'other, and not left the Matter Undetermin'd</p>

It has ever been acknowledged <note place="margin">Argument from Acts of Succession and Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pass'd in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> that the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably annex'd to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that our Legislature lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by <hi>Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Act,</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. c. 4. makes this Tye between the two Kingdoms indissoluble. And we must ever own it our Happiness to be thus Annex'd to <hi>England:</hi> And that the Kings and Queens of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are by undoubted Right, <hi>ipso facto</hi> Kings and Queens of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And from hence we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that if any Acts of Parliament made in <hi>England,</hi> should be of force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before they are Received there in Parliament, they should be more especially such Acts as relate to the <hi>Succession</hi> and <hi>Settlement of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> of the Kings Title thereto, and the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of the King. And yet we find in the Irish Statutes, 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. c. 2. <hi>An Act for the Succession of the King and Queen Ann;</hi> and another, Chap. 5. declaring the King to be <hi>Supream Head of the Church of Ireland;</hi> both which Acts had formerly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47044:74"/>
pass'd in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> So likewise we find amongst the Irish Statutes <hi>Acts of Recognition of the Kings Title to Ireland,</hi> in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> By which it appears that <hi>Ireland,</hi> tho' Annex'd to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> has always been look'd upon to be <hi>a Kingdom Compleat within it self,</hi> and to have all Jurisdiction to an <hi>Absolute</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom belonging, and Subordinate to no Legislative Authority on Earth. Tho', 'tis to be Noted these English Acts relating to the Succession, and Recognition of the Kings Title, do particularly Name <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p>As the <hi>Civil</hi> State of <hi>Ireland</hi> is <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ireland</hi>'s State Ecclesiastical Independent.</note> thus <hi>Absolute</hi> within it self, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is our State <hi>Ecclesiastical:</hi> This is manifest by the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> and even by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of the <hi>Church of Ireland</hi> which differ in some things from those of the <hi>Church of England</hi> And in all the Charters and Grant of Liberties and Immunities to

               <hi>Ireland,</hi> we still find this, That <hi>Holy Church shall be Free,</hi> &amp;c. I would fain know what is meant here by the word <hi>Free:</hi> Certainly if our <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>Free</hi> and Absolute within it self, our <hi>State</hi> must be so likewise; for how our <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government is now interwoven, every body knows.

            <p>Another Argument against the <note place="margin">Argument from a Record in <hi>Reyley.</hi>
               </note> Parliament of <hi>England</hi>'s Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over <hi>Ireland,</hi> I take from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in <hi>Reyley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> pag. 569. to this effect: <note n="a" place="margin">14 Ed. 2. Par. 2. Memb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21 Int.</note> In the 14th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, the King sent his Letters Patents to the Lord Justice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> leting him know, That he had been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> that he would give Order that the <hi>Irish Natives</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> might enjoy the <hi>Laws of England</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Member,</hi> in as large and ample manner as the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> enjoy'd the same. This therefore the King gives in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47044:75"/>
and orders according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by these his Letters Patents. From hence, I say, we may gather, That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did not then take upon them to have any <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (for then they would have made a Law for <hi>Ireland</hi> to this Effect) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, they Apply to the <hi>King,</hi> that he would interpose his Commands, and give Directions that this great Branch of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should be put in Execution in <hi>Ireland</hi> indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the Kings Subjects there, <hi>pursuant</hi> to the <hi>Original Compact</hi> made with them on their first Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now consider the great <note place="margin">Objection drawn from a Writ of Error.</note> Objection drawn from a <hi>Writ of Error</hi>'s lying from the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> on a Judgment given in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which proves (as 'tis insisted on) that there is a <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> and that if an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> Court of Judicature in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> can thus take cognizance of, and over-rule the Proceedings in the like Court of <hi>Ireland;</hi> it will
<pb facs="tcp:47044:75"/>
follow, that the <hi>Supream</hi> Court of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> may do the same, in relation to the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Court of Parliament in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be confess'd that this has been the constant Practice; and it seems to be the great thing that induced my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> to believe that an Act of Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and mentioning or Including <hi>Ireland,</hi> should Bind here. The Subordination of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he seems to infer from the Subordination of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But to this I answer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That 'tis the Opinion of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned in the Laws of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> That this Removal of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> into the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on an Act of Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is lost amongst a great number of other Acts, which we want for the space of 130 years at one time, and of 120 at another time, as we have noted before,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47044:76"/>
pag. 65. But it being only a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tradition,</hi> that there was such an Act of our Parliament, we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer it as a <hi>Surmise,</hi> the Statute it self does not appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where a Judgment in <hi>Ireland</hi> is Removed, to be Revers'd in <hi>England,</hi> the Judges in <hi>England</hi> ought, and always do judge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not according to the Laws and Customs of <hi>England,</hi> any otherwise than as these may be of Force in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but if in any thing the two Laws differ, the Law of <hi>Ireland</hi> must prevail, and guide their Judgment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Case of one <hi>Kelly,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, one Error was assigned that the <hi>Praecipe</hi> was of <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Underwoods,</hi> which is a manifest Error, if brought in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but the Judges finding the Use to be <hi>Otherwise</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> judged it <hi>No Error.</hi> So in <hi>Crook, Charles,</hi> fol. 511. <hi>Mulcarry</hi> vers. <hi>Eyres.</hi> Error was assigned for that the Declaration was of one hundred
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47044:76"/>
Acres of <hi>Bogg,</hi> which is a word not known in <hi>England;</hi> but 'twas said, It was well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so adjudged <hi>No Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence, I conceive, 'tis manifest, that the Jurisdiction of the Kings Bench in <hi>England,</hi> over a Judgment in the Kings Bench of <hi>Ireland,</hi> does not proceed from any Subordination of one Kingdom to the other; but from some other Reason, which we shall endeavour to make out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have before observed, That in the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Gerald Fitz-Maurice,</hi> Lord Justice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> sent four Knights to know what was held for Law in <hi>England</hi> in the Case of <hi>Coparceners.</hi> The Occasion of which Message (as before we have noted out of the Kings Rescript) was, because the Kings Justice of <hi>Ireland</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what the Law was. We may reasonably imagine that there were many Messages of this kind; for in the Infancy of the English Government, it may well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47044:77"/>
that the Judges in <hi>Ireland</hi> were not so deeply versed in the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> This occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Messages to <hi>England, Before</hi> Judgment given in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be inform'd of the Law. And <hi>After</hi> Decrees made, Persons who thought themselves aggrieved by <hi>Erroneous</hi> Judgments, apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the King in <hi>England</hi> for Redress. Thus it must be, that Writs of Error (unless they had their Sanction in Parliament) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in use. Complaints to the King by those that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves injur'd, increased; and at last grew into Custom, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Force of Law.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be Objected, That if the Judges of the Kings Bench in <hi>England</hi> ought to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Judgment by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it will follow, that this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal which we assign of Writs of Error to <hi>England,</hi> is not right.</p>
            <p>I Answer, That this may be the <hi>Primary Original,</hi> and yet consist well enough with what we have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47044:77"/>
before laid down: For tho' the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> was to be the Common Law of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> at the beginning of its English Government might fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently send into <hi>England</hi> to be inform'd about it; yet this does not hinder, but <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a long Process of Time, may have some smaller Customs and Laws of its own, gradually but insensibly crept into Practice, that may in some measure differ from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Practice of <hi>England;</hi> and where there is any such, the Judges of <hi>England</hi> must regulate their Sentence accordingly, tho' the first Rise of Writs of Error to <hi>England,</hi> may be as we have here suggested. In like manner, where the Statute-Law of <hi>Ireland</hi> differs from that of <hi>England,</hi> the Judges of <hi>England</hi> will regulate their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Statute-law of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> This is the constant Practice, and notoriously known in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall:</hi> From which it appears, that removing a Judgment from the Kings Bench of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Kings Bench of <hi>England,</hi> is but an Appeal to the King in his Bench
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47044:78"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> for his Sense, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Exposition of the Laws of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Kings Bench of <hi>England,</hi> Suit is made to the <hi>King only;</hi> The Matter lies <hi>altogether before Him;</hi> and the Party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining applies to <hi>No Part</hi> of the Political Government of <hi>England</hi> for Redress, but to the <hi>King of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land only,</hi> who is in <hi>England:</hi> That the <hi>King only</hi> is sued to, our Law-Books make Plain. This Court is call'd <hi>Curia Domini Regis,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Regia,</hi> because the King used to sit there in Person, as <hi>Lambard</hi> tells us; And every Cause brought there, is said to be <hi>coram Domino Rege,</hi> even at this very day, <hi>Cooke</hi> 4 Inst. p. 72. Therefore if a Writ be returnable <hi>coram nobis ubicunque fuerimus,</hi> 'tis to be Return'd to the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> But if it be Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>coram Iusticiariis nostris apud Westm.</hi> 'tis to be Return'd into the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> This Court (as <hi>Glavnil</hi> and other Antients tells us) used to Travel with the King,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47044:78"/>
where-ever he went. And <hi>Fleta,</hi> in describing this Court, says, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Rex Curiam suam &amp; Iusticiarios suos, coram quibus, &amp; non alibi nisi coram semet ipso,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>falsa Iudicia &amp; Errores revertuntur &amp; Corriguntur.</hi> The King then (as <hi>Britton</hi> says) having Supream Jurisdiction in his Realm, to judge in all Causes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; therefore it is, that <hi>Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Iudgments</hi> were brought to him out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But this does not argue that <hi>Ireland</hi> is therefore <hi>Subordinate to England;</hi> for the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the King to whom they Appeal. And 'tis not from the <hi>Country</hi> where the Court is held, but from the <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the King (to whom the People of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have as good a Title as the People of <hi>England)</hi> that the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of the Iurisdiction</hi> does flow, And I question not, but in former times, when these Courts were first Erected, and when the King Exerted a greater Power in Judicature than he does now, and he used to sit in his own Court, that if he had Travell'd into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Court had follow'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47044:79"/>
him thither; Erroncous Judgments might have been removed <hi>from England</hi> before him <hi>into his Court in Ireland;</hi> for so certainly it must be, since the Court Travell'd with the King. From hence it appears, that all the Jurisdiction, that the Kings Bench in <hi>England,</hi> has over the Kings Bench in <hi>Ireland,</hi> arises <hi>only</hi> from the <hi>Kings Presence</hi> in the former. And the same may be said of the <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> if it will assume any Power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as <hi>Lambard</hi> says, p. 69, 70.) The Chancery did follow the <hi>King,</hi> as the Kings Bench did; and that, as he tells us out of the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Scroope,</hi> the <hi>Chancery</hi> and the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> were once but one Place. But if this be the ground of the Jurisdiction of the Kings Bench in <hi>England</hi> over the Kings Bench in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as I am fully perswaded it is) the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England</hi> cannot from hence claim any Right of Jurisdiction in <hi>Ireland,</hi> because they claim <hi>a Iurisdiction of their own;</hi> and their Court is not the <hi>Kings Court,</hi> in that <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>strict</hi> sence that the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47044:79"/>
But granting that the <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the <hi>Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ying on a Judgment in the <hi>former.</hi> I see no Reason from thence to conclude, that therefore the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> is <hi>Subordinate</hi> to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England,</hi> unless we make any <hi>one sort</hi> of Subordination, or in any <hi>one part</hi> of Jurisdiction, to be a Subordination in <hi>all Points,</hi> and all parts of Jurisdiction. The Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> may Appeal to the King in his Bench in <hi>England,</hi> for the <hi>Expounding</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Statute-Law of <hi>Ireland;</hi> will it therefore follow that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> shall make <hi>New Laws</hi> to bind the Subjects in <hi>Ireland?</hi> I see no manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in it; unless we take <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Old Laws,</hi> (or <hi>Laws alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made) in the-Kings Bench,</hi> and <hi>making New Laws in Parliament,</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same thing.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the best Logician in <hi>Europe</hi> will hardly make a Chain of <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms,</hi> that from such <hi>Premises,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:47044:80"/>
will regularly induce such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To close this Point, We find that a Judgment of the Kings Bench in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be Removed by a Writ of Error to the Parliament in <hi>Ireland:</hi> But the Judgment of the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> was never question'd in the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> This Appears from the <hi>Prior of Lanthony</hi>'s Case afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this our Fifth Article with a memorable Passage <note place="margin">Declaration in the Irish Act of Faculties.</note> out of our Irish Statutes, which seems to strengthen what we have delivered on the Business of a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> as well as the chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I drive at; and that is 28 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. Chap. 19. <hi>The Act of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi> This Statute is a Recital at large of the English Act of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. c. 21. In the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of which English Act 'tis De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That this Your Graces Realm Recognizing no Superiour but Your Grace, hath been and yet is free from any Subjection to any Mans Laws, but only such as have been Devised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>

               <hi>Reasons and Arguments that may be be farther Offered on one side and t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Debate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have before taken notice of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>England</hi>'s Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Ireland</hi> by Purchase.</note> Title <hi>England</hi> pretends over us from <hi>Conquest:</hi> I have likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the <hi>Precedents</hi> on one side and t'other, from <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> from <hi>Records,</hi> and from <hi>Reports</hi> of the Learned in the Laws. There remains another Pretence or two for this <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be Considered; and one is founded on <hi>Purchase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis said, That vast Quantity of Treasure, that from time to time has been spent by <hi>England</hi> in Reducing the Rebellions and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> has given them a just <hi>Title</hi> at least to the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Inheritances</hi> of the Rebels, and to the absolute Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal thereof in their Parliament; And as particular Examples of this,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47044:81"/>
we are told of the great Sums Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by <hi>England</hi> for suppressing the Rebellion of the Irish Papists in 41. and Opposing the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion since King <hi>WILLIAM</hi>'s Accession to the Throne.</p>
            <p>To this I Answer, That in a War there is all Reason imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Estates of the Unjust Opposers should go to repair the the Damage that is done. This I have briefly hinted before. But if we consider the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we shall perceive they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the common Case of Wars between two Foreign Enemies; Ours are rather Rebellions, or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Commotions;</hi> that is, The <hi>Irish Papists</hi> rising against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and then 'tis plain, that if these Latter, by the Assistance of their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> and their Purse, do prove Victorious, the People of <hi>England</hi> ought to be fully Repaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But then the manner of their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in what way it shall be Levied, ought to be left to the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> in Parliament Assembled: And so it was after
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47044:82"/>
the Rebellion of 41. The <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers</hi> then were at vast Charges, and there were several Acts of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> made for their Re-imbursing, by disposing to them the Rebels Lands. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it was thought Reasonable that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> should do this in their own way; and therefore the <hi>Acts of Settlement</hi> and <hi>Explanation,</hi> made all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer English Acts of <hi>No Force;</hi> or at least did very much <hi>Alter</hi> them in many Particulars, as we have Noted before. In like manner we allow that <hi>England</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid all their Expences in supres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this late Rebellion: All we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire is, That, in Preservation of our own Rights and Liberties, we may do it in our own Methods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly in our own Parliament: And if the Re-imbursement be all that <hi>England</hi> stands upon, what avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it whether it be done this way or that way, so it be done? We have an Example of this in Point between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> in the Glorious Revolution under His Present Majesty: <hi>Holland</hi> in Assisting <hi>England</hi> Expended 600000
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47044:82"/>
Pounds, and the English Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fairly repay'd them: It would have look'd oddly for <hi>Holland</hi> to have insisted on Disposing of Lord <hi>Powis's</hi> and other Estates, by their own Laws, to re-imburse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Ungenerous thing to vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie good Offices, I am far from doing it, but with all possible Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude Acknowledge the Mighty Benefits <hi>Ireland</hi> has often receiv'd from <hi>England,</hi> in helping to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Rebellions of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ry; To <hi>England</hi>'s Charitable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance our Lives and Fortunes are owing: But with all humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, I desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether <hi>England</hi> did not at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he same time propose the <hi>Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Danger,</hi> that would necessarily have attended our Ruine; if so, 'twas in some measure their <hi>own Battels</hi> they fought, when they fought for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and a great part of their Expence must be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd in their <hi>own Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing alledged against <hi>Ireland</hi> is this: If a Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47044:83"/>
as <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> for instance, <note place="margin">Object. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Trade, therefore to be Bound.</note> prove prejudicial to <hi>England,</hi> in its Trade, or any other way; <hi>England,</hi> if it be stronger, redresses it self by Force of Arms, or Denouncing War; and why may not <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Ireland</hi> lies cross their Interests, restrain <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bind it by Laws, and maintain these Laws by Force?</p>
            <p>To this I answer: First, That it will hardly be instanced, that any Nation ever Declared War with another, meerly for over-topping them in some signal Advantage, which otherwise, or but for their Endeavours, they might have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <hi>War</hi> only is Justifiable for <hi>Injustice</hi> done, or <hi>Violence</hi> offer'd, or <hi>Rights</hi> detain'd. I cannot by the Law of Nations, quarrel with a Man, because he, going before me in the Road, finds a Piece of Gold, which possibly, if he had not taken it up, I might have light upon and gotten. 'Tis true, we often see Wars commenced on this Account <hi>under-hand,</hi> and on Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Trade and Riches; but then this is never made the <hi>Open Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47044:83"/>
some other <hi>Colour</hi> it must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or else it would not look <hi>fair;</hi> which shews plainly, that this Pretence of <hi>being Prejudicial,</hi> or of reaping Advantages which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you might partake of, is not <hi>Iustifiable</hi> in it self. But granting that it were a good Justification of a War with a <hi>Foreign</hi> Nation, it will make nothing in the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> for if it did, why does it not operate in the same manner between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and consequently in like manner draw after it <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s binding <hi>Scotland</hi> by their Laws at <hi>Westminster:</hi> We are all the <hi>same</hi> Kings Subjects, the Children of one <hi>Common Parent;</hi> and tho' we may have our <hi>Distinct</hi> Rights and Inheritances absolutely within our selves; yet we ought not, when these do chance a little to interfere to the prejudice of one or t'other side, immediately to treat one another as Enemies; fair Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Propositions should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and when these are not hearkened to, then 'tis time enough to be at Enmity, and use Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:47044:84"/>
The last thing I shall take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>a</hi> Colony.</note> of, that some raise against us, is, That <hi>Ireland</hi> is to be look'd upon only as a <hi>Colony</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And therefore as the <hi>Roman Colonies</hi> were subject to, and bound by, the Laws made by the <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> so ought <hi>Ireland</hi> by those made by the <hi>Great Council</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi> Of all the Objections raised against us, I take this to be the most Extravagant; it seems not to have the least <hi>Foundation</hi> or <hi>Colour</hi> from <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Record:</hi> Does it not manifestly appear by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that 'tis a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Kingdom</hi> within it self? Do not the Kings of <hi>England</hi> bear the <hi>Stile of Ireland</hi> amongst the rest of their Kingdoms? Is this Agreeable to the nature of a <hi>Colony?</hi> Do they use the Title of Kings of <hi>Virginia, New-England,</hi> or <hi>Mary-Land?</hi> Was not <hi>Ireland</hi> given by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second in a Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> to his Son <hi>Iohn,</hi> and made thereby an <hi>Absolute King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, separate</hi> and wholly <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> on <hi>England,</hi> till they both came United again in him, after the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47044:84"/>
Death of his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue? Have not multitudes of Acts of Parliament both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> declared <hi>Ireland a Compleat Kingdom?</hi> Is not <hi>Ireland</hi> stiled in them All, the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>Ireland?</hi> Do these <hi>Names</hi> agree to a <hi>Colony?</hi> Have we not a Parliament, and Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Do these <hi>things</hi> agree with a <hi>Colony?</hi> This on all hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves so many Absurdities, that I think it deserves nothing more of our Consideration.</p>
            <p>These being the only remaining Arguments that are sometimes mention'd <hi>Against us,</hi> I now proceed to offer what I humbly conceive <hi>Demonstrates</hi> the Justice of our Cause.</p>
            <p>And herein I must beg the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Patience, if now and then I am forced lightly to touch upon some Particulars foregoing. I shall Endeavour all I can to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix Repetitions; but my Subject requires that sometimes I just men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or refer to, several Notes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:47044:85"/>
First therefore, I say, <hi>That</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>should be Bound by Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made in</hi> England, <hi>is against Reason, and the Common Rights of all Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Men are by Nature in a state <note place="margin">Against the Rights of Mankind.</note> of Equality, in respect of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Dominion: This I take to be a Principle in it self so evident, that it stands in need of little Proof. 'Tis not to be conceiv'd, that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the same Species and Rank, promiscuously born to all the same Advantages of Nature, and the use of the same Faculties, should be Subordinate and Subject one to another; These to this or that of the same Kind. On this Equality in Nature is founded that Right which all Men claim, of being free from all Subjection to Positive Laws, till by their own <hi>Consent</hi> they give up their Freedom, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Civil Societies for the common Benefit of all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. And on this <hi>Consent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Consent only gives Law force.</note> depends the <hi>Obligation</hi> of all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws;</hi> insomuch that without it, by the Unanimous Opinion of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47044:85"/>
all <hi>Iurists,</hi> no Sanctions are of any <hi>Force.</hi> For this let us Appeal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many, only to the <hi>Iudicious</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccles. Polity,</hi> Book 1. Sec. 10. <hi>Lond.</hi> Ed it. 1676. Thus He.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Howbeit, Laws do not take their Constraining force from the Quality of such as Devise them, but from that Power which doth give them the strength of Laws. That which we spake before, concerning the Power of Government, must here be applied to the Power of making Laws whereby to Govern, which Power God hath over All; and by the Natural Law, whereunto he hath made all subject, the Lawful Power of making Laws, to command whole Politick Societies of Men, belongeth so properly unto the same entire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate, of what kind soever upon Earth, to exercise the same of himself,</hi> and not either by express Commission <hi>immediately and personally receiv'd from God,</hi> or else by Authority derived at the first from their <hi>Consent,</hi> upon whose Persons they impose Laws, <hi>it is no better than meer Tyranny. Laws they are not therefore, which</hi> Publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47044:86"/>
               <hi>hath not made so:</hi> But Approbation not only they Give, who Personally declare their <hi>Assent by Voice, Sign, or Act; but also when others do it in their Names,</hi> by Right Originally, at the least, derived from them: <hi>As in Parliaments, Councils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Sith Men Naturally have no full and perfect Power to command whole Politick Multitudes of Men; therefore utterly without our Consent, we could in such sort be at no Mans Commandment living. And to be commanded we do consent, when that Society whereof we are part, hath at any time before consented, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the same after by the like Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Agreement. Wherefore as any Mans Deed past is good, as long as himself continueth, so the Act of a Publick Society of Men, done five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years sithence, standeth as theirs who presently are of the same Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, because Corporations are Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; we were then alive in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, and they in their Successors do still live. Laws therefore Humane of what kind soever, are available by Consent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:47044:86"/>
And again, <hi>But what matter the Law of Nations doth contain, I omit to search; the strength and vertue of that Law is such, that no particular Nation can lawfully prejudice the same by any their several Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, more then a Man by his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Resolutions the Law of the whole Commonwealth or State wherein he liveth; for as Civil Law being the Act of a whole Body Politick, doth therefore over-rule each Civil part of the same Body; so there is no Reason that any one Commonwealth of it self, should to the Prejudice of another, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate that whereupon the whole World hath Agreed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the same purpose may we find the Universal Agreement of all Civilians, <hi>Grotius, Puffendorf, Lock</hi>'s <hi>Treat. Government,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No one or more Men, can by <hi>Nature</hi> challenge any <hi>Right, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Freedom,</hi> or any Ease in his <hi>Property, Estate</hi> or <hi>Conscience,</hi> which all other Men have not an <hi>Equally Iust Claim to.</hi> Is <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Free</hi> People? So ought <hi>France</hi> to be. Is <hi>Poland</hi> so? <hi>Turky</hi> likewise, and all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47044:87"/>
the <hi>Eastern Dominions, ought</hi> to be so: And the same runs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Race of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Against the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which are of Force both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the <hi>Original Compact</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted. It is Declared by both Houses of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> cap. 1. <hi>That in the High Court of Parliament, all the whole Body of the Realm, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member thereof, either in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or by Representation (upon their own Free Elections) are</hi> by the Laws of this Realm <hi>deem'd to be Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally present.</hi> Is this then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England,</hi> and the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of every Free-born English Subject? And shall we of this Kingdom be deny'd it, by having Laws imposed on us, where we are neither Personally, nor Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively present? My Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> in his 4th Inst. cap. 1. saith, That <hi>all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and all the Commons of the whole Realm, ought</hi> ex Debito Justiciae <hi>to be Summon'd to Parliament, and none of them ought to be Omitted.</hi> Hence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47044:87"/>
it is call'd <hi>Generale Concilium</hi> in the Stat. of <hi>Westminst.</hi> 1. and <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi> because it is to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all Persons and Estates in the whole Kingdom. And this is the very Reason given in the Case of the <hi>Merchants of Waterford</hi> forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, why Statutes made in <hi>England,</hi> should not bind them in <hi>Ireland, Quia non habent Milites hic in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamento;</hi> Because they have no <hi>Representatives</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> My Lord <hi>Hobbard</hi> in the Case of <hi>Savage</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it for Law, That whatever is against Natural Equity and Reason, is against Law; Nay, if an Act of Parliament were made against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Equity and Reason, that Act was void. Whether it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Equity and Reason, that a Kingdom regulated within it self, and having its own Parliament, should be Bound <hi>without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> by the Parliament of another Kingdom, I leave the Reader to consider. My Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> likewise in the first Part of his Institutes, fol. 97. b. saith, <hi>Nihil quod est contra Rationem est Licitum.</hi> And in the old <hi>Modus Tenendi Parliamenta</hi> of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47044:88"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> said to be writ about <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Confessor</hi>'s time, and to have been Confirmed and Approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>William the Conqueror:</hi> It is expresly declared, That all the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses ought to be</hi> summoned to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This might as well have been done, and again undone, when they please, by a single Act of the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Parliament.

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Had the King or his Council of <hi>England,</hi> in the 10th year of <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. in the least dreamt of this Doctrine, to what end was all that strict Provision made by <hi>Poyning</hi>'s <hi>Act,</hi> Irish Stat. cap. 4. That no Act of Parliament should pass in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before it was first Certified by the Chief Governour and Privy Council here, under the Broad Seal of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the King and his Privy Council in <hi>England,</hi> and received their Approbation, and by them be remitted hither under the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> here to be pass'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law? The design of this Act, seems to be the Prevention of any thing passing in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland Surreptitiously,</hi> to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>English Interest</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But this was a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47044:90"/>
needless Caution, if the King, and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> had Power at any time to revoke or annul any such Proceedings.

            <p>Sixthly, It is <hi>against the Kings</hi>

            <p>Seventhly, It is <hi>against the Practice</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Against the Practice of former Ages.</note> 
               <hi>of all former Ages.</hi> Wherein can it appear, that any Statute made in <hi>England,</hi> was at any time since the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, allowed and put in practice in the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by what foregoes, that from the Twentieth of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to the Thirteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and from thence to the Eighteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and from thence, to the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Second of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and from thence, to the Eighth of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, and from thence, to the Tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, there was special care taken to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> (such of them as were necessary or convenient for this Kingdom) by degrees, and always with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And since the <hi>General Allowance,</hi> of all

the English Acts and Statutes in the Tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, there have several Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were made in <hi>England</hi> in the Reigns of all the Kings from that Time, Successively to this very Day, been particularly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by Parliament in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and so they become of force here, and not by reason of any <hi>General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive</hi> words, as some Men have lately fancied.

They are Men of <hi>Great Wisdom, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Iustice:</hi> and know how to prevent all future <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</hi> We have heard Great Out-cries, and deservedly, on Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> and other Stipulations; How far the Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Constitution, which has been of Five Hundred years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exceeds that, I leave the World to judge. It may perhaps be urg'd, That 'tis <hi>convenient</hi> for the State of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Supream Council</hi> thereof should make their Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

as <hi>Large</hi> as they can. But with Submission, I conceive that if this <hi>Assumed Power</hi> be not <hi>Iust,</hi> it cannot be <hi>convenient</hi> for the State. What <hi>Cicero</hi> says in his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Nihil est Utile, nisi idem sit Honestum,</hi> is most certainly true. Nor do I think, that 'tis any wise <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Assert</hi> this High Jurisdiction over <hi>Ireland.</hi> For since the Statutes of this Kingdom are made with such <hi>Caution,</hi> and in such <hi>Form,</hi> as is prescribed by <hi>Poyning's Act</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and by the 3d and 4th of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> and whilest <hi>Ireland</hi> is in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish hands,</hi> I do not see how 'tis possible for the Parliament of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to do any thing that can be in the least <hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>England.</hi> But on the other hand, If <hi>England assume</hi> a <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby they think their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> are <hi>taken away; That their Parliaments are rendred meerly nugatory,</hi> and that their Lives and Fortunes Depend on the Will of a <hi>Legislature</hi> wherein they are <hi>not Parties;</hi> there may be ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this. <hi>Advancing</hi> the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> by

               <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> may in time have ill Effects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rights of Parliament</hi> should be preserved <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Inviolable,</hi> wherever they are found.
