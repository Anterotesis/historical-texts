            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>For this corruptible must put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and this mortal must put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is part of a very remarkable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s; and indeed all
his are such. In it he treats of the
great <hi>Article,</hi> by which our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
stands or falls, <hi>The Resurrection of Christ;</hi>
as, likewise, of that of <hi>Christian Men.</hi> For,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63302:3"/>
here he does not speak of the entire Argument,<note place="margin">1 S. Iohn 5. 29.</note>
but of the <hi>Resurrection to life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after having prov'd by several convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Reasons, that <hi>Christ is risen,</hi> and that <hi>those
who are Christ's</hi> shall rise also in God's due time,
he proceeds to the discovery of a <hi>mysterious Truth</hi>
not hitherto unfolded to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> This
holy <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cret</hi> consisteth of two Branches. The <hi>first,</hi>
is the wonderful <hi>change</hi> which shall, of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
be made in the Bodies of those true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who shall be found alive at that time,
when Christ shall come to judge that world, which,
with such insolence and ingratitude, set him at
nought. The Apostle shews that there shall
then be no other separation of the Souls of the
<hi>Iust</hi> from their respective Bodies, than what the
Almighty power of God shall make by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of those Bodies from a <hi>gross</hi> to a <hi>heavenly</hi>
frame. The <hi>second,</hi> is the like glorious alteration
which shall be made at the last in the Bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of
those, who, having slept in Christ, shall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

you a mystery;</hi>

               <hi>we shall not all sleep, but we shall be
changed,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63302:3"/>
In a moment,<note place="margin">52.</note> in the twinkling of an Eye at the
last Trump (for the Trumpet shall found) <hi>[some
awakening Power shall go before the Heavenly
King, when he descendeth with his Host of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels]</hi>
and the Dead shall be raised incorruptible,<note place="margin">53.</note> and
we shall be changed.</p>
            <p>For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality.</p>
            <p>That which I have to say, at present, upon
these words may be reduced to <hi>four Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The grounds of the <hi>Belief</hi> of a Christian,
concerning this <hi>change</hi> of a corruptible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
into an incorruptible and immortal
Body.</item>
               <item>2. The many and great <hi>advantages</hi> which will
accrue to those whose bodies shall be at last in this
extraordinary manner transfigured.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>means</hi> without which no man shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Blessed End.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>An Exhortation</hi> to the conscientious <hi>use of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63302:4"/>
the means,</hi> by which we may, with certainty, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at this <hi>Change,</hi> which will be so very much
every way for the better, that whensoever <hi>we
shall leave these earthly Tabernacles,</hi> (in which we
shall dwell but a few days, and, peradventure
whilst those last, incommodiously enough) <hi>we may</hi>
(by the grace of God and the ministration of his
holy Angels) <hi>be received into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. I begin with the <hi>grounds upon which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
that the Body shall be raised and made Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
in the Heavens, and corrupt no more, and
dye no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Body is mortal,</hi> is an Article in every
mans <hi>Creed,</hi> though many live as if they had not
spent a thought about dying, and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which, after death, must be made by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Body shall rise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. Fel p. 10. putes co. jam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vixisse.</note> was a Doctrine which
the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> spake of with such great
assurance, that as the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in <hi>Minutius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Felix,</hi>
observes, a man that heard them would almost
<hi>think they themselves were already risen.</hi> And tho
the conceit of <hi>Origen</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">v. Gennad. Massil. de Eccl. dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. <hi>c. 6. p. 5. c. 7. p.</hi> 6.</note> about a new Caelestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63302:4"/>
instead of the glorified frame of the old
one (at least of the ideal rudiments of it)
had been by his Followers entertained, yet,
they agreed with other Christians in the point
of a heavenly Tabernacle. Nevertheless, all
men in all Ages have not had a Faith equal
with theirs, but some (especially in ours so
over-run with Scepticism) have doubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resurrection and further Change
of this Body; such things entring with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
into our imaginations, of which no
Instance has been seen by us. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, we have reason to believe <hi>this
Change,</hi> though none have come out of their
Graves to shew us it.</p>
            <p>And here, I appeal to all sensible men,
whether That God who is the Author of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
by which all Alterations in bodies are made,
who brought this goodly Frame of the World
out of an heap of indigested Matter, who
formed the Body of <hi>Adam</hi> out of the Dust, who
has so framed Nature, that a spring of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
should succeed their death in Winter;
who quickens dying Seeds into beautiful Stems
and Flowers and Fruit, who caused even the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63302:5"/>
dry rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> to bud, and blossom, and bring
forth Almonds; who has given skill and power
to men, by Fire and other natural Causes,
to open and refine the grossest bodies, in whose
<hi>Book</hi> (saith <hi>David) were all our members
written,</hi>

               <hi>which in continuance were fashioned, when
as yet there was none of them;</hi> who is pleased
frequently to raise the Sick to Health and
Strength and Vigour, after they had suffer'd
a long and tedious languishment, in which
low Estate their Flesh and their Spirits were
wasted, and their Bones stood, as it were,
staring upon them; I appeal (I say) to all men
of sound common sense, whether that God who
hath done these great things, is not able to
put together the parts of an humane body
which he made, contriv'd, and formerly joyn'd;
and to advance the frame of it from grossness
to purity. To think he is not, is next to no think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all, and it is to reproach God's Power,
and Knowledge and Wisdom, which is a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as well as an injudicious and irreverend
practice.</p>
            <p>How God will effect the change of this <hi>Body,</hi>
when he shall make it <hi>Coelestial,</hi> I pretend not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63302:5"/>
to explain. No man (I believe) can minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell how a <hi>grain of Mustardseed</hi> grows up
into a Tree, or arborescent Plant. It is true,
we cannot properly call that part of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which is revealed, any longer a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi>
But there is something of it kept <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi>
still. God hath not been pleased fully
to discover the methods of his working this
wonderful effect. It may suffice, in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Grace,</hi> (as in those of <hi>time,</hi> and
<hi>place,</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> in <hi>Nature,)</hi> that we
know enough for our present use, though
we know not all; and that we are sure of the
thing it self, though we cannot comprehend
the manner of it.</p>
            <p>It is more than <hi>barely credible,</hi> it is <hi>certain,</hi>
That God, who can do all this, will at last
do it, because he has said he will. He who,
on earth caused the Faces of <hi>Moses</hi> and Saint
<hi>Stephen</hi> to shine, who translated <hi>Elias,</hi> in the
<hi>Chariot</hi> of a bright and glorious Cloud, into
the Heavens; has told us, in his holy Word
(which shall not pass away, though this World
shall) that,<note place="margin">S. Mat. 13. 43.</note> at the end of it, <hi>the Righteous
shall shine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of
their Father;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63302:6"/>
That they who shall be accounted worthy to
obtain that World,<note place="margin">St. Luke 20. 35, 36.</note> and the Resurrection from
the Dead, shall be equal with the Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> if our earthly House of this Tabernacle be
dissolved,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> we have a Building of God <hi>[a Divine
Frame],</hi> an House not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> there is a natural and a spiritual Body:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 44. 49.</note>
               <hi>and that,</hi> as we have born the image of the
earthy, we <hi>[Christians]</hi> shall also bear the image
of the heavenly <hi>[Adam].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is further confirmed to us by the
Oeconomy of the Gospel. That sets forth
Christ as the Person, who, on Earth, was
<hi>transfigured</hi> in so admirable a manner, that <hi>his
Face did shine as the Sun, and his</hi> very <hi>Rayment

order to the Resurrection of the members of it;
who, rising from the Dead, <hi>became the first
Fruits of them that slept;</hi> who, (both to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
himself to these Regions, and to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63302:6"/>
prove, beyond contradiction, that it was he
himself and not a Spectre; <hi rend="margQuotes">Took again his
body with flesh,<note place="margin">Artic. 4</note> bones, and all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the perfection of Man's nature,</hi>
and ascended through the starry Heavens into a
Region still more pure,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 14.</note> and had that body made
Coelestial, and still lives in that most <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
form,</hi> and will come again and receive his
true Disciples into that thrice happy <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 21.</note>
where he now is, and will <hi>change their
vile bodies, and fashion them like to his own
glorious body,</hi> not abolishing the substance of
them, but exalting the meanness and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of their present frame into Coelestial
agility and lustre.</p>
            <p>And, indeed Philosophy (such as is not
vain, though much is, especially when it
refines upon sacred Mysteries,) does plainly
shew us, that a <hi>heavenly body</hi> is only fit
for a <hi>heavenly Region;</hi> That a <hi>pure body</hi> is
not in its element, unless it lives and moves
in <hi>pure aether.</hi> Upon which account, I suppose,
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself observes that <hi>flesh and blood
cannot inherit the Kingdom of God above;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 50.</note>
               <hi>neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi>
It must be changed into a body that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63302:7"/>
corrupt or die, if it is to subsist most
happily for ever in an heavenly place: and
such is the place prepared for the Children
of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>All this being considered, it becomes us
not to be faithless, but believe that this
<hi>mortal</hi> shall <hi>put on immortality.</hi> For it is full
out as absurd to refuse to believe when
there is a reason for our Faith, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
with a forward credulity, when there
is none.</p>
            <p>The consequence of this Belief is very
comfortable: for great and many are the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
derived to Christians, by being
cloth'd with a <hi>Coelestial Body:</hi> and that is the
2<hi>d. Head</hi> which I proposed to discourse of. The
very nature of the thing speaks aloud the
benefit which will accrue to them by the
<hi>renovation</hi> of <hi>this Body.</hi> There is scarce a
comparison to be admitted betwixt this <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
body,</hi> and that which shall be at the <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of Christians. They differ more than the
least and dimmest Star, and the brightest and
greatest Luminary in the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Of this St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
verse</hi> of this Chapter, and those which
follow it, saying, <hi>There are Coelestal bodies and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63302:7"/>
bodies Terrestrial;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 40.</note> 
               <hi>but the glory of the Coelestal is
one, and the glory of the Terrestrial is another.
There is one glory of the Sun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 41.</note> 
               <hi>and another glory
of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars;
for one Star differeth from another Star in glory.
So also is the Resurrection of the Dead. It is
sown in corruption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 42.</note> 
               <hi>it is raised in incorruption;
It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory:
It is sown in weakness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 43.</note> 
               <hi>it is raised in power.
It is sown a natural body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 44.</note> 
               <hi>it is raised a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
body.</hi> Happy are the people who are in
such a Case.</p>
            <p>But, to descend to a more <hi>special considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of this matter: The <hi>happiness</hi> derived from
the change of a natural to a spiritual body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in a deliverance,</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>grossness</hi> of the former, as it is
a body of this <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> From the <hi>disorderly motions</hi> of it, as it
is a <hi>corruptible body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> From the <hi>perishing nature, decay and
fall of it,</hi> as it is both a corruptible and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first advantage</hi> which Christians obtain
by changing an earthly for an heavenly body,
is deliverance from the grosness of the former
as it is a body of this flesh and blood. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63302:8"/>
this is a very valuable <hi>priviledge,</hi> upon <hi>three

Now in this World,<note place="margin">Wisd. 9. 15.</note> 
               <hi>the Earthly Tabernacle weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down the Mind that museth upon many things;</hi>
and it is from the <hi>grossness</hi> of the <hi>Organs</hi> of it
that we think so little, and discern so little of
the Beauty of Nature and Providence. And
the more the <hi>Eye</hi> is help'd by Art, the more it
raiseth Admiration in him who considers the
Works of God. It letteth in a New World
of Creatures, and an infinite agreeable Variety
of Motions, Figures, and Contextures, which
we discern nothing of by our naked Sight.
And in such Contemplation, there is more true
and useful Pleasure, than in all the Brutalities
in which Sensual Men consume their Time,
Substance, and Health; and waste their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
too. Now, it will be necessary for the
Body to be <hi>Coelestial,</hi> that it may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of considering those extraordinary Stamps
and Characters of the Divine Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which will be found upon a <hi>Coelestial</hi> and
Incorruptible <hi>World;</hi> the observing of which,
will (I believe) be one of those Exercises in
which the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect
shall be most happily employ'd. For if these
<hi>Heavens declare the Glory and Handy-work of God,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63302:9"/>
those will much more do so; and a <hi>Saint</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> Another <hi>Privilege</hi> arising from our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from <hi>the grossness</hi> of this Body, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of a great <hi>hindrance of Piety and Devotion.</hi> It
cannot but be an extreme Mortification to those
who would lift up their Hearts to God, and have
their Conversation in Heaven, to feel such a pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and dulness upon their Spirits as damps and
deadens them in their Holy Admirations, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Prayers. This especially will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Grief to them when they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with all their Heart and Soul and Might, to
answer, with the Degrees of their Devotion,
the most solemn Occasions of Publick Worship;
such as those of this Day, on which all that is
within us should bless the Name of God, <hi>who
hath begotten us again to a lively Hope by the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Iesus from the Dead.</hi> But when the Body
is not Restive, and the Spirits move as Handmaids
to the Soul; then, even here on Earth, it is ravish'd
with Religious Joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second Advantage</hi> which Christians obtain, by
<hi>changing an Earthly for an Heavenly Body,</hi> is <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63302:10"/>
from the disorderly Motions to which this Body
is liable, as it is a Corruptible Body;</hi> whether the
Spring of them be within, or from without; and
upon which account it may be called (as it is in
the Book of <hi>Wisdom) a Body that is subject unto
Sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 1. 4.</note> Here frequently Sickness and violent Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
render Life not worthy the Name of Life,
and provoke the Patients to think, sometimes,
that Death moves very slowly towards them.
Here, it many times happens, that one corrupt
Member must be cut off for the Preservation of
the rest; though with certain Pain, and uncertain
Hope. In <hi>this Body,</hi> the <hi>Warmth</hi> which is subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to <hi>Wit</hi> and Elocution, carries frequently
with it a mixture of <hi>Extravagance</hi> and <hi>Indiscretion.</hi>
How often does this Corruptible Frame bring such
Decays upon the Memory, that all things are
almost forgotten, even Injuries themselves? tho
of this sort of Oblivion we have no reason to
complain. What is more common to Man than
the raging and swelling of unruly Passions and
Affections, which are troublesom both to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so highly moved, and to the World to which
he gives Disturbance? How often do unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Appetites and Inclinations become so impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and <hi>war</hi> with such force <hi>against the Soul,</hi> in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63302:10"/>
Men who are not yet grown up into strong Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of Grace, that the Good which they would
do, that they do not; and the Evil which they
would not do, that they do? How often do
Flesh and Blood prejudice the Understanding by
Enthusiastick Heat, which represents to it Dreams
and strong Delusions and flashes of Madness in
the Fancy, as immediate Illuminations from God?
How frequently does it form a dark Cloud of
Melancholy in the Imagination, and fashion
that Cloud into all the Shapes of Terror and
Affrightment, in good, though scrupulous Men?
Upon this account they cry out, in their haste,
and in the anguish of their Souls,<note place="margin">Psal. 77. v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Will the Lord
cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more?

               <note place="margin">v. 8.</note>

               <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
Hath he, in Anger, shut up his tender Mercies?</hi>
These, through the fumes of the Blood, rather
than the guilt of the Conscience, are for a season
in this Life, of all others the most miserable;
for such a troubled Spirit who can bear? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
upon the whole, their Condition is much
safer and better than theirs who sport with their
Misfortunes, and mock at their Griefs, and at
the same time wallow in Sin without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63302:11"/>
upon either the Criminalness or the Peril
of their own Sensuality. For these latter, at the
dreadful Day, shall have their Bodies made the
most <hi>Dishonourable</hi> and Unprofitable of all <hi>Vessels,</hi>
whilst those of the former shall be chang'd into
<hi>Vessels</hi> of the highest <hi>Honour</hi> and the greatest Use,
that Hum<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne Nature is capable of; and such they
shall remain <hi>for ever.</hi> And that is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third sort of Advantage</hi> which those who
are Christ's will be happy in; that is to say, <hi>a
freedom from the perishing nature, decay, and fall of
this Body, as a corruptible mortal Body; for this
Corruptible must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal
must put on Immortality.</hi> There are <hi>two things</hi> which
all Men naturally desire; <hi>to know an end of their
Sufferings, and to have no end of their Happiness.</hi>
The way to the Accomplishment of these Desires
is not shewn in the Schools of <hi>Zeno</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi>
It is confess'd, there was taught by them a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated

               <hi>of the World.</hi> This they would have to be brought
to pass in the Revolution of a certain Period of
Time, in such sort, that all things should come
about again, and be as they had been before for
a like quantity of Duration; and so in Vicissitudes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63302:11"/>
for ever: From whence it would follow, that
this Corruptible Body, after it had put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
for a season, should become corruptible
again, and mortal again. But in the School of
Christ, we learn a Proposition which is most
Confortable as well as most True; to wit, that
after the Resurrection, Ascension, and glorious
Change of this Body, all Grossness, all disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Motion, all Pain and Trouble shall cease;
but of the Felicity of the Christian Man's
Soul dwelling in it, there shall be no End.
The <hi>Apostle</hi> assures us, That <hi>Death,</hi> their
<hi>last Enemy, shall,</hi> it self, <hi>be</hi> then <hi>destroy'd. For
the Lord</hi> [Jesus] <hi>shall descend from Heaven with a
Shout,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the
Trump of God;</hi> and the <hi>Dead in Christ shall rise
first;</hi> then those <hi>which are alive and remain, shall be
caught  up in the Clouds together</hi> with those that
have been raised, <hi>to meet the same Lord in the Air,
and so shall</hi> they <hi>be ever with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sting of Misery is the Continuance of it,
and Hell is the more Hell for that. Continuance
also is the Heaven of Joy. It is made Perfect
by our possessing it, without any Shadow of Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of being ever bereaved of it. And thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63302:12"/>
it will be after the Resurrection of the Just.
Then shall be entirely fulfilled the Words of
the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>He will ransom thee from the
Power of the Grave: He will redeem thee from Death.
O Death! he will be thy Plague; O Grave! he will
be thy Destruction.</hi> Then shall be made good those
Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Mortality shall be swallowed up
of Life:</hi> Or, as he expresseth it, in the Words
after the Text,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note>—<hi>When this Corruptible shall have
put on Incorruption, and this Mortal shall have put on
Immortality; Then shall be brought to pass the Saying
that is written,</hi> [written of old by the Prophet
<hi>Isaiah] Death is swallowed up in Victory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 25. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These</hi> which I have recounted, are (you will
say) very great <hi>Advantages</hi> which a Christian shall
gain by <hi>changing this Earthly for a Heavenly Body.</hi>
But, it may be, you will add, <hi>Why cannot the
Soul be fully happy in it self without any Body at all;</hi>
and happier than in a Body, though Incorruptible
and Immortal?</p>
            <p>To this, I think, it is proper to answer no
more than thus much, in this short Discourse
which is design'd not for nice Dispute, but solid
Edification. That is to say, That God who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63302:12"/>
framed his Creatures in divers Orders, made
Man a Creature consisting of Soul and Body;
and that it belongs to his Rank in the Creation
to have them at last united again: Also, that
by the perfectest Union of them, a Creature of
that Order is, as such, compleated both in his
proper Being, and in the happiness of it. To
this purpose are (as I conceive) the words of
St. <hi>Paul. In this</hi> [Tabernacle] <hi>we grow earnestly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 2, 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>desiring to be Clothed upon with our House which is
from Heaven. If so be that, being Clothed, we
shall not be found Naked. For we that are in this
Tabernacle do Groan, being burthened: Not that we
would be Uncloathed, but Cloathed upon, that Mortality
might be swallowed up of Life.</hi> He would not be
without a Body at <hi>That day</hi> (for of that time
he speaks) but he is desirous that a Celestial
Form should be put upon Terrestrial Matter.<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>These is a <hi>Question</hi> less curious than that
which has been put, but exceedingly more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and it is this. What shall we do that we
may come at these several great Advantages of
living at last in an Heavenly body? And this is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Consideration,</hi> and very fit for the
Exercise of our Thoughts. For, in vain, do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63302:13"/>
we Philosophize about a Celestial Paradise,
and a Spiritual Body, and an Heavenly Word,
without knowing and using the means of being
happy in them all.</p>
            <p>Those means are the Conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace to which Christians on their
Parts have solemnly consented, and which,
by the assistance of God's Grace, they may and
must perform, by their sincere Obedience to
Him. The way to have better Bodies is to have
more Virtuous Souls. God hath put us into this
Body, as into the Habit of a <hi>Pilgrim on Earth,</hi>
as <hi>Probationers</hi> for a more excellent Cloathing.
And, according to our Patience, our Self-denial,
our keeping the Body in Subjection to the
Mind, our governing the Appetites and Passions
of it, so shall the Resurrection and Ascension
of it be. <hi>Righteousness</hi> (saith the Book of
<hi>Wisdom) is Immortal;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 1. 15</note> and the <hi>giving heed to her
Laws is the assurance of Incorruption;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 6. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
maketh us near unto God.</hi> And he that
will not awake to Righteousness shall not
ascend to a state of Incorruption. God will
not receive such a Violater of his Laws into his
especial Presence. He will not admit so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63302:13"/>
brutal a Creature into his Kingdom, where
there is nothing to gratifie the Inclinations of
Flesh and Blood. Such a Creature would still
be desirous to Eat and Drink, and to enjoy the
Pleasures of a corruptible Body.</p>
            <p>We rise to Glory as Members of Christ,
<hi>who</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>died for all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that they
which live should not live to themselves, but unto
him who died for them and rose again.</hi> His true
Members we cannot call our selves with any
Propriety, if we fulfil not the holy <hi>Vow</hi> we
made to him when we were initiated into his
Church, by <hi>renouncing</hi> and <hi>forsaking all the sinful
Lusts of the Flesh.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told the World
in express Terms,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>That he who Soweth to the Flesh,
shall of the Flesh Reap Corruption.</hi> (He shall die
after all the pampering of the Body with <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi>
Art, and for that it may be, much the
sooner; He shall fat himself for Slaughter)
but <hi>He who Soweth to the Spirit</hi> (who Feeds and
Cultivates the Soul with Wisdom and Holiness)
<hi>shall of the Spirit Reap Life everlasting;</hi> the Life
of an Immortal Soul in an Immortal Body.
Can it ever be imagined (or if it be, is it any
other than mere imagination, and a very false
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63302:14"/>
and gross one too) that Christ shall raise the
<hi>Temple of this Body</hi> to a Celestial House, making
that second Temple much more glorious than
this first, after it has been wilfully <hi>Desecrated</hi> by
Man, and put to the vilest uses of Insobriety
and Lust. Such Sensualities render this Body
more Earthly still, and bury the Soul in it, so
far are they from promoting it to an Heavenly
Estate.</p>
            <p>The impenitent Sinner hopes against all
grounds of hope, if he has expectation of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God face to face with Eyes which have been
<hi>full of Adnltery?</hi> and of praising God in Heaven
with a Tongue that has been set on Fire from
Hell, that has Insolently blasphem'd him on
Earth, and bitterly revil'd his Servants, perhaps
because they were his Servants, or for reviling
sake. The like may be said of every Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
done by the Soul in this Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.<note place="margin">

               <hi>For we must all appear before the Iudgment-seat
of Christ, that every Man may receive the things
done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Good or Evil.</hi> This is part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith which we have, this day,
made in these words. <q>At [Christ's] coming
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63302:14"/>
all Men shall rise again with their Bodies,
and give account of their own Works; and
they that have done good shall go into Life
everlasting, and they that have done Evil, into
everlasting Fire.</q> Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Knowing the <hi>Terrors of the Lord,</hi>
which will seize upon the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> and bring
them to <hi>Destruction both of Body and Soul,</hi> and
the joyful Estate of a <hi>happy Soul</hi> in a <hi>Celestial
Body,</hi> which shall be the Portion of all those
who <hi>walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit;</hi>
We beseech you, both by the <hi>Severities</hi> and
<hi>Mercies</hi> of God;</p>
            <q>
               <p> That ye present your Bodies
a living Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> holy and acceptable unto
him, which is your reasonable Service. Seeing
That all these things shall be dissolved,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 11, 12, 13.</note> what
manner of Persons ought we to be in all holy
Conversation and Godliness, looking for, and
hastning unto the coming of the day of GOD,
wherein the Heavens being on Fire shall be
dissolved, and the Elements shall melt with
servant heat?</p>
               <p>Nevertheless we, according to his Promise,
look for new Heavens, and a new Earth,
wherein dwelleth Righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63302:15"/>
Wherefore, Seeing ye look for such things,
be diligent that ye may be found of him, in
Peace, without Spot, and Blameless.</p>
            </q>
            <p>As sure as Christ is risen, <hi>these dry Bones shall
live,</hi> as well as those did which the <hi>Prophet</hi> spake
of in a Political Sense,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 3, 11, 14.</note> meaning by them the
<hi>House of Israel,</hi> which God promised to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It should, therefore, be our Care, not to put
this vile Body into far worse Condition, but
to consult the good of it; seeing the more
Heavenly its Frame be made, the Felicity of the
Soul in it will be the greater.</p>
            <p>Men of light and desultory Humours <hi>affect
Alterations,</hi> without considering the Events of
them. Wise Men chuse them also, when they
foresee plainly they will turn to their exceeding
Benefit. And here they have a plain prospect
of a most considerable advantage, of changing
Corruption for Incorruption, and Mortality for
Immortality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63302:15"/>
If any are extreamly concern'd at Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Body, as so many marks of Shame
(tho' nothing which is not of our own doing
can be a just reproach to us) why have they
not the innocent Ambition of desiring a Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Body, which will be without wrinckle or
blemish? And the way to procure so decent a
a Body, is to rectifie the distractions of our
Reason, and the monstrous choice of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd
Wills; and to subdue all dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Passions and Vices; and to keep our selves
unspotted from the World. If divers are very
Covetous of Life in this Body, as burthensome
as it is, and wish their Years were not so many
as they are, and that they would still be many
more, even then when the Wheel is almost bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at the Cistern, and the Blood can scarce
creep on in its Circle; why are they averse to
Christian Piety, which will provide for them an
Immortal Body?</p>
            <p>You will permit me,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> to use the
Exhortation of the great Apostle, <hi>Awake thou
that Sleepest, and rise from the Dead, and Christ
shall give thee Life.</hi> Say not,<note place="margin">Ver. 32.</note> as the <hi>Epicures</hi>
mentioned in this Chapter, <hi>Let us Eat and Drink
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63302:16"/>
for to morrow we die:</hi> But rather, let us be
<hi>Sober and Vigilant,</hi> that when ever we die the
first Death, we may overcome the Second.
Seeing Christ is risen, and we shall rise and be
changed by his Power, say not, upon any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
about Christian Religion, <hi>Why stand we
in Ieopardy every hour?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 30 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>Why do we die daily? Why
do we Fight with Beasts,</hi> or Men as Savage as
they? Why do we not rather consult the ease
of Flesh and Blood? but rather (as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this Discourse) <hi>Let us be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 58.</note>
               <hi>unmoveable, always abounding in the work of
the Lord, for asmuch as we know that our Labour
shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Let us <hi>glorifie him with our Bodies, and
with our Souls,</hi> that he may glorifie both. Then
may we, upon good and comfortable grounds,
joyn with the same Apostle in these words of
Spiritual Triumph,</p>
            <p>O Death! where is thy Sting?<note place="margin">Ver. 55, 56<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 57.</note> O Grave! where
is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the
strength of Sin is the Law. But thanks be to God
who giveth us the Victory through our Lord Iesus
Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost,
be Glory and Dominion for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
