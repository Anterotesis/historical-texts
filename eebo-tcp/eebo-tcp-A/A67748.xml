            <title>Englands unthankfulness striving with Gods goodness, for the victory as Abaslom [sic] strove with David, whether the father should be more kinde to the son; or the son more unkinde to the father. Or, enough (being wel weighed) to melt an heart of adamant. By R. Younge, florilegus. In reference to Leviticus 19.17 and Isaiah 58.1. In reading whereof, reflect upon your selves; hearken to conscience; and what concerns you, apply it to others, as David did Nathans parable, 2 Sam. 12.1, to 8.

Want of application makes all means ineffectual; and therefore are we Christians in name only, because we think out selves Christians indeed, and already good enough.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even the same do you unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 7. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou shall not hate thy Brother in thine heart, but thou shalt plainly tell him of his faults; and suffer him not to sin,</hi> Levit. 19. 17.</p>
               <p>And then consider, how few there are amongst us; and how rare (one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here and there one) like rich men, among the multitude, or jewels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other stuff, that either do, or care to walk by this golden Rule; Yea, that instead thereof, make not the <hi>World</hi> onely their <hi>God;</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> or <hi>Profit</hi> alone their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. Secondly, Observe (ô that we had the grace seriously to observe and minde!) but the <hi>Predictions;</hi> touching the paucity &amp; fewness of those that shall be saved. <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many will seek to enter, and shall not be able; because strait is the gate, and narrow the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that finde it: But wide is the gate, and broad the way, that leadeth to destruction; and many there be that go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> Matth. 7. 13, 14.

Yea, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>the whole World lieth in wickedness,</hi> 1 John 5. 19.

               <p>And we finde it too true, by sad experience; for what eyes can but run over to see, for the most part, how ignorant and erroneous men are, and what lives they lead? for scarce one of a hundred, whose <hi>knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> is in any degree answerable to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or the Title that they bear; for <hi>Christians</hi> they are called, but no otherwise then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Images are called <hi>Gods:</hi> because he that is a <hi>Christian</hi> indeed, will strive to imitate <hi>Christ,</hi> and square his life in some measure, according to the rule of <hi>Gods Word.</hi>

               <p>§ 3. Thirdly, Observe but the <hi>Testimonies</hi> manifesting how they must be qualified, who mean to be saved. O that we would but believe them; for <hi>God</hi> expresly tells us, <hi>That no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§ 4 Nor can it indeed consist with his justice to pardon such as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in an evil course of life; neither was it ever heard, that any ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven without going up the staires of new obedience: that any have attained unto everlasting life, without faith, repentance, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of Spirit: For even the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Crosse</hi> believed in <hi>Christ,</hi> and shewed the fruits of his faith, in acknowledging his own sin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his fellow, in confessing his <hi>Saviour,</hi> even when all denied and forsook him, in calling upon his Name, and desiring by his means and merits everlasting life. Besides we read not, that ever he was outwardly called, until this very hour. Secondly, though there was one saved at the last hour, that none might despair: yet there was but one, that none should presume.

And yet wretched and <hi>senseless men,</hi> they presume to have part in that merit, which in every part they have so abused; to be purged by that blood, which now they take all occasions to disgrace; to be saved by the same wounds, which they swear by, and so osten swear away; to have <hi>Christ</hi> an <hi>Advocate</hi> for them in the next life, when they are <hi>Advocates</hi> against <hi>Christ</hi> in this: And that Heaven will meet them at their last hour, when all their life long, they have galloped in the beaten road towards <hi>Hell.</hi>

               <p>§ 7. The <hi>Devil</hi> makes large promises to his; but ever disappoints them of their hopes, as he did <hi>our first Parents: You shall die</hi> saith God; <hi>You shall not die at all,</hi> saith Satan: Yea, <hi>you shall be as Gods,</hi> saith he, when his drist was to make them <hi>Devils.</hi> Yet the <hi>Devil</hi> was <hi>believed,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> could not be <hi>credited. Diabolus mentitur, ut fallat; vitam pollicetur, ut perimat,</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And ever since our first parents, gave more credit to <hi>Satan,</hi> then their Maker: Our <hi>hearts</hi> naturally have been <hi>slint unto God, wax to Satan;</hi> so that <hi>Satan</hi> may in a manner triumph over <hi>Christ,</hi> and say, I have more servants then <hi>Christ;</hi> &amp; they do more for me, then his servants do for him: and yet I never died for them as <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for his: I never promised them so great reward, as <hi>Christ</hi> hath done to his, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Well may these men think they believe the Gospel, as the Jews (who persecuted <hi>Jesus,</hi> and sought to slay him) thought they believed <hi>Moses writings, Joh.</hi> 5. 38, 39, 46, 47. But it's altogether impossible, as <hi>Christ</hi> (who knew their hearts better then themselves) affirmes of them: for certainly they would never speak as they speak, think as they think, do as they do; if they thought their thoughts, words, and deeds should ever come to judgement.</p>
               <p>Did men believe, that <hi>neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Swearers, nor Railers, nor the Fearfull, nor Unbelieving, nor Murtherers, nor Sorcerers, nor Liars, nor no unrighteous persons, shall inherit the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> (as the Scripture expresly speaks,) <hi>but shall have their part in the lake that burneth with sire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which is the second death:</hi> They durst not continue in the practice of these sins, without fear, or remorse or care of amendment. As for instance, If <hi>Lots sons-</hi>in-Law had believed their <hi>Father,</hi> when he told them from <hi>God</hi> that the <hi>City</hi> should suddenly be destroyed with <hi>fire</hi> &amp; <hi>brimstone,</hi> and that by flying they might escape it, they would have obeyed his counsel. Or if the <hi>old world</hi> had believed, that <hi>God</hi> would indeed, and in good earnest bring such a <hi>flood</hi> upon them as he threatened, they would not have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the opportunity of entring into the <hi>Ark</hi> before it was shut, and the

                  <hi>windows</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> opened; much less would they have scoffed, and flowt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Noah,</hi> while he was a bulding it. So if men did firmly believe what <hi>God</hi> speaks of <hi>bell,</hi> it would keep them innocent; make them offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; they would need no intreaty to avoid it. Men love themselves well enough to avoid a known pain; yea, there would be more fear, and danger of their <hi>despair,</hi> then of their <hi>security.</hi> And the like of <hi>heaven;</hi> if men but believed what <hi>fulness of joy,</hi> and what <hi>pleasures</hi> are reserved at <hi>Gods right hand for evermore, for them that love,</hi> and serve <hi>him</hi> in sincerity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11. they would be more obedient upon earth.</p>

                  </gap> a <hi>drop</hi> to taste out of that ocean.</p>
               <p>Touching what <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for us: In the first place he gave us our selves, and all the creatures to be our servants; yea, he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated us <hi>after his own Image in righteousnesse and holinesse, and in perfect knowledg of the truth,</hi> with a power to stand, and for ever to continue in a most blessed and happy condition; and this deserves all possible thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; but this was nothing in comparison; for when we were in a sad condition; when we had forfeited all this, &amp; our selves: when by sin we had turned that <hi>image of God</hi> into the <hi>image of Satan,</hi> and wilfully plunged our souls and bodies into eternal torments, when we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his enemies, mortally hating him, and to our utmost fighting against him, and taking part with his only enemies; <hi>(Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan)</hi> not having the least thought or desire of reconcilement, but a perverse and obstinate will to resist all means tending thereunto; He did redeem us, not onely without asking, but even against our wills: so making of us (his cursed enemies) servants, of servants <hi>sons,</hi> of sons <hi>heirs,</hi> and <hi>coheirs with Christ,</hi> Gal. 4. 7. Here was a fathomless depth, a wonder beyond all wonders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But that we may the better consider what an alms or boon <hi>God</hi> gave us, when he gave us his Son: Observe that when neither <hi>heaven,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34200:7"/>
earth,</hi> nor <hi>hell,</hi> could have yielded any satisfactory thing, besides <hi>Christ</hi> that could have satisfied <hi>Gods</hi> justice, and merited <hi>heaven</hi> for us, then, O then! <hi>God,</hi> in his infinite wisdom and goodness, did not onely finde out a way to satisfie his Justice and the Law, but <hi>gave us his Son, his only begotten Son,</hi> his only beloved Son out of his bosome: And his Son gave himself to die, even the most shameful, painful, and cursed death of the Cross <hi>to redeem us; That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life, Iohn</hi> 3. 16. The very thought of which death, before he came to it, together with the weight and burthen of our sins, put him into such an Agony in the Garden, that it made him to <hi>sweat, even drops of blood.</hi> A mercy bestowed, and a way found out, that may astonish all the sons of <hi>men</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven!</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ô wonder at this, you that wonder at nothing! That the Lord should come with such a price to redeem our worse then lost souls, and to bring salvation to us, even against our wils: The <hi>Lord Iesus Christ being rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 9. Even the eternal <hi>God</hi> would die, that we might not die eternally; ô the deepness of <hi>Gods</hi> love! ô the unmeasurable measure of his bounty! ô Son of <hi>God,</hi> who can sufficiently express thy love? Or, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy pity? Or, extol thy praise? It was a wonder, that thou madest us for thy self, more that thou madest thy self man for us; but most of all, that thou shouldest unmake thy self, that thou shouldest die to save u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>§ 3. And which is further considerable, It cost <hi>God</hi> more to redeem the world, then to make it: In the <hi>Creation</hi> he gave thee <hi>thy self;</hi> but in the <hi>Redemption</hi> he gave thee himself. The <hi>Creation</hi> of all things <hi>cost</hi> him but <hi>six dayes</hi> to finish it; the <hi>Redemption</hi> of man cost him <hi>three and thirty years.</hi> In the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> he did but only <hi>speak</hi> the word; in the <hi>Redemption of man,</hi> he both <hi>spake</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi> and <hi>sweat,</hi> and <hi>bled,</hi> and <hi>died,</hi> and did <hi>many</hi> wonderful <hi>things</hi> to do it: Yea, the <hi>saving of one soul</hi> single, is more and greater then the <hi>making</hi> of the <hi>whole World.</hi> In every new <hi>creature</hi> are a number of <hi>miracles,</hi> a <hi>blinde</hi> man is <hi>restored</hi> to <hi>fight,</hi> a <hi>deaf</hi> man to <hi>bearing,</hi> a man <hi>possest</hi> with many Devils <hi>dis-possest;</hi> yea, a <hi>dead</hi> man raised from the <hi>dead,</hi> and in every one a <hi>stone</hi> turned into <hi>flesh</hi> in all which God <hi>meets</hi> with nothing but <hi>opposition,</hi> which in the <hi>Creation</hi> he met not with.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But the better to illustrate this love, consider, that <hi>salvation</hi> stands in two things: First, in <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> of us from <hi>Hell:</hi> Secondly, in the possession of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and eternal life; <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>death</hi> merits the first for us; and by his <hi>obedience</hi> fulfilling the Law, merits the second. The parts of our <hi>Iustification</hi> are likewise two; the <hi>remission</hi> of our sins, and the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnesse. And to this would be added, first, <hi>Conversion,</hi> which comprehends both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> Secondy, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> the Parts whereof are <hi>Mortification</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34200:8"/>
that is, dying unto sin; and <hi>Vivisication,</hi> which is living unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thirdly, <hi>Glorification</hi> begun and perfected, which is freedome from all evil <hi>here,</hi> and the perfection of all good and happiness <hi>in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. What shall I say? <hi>God</hi> of his goodnesse hath bestowed so many and so great mercies upon us, that it is not possible to expresse his bounty therein; for if we look <hi>inward,</hi> we finde our <hi>Creators</hi> mercies; if we look <hi>upward,</hi> his mercy reacheth unto the heavens, if <hi>downwards</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> is full of his goodnesse, and so is the broad Sea; if we look <hi>about us,</hi> what is it that he hath not given us? <hi>Air</hi> to breath in, <hi>Fire</hi> to warm us, <hi>Water</hi> to cool and cleanse us, <hi>Clothes</hi> to cover us, <hi>Food</hi> to nourish us, <hi>Fruits</hi> to refresh us; yea, <hi>Delicates</hi> to please us, <hi>Beasts</hi> to serve us, <hi>Angels</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us, <hi>Heaven</hi> to receive us; And which is above all, <hi>Himself</hi> and his own <hi>Son</hi> to be injoyed of us: So that whithersoever we turn our <hi>eyes,</hi> we cannot look besides his bounty; yea, we can scarce think of any thing more to pray for, but that he would continue those blessings, which he hath bestowed on us already: Yet we covet still, as though we <hi>had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> as if we knew nothing of all this his beneficence. We are bound to praise him above any <hi>Nation</hi> whatsoever; for what <hi>Nation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Heaven</hi> enjoyes so much <hi>light,</hi> or so many <hi>blessings,</hi> as we? above any creature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> might have said before we were formed, Let them be <hi>Toads, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Infidels, Beggars, Cripples, Bond-slaves, Idiots,</hi> or <hi>Mad men,</hi> so long as they live, and after that <hi>Castaways for ever, and ever:</hi> But he hath made us to the <hi>best likenesse,</hi> and nursed us in the best <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>placed</hi> us in the best <hi>Land,</hi> and appointed us to the best, and only <hi>inheritance,</hi> even to remain in <hi>blisse</hi> with him for ever; yea, thousands would think themselves happy, if they had but a piece of our <hi>happinesse;</hi> for whereas some <hi>bleed,</hi> we <hi>sleep</hi> in safety; others <hi>beg,</hi> we <hi>abound;</hi> others <hi>starve,</hi> we are <hi>full fed;</hi> others <hi>grope in the dark,</hi> our <hi>Sun</hi> still <hi>shines;</hi> we have <hi>eyes, ears, tongue, feet, hands, health, liberty, reason,</hi> others are <hi>blinde, deaf, dumb,</hi> are <hi>sick, maimed, imprisoned, distracted, and the like,</hi> yea, <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>removed</hi> so many <hi>evils from us,</hi> and <hi>conferred</hi> so many <hi>good things upon us,</hi> that they are beyond <hi>thought</hi> or <hi>imagination:</hi> For if the whole <hi>Heaven</hi> were turned into a <hi>Book,</hi> and all the <hi>Angels</hi> deputed <hi>Writers</hi> therein, they could not set down all the <hi>good,</hi> which <hi>Gods love in Christ hath done us.</hi> For all those millions of mercies that we have received from, before, and since we were born, either for soul or body, even to the least bit of bread we eat, or shall to eternity, (of which we could not well want any one) <hi>Christ hath</hi> purchased of his Father for us, and yet <hi>God</hi> the Father also, hath of his free grace, &amp; mercie given us, in giving us his Son; for which read <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19. and 145. 15, 16. and 75. 6, 7.

               <p>§ 1. ANd thus according to my scantling, I have spread before you what <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for us: and how we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain required him. Though <hi>God</hi> (who <hi>searcheth the heart, and trieth the reins)</hi> knows infinitely more by us, and sees what <hi>strange mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;</hi> what <hi>ugly, odious, hideous fiends:</hi> what <hi>swarms,</hi> what <hi>litters,</hi> what <hi>legions</hi> of <hi>noysome lusts,</hi> are <hi>couched</hi> in the <hi>stinking styes</hi> of every one of our <hi>deceitful hearts:</hi> and findes, that if all our thoughts did but break forth into action, we should not come far short of the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>And certainly, if we shall compare the <hi>numberless number</hi> of our <hi>great</hi> and <hi>grievous abominations,</hi> wherewith our <hi>Land</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> from <hi>corner</hi> to <hi>corner;</hi> with the many means which <hi>God</hi> hath afforded for our reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it will be found, that no <hi>Nation</hi> under <hi>heaven,</hi> did ever more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Lord.</hi> Nor hath he ever strove more with any <hi>Nation</hi> to reclaim them, then he hath done with us: for when neither <hi>mercies,</hi> nor any <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means</hi> would serve the turn; he hath at several times visited us with several <hi>judgements,</hi> to try what they would do: But we have been so little moved therewith, that instead of becomming <hi>better,</hi> we have bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And <hi>not onely ye, ô inhabitants of this our</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Judah, would I have to <hi>judge, between</hi> Christ <hi>and his Vineyard; what he could have done for us, more then he hath done,</hi> Isaiah 5. 4, to 8. But <hi>heare ye also, ô heavens, and give eare, ô earth; be astonished at it, and horribly afraid; that this foolish people and unwise, should so requite the Lord,</hi> Jer. 2. 11, &amp;c. Isai. 1. 2, to 9. and Verse 15, to 25. Deut. 32. 6, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Oh my Brethren, <hi>Englands unthankfulness hath striven with Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the victory,</hi> as <hi>Absalom</hi> strove with <hi>David,</hi> whether the <hi>Father</hi> should be more <hi>kinde</hi> to the <hi>son,</hi> or the <hi>son</hi> more <hi>unkinde</hi> to the <hi>Father.</hi> We have been <hi>fatted with his blessings,</hi> and then <hi>spurned at his precepts;</hi> resembling the <hi>Leopard,</hi> who wrongs them most, that give him most fodder.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But why do I call it <hi>unthankfulness?</hi> when our sin is many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beyond <hi>ingratitude</hi> it self: For not to confesse a benefit, is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most confine of unthankfulnesse: meer <hi>ingratitude, returnes nothing for good,</hi> but <hi>we return evil,</hi> yea <hi>the greatest,</hi> and most malicious <hi>evil,</hi> for the greatest, and <hi>most admired love.</hi>

Argue with all the World, and they will conclude, there is <hi>no vice like ingratitude:</hi> But we are more ingrateful to <hi>God,</hi> then can be exprest by the best <hi>Oratour</hi> alive.

It was worse which the <hi>Israelites</hi> shewed to <hi>Gideons seed, Judg.</hi> 9. 17, 18. which <hi>Michael Thraulus</hi> shewed to <hi>Leo the Emperour;</hi> which <hi>Justinianus</hi> shewed to that renowned Captain <hi>Bellizarius.</hi> It was yet worse, which <hi>Popilius</hi> shewed to <hi>Cicero;</hi> which <hi>Lycaon</hi> shewed to his <hi>stranger guests,</hi> that came to him for relief. It was worst of all in the <hi>Jews,</hi> to scourge and crucifie <hi>Christ,</hi> who did them good every way: for he <hi>healed</hi> their diseases, <hi>fed</hi> their bodies, <hi>enlightened</hi> their mindes; of <hi>God</hi> became <hi>Man,</hi> and lived miserably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them many years, that he might <hi>save</hi> their <hi>souls:</hi> (though in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, they did their utmost; to <hi>sink</hi> the onely <hi>ship</hi> that could <hi>save them.)</hi> But all these fall far short of our ingratitude to <hi>God:</hi> for his <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> we take and live on, the <hi>bread</hi> we eat, the <hi>air</hi> we breath, the <hi>cloaths</hi> we weare, all are his.</p>

that it may prove of general behoof, I will give you the several <hi>characters of seven sorts of men,</hi> which include the whole number, <hi>viz.</hi>

Nor is any <hi>Profound Humanist,</hi> or <hi>Cunning Politician,</hi> or <hi>False Teacher</hi> so wise: but it is through ignorance, that he doth so ill: and which is as good, the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man</hi> shall meet with his own <hi>thoughts, words,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> in every of the <hi>seven Characters:</hi> if he be but wise enough to know the issue of his own <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>brain,</hi> when he sees the <hi>Brats</hi> brought before him.</p>
               <p>I shall also occasionally pourtray, or paint out: the usual cunning, Covetousness, and Cruelty.

profess thy self to be one of those ignorant, <hi>unbelieving, ingrateful,</hi> &amp; <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> wretches herein concern'd: yea, to be one of the <hi>children of disobedience whom</hi> Satan hath <hi>blinded:</hi> that in respect of others, I should think it needlesse to spend time in further proof thereof: yet I would gladly say something to shame thee out of thy self: wherefore brie fly thus: Thou art <hi>kept by the Devil in a snare, and taken captive of him at his will: he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and worketh his pleasure in thee,</hi> as being <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>and Father, and Prince, and Master,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26.

Thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious qualities are these and the like: thou doest banish all <hi>civility,</hi> and give thy self over to <hi>sensuality:</hi> and art neither afraid nor a shamed; to let thy wicked est thoughts break forth into actions.

All which considered, if they be not good, and godly men; what will become of thousands?</p>
               <p>2. §. These midle sort of men, (I meane for out-ward appearance; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>orme of Godlinesse) have a notable way to delude their owne soules; and to put off all reproofs, and threatnings: that is by comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with such as are (in their repute) worse then themselves: counting none wicked, but such as are notorious for wickednesse. As for example, Because they are not so drunk as <hi>Nabal;</hi> they thinke themselves sober: Because not so proud as <hi>Haman,</hi> therefore they be humble; Because not so
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34200:17"/>
bloodily minded as <hi>Doeg;</hi> therefore they are mercifull: Because not so trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous as <hi>Judas,</hi> therefore loyall. Because neither <hi>Gallowes,</hi> nor <hi>Pillory</hi> can take hold of them; therefore they are honest, and square dealers.</p>
               <p>Nor can there be a more plausible deceit; For as the <hi>Swar by</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>Blackemore,</hi> thinks himselfe faire: So <hi>civill men,</hi> looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>prophane,</hi> admire their owne holinesse.</p>
               <p>Whence it is, that the more unrebukeable any naturall man is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the difficulty of his conversion. For as nothing is more <hi>easily broken,</hi> then that which is <hi>most hard:</hi> so <hi>notorious offenders,</hi> are nothing so hard to be convinced, and converted, as the <hi>civilly honest.</hi> The <hi>civill Iusticiary,</hi> is like the <hi>young man</hi> in the <hi>Gospell;</hi> that supposed he had honestly kept all the Commandements: who when he was bid to follow <hi>Christ,</hi> turned his bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(be we never so milde, and gentle) we are the <hi>seed of the Serpent,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. and <hi>children of the Devill,</hi> Iohn 8. 44. Yea, the very best naturall man, is but <hi>a tame Devill:</hi> as <hi>Athanasius</hi> well notes.</p>

Nor wouldest thou need, any more to humble thee, and make thee loath and abhor thy selfe, then the cleare sight of thy guiltinesse, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and wretchednesse by nature. For no tongue is able to expresse, what impotent, pittifull, and poluted wretches we are; <hi>when we are in our blood,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6. As <hi>Christ</hi> at the first finds us, and before he hath <hi>washed us white, in his blood,</hi> sanctified us by his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and covered us with the long <hi>white Robe of his righteousnesse.</hi> As O what swarmes, what litters, what legions of noysome lusts: lye lurking in every naturall mans heart; by reason of <hi>originall sin.</hi> For <hi>out of the heart naturally, proceeds nothing but evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, theifts, false-witnesse, blasphemies, &amp;c.</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> shewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 18. 19. Yea, <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart; are onely, and continually evill; and deceitfull above all things,</hi> Jet. 17. 9. and that <hi>from his youth,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. and 8. 21. And we are all cut out of the same cloath. So that every man hath the seeds of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne in his heart. And we are beholding to <hi>God,</hi> and not to our selves: that we runne not out into all manner of enormeties; even the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost</hi> not except. That we are not worse then <hi>Manasses</hi> himselfe. <hi>Lord</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin,</hi> thou hast forgiven me those sinnes which I have done; and those sinnes, which onely by thy grace I have not done. They were done in our inclination to them; and even that inclination needs <hi>God,</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Nor are we onely apt to all evill: but we are also reprobate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed to all grace, and goodnesse: yea, to all the meanes thereof. we are not onely weake, but altogether so dead in sinne; that we cannot stirre the least joynt, no not so much as feele our deadnesse, nor desire life: we can no more turne our selves, then we could at first make our selves. And as <hi>God</hi> did at first make us, so he must new make us, or we shall everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perish. Yea, except <hi>God</hi> bestow upon us daily privative grace to desend us from evill; and daily positive grace, inabling us to doe good: we are utterly undone. We have ability, we have will enough to undoe our selves: scope enough Hell-ward, but neither motion, nor will to doe good. Our <hi>understandings</hi> are darkned, and dulled; our <hi>judgements</hi> blinded, our <hi>wills</hi> perverted, our <hi>memories</hi> disordered, our <hi>affections</hi> corrupted, our <hi>reason</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, our <hi>thoughts</hi> surprised, our <hi>desires</hi> intraped; and all the <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>functions</hi> of our <hi>soules:</hi> yea, our very <hi>natures</hi> are no better then poysoned: as every sanctified heart both feeles, and will freely confesse, as did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> And this let me tell thee, that if ever thou obtainest the grace, truly, and orderly to repent of thy sinnes: thou wilt begin here, as esteeming it the <hi>mother</hi> and <hi>nurse</hi> of all the rest: the <hi>puddle</hi> or <hi>spring</hi> of all other sinnes.

               <p>Thou art so stupidly sottish, that thou thinkest, yea wilt professe; that thou lovest <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> and yet hatest all that any way resemble him.

Though thou makest those sinnes thine owne, which thou dost not some way reprove. For to be a doer of ill, or no hinderer; is much about one, in <hi>Gods</hi> account.

               <p>5. §. Thou condemnest, and cryest out upon their profession; when thy spight is at their Religion; as what needs so much profession? Cannot men serve <hi>God</hi> in secret? Yea, their much hearing troubles thee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou callest upon them to heare lesse, and practise more: when thy crying up practise, is but to crie downe preaching.

               <p>If thou hearest of a professer of Religion; (for otherwise thou hast no quarrell against him,) that through humane frailty, does over-shoot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or is overcome in a fault: thou wilt for this bare, single act; most unjustly, and uncharitably judge him, to be a dissembling Hypocrite, as <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends dealt by him.

               <p>6 §. Yea, rather then not censure the religious, thou wilt accuse them for their vertues. As what can they doe, or leave undone; but thou wilt strangely censure them, as if they refuse to Oath it, then they make great conscience of swearing; but none of lying, and cozening: and therefore are not to be believed. If they be carefull of their society, thou wilt tax, and stout them; <hi>with stand farther off, for I am holier then thou.</hi>

               <p>Againe, If a mans conscience be tender: and he makes scruple of small matters: O then he <hi>stumbles at strawes, and leaps over blockes: straines at Gnats, and swallowes Cammels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. §. And as is thy censuring, such is thy envy, and hatred to the Godly; and why? but because they either doe better, or fare betrer, or are better esteemed then thy selfe. Yea, even a good Conscience, and sticking close to the word; is the onely thing that raiseth thy spleen, and is the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of thy malice, as it faired with <hi>Annanias,</hi> touching <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>This makes thee persecute honest, and Orthodox <hi>Christians:</hi> and say thou meanest base, and dissembling <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> Yea, even while thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>left them so, and perhaps in some sence thinkest so, thou dost thinke, and know, and thy conscience now knowes, and thinkes to the contrary. A horrible stupidity, and blockishnesse: that none are lyable too, but such as the Devill hath blinded. But because their is no other way, to cure thee thereof: but by thus, shewing thee those secrets of thy heart, which thou couldest not have thought, <hi>God</hi> himselfe had been privy too. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, though small is my hope of thy amendment. Thou canst love any that are not religious; but thou hatest zeale, and devotion so inveterately, that thou canst in no wise, bare with it in any. Yea, thy Religion is, to oppose the power of Religion; and thy knowledge of the truth, to know how to argue against the truth As thou canst most wisely, and subtilly; (being prompted by <hi>Satan)</hi> argue against <hi>Gods</hi> people, and goodnesse it selfe: taking all occasions so to doe; though under other notions, and pretences, though thou hast not a word to speake for them, or it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence it is, that the power of religion. and the people of <hi>God,</hi> are <hi>every where spoken against as the chief Jews told Paul, Acts</hi> 28. 22. yea, whatsoever Sect or Heresie, thou pretendest: doe but ask thy owne couscience, whether thou dost not hate them; even for the graces of Gods spirit, which shine in them? and whether thou dost not carry an aking tooth against every

               <p>8. §.

               <p>Doth coveteousnesse rayne in you? Are you yet bewitcht with the love of money? Is your heart rivited to the Earth? Are you already inslaved to this sin? doe you make Gold your God? and Commodity the ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>First, Because, as their is no colours so contrary, as white and black. No elements so disagreeing, as fire and water: so there is nothing so opposite to grace, and conversion; as coveteousnesse. And as nothing so alienates a mans love from his vertuous Spouse, as his inordinate affection, to a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy strumpet: so nothing does so far separate, and diminish a mans love to <hi>God,</hi> and heavenly things: as our inordinate affection to the World, and earthly things. Yea, there is an absolute contrariety, and impossibility between the love of <hi>God,</hi> and the love of Money: <hi>Ye cannot serve</hi> God <hi>and Riches,</hi> Luke 16. 13. All those that doted upon <hi>Purchases,</hi> and <hi>Farmes,</hi> and <hi>Oxen; with o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:34200:34"/>
If a mans affections be downward, his hope and inheritance cannot be above. And they that expect no life after this, will make as much of this as they can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a coveteous man doe repent, he must restore what he hath wrongfully gotten, which perhaps may amount to half, or it may be three parts of his Estate at a clap: which to him is as hard, and as harsh an injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 2. <hi>Sacrifice thy Sonne, thine onely Sonne Isaac.</hi> Or as that of <hi>our Saviours to the young man,</hi> Luke 18. 22. <hi>Sell all that ever thou hast, and distribute unto the poore:</hi> And is there any hope of his yielding No, <hi>Coveteousnesse is Idolatrie,</hi> Ephe. 5. 5. Col. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>And Gold is the coveteous mans God: and will he part with his God, a certainty for an uncertainty? No. A godly man, is content to be poore in outward things, because his purchase is all inward: but nothing except the assurance of heavenly things, can make us willing to part with earthly things. Neither can he contemne this life, that knowes not the other: and so long as he <hi>keepes the weapon</hi> (evill gotten goods) <hi>in his wound,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves <hi>not to plucke it</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by restoring: how is it possible he should ever he cured? Whence it is that we shall sooner hear of an hundreth <hi>Malefactors</hi> contrition at the <hi>Gallows;</hi> then of one <hi>coveteous Mizers</hi> in his <hi>bed.</hi> To other sins, <hi>Satan</hi> tempts a man often: but coveteousnesse is a <hi>fine,</hi> and <hi>recovery</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>purchase.</hi> Then he is sure of him; as when a <hi>Jaylor</hi> hath lockt up his <hi>Prisoner</hi> safe in a <hi>Dungion,</hi> he may goe play.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Coveteous men, are blinde to all dangers; deafe to all good instructions: they are besotted with the love of money, as Birds are with their haue. Yet they resolve against their own conversion: The <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>These things considered, no wonder that our <hi>saviour</hi> expresly affirmeth, that <hi>it is easier for a Camel to goe through the eye of needle, then for a rich man</hi> (that is a coveteous rich man) <hi>to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Luk. 18. 25. and the <hi>Apostle, That no coveteous man, can looke for any inheritance in the Kingdome of Christ, and of God,</hi> Ephe. 5. 5. 1 Cor. 6. 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hence it is, that in all the Word of <hi>God,</hi> we read <hi>not</hi> of <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>coveteous, but Hypocrites:</hi> as <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Naball,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the <hi>rich Foole,</hi> and the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> For though <hi>Zacheus</hi> (before he met with <hi>Christ)</hi> knew nothing but to scrape: yet so soone as <hi>Christ</hi> had changed his heart, all his minde was set upon restoring, and giving, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 8. which also was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>We find many acts of deception in the the <hi>Saints</hi> infirmity in those acts, But coveteousnesse, that idolatrous sinne we find not. Once <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk with wine, never drunk with the <hi>World.

Once <hi>David</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the flesh, never with the World.

               <p>Coveteousnesse is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The first is, that they would not turne their backs, upon those <hi>Bookes</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> which shew them their sinnes, and the punishment of them mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> clearly: Because the viewing of our <hi>Counting Books,</hi> is the best means to keepe us from miscarring in our <hi>Estates.</hi> That they will not be so prone to dislike what crosseth their <hi>profits,</hi> or <hi>pleasures:</hi> as for the most part they are, especially if it be delivered with power: as I have knowne many, when injoyned to <hi>read a Booke,</hi> or <hi>beare a Minister preach,</hi> which in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, migtht have converted them, and saved their soules: resemble <hi>a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Patient,</hi> who after he is <hi>launced,</hi> and <hi>searched,</hi> flyes from his <hi>Chyrurgion,</hi> before the <hi>binding up</hi> of his <hi>wound,</hi> not suffering him to proceed to a <hi>perfect cure:</hi> alleadging, that they were so touched to the quick; that the truth was, they durst not heare, or read the same any further, which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34200:36"/>
they prefer the <hi>pleasing</hi> of <hi>their senses,</hi> before the <hi>saving</hi> of <hi>their soules:</hi> and that they <hi>like a thing the worse, for being the better:</hi> whereas if they were wise, they would love their <hi>Monitor</hi> so much the more, by how much the more they <hi>smart:</hi> Because <hi>wounds</hi> cannot be cured, without they be <hi>searched</hi> to the <hi>quick:</hi> and what wise <hi>Patient,</hi> but desires that <hi>physick;</hi> which is most <hi>proper</hi> for his <hi>disease,</hi> and will <hi>soonest, cure</hi> him? And without a <hi>discovery</hi> of our <hi>disease:</hi> how should there be a <hi>recovery</hi> of our <hi>health?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sight of our <hi>filihyness</hi> is the first step toward cleanness. Wholsome <hi>medicins</hi> will for the present <hi>bite,</hi> and offend: yet afterwards, they bring <hi>health</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> And certainly it is better to <hi>heare of their sinnes,</hi> then be <hi>damned for them.</hi> The <hi>Law Waspe</hi> like, <hi>stings</hi> shrewdly; but Satan that <hi>Hornet,</hi> will sting much worse. And he that will not at the <hi>first hand,</hi> buy good counsaile <hi>cheap:</hi> shall at the <hi>second hand,</hi> buy <hi>repentance</hi> over <hi>deare.</hi> For to <hi>fly from the light,</hi> and reject the meanes, as it ever argues <hi>a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi> (For none fear, shun, and <hi>hate the light,</hi> but <hi>evill doers,</hi> John 3. 19, 20, 21.) so it leaves men <hi>without hope.</hi> That sin is <hi>past cure,</hi> which turnes from, and <hi>refuseth the cure,</hi> Deu. 17. 12. <hi>Pro.</hi> 29. 1.

               <p>The second thing, that most <hi>Hearers,</hi> and <hi>Readers</hi> would be minded, and admonished of is; that when they <hi>hear Sermons,</hi> or meet with <hi>Books;</hi> that with <hi>Gods</hi> blessing, are of singular use, both to undeceive the deceived, &amp; to pluck sinners out of <hi>Satans snares;</hi> that are not inferiour to any mans compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or discourses; either for <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>method, argument,</hi> or <hi>elegancie:</hi> For moving the <hi>will,</hi> working upon the <hi>affections,</hi> or speaking home to the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>conscience:</hi> that they would not suffer <hi>Satan,</hi> by the tongues of any; so to forestall them with preiudice against the <hi>Authors;</hi> as to dislike their <hi>labours</hi> against their own reason and judgement; and refuse to read or hear them.

Yea, he was so generally slighted, by many of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and others Acts 17. 18. 2 Cor. 10. 10. That least their prejudice against his person, should cause them to slight whatsoever he either spake, or wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: (the better to vindicate himselfe) he spends almost three whole <hi>Chapters,</hi> in his owne praises, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11, and 12. <hi>chapters:</hi> And yet the worst they had to say of him, was; <hi>His Letters are waighty, and powerfull; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 10.</p>
