            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Should now ſo far be caſt out of your fauour:</l>

               </l>
               <l>Now ſhe is puft, and blowne vp in the bladder,</l>

               <l>It had been better that a chimny-ſweeper</l>

               <l>Yet in my iudgement, the beſt remedie</l>

               <l>She's gone to ſoiourne with our freindes a while:</l>
               <l>And when the child is begger, and can runne,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For I haue knowne ſome wenches, that haue borne</l>

               <l>If all the Cuckolds in the world were preſt,</l>
               <l>And ranged for the field in battaile-ray,</l>
               <l>So great an Armie there would be addreſt,</l>
               <l>As neuer was the like ſeene to this day:</l>

               <l>Nor all the Armies which haue beene prepared,</l>
               <l>Might with this band of Cuckolds be compared.</l>

               <l>Or tell the golden ſtarres which paue the skie,</l>
               <l>Then mayſt thou count the Cuckolds all of yore:</l>
               <l>For millions of men that haue beene married,</l>
               <l>Haue vnto Cornwell without boat been carried;</l>
               <l>And ſuch a crowd are of that reputation,</l>

               <l>And ſlander and diſgrace did ſtill attend it,</l>
               <l>(As all men know, it is a famous name,
And many married perſons ſhould defend it)</l>
               <l>Yet let no Cuckold take it to the heart,</l>
               <l>Since both his friends and neighbors beare a part:</l>
               <l>It is great comfort to a Cuckolds chance,</l>
               <l>That, many thouſands doe the Hornepipe dance.</l>

               <l>Grieue not to beare the horne vpon your creſt;</l>
