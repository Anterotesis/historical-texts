            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fruit of the Ebionites superstitious Doctrines, yet all the Ancient and best Writers in the purest times do give such honour to it, that whoever doubts of it must either be utterly ignorant, or wilfully blinded in the knowledge of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Doctrines of those times; and must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Candle to shew him the Sunne at noone day: <hi>Clemens</hi> onely seemes to cast some staine upon it by making all dayes equall, and every day a Sabbath; but upon narrow search, his meaning may appeare, not to deny the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day, but onely to blame the froth and vanity of sundry Christians, who, if they externally observed the day, they cared not how they lived every day after: nor is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, if <hi>Origen</hi> turne this day sometime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Allegory and a continuall spirituall Rest-day, who miserably transformes (many times) the plainest Scriptures into such shapes, and turnes their substance into such shadowes, and beating out the best of the Kernels, feeds his guests with such chaffe and husks; and although many other Festivals were observed by those times, which may make the Sabbath suspected to be borne out of the same womb of humane custome with the rest, yet we shall finde the seventh dayes Rest to have another Crowne of glory set upon the had of it by the holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of God in those times then upon those which superstition so soone hatcht and brought forth, so that they that reade the Histories of those times in observing two Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in some places, Easter, Whitsunday, yea divers Ethnick and Heathenish dayes, will need no other comment on those texts of <hi>Paul,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he condemnes the observation of Dayes; which
<pb facs="tcp:57760:3"/>
beginning to flie abroad in the day light of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, might well out-face the succeeding ages, and multiply with more authority in darker times; yet so, as that the seventh dayes rest (call it what you will) still kept its place and ancient glory, as in the sequell shall appear.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the good will of him who dwelt in the burning bush of the afflicted Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gave Princes and Emperours to be their nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing fathers; pious <hi>Constantine</hi> among other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Edicts, injoynes the observation of the Lords Day: wherein (if he was bound by his place to be a nourishing father) he went not beyond his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in swadling and cherishing this truth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Christ, and not suffering it to dye and perish through the wickednesse of men; the power of Princes extending to see Christs Lawes observed, though not to impose any humane inventions and Church constitutions of their own. Its true indeed that this Princely Edict was mixed with some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and corruption, it following too short in some things, and extending too far in others; but there is no just cause for any to stumble much at this, that knowes the sick head and heart by the weak and feeble pulse and crasie temper of those clouted, though otherwise triumphing times.</p>
                  <p>The Successours of this man-child (borne out of the long and weary throwes of the poore travelling Church) were inlarged generally in their care and conscience to preserve the religious honour due to this day, untill the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who in the latter end of his reign observing how greatly the Sabbath was profaned (especially by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and leaudnesse of Church-men) did therefore call five Nationall Councels (which I need not here
<pb facs="tcp:57760:4"/>
mention) in all which the Sabbath is advanced to as strict observation to the full, as hath been of late yeers condemned by some in the Sabbatarian Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: that it is a wonder how any man should cast off all shame, and so far forget himselfe, as to make the Sabbath a device of <hi>Fulco,</hi> or <hi>Peter Bruis, Eustachius,</hi> or the Book at <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and put the Visor of Novelty upon the aged face of it, as if it were scarce known to any of the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, but receiving strength and growth from Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> was first hatcht and received life from under the wings of a few late Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Zelots.</p>
                  <p>And it cannot be denied but that the Sabbath (like many other precious appointments and truths of God) did shake off her dust, and put on her comely and beautifull garments, and hath been much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and magnified since the times of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the doctrine and darknesse of Popery (like that of the Pharisees) not only obscuring the Doctrine of Faith, but also of the Law and obedience of Faith, and so hath obscured this of the Sabbath; only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did excell their forefathers the Scribes and Pharisees, for these added their own superstitious resting from things needfull and lawfull to their meerly externall observation of the day; but they (unto their eternall observation of the name of the Day) added their abominable prophanations to it, in May-games and May-poles, in sports and pastimes, in dancing and revellings, and so laid it level, and made it equall (in a manner) to the rest of their Holy dayes; that as they came to shuffle out the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment almost out of the Decalogue, so in time they came to be blinded with that horrour of darknesse, as to translate the words of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:57760:4"/>
into some of their Catechismes, <hi>Remember to keep the Holy Festivals,</hi> and therefore those Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the Reformation who have contended for all that honour which is due to this day, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly aspersed for pleading for a jewish and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious strictnesse, when the cause they handle is no other in truth, then to vindicate the Sabbath both in the Doctrine and observation of it from Papists prophanesse; and therefore all the world may see that under pretence of opposing in others a kinde of Iudaizing upon this day, the adversaries of it do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but maintain a grosse point of practicall Popery, who are by Law most ignorant and grosse prophaners of this day, and therefore when many of Christs servants are branded and condemned for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing so much of Religion in the observation of this day, and yet Bishop <hi>White</hi> and some others of them shall acknowledge as much as they plead for, if other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Festivals be taken in with it ordained by the Church, (as that they are the Nursery of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and all vertue, a meanes of planting Faith and saving knowledge, of heavenly and temporall blessings, and the prophanation of them hatefull to God and all good men that feare God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be punished in those which shall offend)</hi> they do hereby plainly hold forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what market they drive to, and what spirit acts them in setting up mans posts by Gods Pillars, and in giving equall honour to other Festivals and Holy dayes, which those whom they oppose do maintaine as due to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath alone, upon better grounds.</p>
                  <p>The Day star from on high visiting the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in <hi>Germany</hi> enabled them to see many things, and so to scatter much, yea most of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and horrible darknesse which generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
<pb facs="tcp:57760:5"/>
the face of all <hi>Europe</hi> at that day; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of them did not (as well they might not) see all things with the like clearnesse, whereof this of the Sabbath hath seemed to be one: their chiefe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty lay here; they saw a Morall command for a seventh day, and yet withall a Change of that first seventh day, and hence thought that something in it was Morall in respect of the Command, and yet something Ceremoniall because of the Change: and therefore they issued their thoughts here, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was partly Morall and partly Ceremoniall, and hence their observation of the day hath been (answerable to their judgments) more lax and loose; whose ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove the day partly Ceremonial, have (upon narrow examination) made it wholly Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; it being the usuall unhappinesse of such arguments as are produced in defence of a lesser Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to grow big with some man-child in them, which in time growes up; and so serve onely to maintaine a farre greater; and hence by that part of the controversie they have laid foundations of much loosnesse upon that day among themselves, and have unawares laid the corner stones of some grosse points of Familisme, and strengthned hereby the hands of Arminians, Malignants and Prelates, as to prophane the Sabbath, so to make use of their Principles for the introduction of all humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under the name and shadow of the Church; which if it hath power to authorize and establish such a day of worship: let any man living then name what invention he can, but that it may much more easily be ushered in upon the same ground: and therefore though posterity hath cause for ever to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Gods goodnesse for that abundance of light and life poured out by those vessels of glory in the first
<pb facs="tcp:57760:5"/>
beginnings of Reformation, yet in this narrow of the Sabbath it is no wonder if they stept a littele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the truth; and it is to be charitably hoped and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that had they then foreseen what ill use some in after ages would make of their Principles, they would have been no otherwise minded then some of their followers and friends especially in the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who might well see alittle farther (as they use to speake) when they stood upon such tall mens shoulders.</p>
                  <p>Its easie to demonstrate by Scripture and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as by experience, that Religion is just as the Sabbath is, and decays and growes as the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is esteemed: the immediate honour and worship of God which is brought forth and swadled in the three first Commandments, is nurst up and suckled in the bosome of the Sabbath: if Popery will have grosse ignorance &amp; blind devotion continued among its miserable captives, let it then be made (like the other Festivals) a merry and a sporting Sabbath; if any State would reduce the people under it to the Romish Faith and blinde obedience againe, let them erect (for lawfull pastimes and sports) a dancing Sabbath; if the God of this world would have all Professours enjoy a totall immunity from the Law of God, and all manner of Licentiousnesse allowed them without check of Conscience, let him then make an every-day Sabbath: if there hath been more of the power of godlinesse appearing in that small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure of the British Nation then in those vast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents elsewhere, where Reformation and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Church-Discipline have taken place, it cannot well be imputed to any outward meanes more, then their excelling care and conscience of honouring the Sabbath and although Master <hi>Rogers</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

to the <hi>39.</hi> Articles injuriously and wretchedly makes the strict observation of the Sabbath the last refuge of lies by which stratagem the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in former times being drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of al their other strong holds, did hope in time to drive out the Prelacy and bring in againe their Discipline; yet thus much may be gathered from the mouth of such an accuser that the worship and government of the Kingdome and Church of Christ Iesus is accordingly set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the Sabbath is honoured; Prelacy, Popery, Prophanesse must down and shall down in time, if the Sabbath be exactly kept.</p>
                  <p>But why the Lord Christ should keep his servants in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to cleare up and vindicate this point of the Sabbath, and welcome it with more Love then some precious ones in forraigne Churches, no man can imagine any other cause then Gods own Free Grace and tender Love, whose wind blowes where and when it will; <hi>Deus nobis haec otia fecit,</hi> and the times are coming wherein Gods work will better declare the reason of this and some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries by the British Nation, which modesty and humility would forbid all sober minds to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of now.</p>
                  <p>That a seventh dayes rest hath (therefore) beene of universall observation is without controversie; the Morality of it (as hath been said) is now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; in the Primitive times when the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was propounded <hi>Servasti Dominicum</hi>? hast thou kept the Lords Day? their answer was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally this, <hi>Christianus sum, intermittere non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum;</hi> i. <hi>I</hi> am a Christian, I cannot neglect it: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this day was the badge of their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.

<pb facs="tcp:57760:6"/>
from the tractates of some of our late Writers in this controversie; for it is no wonder if they that thrust the Sabbath out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and banish it out of the world untill <hi>Moses</hi> time, and then make it a meere ceremony all his time till Christs Ascension, if since that time they bring it a peg lower, and make it to be a humane Constitution of the Church, rather then any Divine Institution of Christ Iesus; and herein, those that oppose the Morality of it by dint of argument, and out of candor and conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their grounds on which they remaine unsatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I do from my heart both highly and heartily ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and especially the labours of Master <hi>Primrose</hi> and Master <hi>Ironside,</hi> many of whose Arguments and Answers to what is usually said in defence of the Morality of the day, who ever ponders them, shall finde them heavie; the foundations and sinewes of whose discourses I have therefore had a speciall eye to in the ensuing <hi>Theses,</hi> with a most free submission of what is here returned in answer thereto, to the censure of better minds and riper thoughts, being verily perswaded that whoever finds no Knots or Difficulties to humble his spirit herein, either knows not himselfe, or not the Controversie: but as for those whose chiefe arguments are reproaches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of embittered and corrupt hearts, rather then solid reasons of modest minds; I wholly decline the pursuit of such creatures whose weapons is their swell, and not any strength, and do leave them to his tribunall who judgeth righteously, for blearing the eyes of the world, and endeavouring to exasperate Princes, and make wise men beleeve that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sabbath is but a late Novelty, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tending to a high degree of Schisme, a phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Iudaizing, like his at <hi>Tewksbury Sabbata san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta

must reign; the Government of his House, the Laws of his Kingdom, the Solemn days of his worship must be established; the cause of his suffering and afflicted servants (not of our late religious scorners at Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Lawes and Sabbaths) who are now at rest from their labours, but in former times wept, and prayed and petitioned, and preacht and writ, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and dyed for these things, and are now crying under the Altar, must and shall certainly be cleared before men and Angels: Heaven and earth shall passe away, before one tittle of the Law (much lesse a whole Sabbath) shall perish.</p>
                  <p>But while I am thus musing, me thinks no measure of tears are sufficient to lament the present state of times, that when the Lord Iesus was come forth to vindicate the cause and controversie of <hi>Sion,</hi> there should rise up other Instruments of spiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in high places, to blot out the name and sweet remembrance of this Day from off the face of the earth; the enemies of the Sabbath are now not so much malignant time-servers, and aspiring bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles whom preferment principally byassed to knock at the Sabbath; but those who have eaten bread with Christ, (a generation of professing people) do lift up their heel against his Sabbath: so that what could not formerly be done against it by Angels of darknes the old Serpent takes another course to effect it by seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels of light; who by a new device are raised up to build the sepulchres of those who persecuted the Prophets in former times, &amp; to justifie all the books of sports, &amp; the reading of them yea all the former &amp; present profanations, yea scoffs &amp; scorns against the Sabbath day. For as in former times they have Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonialized it out of the Decalogue, yet by humane constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have retained it in the Church; so these of later times have spritualized it out of the Decalogue, ye out of
<pb facs="tcp:57760:8"/>
of all the Churches in the world.
For by making the <q>Christian Sabbath to be only a spirituall Sabbath in the bosome of God out of <hi>Heb. 4.</hi> they hereby abolish a seventh dayes Sabbath, and make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day equally a Sabbath to a Christian man.</q>
This I hope will be the last, but it is the most specious and fairest colour and banner that ever was erected to fight under against the Christian Sabbath; and is most fit to deceive not only some sudden men of loose and wanton wits, but especially men of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but too shallow minds. In times of Light (as these are reputed to be) Satan comes not abroad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually to deceive with fleshly and grosse forgeries, and his cloven foot, (for every one almost would then discerne his haltings) but with more mystical, yet strong delusions, and invisible chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whereby he bindes his captives the faster to the judgment of the great day. And therefore the watchword given in the bright and shining times of the Apostle, was, to <hi>Try the Spirits;</hi> and, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not every Spirit;</hi> And take heed of Spirits, who indeed were only fleshly and corrupt men, yet called <hi>Spirits,</hi> because they pretended to have much of the Spirit, and their doctrines seemed only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Spirit; the fittest and fairest cobwebs to deceive and intangle the world in those discerning times, that possible could be spun out of the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bowels of corrupt and ambitious wit.</p>
                  <p>The times are now come, wherein by the refined mysticall divinity of the old <hi>Monks,</hi> not only the Sabbath, but also all the Ordinances of Christ in the New-Testament are allegorized and spirituallized out of the world: And therefore 'tis no marvel when they abolish the outward Sabbath because of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Sabbath in Christ, if (through Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

But thus they wickedly separate and sever what God hath joyned and may well stand together, through the madnesse of which hellish practise I have long observed almost all the late and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errours of these times arise; and those men who have formerly wept for Gods precious Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and Ordinances, and have prayed for them, and pleaded for them, and have offered their lives in sacrifice for them, and fought for them, yea, that have felt perhaps the comfort, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and blessing of Gods Sabbaths, yea the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming and saving-power of Gods Ordinances to their owne soules; yet through pretences of more spirituall enjoyments above, and beyond, and without all these, they can part with these their old friends without weeping, and reject them as pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted rags, and fleshly formes, and dark vailes and curtaines which must be drawne aside, that so they may not hinder the true Light from shining in them.</p>

This onely I feare; that because of these indignites done thus to Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths even by the under-workings of some of Gods owne people, that the time hastens, wherein if no man should speake, yet the right hand of the sore displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a provoked God by plagues and confusion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glory of all flesh, will plead for his own Name, and for that in speciall which is engraven upon the forehead of his holy Sabbaths. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with regret of heart, in the dayes of her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and misery, all her pleasant things, and especially this of the Sabbath, <hi>Lam. 1.7.</hi> If the dayes of our rest and quietnesse cannot make us to relish the good things of his Temple in the fruition of our Sabbaths; then doubt not of it, but that the dayes of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall make a remnant to remember that they were pleasant things: of all the mercies of God to Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, this is reckoned to be one of the greatest, that he gave his Lawes to Israel, <hi>Psal. 147.19, 20.</hi> And of all Lawes, this of the Sabbath; (For so the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Captivity acknowledged it, <hi>Nehem. 9.14.</hi> who perhaps had far lower thoughts of it before

And if the very making of it known be such a sweet mercy, what then is the rest and peace of it, the blessing and comfort of it? for which I doubt not but many thousands are admiring God in heaven at this day. And shall a shady ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of an Every-day-sabbath, make us sell away for nothing such a heavenly and precious season, and make it common? The Lord Iesus wisht his Disciples to pray that their flight from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> might not be in winter, nor on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Matth. 24.20.</hi> accounting it a great misery, that his people should lose the publike benefit (through the disturbance of any) of one Sabbath-day; (for be it Iewish or Christian Sabbath, I now dispute not; sure I am it was a Sabbath-day, which it seemes was to continue after Christs Ascension to the Father, and therefore not wholly ceremonial) And shall we account it no affliction or misery to fight or flie, to ride or go, to work or play, to heare the Word in publike, or stay at home upon the Sabbath-day? Is it no mercy in these dayes to injoy many Sabbaths, which was so sore a misery in Christs account, and in the Apostles dayes to lose but one? if mans heart be lost in the necessary cumbers of the weeke, (upon the Sabbath) the Lord is wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it again to him; if any feare that the time of Grace is past, the continuance of the Sabbaths, (the speciall seasons of grace) confutes him; if a mans soul be wearied with daily griefs and outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the bosome of Iesus Christ (which is in speciall wise opened every Lords day) may refresh him; and shall we have and professe so little love to such a time, (more precious then gold to humbled hearts) as to cast away such a rich portion of precious time, and make it common under a pretence of making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

morall law, by the law of nature, and so make it to bee that law, which every man is taught by the light of nature.
<q>That which is morally and universally just (say some) which reason, when it is not mis-led, and the inward law of nature dictateth, by common principles of honesty, or ought to dictate unto all men without any outward usher: It is that (say others) which may be proved not only just but necessary, by principles drawne from the light of nature, which all reasonable men, even in nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, have still in their hearts, which either they doe acknowledge, or may at least bee convinced of without the Scriptures, by principles still left in the hearts of all men.</q>
But this description seems too narrow: For 1. Although it be true that the law naturall is part of the law morall, yet if the law morall be resolved into the law of nature only, and the law of nature bee shrunke up and drawne into so narrow a compasse, as what the principles left in corrupt man onely suggest and dictate; then it will necessarily follow, that many of those holy rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are not the law of nature, which were the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect impressions of the law of nature, in mans first creation and perfection, but now by mans apostacy are obliterated and blotted out, unlesse any shall thinke worse than the blinde Papists, either that mans minde is not now corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the fall, in losing any of the first impressions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent nature; or shall maintaine with them, that the Image of God (of which those first impressions were a part) was not naturall to man in that estate. 2.

If that onely is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted morall which is so easily knowne of all men, by the light of nature corrupted, then the imperfect light of mans corrupt minde must bee the principall judge of that which is morall, rather than the perfect rule of morality contained in the Scripture, which Assertion would not a little advance corrupt and blinde Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and dethrone the perfection of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

But wee must know that as transgression of any law doth not make a thing morally sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (for then to breake a ceremoniall law would be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sinne) so also obedience to every law doth not make a duty morally lawfull and good (for then obedience to a ceremoniall law, must be a morall obedience;) morall transgression therefore is a breach of such a law, which forbids a thing because it is evill, as morall obedience is our conformity to such a law which commands a thing because it is good: not that anything is morally evill in it selfe before it be forbidden, for then there should bee a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sinne before, and without any law to forbid it, which is most absurd, but because a thing is evill in it selfe, and is therefore forbidden, it is therefore morally evill: God may and doth make it <hi>fundamentally evill</hi> before it be forbidden, but it is not <hi>morally evill</hi> untill it be forbidden.

that this description given of a morall law, should give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to any to imagine, that some things are morally good or evill, before any law passe upon them, and that therefore there are some duties, and some sinnes, which are so without and before any law of God. For wee see that things good in themselves must be commanded, else they are not morall duties, yet withall they are therefore commanded because they are good in themselves. Its true that by the verdict of some of the Schoolemen, some du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are morally good, before any law commands them (as to love and magnifie God) and that some sinnes (as to curse and blaspheme God) are morally evill, before any law forbids them: but (to omit other answers) if such suppositions may bee rationally made (which some deny) yet it may bee upon good grounds denyed, that any duty can be morally good, or any sinne morally evill, untill some law passe upon them either to command or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the same. 'Tis indeed sutable and meet in nature for man to love God, and unsutable and unmeet to blaspheme and hate God; but such sutablenesse or unsutablenesse, as they make things fundamentally good or evill, so they cannot make any thing morally good or evill, unlesse we suppose some Law; for it would be in this case with man as 'tis in brute creatures, who doe many things unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (as to eate up and destroy their owne young) which yet are not morally sinfull, because they are not under any morall law; and <note n="*" place="margin">Alex Hal. <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When I say as sutable to man, and consequently to every man, I hereby exclude all lawes meerely Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Evangelicall from being morall, the first of which are sutable to some men onely, the other are not sutable to men as men, but to man as corrupt and fallen; and therefore binde not all men, but onely those among whom they are sufficiently and actually promulgated, as is evident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.22. But morall lawes are sutable to all men, and have an inward meetnesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to be observed of all men: For look as when the Lord gives Laws to any particular nation, whether immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himself, or mediately by man, he ever makes them sutable to the peoples peace and good of that nation; so when he makes lawes binding all mankinde in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he makes them sutable to humane nature or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde therein. And look as nationall Lawes binde not meerly by the meere will of the Law-giver, but from the <note n="*" place="margin">Driedo <hi>de lib.

What this sutablenesse to humane nature is, we shall shew, in due place; meane while, I doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by sutablenesse to humane nature, the inclination of humane nature now corrupted by sinne; for infused and supernaturall vertues and graces (to which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humane nature is not inclined) are (as <hi>Vasquez</hi> truly and strongly maintaines) in some sense naturall and good in themselves, not because humane nature is inclined to them, but because they are very congruous and consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous thereunto, and perfecting humane nature, as such, and consequently sutable thereunto: A good is said to be <hi>utile &amp; delectabile</hi> in respect of some profit or delight

As now in the divine nature, it's exceeding beautifull and comely for it (and therefore good in it selfe) to bee bountifull and mercifull, and to doe good unto the creature, although no profit could come to him thereby: It is Gods nature, as I may so say, so to doe; so 'tis in humane nature, it's a comely thing to honour parents, reverence Gods Name, to bee loving and mercifull to all men, in heart, word and deed; to give God a fit and the most meet proportion of time for solemne service of him, who allowes us many dayes to serve our owne good; this is good nature, and being thus seemly and suitable to it, this and such like things are therefore good in themselves, though perhaps neither profit or pleasure should come unto man hereby: And hence it's well observed by some of the Schoolemen, that right reason doth not make a thing morall, but only judgeth and discerneth what is morall; for right reason doth not make a thing suitable, but onely seeth whether it be so or no, a thing may bee suitable before right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son see it, yet when 'tis presented to reason it sees it suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the wall is white before the eye see it, yet when the eye doth see it, it appeares white also: It may bee a meet and comely thing to give God a seventh part of our time, though no mans reason can of it selfe find out such a meet proportion, yet when reason sees it, it's forced to acknowledge a comlinesse of equity, and suitablenesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as shall hereafter appeare.</p>

And hence I suppose it will follow, that the law for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of time to be dedicated to God, may well bee a morall law, although it depends much upon the will of the Law-giver, and is not so immediately written upon mans heart, nor so equally suitable to humane nature, as the law of love and thankfulnesse to God our Creator is:<note place="margin">

For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of which doubt, there is great silence generally in most Writers: Bishop <hi>White</hi> endeavours it by giving three rules to cleare up this mist; but (<hi>pace tanti viri</hi>) I much feare that he much darkens and obscures the truth herein,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>White</hi> Treat. of Sab. day. <hi>p.</hi> 26 28.</note> and muds the streames. For 1. Because the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is not simply morall, but hath something positive in it, he therefore makes it temporary, as appeares in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of that discourse: when as 'tis evident by his own confession, that some lawes positively morall are generall and universall.
<q>For lawes positively morall (he saith) are either personall onely, as was <hi>Abrahams</hi> comming out of his owne Countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. Some are for one Nation or Republick onely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2. Hee seemes to make lawes simply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely morall to bee such as are in their inward nature morally good, before and without any ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ernall impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law-giver: Now if by externall imposition he meanes the externall manner of Mosaicall administration of the law, there is then some truth in what he affirmes; for doubtlesse before <hi>Moses</hi> time the Patriarchs had the law revealed after another manner; but if by externall impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition bee meant externall Revelation, whether immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by God himselfe unto mans conscience, or mediately by man, then it's most false that any thing can be morally good or evill, much lesse entirely and simply so, before and without some such law: for though it may be good and sutable to man before a law pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e upon it, yet nothing can be morally good or evill without some law, for then there should bee some sinne which is not the transgression of a law, and some obedience which is not directed by any law, both which are impossible and abominable.
3. He <q>makes morall lawes by externall imposition and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution onely, to be such, as before the externall imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, are a diaphorous, and good or evill onely by reason of some circumstance.</q>
When as we know that some such lawes as are most entirely morall, yet in respect of their inward nature generally considered, they are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent also: for not to kill and take away mans life is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law intirely so, yet, in the generall nature of it, it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57760:25"/>
indifferent, and by circumstance may become either lawfull or unlawfull; lawfull in case of warre or publick execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of justice; unlawfull out of a private spirit and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall revenge.
In one word, the whole drift of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course herein, is to shew that the Sabbath is not morall, and this he would prove because the Sabbath is not simply and entirely morall, (which is a most feeble and weake conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) and this hee proves, <q>because the Sabbath day hath (in respect of its inward nature) no more holines and goodnes than any other day, all the dayes of the week being equally good by creation.</q>
But he might well know that the day is not the law of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the keeping holy of the Sabbath day, which is a thing inwardly good, and entirely morall if wee speak of some day:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note> Nay, (saith the Bishop) the law of nature teacheth that some sufficient and convenient time bee set apart for Gods worship; if therefore some day be morall, although all dayes by creation be indifferent and equall, according to his owne confession, what then should hinder the <hi>quota pars,</hi> or the seventh part of time from being morall? will he say because all dayes are equally holy, and good by creation? then why should hee grant any day at all to bee entirely morall in respect of a sufficient and convenient time to bee set apart for God? If hee saith the will and imposition of the Law-giver abolisheth its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, because he bindes to a seventh part of time; then we shall shew that this is most false and feeble in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell.</p>

                     <p>There are therefore four rules to guide our judgments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> aright herein, whereby we may know when a law is sutable and agreeable to humane nature, and consequently good in it selfe; which will bee sufficient to cleare up the Law of the Sabbath, to be truely morall (whether in a higher or lower degree of morality it makes no matter) and that it is not a law meerly temporary and ceremoniall.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Such lawes as necessarily flow from naturall relation, both between God and man, as well as between man and man; these are good in themselves, because sutable and congruous to humane nature: for there is a decency and sweet comlinesse to attend to those rules to which our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations binde us. For from this ground the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> cals for feare and honour of God as morall duties, because they are so comely and seemly for us, in respect of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57760:26"/>
the relation between us, If I be your Lord, and Master and Father, where is my feare? where is my honour? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. Love also between man and wife is pressed as a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty by the Apostle, from that near relation betweene them, being made <hi>one flesh, Ephes.</hi> 5.28, 29. there are scarce any who question the morality of the duties of the second Table, because they are so evidently comely, suitable and agreeable to humane nature, considered relatively, as man stands in relation to those who are or should bee unto him as his owne flesh; and therefore he is to honour su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and therefore must not kill, nor steale, nor lye, nor covet, nor defile the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the morality of all the rules of the first Table is not seen so evidently, because the relation between God and man, which makes them comely and suitable to man, is not so well considered: for if there be a God, and this God be our God, according to the first Commandement, then it's very comely and meet for man to honour, love, feare him, delight, trust in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if this God must be worshipped of man, in respect of the mutuall relation between them, then 'tis comely and meet to worship him with his owne worhsip, according to the second Commandment, and to worship him with all holy reverence according to the third Commandment; and if he must be thus worshipped, and yet at all times (in respect of our necessary worldly imploiments) cannot be so solemnly honoured and worshipped as is comely and meet for so great a God, then 'tis very fit and comely for all men to have some set and stated time of worship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some fit proportion, which the Lord of time onely can best make, and therefore a seventh part of time which he doth make, according to the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such lawes are drawne from the imitable Attributes and Works of God, are congruous and suitable to mans nature: For what greater comelinesse can there be, or what can be more suitable to that nature, which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made for God, then to be like unto God, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto those rules which guide thereunto? Hence to be mercifull to men in misery, to forgive our enemies and those that doe us wrong, to be bountifull to those that be in want, to be patient when we suffer evill, are all morall duties, because they are comely and suitable to man, and that because herein hee resembles and is made like unto God: Hence to labour six dayes and rest a leventh is a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57760:26"/>
morall, because a comely and suitable duty, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause herein man followes the example of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes most like unto him. And hence it is that a seventh yeare of rest cannot be urged upon man to be as much morall as a seventh day of rest, because man hath Gods example and patterne in resting a seventh day, but not in resting any seventh yeare; God never made himselfe an example of any ceremoniall duty, it being unsuitable to his glorious excellency so to doe, but onely of morall and spirituall holinesse; and therefore there is somewhat else in a seventh day that is not in a seventh yeare: and it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false to thinke (as some doe) that there is as much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for the observation of the one as there is of the other.
<q>And here by the way may bee seen a grosse mistake of Mr. <hi>Primrose,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prim. <hi>par.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</note> who would make Gods example herein not to be morally imitable of us, nor man necessarily bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it being not naturally and in respect of it selfe imitable, but onely because it pleased God to command man so to doe: as also because this action of God did not flow from such attributes of God as are in their nature imitable, as mercy, bounty, &amp;c. but from one of those attributes as is not imitable, and which wee ought not to imitate, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>omnipotency.</hi>
                        </q>
But suppose it did flow from his omnipotency, and that wee ought not to imitate his omnipotency, and that wee who are weaknesse it selfe cannot imitate omnipotent actions, yet its obvious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that such acts which arise from such attributes as cannot be imitated of us, in respect of the particular effects which are produced by them, yet in the actings of such attributes there may be something morally good which is imitable of us. As for example, though wee are not to imitate God in his miraculous works (as in the burning of <hi>Sodome</hi> and such like) yet there may bee that justice and wisedome of God shining therein which wee ought to imitate, for wee ought to see before we censure and condemne, as God did in proceeding against <hi>Sodome</hi>: So 'tis in this extraordinary worke of making the Word, wherein although we are not to goe about to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world within that time as God did, yet therein the labour and rest of God was seene, which is imitable of man; which labour and rest as they are morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so they are confirmed by a morall example, and therefore most seemly and comely for man to imitate from such an example:
<q>And whereas hee affirmes that this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57760:27"/>
example was not morall, because it was not it self imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, being grounded onely upon Gods free will:</q>
The reason is weake; for to labour in ones Calling is without controversie a morall duty (as idlenesse is a morall sin) yet if one would aske why man is to labour here, and not rather to lead a contemplative life in the vision and fruition of God immediately? I suppose no reason can be given, but the good pleasure of God, who in his deepe wisdome saw it most meet for man to spend some proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time in labour for himselfe, and some in rest for God, whereunto he gave man such an eminent example from the beginning of the world. Master <hi>Primrose</hi> cannot deny but that a convenient time for labour and rest in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, is morall:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <q>But (saith he) if God had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his will by a Commandment particularly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour six dayes and rest the seventh, the Jewes would not have thought themselves bound to this observation from Gods example onely; which shewes that there is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in it to bind the conscience for ever.</q>
But it may be as well doubted whether acts of bounty and mercy (to which hee thinks wee are bound meerely from Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) in respect of the particular application of these acts, to enemies of God and of our selves as well as to friends, be of binding vertue meerly by Gods example, unlesse we had a commandment thereunto: for in morall precepts, as the thing is commanded because it is good, so 'tis not morally good <note n="*" place="margin">

The commandment therefore in this case measuring out and declaring such a proportion, and what time is most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and comely for man to take to himselfe for labour, or to give to God for rest, it doth not abolish the morality
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57760:27"/>
of the example, but doth rather establish and make it: It sets out the most comely and meet proportion of time for labour and rest, and therefore such a time as is most good in it selfe, because most comely and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which being therefore commanded is a morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in man, and the example hereof morally binding in God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such lawes which mans reason may see, either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate light, or by any other externall helpe and light to bee just and good and fit for man to observe, such lawes are congruous and suitable to humane nature. I say by any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal helpe,</hi> as well as by <hi>innate light,</hi> for neither inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nor externall light doe make a thing just and suitable to man, no more than the light of the Sun or the light of a Lanthorne doe make the Kings high-way to the City, but they onely declare and manifest the way, or that which was so in it selfe before: Hence it comes to passe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mans reason cannot see the equity of some lawes, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedenter</hi> by innate light, before it bee illuminated by some externall light, yet if by this externall light the minde sees the equity, justice, and holinesse of such a law, this may sufficiently argue the morality of such a law, which was just and good, before any light discovered it, and is now discovered onely, not made to be so, whether by internall or externall light:

And hence it is, that although no reason or wit of man could ever have found out the most just and equall proportion of time, or what proportion is most comely and suitable, or that a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of time should have been universally observed as holy to God; yet if any externall light and teaching from above, shall reveale this time, and the equity and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of it, so that reason shall acknowledge it equall and good, that if we have sixe dayes for our selves, God should have one for himselfe, this is a strong argument that such a command is morall, because reason thus illuminated cannot but acknowledge it most meet and equall: For though reason may not by any naturall or innate light readily see that such a division of time is most suitable, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57760:28"/>
yet may readily erre and misconceive the most suitable and convenient proportion and division of time, it's then a sufficient proof of the morality of such a command, if the congruity and equity of it be discerned <hi>consequenter</hi> only (as we lay) and by externall light.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What ever law was once writ upon mans heart in <hi>pure nature</hi> is still suitable and congruous and convenient to humane nature, and consequently good in it selfe and morall. For whatever was so writ upon <hi>Adams</hi> heart, was not writ there as upon a private person, but as a common person, having the common nature of man, and standing in the roome of all mankinde: Hence as nothing was writ then but what was common to all men, so such things thus writ were good for all men and suitable to all men, it being most injurious to God, to think that any thing evill should be imprinted there: if therefore it bee proved that the law of the Sabbath was then writ upon mans heart, then it undenyably followes that it is meet and suitable to all men still to observe a Sabbath day; and indeed to the right understanding of what is suitable to man as man, and consequently morall, there is nothing more helpfull, than to consider of our primitive estate and what was suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our nature then; for if that which is morall in marriage is to be searched for, in the first and ancient records of our first creation by the appointment of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; I then know no reason (whatever others object) but morality in all other lawes and duties is there to bee sought also; for although our originall perfection is now defaced and lost, and in that respect is a <hi>merum non ens,</hi> (as some call it) yet it had once a being, and therefore in this controversie we may lawfully enquire after it, considering especially that this being which once it had, may be suffiently knowne by the contrary being of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall corruption that is in us now, as also by the light of the Scriptures, in which the searcher and maker of all hearts declares it unto us, and indeed there are many morall duties which will never appeare good and suitable to man, but rather hard and unreasonable (because im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible) untill we see and remember from whence we are fallen, and what once we had.</p>

Of such things which are not good, fit or needfull for man to observe without a command, as Sacrifices and Sacraments, and such likes: now herein, in such lawes, positive determination may be very well inconsistent with morality; and it may bee safely said that such a law is not morall, but rather posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and thus the learned sometimes speak. 2. Of such things as are equall, good in themselves, needfull and suitable for man; and here particular determination and morality may kisse each other, and are not to be opposed one to another: and hence it is that if Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment positively determines us to observe any part of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted worship (suppose Sacraments or Sacrifices) yet such lawes are not morall (although it bee morall in generall to worship God after his owne will;) because the things themselves are not good in themselves nor needfull: but if God shall determine us to observe a Sabbath day, this determination doth not take away the morality of the command; because it being good in it selfe to give God the meetest and fittest proportion of time for holy Rest, and the commandment declaring that this seventh part,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57760:29"/>
or so, is such a time, hence it comes to passe that this time is good in it selfe, and therefore <hi>determination</hi> by the commandment in this case, doth not abolish the morality hereof. It is a morall duty to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to give to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is <hi>Caesars</hi>: hence because a man may give too much or too little to him, that determination which directs us to that particular which is <hi>Caesars</hi> due and most meet for him to receive, and us to give, that is best in it selfe, and is therefore morall; so prayer is a morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but because a man may bee tempted to pray too oft, or else too seldome, hence determination of the fittest and this fittest season, makes this or that morall. So 'tis here in the Sabbath. I doe willingly and freely professe thus farre with our Adversaries of the morality of the Sabbath; that it is a morall duty to give God some time and day of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rest and worship, as 'tis morall to give <hi>Caesar</hi> his due, and to pray to God: but because we may give God too many dayes, or too few, hence the determination of the most meet and fittest proportion of time, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this time, makes this and that to be also morall. If no day at all in generall was good and fit for man to give to God, and God should notwithstanding command a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, then the commandment of such a day with such positive determination could not bee morall any more then the determination of sacrrifices and such like. But <hi>every day</hi> (say some of our Adversaries) <hi>some day</hi> (say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them) being acknowledged to be equall, just and good, and most meet to give to God, hence it is that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a seventh day doth not abolish but clear up that which is morall, because it points out unto man that which is most meet and equall: Hence therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a seventh day is therefore commanded because it is good, and not good meerly because commanded. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination also, declaring what is most meet, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hereby that this commandment is also morall, and not meerly positive and ceremoniall: which not being well considered by some, this fourth commandment (having some more positivenesse and determination then divers of the rest) hath therefore been the chiefe stumbling stone and rock of offence to many against the morality of it, by which they have miserably bruised themselves, while they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to destroy it, upon so grosse a mistake.</p>

'tis not now <hi>lex nata,</hi> but <hi>lex data,</hi> which is the rule of morall duties: The holy Scriptures containe the perfect rule of all morall actions, whether mans corrupted and imperfect light of nature see them or no.

Nor doe I thinke that any will question any one Commandment of this Table to bee good and suitable to humane nature, unlesse it be some <hi>Nimrod</hi> or <hi>Brennus</hi> (that professed he knew no greater justice than for the stronger, like the bigger fishes of the Sea, to swallow up the lesser in case they bee hungry) or some Turkish <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Caniball,</hi> or some surfetted Professor, transformed into some licentious opinionist, and so growne Master of his owne Conscience, and that can audaciously out-face the very light of nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, through the righteous judgement of God blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and hardning his heart: And if the Commandments of the second Table be thus farre good in themselves, are not those of the first Table much more? Is love to man (when drawne out into all the six streames of the second Table) good in it selfe, and shall not love to God, drawn out in the foure precepts of the first Table, as the Spring from whence all our love to man should flow, much more? Are the streams morally sweet, and is not the spring it self of the same nature? Love to God, and love to man are the common principles (saith <hi>Aquinas</hi> truely) of the law of nature; and all particular precepts (saith hee perhaps unawares) are conclusions flowing from these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. And are the principles good in themselves, and suitable to humane nature, and doe not all the conclusions participate of their nature? For what are all particular precepts, but particular unfoldings of love to God, and love to man? If all the precepts of the second

Table be morall, which doe onely concerne man, why should any of the first fall short of that glory, which doe immediately concerne God? Shall man have six, and all of them morally good, and God have but foure, and some one or more of them not so? Is it comely and good to have God to be our God in the first Commandment, to worship him after his owne minde in the second, to give him his worship with all the highest respect and reverence of his Name in the third, and is it not as comely, good and suitable, that this great God and King should have some magnificent <hi>day of state</hi> to be attended on by his poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and creatures, both publikely and privately, with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall respect and service, as oft as himselfe sees meer, and which we cannot but see and confesse to be most equall and just, according to the <hi>fourth Commandment?</hi> If mans life must bee divided into labour and rest, is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and good if wee have six dayes, that God should have a seventh? If the bruit beasts could speake they would say that a seventh dayes rest is good for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12. and shall man (who hath more cause and more need of rest, even of holy rest) say that it is not good for him even to rest in the bosome of God himselfe, to which he is called this day? Take away a Sabbath, who can defend us from Atheisme, Barbarisme, and all manner of Devilisme and prophanesse? And is it evill thus to want it, and shall it not be good to have it? I confesse if God had commanded a perpetuall Sabbath, it had not then been good but sinfull to observe any set Sabbath: but if God will have man to labour for himselfe six dayes, and this labour be morally good being now commanded; why is it not then as good to observe a seventh in rest to God, being also commanded of him?</p>

And hence they thinke that as the other nine are the summary and epitome of all morall Ordinances, so the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which was kept with the practise of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, was the summary and epitome of all the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ordinances, and hence the fourth Commandment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ceremoniall.</q>
But for answer to this wily notion, unjustly father'd upon <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> by some, it may thus farre be granted, that as the word <hi>Law</hi> is sometimes taken more strictly for the Decalogue onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Iames</hi> 3.8. and sometimes more largely, for the whole doctrine contained in all the writings of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the Gospel also is comprehended, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Psalme</hi> 119.1.51, 55. so the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is sometime taken more strictly for the covenant of works, which is contained compendiously in the Decalogue onely, writ by the finger of God, in two Tables, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13, 14 <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.38. and sometime more largely for all the holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moses, Exodus</hi> 24.7, 8. and 34.10. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 34.13. Now although all the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> may be called the Covenant, as it is largely taken; and so the covenant comprehends not onely morall, but ceremoniall lawes; yet they are never called That Covenant which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57760:32"/>
was writ by the finger of God in two Tables of stone, and given to <hi>Moses</hi>: and in this strict sense the word Covenant comprehends no other lawes but morall, nor can the places and texts which they alleadge evince the contrary, for in that place of <hi>Exodus</hi> 24.7. it is not said that the Tables of the Covenant, but the Booke of the Covenant was read in the audience of all the people; which Booke, we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge to comprehend ceremonials as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but not the Tables of the Covenant, of which the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion now is: so also when the Lord saith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.10. that he will make a Covenant, his meaning is that he will revive his Covenant by writing (as it is there set downe in the same chapter) in which writing it is very true that there is mentioned made of many ceremoniall lawes; but suppose this covenant written by <hi>Moses</hi> comprehends sundry ceremoniall lawes, will it therefore follow that the Tables of the Covenant written with the finger of God did the like?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> The morall law contained in the Decalogue, is nothing else but the law of nature revived, or a second edition and impression of that primitive and perfect law of nature, which in the state of innocency was engraven upon mans heart, but now againe written upon Tables of stone, by the finger of God. For man being made in the Image of God, he had therefore the law of holines, and righteousnes, in which Gods Image consisted, written in his heart: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his fall broken this Table, and lost this Image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing or doing the will of God through the law of sinne now engraven on it: Hence the Lord hath in much pitty made knowne his law again, and given us a faire copy of it in the two Tables of stone, which are the copy of that which was writ upon mans heart at first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the first Table containes <hi>Love to God in holinesse</hi>; the second, <hi>Love to man in righteousnesse</hi>: which holinesse and righteousnesse are the two parts of Gods Image which was once engraven upon mans soule, in his primitive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect estate, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24. Nor indeed doe I see how that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Argument will be otherwise answered, pleading for a possibility in man to keep the law perfectly in his lapsed and fallen estate in this life, for, say they, God makes no lawes of impossible things, it being unjust for God to require and exact that of a man which hee is not able to doe: to which it is commonly and truely answered, That man had once power to keep the law in his innocent estate, and hence though man be not able to keep it now, yet God may require it, because hee once gave him power to keep it; and that therefore it is no more unjust to exact such obedience which hee cannot performe, than for a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to require his money of his broken debtor, or spend-thrift, who is now failed (as they say) and not able to repay. Man therefore having once power to keep the law, and now having no power, this argues strongly that the law of the Decalogue contains nothing but what was once writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as a law of life upon his heart in his innocent estate: for I see not how Gods justice can be cleared if he exacts such obedience in the Decalogue which is impossible for man to give, unlesse the very same law and power of obedience was written upon his heart at first: and therefore it is a wilde notion of theirs who thinke that the Covenant of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57760:34"/>
works which God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> is not the same for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Covenant of works exprest in the morall law; for wee see that there is the same Image of holinesse and righteousnesse required in the Tables of stone, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Covenant, which was once written upon mans heart, and required in the same manner of him. Now this law thus revived and reprinted is the Decalogue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most naturall and suitable to humane nature, when it was made most perfect, therefore it is universall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall; the substance also of this law being love to God and man, holinesse toward God, and righteousnesse toward man, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.37, 39. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. Hence also this law must needs bee morall, universall and perpetuall, unlesse any should bee so wicked as to imagine it to be no duty of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall or perpetuall equity, either to love God, or to love man, to performe duties of holinesse toward the one, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of righteousnesse toward the other: Hence again, the things commanded in this law are therefore commanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are good, and are therefore morall, unlesse any shall think that it is not good in it selfe to love God or man, to be holy or righteous; and which is still observable, there is such a love required herein, and such a lovelinesse put upon these lawes, as that by vertue of these all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in other things, which are not moral, becomes love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for there were many ceremoniall observances, in which and by which the people of God exprest their love to God, as Mr. <hi>Primrose</hi> truely concludes from <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37, 38, 40. but yet this love did arise by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a morall rule,<note place="margin">par. 2. cap. 6. l. 12.</note> for therefore it was love to worship God in ceremoniall duties, because it was lovely to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God with his own worship (of which these were parts) which is the moral rule of the second Commandment.
<q>And hence Master <hi>Primrose</hi> may see his grosse mistake in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one law of the Decalogue ceremoniall, because the summary of the Decalogue being love to God and love to man, and our love to God being shewne in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall as well as in morall duties, because our love is seen &amp; shewn in our obedience to all the Commandments of God, ceremonial as well as moral.</q>
For though there be love in ceremonial dutys, it is not so much in respect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as in respect of some morall rule by vertue of which such duties are attended.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57760:38"/>
this or that particular day, is of it selfe changeable being secondarily morall: For if it bee a morall duty to sanctifie a seventh day which God shall appoint, then it's morall (as it were) in the second place to sanctifie this or that seventh interchangeably which God doth appoint, and yet it doth not follow that this or that particular seventh is in it selfe ceremoniall, because it is changeable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some of our Adversaries in this Controversie, will not acknowledge any set time or day to be morall by vertue of this Commandment, because they think that That particular seventh day from the creation is onely commanded but now abolished under the Gospel; and it onely is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (they say) because it is onely <hi>expressed</hi> and made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in the Commandment; I confesse that That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular seventh is expressed and pointed at, but not onely expressed (as wee shall shew in fit place) but suppose it were granted, that That seventh onely is expressed, yet it will not follow that therefore a seventh day, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a day, and consequently a time of worship is excluded: for look as 'tis in the second Commandment, we see the worship of a <hi>graven Image</hi> is particularly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and yet that which is more generall, is also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forbidden, <hi>viz.</hi> the worship of God by <hi>humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> and why may not the like generall bee enjoyned by commanding that particular seventh in the fourth Commandment? Others of our adversaries, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, acknowledge therefore, that in this particular se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth (which they make ceremoniall) something more generall and morall is herein required, but this generall they limit to a time or some day of worship, but a seventh day which is more generall then that particular seventh, yet lesse generall then a day or time, they fly from this as from some serpent or bugbear, and will not admit it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing generally morall in this Commandment: But it is very observeable in this Controversie, that upon the same grounds on which they would exclude this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of a seventh from being morall, they may as well exclude their owne generals, <hi>viz.</hi> a time or a day from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morall: for if they thinke it irrationall, that because a particular seventh day is required, that therefore a seventh day more generall cannot be commanded; why is it not as irrationall upon the same ground to exclude a time, a day also? Surely a seventh day lyes nearer the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of a particular seventh, and is of nearer kin to it then a day. And I marvaile that they should gather a solemne time and day of worship, which is more generall, rather then a seventh out of that particular day, as not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57760:39"/>
possibly to be intended, although in a manner expressed in the Commandment it selfe. I know there are some who thinke that there is nothing generally morall in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but a <hi>seventh day</hi>; which unlesse it bee well and warily explicated, I then crave leave to concur thus farre with our adversaries, <hi>viz.</hi> That a solemne time, and a day of worship are generally morall in this command, but not onely morall, but that a seventh day also which God shall determine is generally, yea principally morall also in this Commandment.</p>

                     <p>First, <hi>Graven Images,</hi> after which the whole world almost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> hath been enticed, and gone a whoring from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; were worshipped two wayes: 1. <hi>Terminativè, i.</hi> When people terminated their worship upon the dumb Idols themselves, as if they <hi>were gods,</hi> without looking any further to any God more supreame and glorious: This is the sinne of many of the ignorant sort of Papists by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine's</hi> owne confession, as also many of the brutish sort of the blinde heathens: And this kinde of worship and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is directly forbidden, not in the second, but in the first Commandment; and that appeares upon this undenyable ground, to wit, that if the first Commandment expressely enjoynes us to have no other God but Jehovah, to trust in, pray to, love, feare no other God but Jehovah, then for any to have and worship such Images as their gods which are not Jehovah, is directly forbidden here: Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it undenyably follows, that by the making to our selves a graven Image, in the second Commandment, somewhat else must be understood then the <hi>worshipping</hi> of Images termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively as <hi>gods.</hi> 2. Or else they were worshipped <hi>relativè, i.</hi> Relatively or in reference to the true God, as <hi>meanes</hi> and <hi>helps,</hi> In which, At which, and by which, the true God was worshipped: And thus the learned and well instructed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists maintaine their abominable worship of Images, whether graven or painted, crosses, crucifixes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be good and lawfull; for say they, we doe not worship, nor are wee so senselesse as to honour the Image, or Crucifix it self, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57760:42"/>
onely as helps to devotion, to carry our hearts to God and Christ, resembled by these Images: Thus also the Jewes of old, they did never worship the Images themselves, but God in them and by them: They were not growne so soon, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly sottish, as to thinke that the golden Calfe was the true God himself which brought them a few weeks before out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but it was a visible help to carry their hearts to God onely, and therefore the Feast was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed to Iehovah, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5. <hi>Micha's</hi> Idolatrous mother professeth that shee had dedicated the eleven hundred she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels of silver to Iehovah to make a molten Image, <hi>Iudg</hi> 17.3. she was not simple (no not in those confused and blinde times) to thinke that the Image was Iehovah, nor did her son <hi>Micah</hi> think so, and therefore he doth not say, <hi>Now I know that the</hi> Teraphim <hi>will blesse me,</hi> but that <hi>Iehovah will now blesse me,</hi> having set up an Image for his service. Nay verily, the wisest and best instructed among the Heathens did never think that the Idols and Images themselves were God, but they only worshipped God by them; which if any doubt of,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid</hi> Rain. <hi>de Eccles. Rom. Idol.</hi> l. 2. c. 3.</note> let him but read Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> who by preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and most evident proofs demonstrates, that neither the Iewes, nor the Heathens in their deepest apostacies, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worship their Images any other wayes then <hi>relatively,</hi> as helps and meanes of the worship of the true God; and hereby sets forth the abominable Idolatry of the Romish Church, for such a worship of their Images, which even themselves condemne in the Idolatrous Iews and Heathens, who had as much to say for their Image worship as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists have: Hence therefore it followes, that if the graven Image in the second Commandment, was not <hi>worshipped as God,</hi> but onely as a means devised and invented by man to carry the heart unto God, then (by a usuall <hi>Synechdoche</hi> in every command) all humane <hi>inventions and institutions, and devised meanes of worship,</hi> or of carrying the heart better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, are forbidden in this Commandment; and if all humane <hi>institutions and devised meanes of worship,</hi> be herein directly forbidden, then certainly <hi>All divine institutions and meanes of worship,</hi> and consequently <hi>All Gods instituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in Ministry, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> is directly commanded in the affirmative part of this second Command; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not in the fourth Command: And if all Orthodox Divines condemn the Popish relative worship of Images, as directly crosse and contrary to the second Command, I then see no reason why any should question, but that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57760:43"/>
meanes of worship (Images as it were of Gods owne devising) should belong to the affirmitive part of the same Command. The second thing to be explained in this Commandment is, What is love to God and keeping of his Commandments, which we read of in the close of the Commandment? <hi>Love to God</hi> is here opposed to <hi>Hatred of God,</hi> and those that <hi>Love him,</hi> to those that <hi>Hate him</hi>: Now this <hi>Hatred</hi> is not hating of God at large (for there is a hatred of God in every sinne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. and 8.36.) but in particular, when it appeares in this particular sin of setting up of Images and mens inventions, forbidden in this Commandment, which therefore sets down the proper punishment for this sin: So by love of God, is not meant love of God at large (which is seen in keeping every Command) but in particular, when we love God in his owne Ordinances and institutions. Look therefore as hatred of God in setting up mans inventions and institutions (which superstitious persons thinke to be much love to God) is here condemned in the negative part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; so on the contrary, love to God in closing with him and seeking of him in his <hi>owne Institutions,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. is here enjoyned in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part of this Command, and consequently not (as <hi>Wallaeus</hi> would have it) in the affirmative part of the fourth Command, <hi>Keeping my Commandments</hi> being set downe as a fruit of this love, and both together being opposed to hatred of God: Hence by <hi>Commandments,</hi> cannot be meant in generall, all the ten Commandments (as some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine upon miserable weake grounds, which I lift not to mention) but in speciall, Gods Institutions and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances commanded in speciall by him, to which humane inventions and Images of mens heads and hands, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Scripture opposed, and are therefore condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because not commanded, or because none of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Ier.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.30, 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. If therefore (againe) Gods Institutions and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are here enjoyned in this second Commandment, they cannot bee directly required in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. These things being thus cleared, the objections of <hi>Wallaeus</hi> are easily answered: For first, he saith,
<q>That from the negative part of this second Commandment cannot be gathered such an affirmative part as this is,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
That God will be worshipped by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But that this assertion thus barely propounded,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57760:44"/>
but not proved, is false, appeares from what hath been said concerning the true meaning of the negative part of this Command: For if humane inventions, under the name of <hi>graven Image</hi> bee forbidden, then Divine Institutions, such as <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> bee, are here commanded, and from that negative any ordinary capacity may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see what the affirmative is. Hee saith again second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<q>That if instituted worship was contained under the affirmative part of the second Commandment,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> then this Commandment is mutable, because God was thus worshipped one way before Christ, and another way since Christ; but (saith he) the second Commandment is morall, and therefore immutable, and therefore such mutable worship cannot be enjoyned herein.</q>
But we have <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Thes.</hi> 34</note> formerly shewne that although this Commandment be morall and immutable in respect of it selfe, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the application of it to this or that object or thing commanded, it may be in that respect mutable: For it is an immutable law that God must be worshipped with his owne worship, such as hee shall institute (and this is the summe of the second Commandment it selfe) yet the things instituted (wherein there is onely an applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the command) may be mutable: the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment doth not immutably binde to the observance of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular instituted worship onely: But to observe Gods instituted worship, and to attend his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is the onely morall law and rule in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative part of this Command. Hee thirdly objects,
<q>That the <hi>worshipping</hi> of God in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> &amp;c. is never opposed in all the Scripture to the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images.</q>
But this is false; for Gods Institutions (of which Word and Sacraments are a part) are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently opposed to humane inventions, the worship ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to the worship devised by man: Images of Gods devising, are oft opposed to Images of mens owne inventing; the voice of God which was onely heard with the eare, is opposed to an Image or similitude which might bee seen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. A graven Image, a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of lies, is opposed to the Lords teaching of truth, and also to his presence in his Temple, which was the seat of instituted worship, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. The worship of Images which God would have abolished, is opposed to the worship of God by Sacrifices and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in the place which God should chuse, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 12.1.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57760:44"/>
to 20. but yet he tels us, <hi>That to worship God in Images, and to worship him in Spirit and Truth (which is inward worship) are opposite: as also the lifting up of pure hands in every place,</hi> John 4.28. 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>Hee tels us also that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of God in his Immensity and Infinite Majesty, are opposed to Image-worship,</hi> Rom. 1.20, 21, 22. Isa. 40.22. Bee it so: But will it therefore follow, that to worship God according to his own Institutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not to <hi>worship him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in Truth</hi>? Is it rather a carnall than a spirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to attend on God in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments?</hi> May we not lift up pure hands in the use of Gods own institutions? Is not Gods Immensity and Majesty acknowledged and seen in the use of his owne Ordinances, as well as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and providences? I confesse the blinder sort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens might worship stocks and stones and Images of cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things, and four-footed Beasts, in the place of God himselfe terminatively, and God might account of all their Image-worship as such, though used relatively, and hence the opposition may well bee made between worshipping them as God, and an infinite God; and this worship (as was said) fals then under the first Commandment: but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly this Image-worship which the Apostle condemnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 23. in debasing the infinite Majesty, and limiting it to this and that Image wherein they did worship it, is forbidden (being only relative worship) in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For I think the Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. hath an eye prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally at the most lascivious Idolaters in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom principally we read of those Images of creeping things and foure-footed beasts, in their <hi>Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphicks</hi>: and yet we know that all that base worship did set out something or other of the <hi>Deity,</hi> which therein (and so relatively) they did worship. But I must not enter into the Discourse of these things here: sufficient is said to cleare up this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That Gods instituted worship fals directly under the second, not fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                     <p>It is true, that the <hi>exercise of publick worship</hi> of many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/> together, is to be at this time upon the Sabbath, but doth it follow that therefore this <hi>publick worship it self</hi> falls directly under this command? For if publick Assemblies bee (as some think) a part of naturall worship, so as that the light of nature directs all men dwelling together as creatures, to worship God together publickly as Creator,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57760:45"/>
then this worship fals directly under the first (not fourth) Commandment, where natural worship is directly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but if <hi>publick Assemblies</hi> be considered as distinct Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>politically</hi> united and combined, publickly to worship God; then such Churches considered thus as politicall, not mysticall Assemblies, do fall directly under the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as parts of instituted worship: for as all devised formes of Churches, whether Diocesan, Provinciall, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Universall (being the inventions of man to further the worship of God) are condemned directly in the second Command: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> all such Churches as are framed into a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall policy, after the fashion and patterne of the Word and primitive institution, are (with leave of <hi>Erastus</hi> and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) enjoyned in the same Commandment, and therefore not in the fourth.<note place="margin">Gom. <hi>Inv. sent. &amp;</hi> Orig. <hi>Sab. ca</hi> 5.

                        <hi>Gomarus</hi> and Master <hi>Primrose</hi> therefore do much mistake the mark, and scope of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who affirme, <hi>That as in the three first Commandments, God ordained the inward and outward service, which hee will have every particular man to yeeld to him in private and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the society of men every day, so in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment he enjoyneth a service common and publick, which all must yeeld together unto him, forbearing in the mean while all other businesse.</hi> But why should they think that publick worship is more required here than private? Will they say that the Sabbath is not to bee sanctified by private and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship, as well as by publick and externall worship? Is not private preparation, meditation, secret prayer and converse with God, required upon this day, as well as publick praying and hearing the Word? If they say that these are required indeed, but 'tis in reference to the publick, and for the publick worship sake, it may be then as easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the publick worship is also for the sake of the private, that each man secretly and privately might muse and feed upon the good of publick helps; they are mutually helpfull one to another, and therefore are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one for another, unlesse any will thinke that no more holinesse is required upon this day than while publick worship continues; which we hope shall appeare to bee a piece of professed prophanesse: In the meane while, looke as they have no reason to thinke that private worship is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this command, because the exercise of private worship is at this time required; so they have as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to thinke that the publick worship it selfe is herein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, because the exercise of it is to be also at such a

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> To both these places therefore, a threefold Answer may bee given: First, Admit the gradation in them both, yet by dayes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. is not necessarily meant, all weekly Sabbath dayes, for there were other dayes Ceremoniall which the Iewes observed, and which the Iewish teachers urged, besides the Sabbath; to instance onely in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision which they zealously prest, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. which we know was limited unto the eighth day, and which they might urge as well as Circumcision it selfe. However, look as the Apostle when he condemnes them for observing <hi>times,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which signifies <hi>Fit seasons,</hi> he doth not therin condemn them for observing <hi>all</hi> fit seasons (for then wee must not pray nor heare the word in fit seasons) but hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the Iewish Ceremoniall times and seasons; so when he condemnes the observation of dayes, the Apostle doth not condemne the observation of all dayes (for then dayes of fasting and feasting must be condemned, as well as dayes of resting, under the new Testament) but the observation of Ceremoniall dayes, which the Iewes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and false teachers urged: and indeed the Apostle speaks of such dayes as were beggerly elements and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57760:49"/>
now <hi>Iames</hi> speaking of the morall law, which comprehends Sabbath dayes, hee doth not call it a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly law, but a roiall law, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8.12. nor doth hee make subjection thereunto, to be the bondage of servants (as that was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9.) but the liberty of children, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a royall law of liberty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Suppose the weekly Sabbath bee here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under dayes, as also that by Sabbaths is meant weekly Sabbaths, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. yet hereby cannot be meant the Christian Sabbath, but the Iewish Sabbath: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle condemnes that Sabbath and those Sabbath dayes, which the Iewish teachers pleaded for, among the Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians; now they never pleaded for the observation of the Christian Sabbath, but were zealous and strong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters for that particular seventh day from the creation, which the Iewes their fore-fathers for many yeares before observed, and for the observation of which, some among us of late begin to struggle at this day: Now, as was said, admit the gradation; we doe not observe the Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, nor judge others in respect of that Sabbath, no more than for observing new moones, or holy dayes, we do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne the observation of that Sabbath: If it bee said, why, doe we not observe new moones and holy dayes as well, by substituting other dayes in their roome, as we doe a Christian Sabbath in the room of that Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? wee shall give the reason of it in its proper place, which I mention not here, lest I should <hi>bis coctam apponere.</hi> These places therefore are strong arguments for not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that seventh day which was Iewish and ceremoniall, but they give no sufficient ground for abandoning all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbaths under the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is a double observation of dayes (as <hi>Wallaeus</hi> and <hi>Davenant</hi> well observe) 1. Morall. 2. Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.<note place="margin">Daven <hi>in Col.</hi> 3. Wall. <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>praec.</hi>

And that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> hardnesse of heart strengthened him in his sin against God unto the last gasp, and hence it is also that the deepest and greatest spirit of mourning for sin is poured out upon Beleevers, after God hath poured out upon them the spirit of grace, as is evident, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11. because the bloud of Christ which was shed for the killing of their sinne, now makes them sensible of their sinne, because it's now sprinkled and applyed to them, which it was not before, for they now see all their sins aggravated, being now not onely sinnes against the law of God, but against the bloud and love of the Son of God: It is therefore a most accursed doctrine of some Libertines, who imagining that (through the bloudshed and righteousnes of Christ in their free justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) God sees no sinne in his justified people, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The outward law therefore is the rule: The law of the Spirit of life (which is the internall law)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57760:55"/>
is called a law, not in respect of perfect direction (which is essentiall to the rule) but in respect of mighty and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall operation, there being a power in it as of a strong law effectually and sweetly compelling to the obedience of the law: For as the law of sinne within us (which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls, the law of our members, and is contrary to the law of our mindes, or the law of the spirit of life within us) is not the rule of knowing and judging what sinne is, but the law of God without, <hi>Romans</hi> 7.7. and yet it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a law, because it hath a compulsive power to act and encline to sin, like a mighty and forcible law; so the law of the spirit of life, the law of our mindes, is called a law, not that it is the rule of a Christians life, but that it compels the heart, and forceth it like a living law to the obedience of that directing rule (when it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true indeed, 1. That the spirit inclines the heart to the obedience of the rule; 2. It illuminates the minde also many times to see it by secret shinings of preventing light, as well as brings things to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, which they knew before: 3. It acts them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometime, so as that when they know not what to pray, it prompts them, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.26. When they know not what to speake before their Adversaries, in that day it's given to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.19. When they know not whither to goe nor how to goe, it's then a voice behinde them, and leads them to fountaines of living waters, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 30.21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.17. But all these and such like quickning acts of the spirit, doe not argue it to be our rule, according to which wee ought to walke, but only by which or by meanes of which we come to walke, and are <hi>enclined, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and inabled to walke according to the rule,</hi> which is the law of God without. For the Pilot of the ship is not the compasse of the ship, because that by the Pilot the ship is guided: nor doth it argue that the Spirit is our rule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he guides us according to the rule: It is not essentiall to the rule to give power to conforme unto it, but to be that <hi>according</hi> to which we are to be conformed: And therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57760:55"/>
it's a crazy argument to prove the law of the Spirit to be the rule of our life, because it chiefly gives us power to conforme unto the rule; for if the law be that according to which are to bee guided, although it should give us no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet this is sufficient to make it to be our rule.</p>

For either their writing and preaching the Gospell was not an externall and outward Ministry (which is crosse to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense) or it was not Christs Ministery, which is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to imagine: and it is a vain shift for any to say, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was Christs Ministery, yet it was his Ministery as under the Law and in the flesh, and not in meere glory and spirit: for its evident that the Apostles preachings and writings, were the effect of Christs ascension and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8.11. when hee was most in the spirit, and had received the spirit that hee might poure it out by this outward Ministery, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. and it is a meer New-nothing and dream of Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> and and others, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Christ in the flesh and Christ in the Spirit, as if the one Christ had a divers Ministery from the other: For when the Comforter is come (which is Christ in the Spirit) what will he doe? he will lead (its said) unto all truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13 But what truth will he guide us into?

They that see how justly they deserve to bee forsaken of God and given over to their owne hearts lusts, and to be for ever sinning and blaspheming God in hell, where God will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to think of him, speak of him, doe for him, pray to him more, cannot but account it a high and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favour of Jesus Christ to command them any thing, or bid them doe any thing for him; a poore humbled prodigall will account it great love to bee made a hired servant; <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> will count it a high favour if he may but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Christs shoe-latchet, and bee commanded by him to doe the meanest worke for him: <hi>David</hi> wondred at Gods grace toward him, that God should command him, and in some measure enable him to offer willingly, <hi>Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>what are wee?</hi> I doe therefore marvaile how any can pretend that they are acted by the love of Christ, and not by the law of commands, considering that there is so much love in this for Christ to command, and how they can professe their relish of preaching Gods free grace and love, and yet cannot away with sweet and gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations pressing to holinesse and holy duties, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing and urging of which there is so much free-grace and heart-love of Christ Jesus; surely if the love of Christ is to lead us, then the commands of Christ (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee discovers one chiefe part of his love) are to guide us and be a rule of life unto us, The man who in his cool and deliberate thoughts imagines that a Christian under the rule of the law, is a Christian under bondage, may be

justly feared that himself is still under the bondage of sin and Satan, and never yet knew what the true love of Christ Iesus is to this day.</p>

layes the basis of refusing to doe any duty, or conforme to any law <hi>in our owne persons</hi>: for if this principle bee true (which no Orthodox writer doubts of) <hi>viz.</hi> That we are to seek for no righteousnesse in our selves to our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because wee are perfectly just and made righteous for that end in Christ, then it will undenyably follow that wee are not to seek for any holinesse and sanctification in our selves, because we are perfectly sanctified also in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who hath repented, and beleeved, and mortified sinne perfectly for us in his owne person; Look therefore as the perfection of Christs righteousnesse to our justification, should make a Christian abhorre any personall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his owne to his justification, so if wee bee perfectly sanctified in Christ, then perfection of Christs holinesse to our sanctification should make a beleever not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Law, but to abhor all personall holines through the Spirit to our sanctification, and then a Beleever must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to seek any love or feare of God in his heart, which is not painted but professed prophanesse, and the inlet not <hi>per accidens</hi> but <hi>per se,</hi> to all manner of loosenesse and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the world.</p>

He brought in such a righteousnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as might merit mercy and make us just: now this is wholly in Christ out of our selves; but because there was a righteousnesse of new obedience and thankfulnesse to be wrought in us for this love, therefore, 2.

Christ did for us in himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he did not beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and performe duties of thankfulnesse for us, because these and such like are not to satisfie justice, but follow as fruits of that satisfaction, and therefore are wrought within us, and so are personally required of us, and therefore when a Christian findes a want of these things in himselfe, he is not to comfort himselfe with fond thoughts of the imputation of these in Christ onely unto him, but he is to look up to Christ Jesus for derivation of these out of Christ into himselfe; otherwise by making Christ his sanctification, onely in way of imputation, he doth really destroy Christ from being his sanctification; for if Christ be our righteousnesse onely by imputation, then if Christ be our sanctification, it must be by derivation from him, which they must needs destroy who make him their sole sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by meere imputation.</p>

that he that runnes may read it: For hence it undeniably followes, that in a case a Beleever fall into any sinne, of whordome, murder, theft, witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These wicked acts though they be sins in themselves (because they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law) yet they are not sinnes <hi>unto him,</hi> because he is now set free from the law, and not bound to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it by vertue of any command: for where there is no law, there is no transgression; and if there bee no law which bindes him, there is no transgression then at least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: <hi>They are sinnes indeed in themselves, but not unto him, they are sinnes</hi> (as some say) <hi>to sense, but not to faith, sinnes in the conversation, but not to conscience, sinnes before men (because they may crosse their lawes) but not sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who exempts them from all law</hi>: And it is in vaine here to reply, that they may bee sinnes To him, because they may be against the law of the Spirit which is his rule; for we have already shewn, that although the spirit be the principle by which we obey, yet it is not our rule according to which we are to obey: Indeed it is an high aggravation of sinne when it is against the spirit, but to crosse the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not firstly make these things sinfull, nor could they be sinnes unlesse they crosse such a spirit as speakes in and by some holy law, the very essence of sinne lying in the transgression (not of any law) but of the law, <hi>i.</hi> the known morall or Evangelicall law.

And hence it is that let a man do the most glorious things in the world out of his owne supposed good end (as the blind Papists doe in their will-works and superstitions) which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded, nay let him doe all things which the law of God requires, give his goods to the poore, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bee burnt, and yet not doe these things because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, let him then quit himselfe from hypocrisie and himselfe from being a deep hypocrite in all these if he can: Surely those who straine at this gnat, <hi>viz.</hi> not to doe a duty because commanded, will make no bones of swallowing down this camell, <hi>viz.</hi> not to forsake sinne, because 'tis forbidden, and whosoever shall forsake sinne from any other ground, shewes manifestly hereby that hee hath little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of Gods command; I know the love of Christ should make a Christian forsake every sin, but the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and reason thereof is because his love forbids us to continue in sinne; for to act by vertue of a command, is not to act onely as a creature to God considered as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but by vertue of the will and commandment of God in a Redeemer, with whom a Beleever hath now to doe.</p>

When a Beleever is once justified hee cannot be made more just by all his obedience, nor lesse just by all his sins in point of justification, which is perfected at once: but he who is perfectly justified is but imperfectly sanctified, and in this respect may more or lesse please God or displease him, be more just or lesse just and holy before him: It is I confesse a secret but a common sinne in many, to seek to pacifie God (when they perceive or feare his anger) by some obedience of their own, and so to seek for that in themselves chiefely which they should seek for in Christ, and for that in the Law which is onely to be found in the Gospel; but corrupt practises in others should not breed (as usually they doe) corrupt opinions in us, and to cast off the law from being a rule of pleasing God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is no rule to us of pacifying of God: For if wee speak of revenging (not fatherly) anger, Christs bloud can onely pacifie that, and when that is pacified and God is satisfied, our obedience now pleaseth him and his mercy accepts it as very pleasing, the rule of which is the precious law of God.</p>

Those who say we are not under the Ceremonial law as they were, doe speak truely, but they doe not resolve the difficulty in this place; for certainly the Apostle speaks, not onely of the Ceremoniall law, but also of that law which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven because of transgressions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. and which shut up (not onely the Jewes) but all men under sinne, <hi>verse</hi> 22. which being the power of the morall law chiefely, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle must therefore intend the morall law, under which the old Testament Beleevers were shut up, and we now are not: The doubt therefore still remaines, <hi>viz.</hi> How are we not now under the morall law? Will any say that we are not now under the malediction and curse and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, but the Jewes under the old Testament were thus under it, even under the curse of it? This cannot be the meaning, for although the carnall Jewes were thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, yet the faithfull (whom the Apostle cals the heire and Lord of all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1.) were not thus under it, for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers then were as much blessed then with faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as Beleevers now, <hi>cap.</hi> 3.9. How then are we not now under it as they were? Is it in this, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as a rule of life to walk by, and so are not we? Thus indeed some straine the place, but this cannot bee it; for the Apostle in this very Epistle presseth them to <hi>Love one another,</hi> upon this ground, because <hi>All the Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in love,</hi> cap. 5.13, 14. and this walking in love accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law, is walking in the Spirit, <hi>verse</hi> 16. and they that thus walke in the spirit, according to the law, are not (saith the Apostle) under the law, which cannot, without flat contradiction, be meant of not being under the rule or directive power of it; and it would bee a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable weake motive to presse them to love, because all the law is fulfilled in love, if the law was not to bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as any rule of life or of love; for they might upon such a ground easily and justly object, and say, What have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57760:65"/>
we to doe with the law? If we therfore as well as they, are thus under the law as a rule of life, how are wee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as they were? Is it because they were under it as a preparative means for Christ, and not wee? They were under the humbling and terrifying preparing worke of it, but not we: There are some indeed who think that this use of the law under the Gospel is but a back-doore, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian path, or a crookt-way about, to lead to Jesus Christ; but certainly these men know not what they say, for the text expressely tels us, that the Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded (not onely the Jewes) but <hi>All under sinne, that so the promise by faith, might be given to them that beleeve,</hi> Gal. 3.22. So that the law is subservient to faith and to the promise, that so hereby not onely the Jewes, but all that God saves might hereby feele their need, and fly by faith to the promise made in Iesus Christ; and verily if Christ be the end of the law to every one that beleeves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. then the law is the meanes (not of it selfe, so much as by the rich grace of God) not onely to the Iewes, but to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the end of the world, to lead them to this end Christ Iesus: If therefore the faithfull under the new Testament, are thus under the preparing worke of the law, as well as those under the old, How were they therefore so under the law, as we are not, and wee not under it as they were? I confesse the place is more full of difficulties than is usually observed by writers upon it, onely for the clearing up of this doubt, omitting many things, I answer briefely, That the children of the old Testament were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law and the pedagogy of it, two wayes, after which the children of the new Testament are not under it now, but are redeemed from it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As the morall law was accompanied with a number of burdensome Ceremonies, thus wee are not under it, thus they were under it; For we know this law was put into the Ark, and there they were to look upon it in that type, if any man then committed any sinne against it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through infirmity, ignorance or presumption, they were to have recourse to the Sacrifices and High Priests yearely, and to their bloud and oblations: They were to pray (which was a morall duty) but it must bee with incense and in such a place: They were to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (another morall duty) but it must bee testified by the offering up of many Sacrifices upon the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were to confesse their sinnes (a morall duty also) but it

must be over the head of the Scape-goat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus they were under the law, but we are not: And as 'tis usuall for the Apostle thus to speak of the law in other places of the Scripture, so surely hee speakes of it here, for hence it is that in the beginning of this dispute, <hi>cap.</hi> 3.19. hee speaks of the morall law which was given because of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions; and yet in the close of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3. he seemes to speak only of the ceremoniall law, which he cals the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, under which the children were then in bondage, as under Tutors and Governours; which implies thus much, that the children of the old Testament were indeed under the morall law, but yet withall as thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ceremoniall rudiments and elements fit to teach children in their minority: But now in this elder age of the Church, although we are under the morall law in other respects, yet wee are not under it as thus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In respect of the manner and measure of dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the morall law, which although it had the revelation of the Gospel conjoyned with it (for <hi>Moses</hi> writ of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.46. and <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Gospell preached to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. and the unbeleeving Jewes had the Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.) yet the law was revealed and pressed more clearely and strongly, with more rigour and terrour, and the Gospel was revealed more obscurely and darkly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the manner of externall dispensation of them in those times; there were three things in that manner of dispensation, from which (at least <hi>ex parte Dei revelantis</hi>) we are now freed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There was then much law urged, externally, clearly, and little Gospel so clearely revealed, indeed Gospel and Christ Iesus was the end of the morall law and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all the shadowes of the ceremoniall law, but the externall face of these things was scarce any thing else but Doing and Law, by reason of which there is a vaile spread over the hearts of the lewes in reading the old Testament unto this day, as is evident 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. so that the inside or end of the morall law being Gospel, and the out-side and meanes appointed to this end being law, hence the Gospel was then lesse clearly, and the law was more clearely revealed in those times; to say that Iesus Christ and his benefits, or eternall life were then dispensed under a Covenant of works, or <hi>sub conditione perfectae obedientiae</hi> (as some eminent Worthies affirm) is such an errour which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57760:66"/>
wise and able men might easily fall into by seeing how much law was revealed and urged in those times; for though the law simply considered in it selfe contained the matter of the Covenant of works, yet considered relatively in respect of the people of God, and as they were under <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant of grace, so it was given to them as a rule of perfect righteousnesse, by both which they might the better see their owne weaknesse and unrighteousnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

chiefely and most abundantly urged in his blessed Gospel: and thus the Apostle tels us in this Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. with 4.5. that the heires of the Promise under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were as servants, but by Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. The Law was a Schoolmaster, Tutor and Governour to lead them unto Christ to come, for so the Apostle tels us in this place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. that <hi>before faith came, we were shut up under the Law, unto the faith, which should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be revealed</hi>: Thus the Ceremoniall law pointed to Christ to come, the morall law discovered mans sinne and misery, and need of Christ who was to come; nay, all the promises were made with reference to Iesus Christ to come: but now <hi>the fulnesse of time being come,</hi> that the Sonne of God is come, now <hi>we are no longer under the Law</hi> after this manner, neither ceremoniall or morall law are of any use to us to lead us unto Christ to come, for Christ is already come: and hence it is that Beleevers now are said to be rather under the Gospel than under the Law, and Beleevers under the Old Testament to be rather under the Law than under the Gospel: because although these had the efficacy of Christs Redemption, yet they were not yet actually redeemed, because the Redeemer was not yet come into the flesh, and in this respect they were under the rigour of the law, and hence it was fit that they should bee handled as servants, and the law and curse thereof principally revealed: but now Christ being come, and having actually redeemed us, having been (not onely virtually but actually) made righteousnesse and a curse for us: now therefore is the time that we should see Christ Iesus with open face, and hear principally concerning faith and the fathers love in him: now Christ is revealed chiefely (being come) the end of the Law, then the Law was revealed chiefely (Christ being not yet come) as the meanes to this end: looke therefore as the promise before Christ, of which the Apostle
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57760:67"/>
speaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19, 21, 22. was fulfilled in Christ being come (as Divines speak) rather than abolished, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished as it was a promise of grace to come: so the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law is rather fulfilled than abolished in Christ being come, and yet as it did lead unto Christ to come, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished to us now under the Gospel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The law being principally revealed, and yet so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed as to lead unto Christ Jesus to come, hence ariseth a third thing of the law from which we are now delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> they were therefore under more terrour and feare of the Law than we are (on Gods part revealing the Gospel more clearely) in these times; and therefore saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>that when the fulnesse of time came, God sent his Sonne to redeeme us from under the Law, that wee might receive the adoption of Sonnes, and thereby the Spirit of Sonnes crying, Abba, Father</hi>: could not they who were Sonnes under the Law call God Father? yes verily, doubtlesse thou art our Father say they, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 63.17. but they having lesse light they had more feare and lesse of the Spirit of Adoption, I say still <hi>(ex parte Dei revelantis)</hi> than we have in these dayes: We are not therefore so under the law, <hi>i.</hi> the feare and terrour of the law as they were: the summe of all this is, that although we are not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, 1. so accompanied, and 2. so dispensed, as they were under the Old Testament, yet this hinders not but that we are under the directive power of the Law as well as they.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That so men may keep their lusts and sins and yet keep their peace too, for if peace be the portion of a man under the power of sin and Satan; look then, as he may have it, why may he not keep it upon the same terms: And therefore <hi>W. C.</hi> saith, <hi>That if conscience object, thou art an hypocrite (perhaps truly) yet a hypocrite is but a sinner, and Gods love belongs to sinners as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>: And if this be thus, what doth this doctrine aim at, but to reconcile God and Belial, Christ and Mammon? not onely to open the door to all manner of wickednesse, but to comfort men therein,</p>

That the father sent his only Son; 2. That whosoever did beleeve, in him (or if they did beleeve in him) they should have eternall life; The Lord shews wonderfull love, that whoever beleeve may have Christ and eternall life by beleeving; but this doctrine breathing ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For is not this preaching of the Gospel the instrument and means of working that faith in us, which the Lord requires of us in the Gospel? And must not Jesus Christ use the means for the end? Were not those three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand brought into Christ by faith, by <hi>Peters</hi> promise of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins upon their repentance? Were not many filled with the holy Ghost when they heard this Gospel thus preached upon condition of beleeving? <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. Doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle say that the Gospell is the power of God to salvation, because therein is Christs righteousnesse revealed (not to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as sinners) but from faith to faith? The condition of works is impossible to be wrought in us by the Spirit, but the condition of faith (though it be impossible for us to work it in our hearts) yet it is possible, easie and unusuall for God to work it by requiring of it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is no prejudice to Gods free-grace, because faith is purposely required and wrought, because it chiefly honours and advanceth free-grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 16.

                     <p>The second thing remains to be cleared, whether sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not be a first evidence and therefore more then a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inferiour and last evidence, as Mr <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> cals it: For if it be (not a doubtfull) but a clear and certain evidence in it self (as hath been proved) why may it not be a first evidence? why may not the Spirit of God who works it in a person ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, first reveal it as an evidence that he is justified? What mortall man can limit the Spirit of God, to what evidence he shall first bring in to the conscience of a justified estate? For let sanctification be taken in the largest sense, for <hi>any work of saving grace</hi> wrought in the Elect (whether in vocation to faith, or in sanctification which (strictly taken) followes our justification by faith) and take evidence not for evidence of the object (for Christ Jesus in his free-grace must be seen first as the <hi>ground</hi> on which faith rests) but for evidence of testimony to the subject, and then I thus argue, that this first evidence of speciall actuall love in beholding Gods free-grace to a sinner, it is either
<list>
                           <item>1. Without the being of faith and other graces.</item>
                           <item>Or 2. Without the seeing of them only, the eye looking up only to Christ and free-grace.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this first evidence is not without the <hi>being</hi> of faith and holinesse; for then it should be to a man actually under the power of sin and his filthy lusts and the devil; which hath been already proved in the former <hi>Thesis</hi> to be a meer delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: there being no such word of the Gospel which reveals Gods free love and actual reconciliation to a sinner as a sinner, and as under the power of his sins, but the Gospel rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the quite contrary; and to affirm the witnesse of the Spirit clears this up, is to pretend a testimony of the Spirit
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57760:79"/>
contrary to the testimony of the world; and yet I strongly fear and do fully beleeve that this is the first evidence which some men plead for, <hi>viz.</hi> to see Gods love toward them, while they neither see grace or any change of heart in them: or have grace, but are still under the dominion of their sin.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side, if any affirm that this evidence is not without the being of grace but onely without the seeing of it: so that a Christians first evidence is the seeing of Gods free grace out of himself, without seeing any faith or grace in himself, and seeing nothing else but sin in himself, this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse is nearer the truth, but it is an errour which leads a man to a precipice and near unto the pit: for if this be so, then these things will unavoidably follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a Christian must see the love of God toward him in Christ, and yet must not see himself to be the person to whom this love onely belongs: for (according to this very opinion it self) it belongs only to a beleever, and one that hath the being of grace, and not to a sinner as a sinner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then a Christian must not see the love of Christ and free grace of God by that proposition or testimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which reveals it, and that is this, <hi>Tu fidelis,</hi> thou Beleever called and sanctified, art freely beloved: and thus a man must not see his estate good by the light of the spirit, nay thus a Christian must receive the testimony of the Spirit which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures him that he is loved without understanding the meaning of the Spirit, which is (not thou sinner as such) but thou Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever art beloved: not thou that hast no grace, but thou that hast the being of it, art beloved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then the first evidence is built upon a meer weaknesse, nay upon an untruth and falsehood; for it is a meer weaknesse not to see that which we should see, <hi>viz.</hi> the being of faith and grace in the heart, in which respect the promise is sealed, and if any man by not seeing it shall think and say there is no grace, no faith, no sanctification, and now he sees Gods love to such a one, and he thinks himself to be such a one when he sees Gods free grace, and hath this first evidence, it is a falsehood and an untruth, for it is supposed to be there in the being of it all this while; suppose therefore that some Christians at their first return and conversion to God or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, have grace and faith, but see it not in their assurance of Gods love (the eminency of the object and good of it swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up their thoughts and hearts from attending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) yet the question is <hi>quo jure,</hi> they do not see, nay should not see and take notice of the being of them in themselves? Is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57760:79"/>
not this a meer weaknesse and falsehood which is now made the mystery of this first evidence? and indeed somewhat like <hi>Cusanus</hi> his <hi>summa sapientia,</hi> which he makes to be this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>viz. Attingere illud quod est inattingibile inattingibiliter,</hi> That a Christian must see and touch Gods deep love, and yet neither see not touch nor feel any change in himselfe, or any being of grace, when in truth it is there; in which respect also Gods free-grace and love is revealed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If this be the first evidence, then no Minister, no nor any Apostle of Christ Jesus, can give any first evidence of Gods love by the ordinary dispensation of the Gospel; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Minister may say. Thou art a sinner, therefore the Lord Jesus <hi>may</hi> save thee, yet he cannot say upon that ground that therefore the Lord Jesus <hi>will</hi> save him, for then every sinner should be saved: No Minister can say to any unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Christ hath redeemed thee, therefore beleeve, or say ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Thy sins are pardoned, for then he should preach contrary to the word which expressely tels us, That he that beleeves not is already condemned. No minister can say God will work faith in all you that are sinners, as hath been shewn; but they can say, Thou Beleever are pardoned, thou that art sanctified art reconciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is therefore an evill speech of one lately in print, who cals <hi>That a bastard assurance, arising from a lying spirit, which</hi> first <hi>proceeds from the sight of any grace, and thence concludes they are justified and shall be saved.</hi> For I would thus argue, that this worke of grace (suppose love to the Saints, hunger and thirst after righteousnesse, universall respect to all Gods Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) it is either common to hypocrites and unsound, or else it is peculiar to the elect and sincere? If the first, then it cannot be either first or second evidence: it can be no evidence at all either without or with seeing, first, <hi>Gods free love to sinners as sinners</hi>; if the second, then either Gods promise (made to such as are hungry and humble, and have a work peculiar to Gods elect in them) must be fals (which is blasphemous to imagine) or else when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is seen, whether first or last, it must needs be a most blessed and sweet, and sure evidence: for when we say that such a work of grace may be a first evidence, we do not mean, as if the work simply considered in it self could give in any evidence, but only as the free promise of grace is made to such as have such a work of grace; this promise we say to such persons, whensoever they see this work, gives in full and clear evidence of their blessed estate: And if the word of grace to a sinner as a sinner, may give in a first evidence (as some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57760:80"/>
then much more may it give in evidence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, where there is not only the word of grace, but also the spirit of grace, yea the work of grace to assure the conscience: and for any to affirm that faith and sanctification are good evidences, if justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be first evident, is but a quirk of frothy wit; for it may be as safely affirmed on the contrary, that justification is a good evidence, if faith and sanctification he first evident; for 'tis not these simply, but the promise which is our evidence, which is never to a sinner as such: I shall therefore conclude these things with shewing the true grounds of effectuall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the love of Christ.</p>

                     <p>The free offer of grace (containing Gods call, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beseechings to beleeve and be reconciled) gives us right to this possession of Christ or to come and take and so possesse Christ Jesus by faith. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5, 6. The free promise of grace (containing revealed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable purposes and actual assurances of present and future grace) gives us <hi>right</hi> to the fruition of Christ, or to enjoy Christ as a free gift when 'tis offered; the command and desire of the donor to receive it to be our own, gives us <hi>right</hi> and powet to possesse it: and when it is received, his promise to us assuring us that it is and shall continue our own, gives us right and priviledge to enjoy it and make use of it. For by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things (the promise confirmed by oath) we have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to the hope before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. The <hi>free offer</hi> is the first ground of our faith, why we receive Christ to be our own: but the <hi>free promise</hi> is the <hi>first ground of the assurance of faith,</hi> why we are assured and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that <hi>he is our own</hi> already: for the Gospel containing three things, 1. The revelation of Christ: 2. The offer of Christ.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57760:80"/>
3. The promise of Christ to all those that receive this offer; Hence faith (which runs parallell with the Gospel, the proper object of it) first sees Christ, secondly receives Christ, thirdly is assured of the love of Christ having received him.</p>
                     <p>The free offer of grace being made to the soul because it is poor and sinfull, cursed and miserable, and that <hi>therefore</hi> it would receive Christ, hence it is that in this respect the soul is not bound first to see some good in it self and so to receive him, but rather is bound (at first breathings of God upon it) rather to see no good, <hi>i.</hi> nothing but sin and perdition, death and darknesse, enmity and weaknesse, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.3. But the promise of free-grace being actually given to the soul (and not declared only as it is in the free offer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath received Christ already by which he is actually its own) hence it is that in this respect, the soul is bound to see some good or saving work of grace in it self first, and so embrace and receive the promise and Christ Jesus in it: So that although in receiving Christ to be our own, we are to see no good in our selves wherefore we should receive him or beleeve in him; yet in receiving him <hi>as our own already,</hi> we must first see some good (the work of free grace in us) or else we have no just ground thus to receive him: No man can challeng any promise belonging to him without having a part in Christ the foundation of them; no man can have Christ but by receiving of him or beleeving in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. Hence therefore they that say that the first evidence of Gods love and free grace or actuall favour, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they say the first, they then speak the truth, but then they raze down their own pernicious principle, that Christ and Gods love belongs to them <hi>As sinners</hi>: If they affirm the latter, then they do injuriously destroy Gods free grace and the glory of Christ, who think to possesse promises without possessing Christ, or to have promises of grace, without having Christ the foundation of them all. For though the common love of God (as the bare <hi>offer</hi> of grace is) may be manifested with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having Christ, yet speciall actuall love cannot be actually our own, without having and first receiving of him: And if the Spirit of God convince the world of sin (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of condemnation) while they do not beleeve, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.9. I wonder how it can then convince them of pardon of sin and

reconciliation, before they do beleeve? unlesse we will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be a lying spirit, which is blasphemous.

                        <item>2. The receiving of this offer by faith (relatively conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in respect of Christs spotlesse righteousnesse) is the first evidence shewing <hi>why</hi> he is beloved, or what hath moved God actually to love him.</item>
                        <item>3. The worke of sanctification (which is the fruit of our receiving this offer) is the first evidence shewing <hi>that</hi> he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</item>

                     <p>If therefore a condemned sinner be asked whether God may love him, and why he thinks so? he may answer, Because Jesus Christ is held forth and offered to such a one: If he be further asked, why or what he thinks should move God to love him? he may answer, Because I have received Christs righteousnesse offered, for which righteousnesse sake only I know I am beloved, now I have received it: If he be asked lastly, how he knows certainly that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; he may answer safely and confidently, Because I am sanctified: I am poor in spirit, therefore mine is the kingdom of heaven: I do mourn, and therefore I shall be comforted: I do hunger and thirst, and therefore I shall be satisfied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We need in time of distresse and temptation all these eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore it is greatest wisdom to pray for that spirit, which may clear them all up unto us, rather then to contend which should be the first.</p>

But it can never be proved that God hath left any humane wisdom at liberty to make holy daies, by the rule of Jewish proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Beside, if humane wisdom see it meet and congruous

to give God at least one day in seven, this wisdom and reason is either regulated by some law, and then 'tis by vertue of the law of God, that he should have one day in seven, or 'tis not regulated by a law, and then we are left to a loose end again, for man to appoint what day he sees meet in a shorter or a longer time, his own reason being his only law; and this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gomaras</hi> nor the words of the Commandment will allow, which sets and fixeth the day, which we see is one day in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which not man but God shall determine and therefore called <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord our God.</hi>

                        </gap>per place, it may be made good, that not that seventh day from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so much as a seventh day which God shall determine (and therefore called the seventh day) is primarily morall, and therefore enjoyned in this Commandment, for which end let these things be considered and laid together.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because the expresse words of the Commandment do not run thus, <hi>viz. Remember to keep holy That seventh day,</hi> but more generally, <hi>the Sabbath day</hi>; 'tis in the beginning and so 'tis in the end of this Commandment, where it is not said that <hi>God blessed That Seventh day,</hi> but <hi>The Sabbath day,</hi> by which expression the wisdom of God, as it points to that particular seventh day that it should be sanctified: so it also opens a door of liberty for change, if God shall see meet, because the substance of the Commandment doth not only contain <hi>That seventh day,</hi> but <hi>The Sabbath day,</hi> which may be upon another seventh, as well as upon that which God appointed first: and that the substance of the command is contained in those first words, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,</hi> may appeare from the repetition of the same Commandment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12. where these words, <hi>As the Lord thy God commanded thee,</hi> are immediately inserted before the rest of the words of the Commandement be set down, to shew thus much: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained the substance of the fourth command: the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57760:82"/>
words following being added only to presse to the duty, and to point out the particular day, which at that time God would have them to observe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because in the explication of those words [<hi>the Sabbath</hi>] it is not called <hi>That seventh,</hi> but <hi>The seventh,</hi> for so the words runne, <hi>Six daies shalt thou labour, but the seventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God,</hi> the meaning of which is thus much, to wit, that man taking six daies to himself for labour, that he leave the seventh to be the Lords: now unlesse any can shew that no other day but that Seventh could be the seventh for rest, nor no other six daies but those six daies going before tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> seventh could be the six daies for labour, they can never prove that this fourth Commandment hath only a respect to That particular Seventh, and it is no small boldnesse necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to limit where God hath left free: for we know that if God will, man may take other six daies for labour, and leave another Seventh for God, then those six daies and that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day only.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The change of the Sabbath undeniably proves thus much (if it can be proved) that the morality of this command did not lie in that particular day only: for if that only was morall, how could it be changed? and if it did not lie only in that Seventh, wherein then did it more generally lie? was it in a day more largely or in a Seventh day more narrowly? now let any indifferent conscience be herein judge, who they be that come nearest to the truth, whether they that fly so far from the name Seventh, which is expresly mentioned in the Commandment, or they that come as near it as may be? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that plead for a Seventh of Gods appointing, or they that plead for a day (but God knowes when) of humane institution? and it's worth considering why any should be offended at the placing of the morality of the command in a Seventh, more then at their own placing of it in a day; for in urging the letter of the Commandment to that particular Seventh, to abolish thereby the morality of a Seventh day, they do withall therein utterly abandon the morality of a day; for if That Seventh only be enjoyned in the letter of the Commandment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they will thence inferre, that a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth therefore cannot be required, how can they upon this ground draw out the morality of a day?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because (we know) that <hi>ratio legis est anima legis, i.</hi> the reason of a law is the soul and life of the law: now let it be considered, why God should appoint the Seventh rather then the ninth or tenth or twentieth-day, for spirituall rest? and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57760:83"/>
the reason will appear not to be Gods absolute will meerly, but because divine wisdom having just measures and ballances in its hand, in proportioning time between God and man, it saw a seventh part of time (rather then a tenth of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth) to be most equall for himself to take, and for man to give: and thus much the words of the Commandment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is most equall if man hath six, that God should have the seventh: now if this be the reason of the law, this must needs be the soul and substance of the morality of the law, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Seventh day be given to God, man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving six, and therefore it consists not in That Seventh day only: for the primary reason, why God appointed this or that Seventh, was not because it was that seventh, but because a Seventh was now equall in the eye of God for God to take to himself, man having the full and fittest proportion of six daies together for himself; and because a seventh was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test proportion of time for God, hence this or that individual and particular seventh in the second place fall out to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, because they contain the most equall and fittest propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Seventh day in them; there was also another reason why That Seventh was sanctified, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods rest in it, but this reason is not primary as hath been said, and of which now we speak.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because if no other Commandment be in the Decalogue, but it is comprehensive, and looking many waies at once, why should we then pinion and gird up this only to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compasse of that Seventh day only?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because our adversaries in this point are forced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to acknowledge this morality of a Seventh with us: we have heard the judgement of <hi>Gomaras</hi> herein, <hi>Thesis</hi> 44. and M. <hi>Primrose</hi> who speaks with most weight and spirit in this controversie, professeth plainly, <hi>That if God give us six daies for our own affairs, there is then good reason to consecrate a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth to his service, and that in this reason there is manifest justice and equity which abideth for ever, to dedicate to God precisely a seventh day after we have bestowed six daies upon our selves: it cannot be denied</hi> (saith he) <hi>but that it is most just</hi>; Now if it be by his confession, 1. <hi>just,</hi> 2. <hi>most just.</hi> 3. <hi>manifestly just.</hi> 4. <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually just,</hi> to give God precisely one day in seven: the cause is then yeelded: the only evasion he makes is this, <hi>viz. that though it be most just to give God one day in seven, yet it's not more just, then to give God one in six, or five, or four, there being no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall justice in the number of seven more then in the number of six or four</hi>: but the answer is easie, that if man may give unto God
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57760:83"/>
superstitiously too many, or prophanely too few: and if the appointment of God hath declared it self for a seventh, and that the giving of this seventh be most just and equall, then let it be considered, whether it be not most satisfactory to a scrupling conscience, to allow God a seventh day which he hath appointed, which is confessed to be most just and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually equall, and consequently morall: and if there be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and perpetuall equity to give God one day in seven, then 'tis no matter whether there be any more naturall equity therein, then in one in five or six: the disputers of this worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> may please themselves with such speculations and shifts, but the wisdom of God, which hath already appointed one day in seven rather then in six or ten, should be adored herein, by humble mindes, in cutting out this proportion of time, with far greater equity then man can now readily see.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because deep corruption is the ground of this opinion, the plucking up of Gods bounds and land-marks of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, is to put the stakes into the Churches hands, to set them where she pleaseth; or if she set them at a seventh, where God would have them, yet that this may be submitted to, not because God pleaseth, but because the Church so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; not because of Gods will and determination, but because of the Churches will and determination, that so it being once granted, that the Church hath liberty to determine of such a day, she may not be denied liberty of making any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holidaies, or holy things in the worship and service of God; and that this is the main scope and root of this opinion is palpably evident from most of the writings of our English adversaries in this controversie.</p>

                     <p>A seventh day therefore is primarily morall, yet (as was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="123"/> formerly said <hi>Thesis.</hi> 48.) there is something else in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which is secundarily morall, <hi>viz. This or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular seventh day,</hi> I will not say that it is accidentally morall (as some do) but rather secundarily, and consequently morall: for it is not morall firstly, because it is this particular seventh, but because it hath a seventh part of time, divinely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and appointed for rest, falling into it, and of which it participates: to give almes to the needy is a morall duty, and primarily morall; but to give this or that quantity may be morall also, but it is secundarily morall, because it flowes <hi>ex consequenti,</hi> onely from the first; for if we are to give almes according to our ability and others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, then this or that particular quantity thus suting

Mr. <hi>Ironside</hi> and others doe usually dash all such reasonings out of countenance, with this answer, viz. <hi>That by this argument,</hi> That particular seventh from the creation is morall, <hi>which we see is changed; for (say they) that also is set in the heart of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, with a speciall note of remembrance also.</hi> But the reply from what hath ben said is easie, <hi>viz.</hi> That that also is indeed morall; only 'tis secondarily morall, not primarily; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as we have shewn) was mutable and changeable, the primary morality in a seventh immutably remaining; the morall duty of observing a seventh day is not changed, but only the day.

But by this reason he may as well exclude all the other nine from being morall also; for I reade not in Scripture that any one of them is stiled by that name, <hi>Morall</hi>: And although it be true which he saith, That covenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men consist sometime together of divers articles, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that Gods Covenant (taken in some sence) sometimes did so; yet the Covenant of God made <hi>with all men</hi> (as we shall prove the Decalogue is) ought not to be so mingled, neither could it be so without apparent contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That here should be a covenant which bindeth all men in all things to observe it, and yet some part of it being ceremoniall, should not binde all men in all things it commands: nor is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any need of putting in one ceremoniall law, considering how easily they are and may be reduced to sundry precepts of the morall law as <hi>appendices</hi> thereof, without such shuffling as is contended for here.</p>

The Apostle speaks of such a Law which not only the Jews but all the Gentiles are bound to observe: and for the breach of any one of which, not only the Jews but the Gentiles also were guilty of the breach of all, and therefore it cannot be meant of the ceremoniall Law which did neither binde Gentiles or Jews at that time wherein the Apostle writ. 2 He speaks of such a Law as is called a royall Law, and a Law of liberty, <hi>vers.</hi> 8.12. which cannot be meant of the ceremoniall Law in whole or in part, which is called a Law of bondage, not worthy the royall and kingly spirit of a Christian to stoop to, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. 3.

The great and most high God could have made the world in a moment or in a hundred years, why did he make it then in six daies, and rested the seventh day, but that it might be an example to man?

Pointing out unto man most visibly (as it were) thereby on what day he should rest: A meet time for labour was a morall duty since man was framed upon earth, God therefore gives man an example of it in making the world in six daies: A meet time for holy rest, the end of all holy and honest labour, was much more morall (the end being better then the means) why then was not the example of this also seen in Gods rest?

Hence also although he was to live holily every day, yet this hinders not but that his soul might then have need of the holy rest of a Sabbath: For 1. <hi>Adam</hi> was to serve God in a particular calling then, as is manifest from, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 2.15. for he was then to keep and dresse the garden, and to act with and under God in the government of many inferiour creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. And thus his time being filled in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God with all holinesse in his calling, he might need a Sabbath; nor was it lawfull for him to turn daies of work in his calling into daies of rest, and so to keep a Sabbath every day, no not in that innocent and happy estate: for if it was contrary to <hi>Adams</hi> holy estate to work six daies, how could it be agreeable or sutable to the holinesse of God to work six daies? If God did labour six daies and rested a seventh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any need of a rest in respect of any wearinesse in his work, why might not, nay why should not man imitate and be like to his God in labour and rest, although he was not subject to any wearinesse in his holy work? 2. Though every day was to be spent in holinesse <hi>mediatly,</hi> both in seeing God in the creatures and meeting with God in his labour and calling: yet it was not unsutable, nay it was very needfull in that estate to have one day in the week for more <hi>immediate</hi> and speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with God, and for God more immediatly and specially to converse with him. Nor indeed was it suitable to Gods wisdom to confine mans holinesse either then or now, either to holy labour only, or to holy rest only, for then he should not have been so like unto God who was exemplary holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man in both. Speciall time for <hi>action</hi> wherein he closed with God more mediatly throughout the six daies labour, might well stand with speciall time for <hi>contemplation</hi> of God upon the Sabbath, wherein he was to enjoy God more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. <hi>Adam</hi> did not need a Sabbath upon the same ground of <hi>weaknesse</hi> that we do, <hi>viz.</hi> because we cannot be earnest enough (as M. <hi>Primrose</hi> objects) in holy services to God upon the week daies, but we see it did not sute Gods wisdom nor

mans holy estate, then to be intent and earnest only in the enjoyment of his rest, to which his intention on his calling and labour then, could not be any hinderance when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath came; being free from such clogs of sin then, as we are now prest down withall: and therefore it is an unworthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, but oft used by the same author and others: <hi>viz.

by which we are to live, Christ is revealed only in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and therefore could not be so revealed in the Covenant of works directly contrary thereunto. <hi>Adam</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not capable of any types then to reveal Christ to him: of whom the first Covenant cannot speak, and of whom <hi>Adam</hi> stood in no need, no not so much as to confirm him in that estate, for (with leave) I think that look as <hi>Adam</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the first Covenant by sinne, he is become immutably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and miserable in himself, according to the rule of justice in that Covenant; so suppose him to have kept that Covenant, all his posterity had been immutably happy and holy, (not meerly by grace) but by the same equity and justice of that first Covenant, and hence it follows that he stood in no need of Christ or any Revelation of him by types, no not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in that Covenant: I know in some sence whatever God communicates to his creature in way of justice, may be saîd to be conveyed in a way of grace, if grace be taken larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that which is conveyed out of Gods free will and good pleasure, as all things in the world are, even to the acceptance of that wherein there is most merit, and that is Christs death and satisfaction for sinne: but this is but to play with words; for it's clear enough by the Apostles verdict that grace strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is opposite to works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. the law of works which only reveals doing and life, to the law of faith which only reveals Christ and life; under which Covenant of grace <hi>Adam</hi> was not, and therefore had no types then to shadow out Christ: to say that Paradise and the Tree of life were types by way of anticipation (as some lately affirm) is as much as to say that they were not types then: and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these nor the Sabbath were Ceremoniall then, and that is sufficient for what we aim at; only 'tis observable that this unsound expression leads into more palpable errours; for as they make the Tree of life Typicall by Anticipation, so they make the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and consequently the marriage of all mankinde typicall, and then why should not all marriages cease, when Christ the Antitype is come? nay they make the rivers and precious stones and gold in Paradise thus Typicall of Christ and his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and then why may they not make the Angels in heaven Typicall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men on earth who pour out the Vials are resembled to them? and why may not men riding upon white Horses be typicall, because Christ is so resembled? <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Pererius</hi>

                     <p>It's a monkish speculation of M. <hi>Broad</hi> to distinguish so of the Sabbath in <hi>sensu mystico,</hi> and <hi>sensu literali,</hi> as that the mysticall sense like the lean and ill-favoured kine in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah's</hi> dream shall eat up the literal sense, and devour Gods blessed and sweet Sabbath; for the Lord never meant by the Sabbath such a mysticall thing as the resting from the works of the old man only every day, no more then when he commands us to labour six daies, he permits us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the works of the old man all the six daies.</p>

                     <p>For though it be true that we are to rest every day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="204"/> from sin, yet it will not hence follow, that every day is to be a Christians Sabbath, and that no one day in seven is to be set apart for it: For 1. Upon the same ground <hi>Adam</hi> should have had no Sabbath, because he was to rest from sin every day. 2. The Jews also before Christ, should have rejected all Sabbaths, because they were then bound to rest from sin as well as Christians now. 3. Upon the same ground there must be no daies of fasting or feasting under the Gospel, because we are to fast from sinne every day, and to be joyfull and thankfull every day. I know some Libertines of late say so; but upon the same ground there should have been none under the law neither, for they were then bound as well as we to fast from sin. 4. Hence neither should any man pay his debts, because he is bound to be paying his debt of love to God and all men every day. 5. Hence also no man should pray at any time in his family, nor alone by himself so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, because a Christian is bound to pray continually: And indeed I did not think that any forehead could be so bold and brazen as to make such a conclusion; but while I was writing this, came to my hearing concerning a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who came to these coasts from <hi>London,</hi> miserably deluded with principles of Familisme, who when an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest New-English man his Cabbin-mate invited him to go
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57760:111"/>
along and pray together, considering their necessities, he would professedly refuse to doe it upon this ground, viz. <hi>Dost not pray continually? Why then should we pray together now?</hi> 6. The Commandment of the Sabbath doth not therefore presse us to rest only from such works as are in themselves evil, which God allows at no ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from the works of our callings and weekly imployments which are in themselves lawfull and of necessity to be attended on at some time. It is therefore a loose and groundlesse assertion to make every day under the Gospel to be a Christians Sabbath day.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="205"/> To think that the Sabbath was proper to the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they only were able to keep and exactly observe the time of it, being shut up (as M. <hi>Primrose</hi> saith) within a little corner of the earth, and that the Gentiles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not bound to it, because they cannot exactly observe the time of it, in severall quarters of the earth so far distant, is a very feeble argument: For why might not all nations exactly observe the rising and the setting of the sun according to severall climates by which the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day and so this of a Sabbath is exactly measured? and which God hath appointed (without limitation to any hour) to be the bounds of the Sabbath as it sooner or later rises or sets? were not the mariners of the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> bound to observe the Seventh day in all the severall coasts where they made their voyages? did God limit them to the rising or setting sun of <hi>Iudaea</hi> only? what colour is there to think thus of them? indeed it's true that in some habitable Northern coasts, the Sun is not out of sight some moneths together, but yet this is certain, if they know how the year spends into moneths, they can exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon the weeks of those moneths, and therefore can exactly tell you the daies of which those weeks consist, and therefore they have their exact rules and measures to know East and West, the place of the sun-rising and sun-setting, and consequently to know the Sabbath daies; and yet if they should not exactly know it, their will to do it is herein (as in other things) accepted of God.</p>

                        </gap> an argument against the Sabbath, which they have gone compassing the whole earth and heavens about to finde out, never heard of till their daies, and now it's brought to light. I would not make mirth with it (as some have done and left the scruple untoucht) but in words of sobriety, and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and plainnesse. <hi>If the Sabbath or Lords day</hi> (say they) <hi>be morall, then the morall Law is subject to manifold mutation, because the nations issuing out of Noahs ark spread themelves from thence over the face of the whole earth, some farther, some at a shorter distance, whereby changing the longitude with their habitation, they must of necessity alter the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of times, neither can any exactly and precisely observe any one day, either as it was appointed by</hi> Moses, <hi>or as it was instituted by Christs Apostles afterwards, by reason of the manifold transportation of Colonies, and transmigration of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from one region into another, whereby the times must necessarily be supposed to vary.</hi> The answer is ready and easie, <hi>viz.</hi> Although the nations issued out of <hi>Noahs</hi> ark,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57760:112"/>
and spread themselves over the face of the whole earth, some farther, some at a shorter distance, and thereby changing their longitude altered the differences of time, some beginning the day sooner, some later, yet they might observe the same day; for the day is regulated and measured by the Sun, and the Sun comes to one meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sooner or later then to another, and hence the day begins in one place sooner or later then in another, and so the beginning of the day is (respectively) varied, but yet the day it self remains unchangeably the same: what though our countreymen in old <hi>England</hi> begin their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath above 4. hours before us in new, they beginning at their evening, we at our evening, yet both may and do observe the same day: all nations are bound to keep ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Seventh part of time; but that time must be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Sun, neither is it necessary that the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall 24. hours should be observed by all, but the same day as it is measured by the Sun in this or that place, which may begin in places more easterly many hours sooner then in other places more westerly; a day is not properly time but a measure of time, and therefore the manifold transportation of Colonies, and transmigration of nations from one region unto another, hinder not at all, but that they may exactly and precisely observe the same day, which was instituted and appointed: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the time of the beginning of the day be varied, yet the day it self is not, cannot be varied or changed. Now whereas they say, that <hi>if any man should travell the world about, a whole day must needs be varied, and if two men from the same place travell, the one Eastward, the other Westward, round about the earth, and meet in the same place again, they shall finde that he who hath gone Eastward hath gotten, and the other going Westward hath lost a day in their account; yea, the</hi> Hollanders <hi>after their discovery of</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum de Mayre, <hi>comming home to their countrey, found by comparing their accounts with thtir countreymen at home, that they had lost a day, having gone Westward, and so compassed the earth round.</hi> I answet, what though a traveller vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetually the quantity of the day, by reason of his continuall moving with or against the Suns motion, in time get or loose a day in his account, is the day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of it's own nature variable or changeable? God hath
<pb facs="tcp:57760:112"/>
placed the Sun in the Firmament, and appointed it for times and seasons, and in speciall for the regulating of the day; and as the motion of the Sun is constant, so there is an ordinary and constant succession of daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variation; for unlesse the Suns course be changed, the day which is regulated by it, is not changed, Now if any shall travell round about the world, and so anticipate or second the diurnall motion of the Sun, and thereby varying continually the quantity of the day, at length gain or loose a day, according to their reckoning, they may and ought then to correct their accounts: <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. having found the Julian year to be too great for the Motion of the Sun, cut off ten daies by which the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoxes and Solstices had anticipated their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that so the year might be kept at it's right periods: and is it not as good reason that a traveller who opposing the Suns diurnall course continually shortens somewhat of his day, till at last in compassing the earth round he gains a whole day, should cut off in his accounts that day which he hath gained by anticipating the Suns course, and so rectifie his account of the day? For in every regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and countrey whatsoever and howsoever situate, as men are to begin the day at that time when the day na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally begins in that place, so likewise they are to reckon and count the daies as they are there regulated and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Sun, and that should be the first or second day of the week to them, which is naturally the first or second day of the week to that place where they are: and thus their doubts are easily satisfied when they return to the place from whence they first came. <hi>But if any shall say it's very difficult for men thus to rectifie their accounts, and to observe that time in every place which was at first instituted, and it's probable that the nations in their severall transmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and transportations never used any such course.</hi> The ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is obvious; mens weaknesse, or neglect and carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to do what they ought, is not a sufficient argument to prove that not to be their duty; besides 'tis not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any nations were thus put to it to travell round about the whole earth (although some particular persons in this later age have sailed round about it) and therefore could not vary a whole day possibly, but going some Eastward, some Westward, some Southward, some
<pb facs="tcp:57760:113"/>
Northward, they spread themselves over the face of the whole earth, some at a shorter, some at a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and so some began the day sooner, some later, and yet all (as hath been shewn) might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same day: the morality of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath is not built upon Astronomicall or Geometricall principles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot fall by any shady speculations so far fetcht.</p>

that in this and such like Controversies, the Scriptures were not written to answer all the scruples and objections of Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but to satisfie and stablish the consciences of poor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And verily when I meet with such like speeches and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as these, <hi>viz. Where is it expressely said that the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is abrogated? and what one Scripture is there in the N.

For the Holy Ghost is not bound to write all the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Common-place heads, nor to say expressely, <hi>In this place of Scripture you may see the old Sabbath abrogated, and the new instituted</hi>; for we find no such kind of expressions concerning <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles and many books of Scripture, that this or that Epistle or book is Canonical; which yet we know to be so by other evidences. We know also that the Holy Ghost by brief hints of Truth, gives occasion of large Comments; and by writing about other matters <hi>tanquam aliud agens,</hi> it brings forth to light by the By revelations of great concernment, which it saw meet purposely in that manner to make known.

                     <p>The observation of the first day of the weeke for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Christian Sabbath ariseth from the force of the fourth Commandment, as strongly as the observation of the <hi>media cultus,</hi> or means of worship now under the New Testament, doth from the force of the second Commandment; only let this be supposed, that the day is now changed (as we shall hereafter prove) as also that the worship it self is changed by divine institution; for Gospel-institutions when they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by divine and soveraign Authority, yet they may then be observed and practised by vertue of some morall Law. The Gospel appointed new Sacraments, but we are to use them by vertue of the second Commandment: so here the Gospel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a new seventh day for the Sabbath, but it stands by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the fourth Commandment: and therefore the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is not an Act of Christian Liberty, but of Christian duty imposed by divine Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet suppose that by deduction and strength of wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they could in respect of naturall ability; but the question is not what men may or might do, but what they ought to do, and should do. For besides the change of Gods Rest through the work of the Sonne, there was a Type affixed to that Jewish <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for which cause it may justly vanish at Christs death, as well as other types, in respect of the affixed Type, which was but accidentall; and yet be continued and preserved in another Day, being originally, and essentially Moral: A <hi>Sabbath</hi> was instituted in <hi>Paradise,</hi> equally honoured by God in the Decalogue with all other Moral Lawes, foretold to continue in the dayes of the Gospel by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Ezek. 43. <hi>ult. Isa.</hi> 56.4.6. and commended by Christ, who bids his people pray, <hi>that their flight may not be in the winter or Sabbath-day,</hi> as it were easie to open these places against all Cavils; and therefore it is for substance Moral. Yet the word <hi>Sabbatisme,</hi> Heb. 4.9. and the Apostles gradation from yeerely Holy-dayes to monthly new-moons, and from them to weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, which are called <hi>shadowes of things to come, Colos.</hi> 2.16. seemes strongly to argue some type affixed to those individual Sabbaths, or Jewish seventh dayes; and hence it is perhaps that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is set among Moral Lawes in the Decalogue, being originally and essentially Moral, and yet is set among ceremonial Feast-dayes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.2, 3. because it is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally typical.

And that it was not a Motive only to observe that day (as it is in the Preface to the Decalogue) but a superadded ground of it, may appear from this one consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> because that very ground on which the Lord urgeth the observation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11, it is wholly left out in the repetition of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. and their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> put into the rome thereof: for the ground in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. is this, <hi>Six daies God made Heaven and Earth, and rested the seventh day and sanctified it</hi>; but instead of these words, and of this ground, we finde other words put into their roome, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou wast a servant in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord brought thee out thence with a mighty hand, therefore the Lord thy God commandeth thee to Keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Which seems to argue strongly that these words are not a meer Motive but another ground of the observation of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> And why might not the generall Motive in the Preface of the Decalogue, serve as a sufficient Motive to the obedience of this Commandment, if there was no more but a Motive in these words of <hi>Deutr.</hi> and therefore I suppose this was also the ground and affixed Type unto the Jewish <hi>Sabbath.</hi>

For Mr. <hi>Brabourne</hi> could not but know that all the Iewish Ceremonies being once the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, were to have an honourable burial, and that therefore they might be lawfully observed for a time among the Iewes, untill they were more fully instructed about them; and hence <hi>Paul</hi> Circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> because of the Iewes, <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.3. and did otherwise conforme to them, that so he might winne and gaine the more upon them: and if <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served purposely a Iewish Ceremony of Circumcision, which was not necessary, nay which was not lawfull to be observed among the Gentiles, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.2. and yet he observed it to gaine the Iewes: why might not <hi>Paul</hi> much more preach the Gospel, which is in it selfe a necessary Duty, upon a Iewish Sabbath which fell out occasionally to him, and therefore might lawfully be observed for such an end among the Iewes, which among the Gentiles might be unlawful? Suppose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Apostles might have taught the Iewes from house to house (as Mr. <hi>Brabourne</hi> argues against the necessity put upon the Apostles to preach upon the Iewish Sabbath) yet what Reason or Conscience was there to lose the opportunity of publike preaching for the more plentiful gathering in of soules, when many are met together, and which may lawfully be done, and be contented onely to seek their good in such private waies? and what although <hi>Paul</hi> did assemble the chiefe of the Iewes together at <hi>Rome</hi> when he was a prisoner, to acquant them with Civill matters about his imprisonment, <hi>Acts.</hi> 28.17. yet had he power to do thus in all places where he came? or was it meet for him so to do?

That the end of this meeting was Holy Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> to break bread, or to receive the Lords Supper, as the phrase is expounded, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.43. which was therefore accompanied with preaching the word and prayer, Holy preparation and serious meditation about those great mysteries. Nor can this breaking of Bread be interpreted of their Love-feasts or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Suppers, as <hi>Gomarus</hi> suspects. For their Love-feasts and common Suppers were not of the whole Church together (as this was) but in several houses, as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> proves from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. And although the Corinthians used their Love-Feasts in publike, yet they are sadly reproved for it by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. and therefore he would not allow it here.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. The first Day was honoured above any other Day for these Holy Duties; or else why did they not meet upon the last Day of the week, the Iewish Sabbath for these ends? For if the Christian Churches were bound to observe the Iewish Sabbath, why did they not meet then and honour the seventh Day above the first day? considering that it was but the day before, and therefore might easily have done it, more fitly too, had that seventh day been the Christian Sabbath.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Why is the first Day of the week mentioned which is attributed onely in the New Testament to the Day of Christs resurrection, unlesse this day was then usually honoured and sanctified for Holy Duties called here breaking of bread by a Synecdoche of a part for the whole, and therefore compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all other Sabbath Duties?

And what other reason can be given of Limiting this Collection to this Day? I confesse <hi>I</hi> cannot honestly (though <hi>I</hi> could wickedly) imagine.

This Lastly I adde, this first Day was thus honoured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Divine or Humane Institution: If by Divine, we have what we plead for; If by Humane custome and tradition, then the Apostle assuredly would never have commended the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this Day, who elsewhere condemnes the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dayes, though the dayes were formerly by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. <hi>Ye observe</hi> (saith he) <hi>Dayes and Times</hi>: and would he then have commended the observation of these dayes above any other which are onely by humane, but never by Divine Institution? Its, strange that the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the observation of dayes, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.10. and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.2. a more sacred and solemne observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Daye of the week rather then any other! Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this could not be, unlesse we conclude a Divine Institution hereof. For we know how Zealous the holy Apostle is every where to strike at Humane customes, and therefore could not lay a stumbling block (to occasion the grievous fall of Churches) to allow and command them to observe a Humane Tradition, and to honour this above the seventh Day for such holy services ar are here made mention of. But whether this Day was solemnely sanctified as the Sabbath of the Lord our God, we come now to inquire.</p>

                     <p>The first Difficulty here to prove and cleare up, is, that, This Day which is here called the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> is a day institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and sanctified for the Lords honour and service above any other Day. For, as the Sacrament of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> for no other reason but because they were instituted by Christ, and sanctified for him and his honour; so what other reason can be given by any Scripture-light why this is called the Lords Day, but because

                        </gap>t was in the like manner instituted and sanctified as they were? Master <hi>Brabourne</hi> here shifts away from the light of this Text, by affirming <hi>that it might be called the Lords Day in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God the Creator, not Christ the Redeemer, and therefore may be meant of the Iewish Sabbath which is called the Lords holy Day,</hi> Isaiah 58 3. But why might he not as well say that its called the Lords Supper &amp; Table in respect of God the Creator, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the New Testament since Christ is actually exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Lord of all, this phrase is onely applyed to the Lord Christ as Redeemer? Look therefore as the Jewish Sabbath being called the Lords Sabbath, or the Sabbath of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is by that title and note certainly known to be a Day sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as Creator; so this Day being called the Lords Day, is by this note as certainly known to be a Day sanctified by our Lord Jesus as Redeemer. Nor do I finde any one distinct thing in all the Scripture which hath the Lords superscription or name upon it (as the Lords Temple, the Lords Offerings, the Lords people, the Lords Priests &amp;c.) but it is sanctified of God and holy to him: why is not this Day then Holy to the Lord, if it equally bears the Lords name? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Primrose</hi> indeed puts us off with another shift,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Primr.</hi> par. 3. cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. That this Day being called so by the Churches customs</hi>; John <hi>therefore calls it so in respest of that custome which the church then used, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine institution.</hi> But why may he not as well say that he calls it the Lords Table in respect of the Churches Custome also? the <hi>Designation</hi> of a Day, and of the first time in the Day for Holy publike services is indeed in the power of each particular Church (Suppose it be a Lecture, and the houres of Sabbath-meetings) but the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of a Day, if it be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, to observe it if God command and appoint it; then surely it is wil-worship for any Humane Custome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute it. Now, the Lords name being stamped upon this Day and so set apart for the honour of Christ, it cannot be that so it should be called in respect of the Churches customes; for surely then they should have been condemned for wil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by some of the Apostles; and therefore it is in respect of the Lords institution hereof.</p>

                     <p>The second Difficulty now lies in clearing up this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> viz. <hi>That this Day thus sanctified was the first Day of the week, which is therefore the Holy Day of the Lord our God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Christian Sabbath:</hi> for this purpose let these ensuing particulars be laid together.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Day of which <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks, is a known Day,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57760:129"/>
and was generally known in those dayes by this glorious name of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and therefore the Apostle gives no other title to it but the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> as a known day in those times; for the Scope of <hi>Iohn</hi> in this Vision is as in all other Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Visions when they set down the day and time of it, to gain the more credit to the certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of it, when every one sees the truth circumstantiated, and they heare of the particular time; and it may seem most absurd to set down the day and time for such an end, and yet the day is not particularly known.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it was a known Day, what Day can it be either by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Scripture or any Antiquity but the first Day of the week? For,
<q>
                           <p n="1">1. There is no other Day on which mention is made of any other work or action of Christ which might occasion a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Day, but onely this of the Resurrection, which is exactly noted of all the Evangelists to be upon the first Day of the week, and by which work he is expressely said to have all power given him in heaven and earth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18. and to be actually Lord of dead and living, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why should any other Lords Day be dreamed of? why should Master <hi>Brabourne</hi> imagine that this day might be some superstitious Easter Day, which happens once a yeer? the Holy Ghost on the contrary, not setting downe the month or day of the yeer, but of the week wherein Christ arose, and therefore it must be meant of a weekly Holy Day here called the <hi>Lords Day.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. We do not read of any other Day (besides this first Day of the week) which was observed for Holy Sabbath Duties and honoured above any other day for breaking of Bread, for preaching the Word (which were acts of piety) nor for Collections for the poor (the most eminent act of mercy) why then should any imagine any other day to be the Lords day, but that first day?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. There seems to be much in that which <hi>Beza</hi> observes out of an ancient Greek Manuscript wherein that first Day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. is expressely called the Lords Day, and the Syriack Translation saith that their meeting together to receive the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. was upon the Lords Day; nor is there any antiquity but expounds this Lords Day of the first Day of the week, as learned <hi>Rivet</hi> makes good against <hi>Gomarus,</hi>

                              <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57760:129"/>4. Look as <hi>Iehovahs,</hi> or the Lords Holy Day, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58.13. was the seventh Day in the week then in use in the Old Testament, so why should not this Lords Day be meant of some seventh Day (the first of seven in the week which the Lord appointed, and the Church observed under the New Testament, and therefore called (as that was) <hi>the Lords Day?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. There can be no other Day imagined but this to be the Lords Day; indeeed <hi>Gomarus</hi> affirms that its called the Lords Day, because of the Lord Jesus apparition in Vision to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and therefore he tell us that in Scripture phrase, <hi>the Day of the Lord is such a Day wherein the Lord manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe either in wrath or in favour, as here to Iohn.</hi> But there's a great difference between those phrases, <hi>The Lords Day,</hi> and the <hi>Day of the Lord,</hi> which it is not called here. For such an interpretation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> as if it was an uncertaine time, is directly crosse to the Scope of <hi>Iohn</hi> in setting downe this Vision, who to beget more credit to it, tels us, First, of the person that saw it, <hi>I Iohn ver.</hi> 10. Secondly, the particular place, <hi>in Paimo.</hi> Thirdly, the particular time, <hi>the Lords Day.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These considerations do utterly subvert Mr. <hi>Brabournes</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to prove the Jewish Sabbath to be the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> which we are still to observe, and may be sufficient to answer the scruples of modest and humble minds; for if we aske the Time of it? It is on the first Day of the week. Would we know whether this time was spent in holy Duties and Sabbath ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices? this also hath been proved. Would we know whether it was sanctified for that end? Yes verily, because its called the Lords Day, and consequently all servile work was and is to be laid aside in it. Would we know whether 'tis the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Sabbath Day? Verily if it be the Day of the Lord our God (the Lords Day) why is it not the Sabbath of the Lord our God? If it be exalted and honoured by the Apostles of Christ above the Jewish Sabbath for Sabbath duties, why should we not beleeve but that it was our Sabbath Day? And although the word Sabbath Day, or seventh day be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely mentioned, yet if they be for substance in this Day, and by just consequence deduced from Scripture, it is all one as if the Lord had expressely called them so.</p>

                     <p>Hence therefore it followes, that although this particular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> seventh day, which is the first of seven, be not particularly made mention of in the fourth Commandment; yet the last

of seven being abrogated, and this being instituted in its roome, it is therefore to be perpetuated and observed in its roome. For though it be true (as Mr. <hi>Brabourne</hi> urgeth) <hi>That New Institutions cannot be founded, no not by Analogy of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meerly upon Old Institutions; as because children were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, it will not follow that they are therefore to be baptized: and so because the Iewes kept that seventh day, that we may therefore keep the first day.</hi> Yet this is certaine, that when New things are instituted not by humane Analogy, but by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Application of these may stand by vertue of old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and general Rules, from whence the Application even of old Institutions formerly arose.

                        </hi> in the New Testament in Ministry and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, stands at this day by vertue of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the instituted worship under the Old. And though Baptisme stands not by vertue of the institution of Circumcision, yet it being <hi>De novo</hi> instituted by Christ as the Seale of Initiation into Christs mystical Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. it now stands by vertue of that general Rule by which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision it selfe was administred, <hi>viz</hi> That the Seale of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation into Christs Body be applyed to all the visible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Body: and hence children are to be now Baptized, as once they were Circumcised, being members of Christs Body. So the first day of the week being instituted to be the Lords Day or Lords Sabbath, hence it followes that if the first seventh which is now abrogated, was once observed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the Lords Sabbath or the Sabbath Day which God appointed; by the very same Rule, and on the very same ground we also are bound to keep this first day being also the Sabbath of the Lord our God, which he hath now appointed anew under the New Testament.</p>

The Temple was but a circumstance of place, and King <hi>Vzziah</hi> in in offering Incense, varied onely in a circumstance of person, yet we know that the ten Tribes were carried away captive for not sacrificing at the Temple, and <hi>Vzziah</hi> smitten with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie till his death: so the Lord having determined the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day to be his, what now should hinder but that he should determine the Beginning also thereof?</p>

Surely its all that space of time wherein the Lord did his first dayes

in the dark night, then in the light day, and (which is all one) first in the Evening, then in the Morning, 3.

                     <p n="1">1. Some say that it might be meant of the Artificiall day if the words had run thus, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Dawning of the day</hi>; or the first Day of the week about the dawning of the day; but the dawning toward the first day, <hi>This phrase</hi> (they say) <hi>seems to describe beginning of such a day a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57760:140"/>
be taken for naturall dayes:</hi> But, 1. There is I hope a first Artificiall day of the week as well as a Naturall. 2. This Artificiall day doth not in this account exclude the Night before as part of this first Day, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Naturall Day consisting of Night and light; therefore it may well stand in relation to the other dayes of the Week which were naturall; for although the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist sets down particularly when these things about the Resurrection of Christ happened to be, <hi>viz.</hi> at the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the first day of the Week, yet we that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Sabbath at Evening may and do use the same phrase, and yet so speake of the Artificial day upon which some event begins, as not to exclude the Night before upon which the Naturall Day begins. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Evangelists; and the dawning in <hi>Matthew</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the first day, will be found to be all one with this phrase, <hi>viz.</hi> The first day about or at the dawning of it: for that which <hi>Matthew</hi> calls dawning to the first day, <hi>Marke</hi> calls early in the Morning, the first day of the Weeke at the rising of the Sunne; and <hi>Luke</hi> calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first day of the Week very early in the Morning: whence it is evident that <hi>Matthews</hi> drawning to the first day is all one with about the rising of the Sun upon the first day: so that this difference between dawning toward the first day, and dawning upon the first day seemes to be an English <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balisme,</hi> and a meere curiosity exhaled and extracted out of the words, rather then any solid Truth which the Text holds forth or the Spirit of God aimed at.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A second exception is; that though the word <hi>Day</hi> in Scripture be taken for the Artificiall day, yet never when the word first, second, or third Day, &amp;c. are joyned together; and they point us to the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where when the first or second day is mentioned, its constantly meant of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and not an Artificiall Day. But 1. This is a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; for the Day for the <hi>Levites</hi> Travell (which was not in the Night but upon the Artificiall day) is called the fourth Day, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 19.5. And the 5th day, <hi>verse</hi> 8. 2. This Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all day may be called the first day as that it may involve the Night before, (where we make the Sabbath to begin) as well as the Night after, on which they make the Sabbath to end; and thus the Naturall day may be here comprehended also (which they plead for) the same day which Artificially begins at day-light, may naturally begin the night before.</p>

                        </gap> frequently signifies the time of the night when Cocks crow. I forbear to instance in Greek Writers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Evangelist <hi>Iohn</hi> clears up this most fully, who expresly saith, that it was <gap reason="foreign">

However the Evangelists be reconciled, this is evident, that the first stirring of the women about that work from which they abstained upon the Sabbath day, was very early in the depth of the morning Darknesse, before the Day-light, when some would begin the Christian Sabbath: and from hence it follows, 1. That if the Sabbath was not past even before this dark time of the night began, but rather ended when the first day of the week began to dawn: then it will follow, that these holy women did not rest the Sabbath according to the Commandment; for we see they are this night busie about those things which they did forbear to do because of the Sabbath, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.52. 2. Hence it will also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if the Sabbath was not ended before this dark time of the night, but onely at the dawning of the Day-light, then our Saviour could not arise from the dead the First day of the week, but within the dark night of the Jewish Sabbath: for <hi>Mary</hi> came when it was dark, and the Lord Christ was risen before she came, and how long before no man can tell; but its evident that Christ arose the first day of the week, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.9. and therefore the Sabbath was ended long before. 3. If therefore the Sabbath was past at the dark time of the night, how then can the Sabbath begin at morning Light; and if it was past when it was thus dark, when then could the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath end, but when this night did first begin? and if this was so, it was then truly <gap reason="foreign">

Morning is also frequently taken in Scripture for any early time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. and so this night of the first day of the week, wherein the women arose to their work, was an early time, and therefore called morning. Again, suppose a double mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be acknowledged (as there was a double evening) yet it will not follow that this morning belongs onely to the day following, for it may belong to the night before; for as where there are two evenings spoken of, the former belongs to the day, the latter to the night: so if we grant two mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the latter morning may belong to the day ensuing, and the former to the Night preceding; if therefore any plead for the beginning of the Sabbath at the morning light, these places of the Evangelist will not bear them out in it, it being dark morning when Christ arose; if they say it begins in the dark morning, then let them set exactly the time of that dark morning wherein Christ arose, and when they would begin it; but no wit of man I feare is able to demonstrate this.</p>

Now assuredly, if it had been the mind of God that his people should begin the Sabbath when Christ began his resurrection, he would have pointed out the exact time when he did arise, that so they might exactly begin the Sabbath; but none of the Evangelists point out the time, nor is it their scope exactly so to doe; nay, they do exactly point out when other matters hapned about the womens comming to the Sepulchre,

but this is not made mention of; onely we may gather by laying many things together about what time it should be, &amp; therefore I marvell at them who would prove the beginning of the Sabbath at the time of Christs Resurrection from the four Evangelists speaking exactly to the time of the womens rising in the morning to visit Christs Sepulchre, but not a word of the main thing this drives at, which is the exact time of Christs rising.</p>

That the cause of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in so much of the Night following for Preaching till midnight was extraordinary, <hi>viz. Pauls</hi> early departure never to see their faces more; and to say that if this Night was no part of the Sabbath, it was then unreasonable to hold them so long at it, is an assertion which wants reason, if we do but consider the shortnesse of his time, the largenesse of <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, speaking now for his last, and the sweetnesse of their affections as might easily enable them to continue till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night and upward, with cheerfulnesse, and without thinking the duty tedious, and unreasonable long. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore might begin his Sermon some part of the Day-light, which was part of the Sabbath Day, and continue it till midnight following, and yet this night be no part of the Christian Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was an extraordinary cause which prest him hereunto. 2. That there is nothing in the Words which will evince the Sabbath to continue so long as <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon did; for suppose those who begin the Sabbath at Evening, that it should be said of such, that being met together the first day of the Week to break Bread, their Teacher being to depart on the morrow, Preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto them and continued his speech till midnight, will this argue a continuance of the same day? No verily, and the like reason is here. 3.

This first darknesse must either be the whole night, consisting as the light did of about twelve houres; and then it cannot possibly be called morning or belong thereunto; or it must be part of the night, and that which came after the light another part of it, and then we may see a monstrous day which hath part of its night before it, and part after it; beside its contrary to the Text, which makes the whole morning together, and the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening together, the whole day-light together, and so the whole night together. 2.

For the eighth Commandement which would not have us steale, commands us therefore to labour for our Families and comforts in all the seasons of labour.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> But if we consult with Scriptures and the very words of this fourth Commandement, we shall finde two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to make up a servile worke. 1. If any worke be done for any worldly gaine profit, or livelyhood to acquire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the things of this life by; (which is the principall end of weeke day labour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.12.) this is a servile worke, all one with what the Commandement calls <hi>Thy work</hi>: Hence buying, selling, sowing, reaping, which are done for worldly gaine, are unlawfull on this day, being therefore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile works: hence also worldly sports and pastimes (which are ordained of God to whet on worldly labour, not necessary every day but onely at some seasons) are therefore most proper appurtenances unto daies of labour, and are therefore unlawfull
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57760:156"/>
upon this day: holy Times are no more to be sported on, then holy places; hence also on the other side, to rub the eares of Corne, to dresse meat for comfortable nourishment of man, because they respect not worldly gaine, are no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile workes nor yet unlawfull, but may be more lawfully done for the comfort of man then to lead his horse to the water this day, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.2. &amp; 13.15 &amp; 14.5. hence also such works as are done onely for the preservation of the Creatures, as to pull a sheepe out of a ditch, to quench fire in a Towne, to save Corne and Hay from the sudden inundation of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to keepe Fire in the Iron mills, to sit at sterne and guide the ship, and a thousand such like actions (being not done properly for worldly gaine) are not unlawfull; God himselfe not ceasing from workes of preservation, when he did from those of creation: hence also such works as are not works of immediate worship, but onely required necessarily thereto, as killing the Sacrifices in the Temple, travelling a Sabbath daies journey to the publique assemblies, being no servile workes for outward gaine, are not unlawfull upon this day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such worldly works, which though they be not done for worldly gaine or profit, yet if by a provident care and foresight they might be done as well the weeke before, or may as well be done a week after the Sabbath, these also are servile works: for thus the Commandment expresseth it, <hi>Six daies thou mayst doe all thy work,</hi> (meaning which can be done as well the week before) and if all cannot be done, it may therefore be as well done the week after. Hence the building of the Tabernacle (which was not so much for mans profit as Gods honour) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it might be done upon the six daies seasonably enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hence it is prohibited upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. If a man hath Corn in the field, though he may pretend that the weather is uncertain, and it is ready to be brought into the Barn, yet he is not to fetch it in upon the Sabbath day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no eminent danger of spoyle the Munday after, and then he may fetch it in as well as upon that day: the like may be said concerning Sea mens setting sayle upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, though they be uncertaine of a faire gale upon the day after. Yet we must trust Gods providence, who almost in all such matters keeps us at uncertainties: hence also the sweeping of the house ought not to be done now, if it may as well be done the day before: so also to buy any things at shops, or to wash clothes; if they may be done the week before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they must not be done upon this day: hence on the other
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57760:157"/>
side works of necessity, which cannot be so conveniently don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence also works of necessity, not onely for preservation of life, but also for comfort and comelinesse of life, are not unlawfull: for tis a grosse mistake to thinke that works onely of absolute necessity are allowed onely upon this day: for to lead an Ox to water, which in the strictest times was not disallowed of, is not of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; for it may live more then a day without it; onely its necessary for the comfort of the life of the beast: how much more is allowed to the comfort of the life of man? the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples possibly might have lived longer then the Sabbath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rubbing Corn eares, and men may live on Sabbath daies generally without warm meat, yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hey may fast perhaps all that day; yet it is not unlawfull to eate such meat, because its necessary for the comfort of life. Hence also to put on comely garments, to wash hands and face, and many such things as are necessary for the comelinesse as well as the comfort of life, are not unlawfull now: there is sometime an inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity by Gods providence, and sometime a contracted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity through want of care and foresight; in this case the work may sometime be done, provided that our neglect beforehand be repented of: in a word, he that shall conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously endeavour that no more work be done on the Sabbath then what must be done for the ends mentioned, that so he may have nothing else to doe but to be with God that day, shall have much peace to his own conscience herein, against Satans clamours: hence lastly, not onely outward servile work, but servile thoughts, affections, and cares, are to be cast off this day from the sight of God, as others are from the eyes of men; servile thoughts and affections being as much against the fourth Commandement as unchaste and filthy thoughts against the seventh.</p>

Holinesse is to be writ upon our cups and pots, and hors-bridles, and ploughs, and sickles, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.20.21. but this holinesse is more immediate; we enjoy God by and in the creature, and in our weekly occasions and providences: but do we think that there is no more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse required upon the Sabbath? verily every day then should be our Christian Sabbath, which is most false; and therefore some more immediate holinesse is required now on this day which is not then, nor required of us every week day; and what can this be but drawing neer to God this day more immediately, and as neer as mortall man can do, and casting aside the world and getting out of it, and so to be neere God in Prayer, in hearing the Word, in Meditation, &amp;c? <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.5.6. if it were possible to be with and enjoy Christ in Heaven where there are no meanes we should this day long for it, and prize it; but because this cannot yet be, and that the Lord comes down from Heaven to us in his ordinances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by makes himselfe as neer to us as he can in this fraile life; hence we are not onely to draw neer to Ordinances, but to God and Christ in them, upon this day, and so be as neere them with greatest immediatenesse that we can, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Adam</hi> did enjoy God in his calling the week day, but this was not so immediate as he was to have upon the Sabbath day.</p>

and speciall, but constant and continued, the whole day together. For upon every day of the week we are to take some time for converse with God; but our worldly occasion soon call us off, and that lawfully; but Sabbath holinesse must be constant and continued all the day; if the Lord was so strict that he would not lose a moments honour in a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall day of rest, <hi>Levtt.</hi> 23.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we have them and finde but little by them conveyed to us, yet that by that little we may be carried on the wings of faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all meanes unto that Rest which upon this day we may find in his bosome: that as Christ after his labours entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Rest, <hi>Heb</hi> 4. so we ought to labour after the same Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme begun here on earth, but perfected in Heaven; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the weary steps we tread, and sinnes and sorrowes we finde all the weeke, yet when the Sabbath comes we may say returne unto thy Rest oh my soule.

Gods great love appeares to weary, sinfull, restlesse man, as a day wherein all the treasures of his most rich and precious Love are set open; and in this respect let any man tell me what greater sinne he can imagine, then sinnes against the greatest Love? The same sinnes which are committed upon other daies in the Weeke are then provoking sinnes; but to commit these sinnes upon the Sabbath Day, is to double the evill of them: Drinking and Swearing, and Rioting, and vaine Talking, &amp;c. are sinnes on the weeke-day, but they are now but single sinnes; but these are such like sinnes on the Sabbath Day are double sinnes, because they are now not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes against Gods command, but also against Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths too, which much aggravates them; and yet men mourn not for these sinnes; had the Lord never made knowne his Sabbaths to his Churches and People in these daies, they might then have had some excuse for their sinne; but now to prophane them since God hath made them knowne to us; especially the English Nation and People to do it, upon whom the Lord hath shined out of Heaven with greater light and glory in this point of the Sabbath, above any other places and Churches in the World, what will they have to say for themselves, with what Fig-leaves will they hide this naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before the Tribunal of God?</p>
                     <p>The Lord might have hid his Sabbaths from us and gone to another People, that would have beene more thankfull for them, and glad of them then we have beene; and yet he hath beene loth to leave us; and doe we thus require the Lord? surely he hath no need of the best of us, or of our attendance upon him upon these daies; its onely his pitty, which seeing us wearied with sorrowes and wearying our selves in our sinnes, makes him call us back to a Weekly rest in his Bosome, who might have let us alone and tyred out our hearts in our own folly and madnesse all our daies; and do we thus requite the Lord?

without any check by their reasonings; that now when God is wasting the Land, and burning down its glory, for the sins against his Sabbaths, that just at this time, more then ever, they should rise up to polute and prophane this day. The Lord grant his poor people to see cause at last to mourn for this sin, that the rest of the Sabbath may be rest to their souls, especially in this weary hour of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, which is shaking all things, and threatens yet greater troubles unto all flesh. The Lord Jesus certainly hath great blessings in his hand to poure out upon his people in giving them better dayes, and brighter and more beautiful Sabbaths, and glorious appearances; but I fear, and therefore I desire that this unwise and unthankful generation may not stand in their own way, lest the Lord make quick work, and give those things to a remnant to enjoy, which others had no hearts to prize.</p>
