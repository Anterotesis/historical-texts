            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.<note place="margin">1662</note>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN the Lord God of Eternal Power began, by his Spirit,
to move in these Nations, in the late times of Trouble, and
there was an Opening in the times for the Zeal of the Heart to work
out it self, then every one betook themselves to that Fellowship and
People that agreed most with the Working Principle that was in them,
and so there came a distinguishing and knowledge of those seeking Souls,
according to some thing most obvious to the Eye of the World, and
so they called some by the name of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> some <hi>Independent,</hi>
and the like: For, as for those called <hi>Prelatical,</hi> they were not of such
a pressing Nature, as to seek forward much after the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but rather Breathed after their Old Form, how they might come
to this again, (without the former Troubles) to lye down in that:
But those called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or mixed <hi>Independent</hi> (in answer to
whose Queries, or one of them, the ensuing sheets are) they seemed
so Zealous while the Worlds Power countenanced them, as though they
would have taken Heaven, as it were by force; and not only so, but
even of late also, since the Second <hi>Charles</hi> came in, and they began to
be put out of their high Places by some old Incumbent, as they call them,
or upon some other Account, as Zealor so, yet did some of them keep up
their Custom of Preaching amongst People in publick, where they could
get place or audience, in so much that the boasting Spirit began to get up
in some of them, as in this <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> as though nothing should
stop their passage, and so would have all accounted Liars that had said
to the Contrary: But behold the Wisdom if God in suffering things so
to come to pass, that all things might be fully manifest: And so an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50955:3"/>
Act of Parliament must come out against them, unless they will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
And then lo, behold this shower of Rain forces in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heads, as not being able to endure the sharpness of the Storm,
for want of the true Spiritual Armour: For Words and Profession
could never secure any from the Fiery Trials that are still ordered in
the Wisdom of God for the manifesting of every Seed: So if these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
answers may be serviceable unto any of these Zealous Hearts to
provoke them to a further search of themselves, and be a means now
when they are something low, to give them a sight of any thing wherein
they have Sined against God, and Erred from his way of Life, and so
to move them to Repentance, it will be well, and a gladding of my
Heart, and of my Brethren, who cannot but desire and endeavour, not
only theirs, but even the good of all Men; yea, of them, that either
in times past have, or at this day do shew the greatest Enmity against
us; for we know, they none of them understand aright the Innocency
of our Hearts to them, and the Fear and Love of our Souls to God and
his Truth; for if they did, how could they forbear to Love us: But
Glory to God for ever, that bath given us, not only to believe, but
even, as need is, to suffer for his Name and Truths sake, and to pass
by great Offences done to us, which in Love to the Soul we could desire
might be also the Portion of all that name <hi>Truth,</hi> Rests God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</p>

REPROVED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN REYNOLDS,</hi> A Paper of Queries (coming to my hand)
as seems from thee to <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton</hi> of <hi>Dudly,</hi> and
weighing it well, I could not but in obedience to God write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to it, not so much for the use of these two young men, who by
the Light that God hath raised in them do see thy deceit therein, as
for the sake of some simple people who are as yet admirers of thee, and
deceived by thee, and such like who under a pretence of zeal for the letter
of Scripture, and things you have set up in your wills under the name of
Ordinances, not knowing nor considering that Christ is come, the end
of all things to them that believe: Though you may sometimes unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
light on Scriptures, that speaks the thing; and so if by what here
may be said, the Truth may more appear, and their simple Souls be helped,
God will be Glorified, and that will be Reward sufficient: But before
the Queries themselves be answered, something may be said, to that
which goes before them in that Paper, and from that I have noted the
nature of thy Fawning, Flattering, Self-contradicting and Confused Spirit;
but to hide that from the Light, thou backs thy sayings with quotations
of Scripture, as though mentioning what the Holy Men of God spoke by
the true Spirit, could prove that to be a true Spirit which acts in thee:
Nay, nay, the day is dawned Praised be God; and the Sheepskin no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can hide the Wolves from being seen of the Lambs of Christ, for
such hear Christs Voice and follow him, and so are Children of the Light,
but the Stranger they will not follow, though he may Paint him self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
never so cunningly with words, but all your fair words in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of your work, ye Fair-sayers, whether in Pulpit or in Press, is
but to make way for your sting that follows, for you resemble the Soor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
whose sting is in his Tail, mentioned in <hi>Revelations:</hi> for the end
of all thy fair words here, is but to draw these young men from the
simplicity that is in Christ, and his Light that Lighteth every man that
cometh into the World, for the great Malice of thy Heart, is against
the sufficiency of Christs Light in every man; and so would have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be added to it from without, that so thou may'st bring in thy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50955:4"/>
own traditions; but what condition shall one gather by thy words,
these two Men <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton,</hi> were in at the writing of
these Queries to them, for one while thou seemest to apply Scriptures
respecting the conditions of the unbelieving Jews to them, and another
while thou applies those that respect the condition of pretty well-grown
Christians: But however the sum of all is, to perswade them from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Light of Christ in them, as not being sufficient, and so thy
love is not testified unto them in Deed and in Truth, as thou say'st it is,
but in meer Hypocrisie and Deceit, as may further appear: But what
is that Soul enlightning Commandment <hi>Psalm</hi> 29. 8. Whereby thou
seemest to desire they may be enlightned? Is it this letter without, or the
Light of Christ within? If thou say the letter, as thou must say, or else
thwarts the whole current of thy Doctrine, and then all that have Eyes
may see thee to be an outward Jew only: But if thou say with us, it is the
Light of Christ that shineth in Darkness, <hi>John</hi> 1. which at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God shineth out of Darkness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods Glory to Man in the Face of Christ, then the business a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Sufficiency of the Light between us is at an end, and the Truth
stands over the from thy own words. The next is, when thou hearest the
Scripture mentioned thy Windy, Slightly, Crafty Doctrine of Deceivers,
<hi>Ephes</hi> 4. 14. then thou shoots thy Sting at the Innocent and would'st
have People believe that is to be applyed to us who Preach Christ and
his all-sufficiency in, and for every one that can Receive Him, who is
near every Man, and by his Light shineth to Conviction and Judgment
in every Man, who would have all Men to be saved, and come to the
knowledge of his Truth, which is nigh in the Heart and in the Mouth;
but this was the Apostles Doctrine, and so not to be condemned in us,
but thou goest on, telling of two ways of Deceiving, the one thou namest
the upper way (which thou say'st) is by Philosophy, the Traditions of
Men, Rudiments of the World, and Sciences falsly so called: And
Praised be God, thou art as it were forced by the Light in thy Conscience
to acquit us from being of this Number; but truly the Light in our
conscience tells us expresly, that thou <hi>John Reynolds</hi> art one of them that
are <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this upper way, as thou callest it, of deceit, for of Philosophy,
Traditions of Men, Worldly Rudiments, and false Sciences is the Body
of thy Divinity made up, as well as other of thy Brethren the Hirelings
thou would'st condemn, for the difference is not in the nature of your
Doctrine, but in the form. And so though an Idol of Gold appear more
beautiful than one of baser mettle, yet it is an Idol still, and so you are
both in the Fighting and Persecuting nature, as all Idolaters are; <hi>Ephraim</hi>
against <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and <hi>Manasseb</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi>
one for the Common-Prayer, another for the Directory, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50955:4"/>
will own the Lambs Light in you, to Teach and Guide you; and
so though you may have a Form of Godliness more Painted than they, yet
denying the Power (Christ in man) you are all alike to be turned away
from: And so <hi>John Finch,</hi> and <hi>John Payton</hi> in turning from thee, as well
as the other Formalists, are excuseable; and though thou goest about to
perswade them from the Truth, by telling them of a lower way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
by a voluntary Humility, and neglecting of the Body, and
wearing a rough Garment to deceive, which thou would'st intimate to be
our condition, yet this will not deceive their minds, if they keep to the
true Light of Christ in them, for in that they feel our Garment to be
smooth and sweet, through the Fathers Love, not rough or hairy; as the
Hypocrites is, who kill one another about their ways of Worship;
but for voluntary Humility in the will offered up by heaps, which is no
better than filthy smoke in the nostrils of a pure God in this day; and
Praised be God that hath brought us from this into the true Humility:
but how thy words of accusing us here of neglecting the Body, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of Drunkenness, can agree, let the wise in Heart consider; but all
in thy changeable nature and unstable must needs be Self-contradictors;
and so who be the Thieves that Christ in this day is Crucified between,
is thus far in part, and will afterwards God willing more appear. Also
it is observable from that Preface of thine further, where it is said that
this latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Namely, the lower way of deceiving may possibly prevail,
though not with the present Multitude, yet some unstable Souls that
have been none enlightned and have tasted the good Word of God, and
the Power of the World to come, but are not yet rooted and settled in
the Truth and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ; then I say, thou need'st
not fear any of thy followers to be deceived on this manner, for none can
be savingly enlightned who denies the sufficiency of Christs Light, the
Grace of God, which hath appeared to all Men; yea, in their Darkness
shineth, though the Darkness comprehend it not, as thou dost not; and
none can say in Truth they have tasted the Good Word of God who puts
the Letter for it, and denies the sufficiency of Christs Light, which is
his Word nigh in the Heart and Mouth, as thou dost; nor none can truly
be said to taste the Powers of the World to come, who deny to bow
their Hearts to the least Measure of Christs Light in them, accounting it
insufficient, as thou dost: And so it is the real Believers that had need to
take heed of being Deceived, with fair Shews and rough Garments,
for the Hypocrites are deceived already: But what Doctrine <hi>John
Reynolds</hi> doth judge in these he calls silly Seducers and Quakers, to
be amiss, and by these two men he writes unto to be taken heed of, may
gathered out of these Queries, to instance some.</p>
            <p>1. Because they say Christ Lighteth every man with a sufficient Light
that cometh into the World</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50955:5"/>
2. Because they say, That the Measure of the Spirit of God in man is the
true and certain trier of all Spirits.</p>
            <p>3. Because they say, Christ himself and not the empty declaration
without, is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>4. Because they say, Christ the better hope, being come, sinless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thorough him is attainable here.</p>
            <p>5. Because they say, Judgment is commited to the Saints even whilst
they are in the Body, and therefore such may Judge; and yet, say they,
it is not flesh, but Spirit that Judgeth all things.</p>
            <p>6. Because they make Conscience of saying <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
which is the plain Language.</p>
            <p>7. Because they say, that all Honour, and Glory, and Worship is to
be given to God alone, and not to any Creature.</p>
            <p>8. Because they say, The true Church is in God, and so no Unrighteous
One in it, or of it, and so can neither call the Wicked God's Church,
nor a House of Wood and Stone his Church.</p>
            <p>9. Because they cannot own the Worlds Sprinkling of Infants with
a little outward Water, for Christ's Baptism; and because they cannot
own that for a right Communion, which is in Sin, and who eat Bread
and drink Wine in Remembrance of a Coming of Christ, which they
say shall never be while they are here, and the like.</p>
            <p>But now something, the Lord assisting, may be spoken parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in Answer to the Queries themselves; and the first of them
is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. First Question; If that Light which is within every Man
that cometh into the World, be sufficient without the Preaching of
the Gospel, how is it that Heathens know little or nothing of the True
God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answer, That thou run'st here upon a false Ground, and
so draws this and the rest of thy stumbling Consequences from thy own
Imaginations, not from our Words, for we do not Exclude the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel from the Light, nor the Light from it; but say, <hi>That
is the true Light that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> one
loves the Light, believes it, and follows it, and is led to God, and so
saved by it sufficiently; the other hates it, and it is his Condemnation:
And this is the Gospel Preaching, and this Light of Christ in every
Man is the Light of the Glorious Gospel, whether it be declared of
to the outward Ear in Words or not; but he that Preaches not this
True Light, Preaches another Gospel, though there be not another
Gospel: And I say unto you, all People, if a seeming Angel Preach not
this Gospel of Light, this Grace of God which brings Salvation, which
hath appeared to all Men, and is the Saints Teacher and Keeper, he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50955:5"/>
is to be accursed: But whereas thou cell'st of Heathen: Answer, All
are Heathens now, and Ignorant of the True God, who know nothing
of the sufficiency of the <hi>Light that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the
World;</hi> but thou askest in the end of that Query two very Childish,
Questions: The first, Why we exhort all Men to follow the Light
within, if that be sufficient? I answer, Because it is sufficient, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do we Exhort all Men to follow it, for that which is not sufficient
is not safe to follow: And so you that are so full of words, and ignorant
of the Sufficiency, beat the Air and deceive the People, keeping silly
Women ever Learning, and never able to bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth, which perfects to God all the commers thereunto.
Thy second Query there, How could the Word of God be called a
Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifest,
if the Light within be sufficient? And then quotes <hi>Eph. 3. 9. Col.</hi> 1.
25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. I answer, That it was within, and sufficient when
it lay hid as a Mystery, till God's full time came of revealing it; and
therefore Christ compares it to many Powerful and Precious, though hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
things, and of little account to the outward view, as to a Grain
of Mustard-seed in the Earth, to a little Leaven within much Flower,
to Treasure hid in the Field; and Christ said to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that
God's Kingdom was to be found in Man, he excludes none, and those
Scriptures thou sett'st down prove for this Truth, and against thy ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Mind which is in the outward observings, thinking to find the
Kingdom there, when Christ saith, it cometh not that way, see <hi>Luke</hi>
17. 20, 21. What, wilt thou conclude it was not, because it lay hid?
What <hi>Logick</hi> is this? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> there say, that the Mystery which
was so hid, and which he by the Spirit now Preached, <hi>which was Christ
in the</hi> Gentiles <hi>the Hope of Glory?</hi> And Christ was Light, and to this
Light he warned every Man to take heed; but the little Children, not
the Masters, obey the Voice, and so are led into the Understanding,
of the Mystery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. In the next general <hi>Query</hi> thou askest, Are not the Scriptures
the Words of the Lord, whose Words are they? And why is the
Scripture so often called the Word of God, and the Word of the Lord?
And for this thou brings many Scriptures, as <hi>Exod. 24. 4. 2. Kings</hi>
20. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Psal. 12. 6. Jer.</hi> 36. 4, 6, 8, 11. Acts 19. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 17. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I say, First, That the Holy Scriptures were given forth
by Holy Men of God, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and so
they may be called the Words of God, or of the Lord, not that Spirit
and Living Word, but that those Scriptures prove what thou bringest
them for; to wit, that the Scriptures or Writings without, is there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50955:6"/>
called the Word of God,<note place="margin">1662</note> is not true; it is said indeed in that of 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
20. 16. That <hi>Isaiah</hi> said unto <hi>Hezekiah, Hear the Word of the Lord;</hi>
and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> said, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord;</hi> and in other places of
Scriptures, <hi>that the Word of the Lord came to the Prophets;</hi> and that in
the fore-mentioned place of <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
mention is made of the <hi>Apostles</hi> Preaching the Word of God, all this
is true; but of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> mention is made of
Words; but what doth all this prove, but only that the Word came
to Holy Men, this Word was God, and as this Word moved in them,
and gave them Wisdom and Utterance, they writ or spoke forth Words
as a Declaration of what was in the Mind, or Word of God, or what
God was; and what, though the Scriptures may be thus called, The
Words of the Lord, or his Prophets, or Apostles, Acted by his Power,
which we never denied; this is nothing to the Hypocrites, who use
their Tongues to say, <hi>The Lord saith,</hi> when he never spoke by them,
but make a Trade of the Scriptures for filthy Lucre, and by their much
pressing the Declaration to be the Word of God, have quite clouded
the Word if self (Christ, from whence true Words come) from the
Peoples Minds, so that scarce any have any true Living Feeling after
God in his Word Christ; <hi>for in the beginning was the Word,</hi> before all
Declarations, and shall be after all the Peaceable Life of all that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
for ever! So that the Lord saw it good to stir up a People in
these days to be True and Living Witnesses of the Word, for the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the Mouths of all such as have gotten the Words, as Thieves
from others, and so kept People in the form with themselves, always
Professing, but never Possessing the Power which the Scripture Witness
unto, and so the Letter and empty Words kill'd and do kill; but
now the Living Spirit and Living Word being Witnessed, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is owned in its place; and Resurrection to Life being felt, the
Crown is set upon the King's Head, whose Name is called <hi>The Word of
God, who was, and is, and is to come, over all God Blessed for evermore;</hi>
and it is considerable, that the Ministers of Christ are never called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Letter, or Words, but of the Word and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
and that Christ and his Apostles mentioning the Prophets Words,
usually called them <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not <hi>The Word of God,</hi> as the custom
of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> is now; <hi>All Flesh is Grass, and all outward Sounds and Signs
vanish, but the Word of the Lord that endures for ever;</hi> and this is that
Word which, by the Gospel, (the Power of God) is Preached, and
by nothing else savingly; which, when understood, People are One,
but not before; for it is the weakness which is like the Womans speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
makes Dissention; so let the Scripture have its due, and the Word
of God its due, and all is Beautiful in its place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50955:6"/>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. In thy third, thou askest, How shall we know whether the
Spirit that speaks in us be the Spirit of God, or an evil Spirit, but by
trying them by the Scriptures? And for this thou bringest 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1.
<hi>Isa. 8. 19, 20. Acts 17. 11. John</hi> 5. 39. then thou replies, and as it were
says, If you say we know the Spirit to be of God, because it convinceth
of Sin; then I ask, how do you know that to be Sin, but by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
For this thou bringest 1 <hi>John 3. 4. Sin is a Transgression of the
Law;</hi> and afterwards says, If we say that Spirit tells us it's of God,
or that we know it but by its Fruit, how do we know it not to be a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit; or how do we know the Fruits of the Spirit but by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now, I say, by all this it plainly appears, that thou art no Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Minister,
no Minister of the Spirit of God at all, but art a meer
talker of the Letter and Law, not knowing what it saith, nor whereof
it affirmeth; for doth not the next Covenant run thus, <hi>I will put my
Law in their Hearts, and in their Minds will I write it,</hi> Jer. 31. 31; and
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. and the Apostle that said unto his Brethren, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi>
in that place 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. did not say, you have a writing without by
which you know all things, but you have an Anointing from the Holy One,
and this abides in you, and by this they know all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20,
27. according to what <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16. saith, <hi>The Spiritual
Man judgeth or discerneth all things, but is judged or discerned of none;</hi> for
the Natural Man knows nothing aright, though he may have all the
Scriptures to talk of without him; and though he may cry up in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
even as <hi>Isaiah</hi> said to the Law and to the Testimony, yet
he never goes to the Law or Testimony at all, for the Law is Spiritual
and Inward, and the Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophesie, as
saith Scripture Declaration; and by that Spiritual Law <hi>Paul</hi> came to
the knowledge of his Sin, to Humiliation; but while he was but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of the Law in the Letter, he was alive without Law; but when
the Commandment in Spirit came to be felt nigh in the Heart, then
Sin Revived and he Died: And so will <hi>John Reynolds</hi> dye when the
Law indeed he comes to feel, but he is yet alive without Law, and
from that Ground comes all these Queries of his to stop, if possible, the
Holy Seed from coming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the Lord will break all Bonds
for his Elect sake; so that in a few words, take away from thIs <hi>John
Reynolds</hi> the Letter, and by his own words he is as blind as a Beetle;
for he Questions how a Man can either know the true Spirit, or Sin,
or the Works, or Fruits of either good Spirit or bad, but by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so that his Eye is in the outward Book, and so no Letter, no
Preacher. For, <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> did the Apostles hold sorth a Letter
without them to be an Eye to the World? Nay, nay, they were to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50955:7"/>
turn the People to the Light of Christ within them, that thereby they
might see the Light out of all Darkness and false Worships; <hi>For in thy
Light,</hi> saith <hi>David, we shall see Light:</hi> O the Riches of the Grace of
God that hath deliver<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>John Fince</hi> and <hi>John Payton</hi> from this Blind
Guide <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> whose Eye within is yet shut by the god of the
World! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Thou Queriest, whether the Saints in your times are more
perfect than Saints in Scripture times? And the rest of this Query is
to plead for Sin, and against sinless Perfection; and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of it, thou say'st, we cannot shew you one Man that ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, to this I say, Through the Lord's great Love we are able
to hold forth to thee, and all the World, one perfect Man; yea, such
a One, in whose Mouth there was and is no Guil; who did, and doth
good, and sinned not, nor doth sin; who was in a sinless Perfection,
and of such a Man will we glory, not of Self, nor of Flesh, but in him
who is made unto us of God, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification
and Redemption, who is more perfect than Thousands under the Law
were. Go to then, to stop all Mouths, the Gospel-day is Witnessed,
Praised be the Lord, and in Perfection of Beauty do true Believers
now Worship, and the Righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in such
who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; so <hi>John Reynolds</hi>
to thee, and thy Company, I say, Arise, stand up from the Dead, come
out of your own times where there is none perfect, for your times pass
away into nothing; but for Scripture times (that's large, it is not, as
thou would'st Infinuate) ended yet, for the Scripture is the Lord daily
fulfilling, and will do it until time shall be no more; which <hi>he that hath
an Ear to hear, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t him hear;</hi> and not only they, but a Hundred Forty
Four Thousand sinless perfect Ones are mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 25. with
many more; see also Chap. 7. Vers. 9. 14. <hi>an Innunerable Number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. And for thy fifth Query, where thou say'st, If those that
are called <hi>Quakers</hi> esteem themselves the only true Christians in the
World, then would I know where hath been their Church this 1600
Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To this, I say, here thou manifests thy self again; what stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
is here in thy dark Mind? This is like the <hi>Papists</hi> Arguments to
<hi>Protestants;</hi> but to this may be easily answered, that if it be manifest
to the Conscience of any, as Praised be God it is to many, that we are
of God, such a one will never ask such a Question as this: But now
to you who cannot own the Light in your Consciences, we cannot be
manifest, because the World knows us not; and then ask, where hath
your Church been? I say, it hath been ever where it is at this day; to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50955:7"/>
wit, the Church which is in God and Christ; which, when thou comest
to the Light of Christ within thee, then thou wilt see, but till then
we must be content to lye hid from thee, and all Dark Minds, and so
to bear Christ's Reproach; but to all my dear Brethren in Christ, I
say, Behold what manner of Love the Father hath bestowed on us, that
we should be called the Sons of God, Fellow-Citizens in the Heavenly
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> with all the Church of God, First-born of God, whose Names
are written in Heaven, therefore the World knows us not, because it
knew not our Head first, 1 <hi>John 3. Heb.</hi> 12. But as for thy telling of
Esteeming <hi>Self,</hi> and the name <hi>Quaker,</hi> and the like, thou may'st take
those words in again from whence they came, for Self and Names of
Mens giving we deny; and Glory in the Cross of Christ, where the
Name of God is known; and as for the rest of thy Queries, which
tell of our unableness to give a Proof of such People as we, before the
last twenty Years, or so; who placed Religion in <hi>Thouing</hi> and <hi>Thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and refusing to put off their Hats, and wear Decent. Ornaments
in their Apparel, and it is such frothy stuff that it Shames thee and
thy Profession; but thou may'st know, that though you may do what
you will that are without Law to God, yet we are taught to fear the
Lord, and whatsoever is pure, to mind that, and so our Religion stands
in Christ, not in outward Appearances, though the outward be all thou
canst see, and so stumbles at the meanness of it; but what are those
Decent Ornaments in Apparel thou tell'st on? Is needless Points, and
Laces, and Ribonds, and such filth? Then surely all Saints are one
with us here; but for that thou say'st, we Rail against Priests Tythes,
Idols Temples, and Idols Worship, being such as yours; I say, though
Railing we deny, yet we can easily prove by Scripture, that Holy Men
Cried Vehemently against false Worships and Worshipers, who were
guided as you are in all Ages; but as for that, thou say'st, We Rail
against Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and Singing of Psalms, thou
art found a great and false Slanderer in this, for to let pass the word
<hi>Railing,</hi> we deny that we so much as speak against Christ's Baptism,
or Supper, or his Singing, or that we take upon our selves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
any to Hell; but this we say, That no <hi>Vnrighteous</hi> One, or <hi>Hypocrite</hi>
hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of God, or of Christ, and he that is
not with us is against us; which Words will-be hard and heavy for many
to bear; and as for Christ's Baptism, and Supper, and Singing in and with
the Spirit we dearly own, but the Hypocrite and their Leaven we deny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. The next Query is something to the former purpose, and so
that which is said may serve for that; but thou addest a great and
wicked Lie and Slander, in saying, we condemn the most Eminent Saints
and Martyrs, for thou say'st, they were not of our Minds, and thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50955:8"/>
seemest much Troubled, that thy self also (whom thou hast so high an
esteem of) could not pass the Censure of those thou scornfully calls
<hi>Quakers,</hi> have any of them called thee <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and the like? I say,
see if it be not true that might be thus spoken unto thee, for it is no
Derogation to the Honour of Truth, to say, the Truth it self may
call a Deceiver, false Accuser, and Reproacher, by their proper names:
For in <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. and <hi>John</hi> 8. see Christs Language to the Hypocrites
of those Days; so the Error was not in Christ his calling them so,
that were so, but in those <hi>Pharisees</hi> there calling Christ a Deceiver,
and Devil, when he was not so, nor could be; and for the most Holy
and Zealous Christians amongst you, that thou say'st, had the like Names
from us: I answer, if any under the Name <hi>Quaker</hi> called thee or any
of thy Company otherwise than they, in the Light, saw true, or could
make good, they were to blame; but if any in Truth have declared
your Inward Condition to you, though under such Tearms, you ought
rather to repent, than to kick and spurn at it in your hard Hearts; <hi>for
it will be hard for you to kick against the Pricks;</hi> and for Spewing, you
may take that to your selves, whose Throat is an open Sepulchre, wide
opened against all that are Holy and Zealous in Christ, to separate
from you, and witness against your Deceit: And so if those thou
callest Holy and Zealous Christians amongst you, together with thy
self be weighed in the Ballance of Truth, it will appear you are as far
from that State, as the <hi>East</hi> is from the <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I demand how thou knowest the Saints and Martyrs were not of
our Perswasion and Practice? for thou dost not judge with the Light
that is Pure and Spiritual, as is manifest, nor see with a single Eye,
but only judgeth with thy Evil Thoughts and False Imaginations; for
we say in a few words, that our Mind and Practice is to believe on the
Name of the Son of God, that true Light <hi>that Lighteth every Man that
cometh into the World,</hi> and to love one another, and to labour to keep
a Conscience void of offence towards God and all Men: And I Read
that the Saints and Martyrs were of this Perswasion and Practice with
us, and so we have a Cloud of Witnesses, both Ancient and Modern,
of the Truth of this our way; and so if thou hast Books that tell of
other manner of Saints or Martyrs, I deny both them and thee, in
calling them Saints, who are not; for the Saints of God and Martyrs
of Jesus are one Body in all Ages, not loving their Lives to death, that
so they might always keep to God's manifest Truth in them without
denying it before Men; and this is that which the Lord God hath
wrought in us poor Despised People, to the Glory of his Grace in this
his day, that no Flesh might Glory, but as it is written, <hi>Let him that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
Glory in the Lord, who alone is worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50955:8"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. But in thy seventh and next Query, thou thinkest thou hast
gotten something against us, because, say'st thou, we use to cry against
you as Hirelings, and that you would Preach no longer than People
put into your Mouths; but now, say'st thou, it's manifest that many
of these are ready to lose all for the Testimony of Jesus, and to Preach
the Gospel freely though it be in danger of Imprisonment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer and say, That the Testimony of those
thou scornfully callest <hi>Quakers,</hi> against you, stands firm and true, for
all these thy high swelling Words of Vanity; for we know none of
you Preaching freely as yet, and the reason why you talk in the form,
you do it because you cannot keep your fat Benefices; O Hypocrites!
What Whining and Complaining is there by you in these days for your
Belly? But for Preaching the Gospel, you have manifested your selves
to be Ignorant both of Christ and of the Gospel, by denying the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the Light <hi>which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi>
John 1. 9. and then put the Letter for the Light, and so sight and strive
with your Brethren about your form and several Imaginations of the
Letter; one cries up a <hi>Bishop,</hi> another a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and both of you Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the true Bishop and Elder. But <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> would'st not
thou and thy Brethren be at the Gain from your Quarter again, if
Common-Prayer could be dispensed withal? Oh if you be brought
into such a suffering Frame! How is it that we have no more of your
Company in Prison? Nay, nay, your old Heart is in you yet, and ye
would be sucking Lambs Blood still if you had Power, and that the
God of Heaven sees, and will take Vengeance on you for it; and that
which you cannot do with your Hands, you are doing with your Tongues
and Pens, as is manifest. But I have often said, if you could Preach
freely; that is, without a set or forced maintenance, in the state where
you are, that would not at all commend you to God or his People:
<hi>For you have run, and God never sent you;</hi> and therefore you remain so
ignorant of him, and profit not them that follow you; for when did
Christ bid you go to the Universities of the World to learn him there?
And when did he bid you go to such a place, and such a place, and
there sit down and Eat the Fat, and Cloath with the Wooll, and Preach
the Thoughts of your vain Hearts, as you have done, and would do,
and be guarded by the Magistrates Power, that none should speak to
you in your high Places, nor going nor coming from thence? O call to
mind the day of your fulness, and of your Pride; the same measme
you mete to others is God measuring to you; you must be broken to
pieces, because you turn not to the Lord for all this: And to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
thing, the Light in your Conscience, you must come and how
before it, as others have done, before you be healed; and if it give
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50955:9"/>
you a word to speak, you may speak it; otherwise you must be silent,
or you perish: The Lord is arisen, and so if indeed you can kiss his
Rod, you may find Mercy; but if you still go on justifying your selves
in his sight, you shall certainly moulder to nothing; the Lord hath
said it, who is daily gathering his Lambs out of the Mouths of all
Devourers, <hi>Glory to his Name for ever.</hi> But what Testimony of Jesus
can you either give or suffer for, who have so Vilified and Reproached
the Spirit of Prophesie in Sons and Daughters, in Servants and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids
in these Days? For the Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of
Prophesie.</p>
            <p>And now all People, I shall lay before you, a little more, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> and such like boasting Men, who now thus
cry up themselves for suffering Ministers of Christ, as to this particular
thing. In the former times, before the Wars when the Bishops had
Rule, there were some such that could not conform to all the Fooleries
of those Days, and so could not enjoy their fat Benefices (though they
loved them well enough) and so instead of suffering in <hi>Old-England</hi> fled
into <hi>New-England</hi> to avoid the Cross, and so in process of time it came
to pass that they got the Magistrates on their side there; and then
their Old Wolfish Hearts being still in them, they fell on Persecuting
the Servants of God that came amongst them to witness to Truth,
insomuch that of late years they have sucked the Blood of several of
our Dear Members in Christ; Three they hanged on a Tree, cut the
Ears of others, Tortur'd the Bodies of many with cruel Whippings,
spoiled the Goods of many, and Banished others for no other thing,
but for owning the Truth as it is in Jesus, and meeting to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. The Eighth and next Query is such a vain and empty one,
that the very setting of it down will be in great measure an answer
to it, and it is this.</p>
            <p>If there be no honest Men in the World that are not <hi>Quakers,</hi> then
is it not certain, that no honest Men ever turned <hi>Quakers?</hi> Then is it
not certain, that none but the Wicked ever turned from us, and then
where is our shame? Again, if all are Graceless Persons that are not
<hi>Quakers,</hi> then how can any Man turn <hi>Quaker</hi> if he will not first acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
himself a Wicked and Graceless Wretch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> O Crooked, Twining, Twisting Serpent! How Cunning and
Crafty wouldst thou here appear in thy vain Philosophy, and false
Science, to cast a Mist before the Eyes of the Simple? Yet, Praised be
the Lord, the least Child of Light sees thee well, and the Seed of the
Woman shall bruise thy Head, and thou shalt not proceed far, but thy
Folly shall be manifest to all, as the Sorceries of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> thy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50955:9"/>
Fathers were; for the Lord is already at work the second time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and no Weapon formed against his Seed shall
ever prosper; but the Horse and his Rider shall fall, and the Beast
and False Prophet shall be taken alive and cast into the Pit, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
praises shall be Sung to the Lord God Almighty by the Lambs
of his Holy Fold, as it is in <hi>Zion</hi> this day.</p>
            <p>But let us see how this reaoning of thine would have helped the
<hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the first times of the Gospel against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and so setting down thy words for them, only instead of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
putting in the word <hi>Christian</hi> thus:</p>
            <p>If there are no honest Men in the World that are not Christians,
then is it not certain, that no honest Man ever turned Christian; and
if so, where is their Glorying? And if all are wicked that are not
Christians; then is it not certain, that none but the Wicked did ever
turn from us; and where is our Shame? Again, If all are Graceless
persons that are not Christians; then is it not certain, that none but
the Wicked did ever turn from us; then where is our Shame? Would
this have been good Reasoning, either to have disproved the Christians
Doctrine withal, or to have kept the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in
a safe Condition where they stood? Nay, all must bow to the Son of
God in his rising and going forth; for his going forth is prepared as
the Sun in the Morning, who rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his Course,
and to this Just One must every Knee bow, and Tongue confess; for his
Way is in his Light Shining more and more until it be high Noon and
perfect Day: And the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though as honest as <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi>
10. and the <hi>Jew,</hi> though as blameless concerning the Law as <hi>Paul</hi> in
his first state was, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. must bow to him: Yea further, <hi>Let all the
Angels of God Worship him.</hi> But as for the Worlds Inhabitants, both
Honest and Wicked, we know that the whole World lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And so, before you turn such Christians as quake and tremble
at God's Word, and work out their Salvation in Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
you must be content to own your selves to be little less than
Dishonest, Wicked, and Graceless Wretches, though into the Truth
Sinful Flesh and Blood cannot enter; and though you will not now own
the Grace of God to be your Teacher, and so in that respect may be
called Graceless; yet you will one day know, that the Grace of God
which brings Salvation, and would have taught you, did appear unto
you all; and so God will be clear of all your Blood, and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
will be of your selves; and so because you have not received
this manifest Truth, the Grace of God to be your Teacher, therefore
me you given up to believe Lies, as is manifest.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Thy Ninth and next Question is about Ordination; and then
Queries, To what purpose did the Apostles, Evangelists, and Presbyters
ordain Elders in every City with Fasting, Prayer, and Imposition of
Hands, if every Person that will, may run and ordinarily Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any such Ordination? And thou say'st, you may see how Persons
were sent forth to Preach in Scripture, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 23. and 14. 23
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I say, that the purpose of God in ordaining Elders
in every City, as is mentioned in that <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 23. was not that proud
and covetous Men (who have a little Worldly Wisdom only to talk of
the Letter and wrest Scripture by) should perk up and set up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the place of God's Elders in God's Church: But that in this
Church, by his Spirit in those Elders, the Body might be Edified, and
all kept in good order amongst them through Love: Mind, this was
the Church of God which was in God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 1. the Body of Christ,
of his Flesh, and of his Bone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23, 24. Not a Worldly People
gathered in the Will of Man into a vain Form without the power; not
I say, the Synagogue of Satan, who denies Perfection, and the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of Christ's Light: And that there is none knows any thing aright,
but by the Letter, as this <hi>John Reynolds</hi> pretends is not true; for the
Church of God was taught of God, and the Elders in this Church were
not brought up at the Worlds Schools of Learning, nor called of Men
<hi>Master,</hi> nor Hirelings, nor Persecutors of the Innocent, as the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of these days are; but they were Holy Men of God, of mean account
in the World, raised up meerly by God's Power, out of the Heathenish
and Jewish Worships, to know Christs Spirit, and his Anointing in them
which taught them all things; and they were not such as got the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to help them to great Livings and fat Benefices, and compel all by
his Iron Sword to come in to them, but they were Sufferers under the
Powers of the World, as we are at this day.</p>
            <p>But whereas thou speakest of every Man that is not so ordained,
running in his own will ordinarily to Preach, thou may'st take that to
thy self, and your selves, who never were ordained by the Holy Ghost,
as they were; for when did the Holy Ghost in your Assemblies say,
as in <hi>Acts. 13. 2. Separate such and such, for the work I have appointed them
unto,</hi> Nay, nay, you have run and God never sent you; for you never
heard his Holy Voice at any time; and therefore you profit not the
People at all, but make them more Cunning to Dispute against the
Truth, than they were before they followed you.</p>
            <p>But what Ordination of Man had <hi>Paul</hi> at his first going out to Preach?
See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. he received not the Gospel by Man, and went not to Man, no
not to the Apostles themselves for Ordination and Commission to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50955:10"/>
Preach, but immediately Preached Christ, as many have done, and do
at this Day, who go under the Reproach of the name <hi>Quaker.</hi> And
so God is Restoring his Church to us Primitive Purity and Power, to
the stopping of the Mouth, and confounding the Wisdom of all Flesh,
whether called <hi>Pope, Cardinals, Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> that the true Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Body of Christ, to God's Glory, may again appear: And what
Rules and Orders are, and shall be in this true Church, is known to
God, and by him Manifested, and to be Manifested to the Body it
self, and not to the World; for the World must neither have the right
Understanding nor Management of those things, no more than they
had in those Days, when it was said, <hi>I stand not to Mans Judgment; for
the Holy Anointing must be all in the Church of God for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Thy Tenth and next Query, is a plain discovery of thy
Folly, and of thy manifest Enmity against the simple Appearance of
Truth in any discovery; and though thou say, the Scripture is thy
Rule, yet by it thou canst not endure to be Ruled, but plain Language
it self is thy Burthen; and therefore thou askest, how it can be said
that ever Christ, or his Apostles, or Patriarchs, or Prophets used the
words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> when they never spake <hi>English?</hi> And how can
it be unlawful for us to use the word <hi>You</hi> to each other, since the same
words in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> that signifie <hi>Thou,</hi> signifie <hi>You</hi> in the
Singular Number also, and may be Translated <hi>You</hi> as well as <hi>Thou,</hi> and
so it seems thou say'st, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ, John Reynolds,</hi> Didst thou Read this Query twice over? Or
didst thou at all Consider what thou said'st in it? Was either the Fear
of God, or Care of thy own Credit before thy Eyes when thou writest
it? Surely neither. But thou hast judged in thy self with thy vain
Thought, that because thou hast used to blind thy poor Hearers, and
make them believe any thing for Truth thou speakest or writest; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will be so with others: Nay, nay, the Day is dawned, the Lord
hath given his People an Eye whereby all Covers are seen through;
and to this Light thou hast manifested as much Nakedness and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be in thee, as in the grossest of them that say Mass at <hi>Rome,</hi>
or read Common-Prayer in <hi>English:</hi> Nay, I do believe many of them
would be ashamed to argue thus, as thou dost; to wit, because Christ,
his Apostles, Patriarchs and Prophets did not speak in the <hi>English</hi>
Tongue, that therefore they used not the words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee:</hi> How
came the Translators to Translate their Words, when they speak to a
particular Person, <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> and never <hi>You,</hi> as may all over Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be easily found; thou may'st as well say, Christ, his Apostles, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and Prophets said nothing at all that is Recorded in Scripture
in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, because they spoke not <hi>English;</hi> so the Lord hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50955:11"/>
catched the Wise in his own Craftiness; but thou goest on, and say'st
the same words in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that signifie <hi>Thou,</hi> signifie
<hi>You,</hi> in the Singular Number also, and may be Translated <hi>You,</hi> as well
as <hi>Thou;</hi> which, I say, is altogether false; for <hi>You</hi> is not at all Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but Plural altogether, and so the Translators of the Bible knew,
and therefore never Translated their Singular Term in the forraign
Language to you in <hi>English,</hi> but <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> as is before mentioned;
and for that place in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 27, thou set'st down, and says, it
seems that <hi>You</hi> is used to a singular there, it shames thee; for if envy
to the Truth had not Blinded thee, thou mightest <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that the
King speaking to <hi>Zadock,</hi> and saying, <hi>Your Sons and you, speaks not of</hi>
Zadock <hi>and his Son, but of</hi> Zadock <hi>and</hi> Abiathar <hi>and their Sons,</hi> as the
very words next after; and in <hi>Verse</hi> 29. plainly shew, and so here thou
hast committed that great Error thy self, that thy Generation use to
Charge falsly upon us; to wit, in taking a piece of a Verse that seems
to make for thy purpose, and leaves out the rest that shews fully the
Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. Thy Eleventh and next Query is for the World, where thou
undertakest the part of an Advocate for Flesh; not only pleading for
the Honour that is below, but also for the Manner of it. Thy Doctrine
is very pleasant to the fall'n Man, and the World cannot hate such
Preachers as thee; for ye are not only of the World, but chief Master-Builders
of the old House of the fall'n <hi>Adam,</hi> who loves the Earthly
Honour. But now that Chrst the second <hi>Adam</hi> is come, the Lord
from Heaven, above the Earthly Man, let all Flesh bow before him, and
give up his Honour to him; otherwise this shall be fitly applied unto
you that Christ said unto the <hi>Jews, How can you believe, that not only
receive, but also seek, and plead for Honour one of and from another?</hi> John
5. 44. <hi>For Christ received not Honour from Men,</hi> Verse 41. So that tho'
there was a time that Angels were bowed unto, which were greater
than Flesh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1. yet a time came that Angels denied that Honour,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. For now the Son himself was Glorified, of whom it was
said, <hi>And let all the Angels of God Worship him,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. <hi>And at his
Name shall every Knee bow,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. And Christ said to the Devil,
who was like his Children, that would now be Worshipped, <hi>Thou
shalt Worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve:</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi>
and <hi>Haman</hi> would be bowed unto, but the true <hi>Jew</hi> will bow only
to God: But thou queriest, and say'st:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether did the Saints in Scripture-times Sin, in giving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
that is, (say'st thou) A Civil or Inferiour Honour unto Men, and
upon occasion Testifying the same by Honorary Words or Deeds?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50955:11"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer and say, 1626 All that the Saints before the
coming of Christ did, is not to be an Example to us now; but we must
all now, that would be approved to Christ, take him for our
Example, and to follow no Man for our Example, further than
they followed, or do follow him; and when the Apostles speak
of Honouring all, it must be understood (as in some place is mentioned)
in the Lord; and that is not with Cap and Knee, and false Flattering
Titles, and Gestures, as the World useth; but in Heart and Truth,
as the Spirit of God moveth: So that a Man must first be in the Lord
(out of the first fall'n false Mind) otherwise he knows not at all how
to Honour either God or Man, but is a Dissembling Wretch, making
fair Shews outwardly of Love, where nothing but War and Self-love
is in the Heart: See 2 <hi>Sam. 20. 9, 10. Jude</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Thus Children being in the Lord, do, through the Lord, Honour
Parents aright; thus Servants in the Lord, Honour their Masters after
the Flesh aright; and so Church-members the Elders, Wives their
Husbands; the Ruled the Rulers: Yea, thus they Honour their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Brethren aright; and in a Word, all Men; and so the Scripture is
fulfilled in them: But what Honour do these Faithful Ones look for
from Men? Nay, nay, believe and seek for that Honour that
comes from God only; and so the Scripture will not help the fall'n Man
now to his Honour, which is his Life; but as the Scripture saith, <hi>He
that would save his Life, must loose it.</hi> And so all you, Hypocrites of the
World, who are giving Honour to Proud Flesh, and receiving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from it, cease your Work, and let Christ have his due, or verily
he will break you all in pieces with his Iron Rod. But in the end of
thy Query, thy Conscience a little checking thee for this vain Work,
thou wouldst daub over the matter, by telling People the Honour from
below, which thou hast been pleading for, must not be in Opposition to,
but in Subordination to God's Honour: Nay, nay, I say, the true
Christ, the Son of God is come, and all Power in Heaven and Earth is
given to him; and so all Honour, and Glory, and Worship is his due
(and the due of none else) to whom be it given of all his Angels
and Servants, both now and for evermore. So all People, hearken and
hear a word for your good; would ye be Honoured? Then Honour
the Lord by obeying his Voice, and he will Honour you in due time,
though for doing his Will you loose the Worlds Honour, as assuredly
ye will, if once ye be Faithful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 12. The next Query Consisteth of a great Boast of the Ministry,
as though it were Unrebukeable. And thou queriest, whether that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
can be lawfully Condemned as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> which the Lord hath
owned and sealed with the Conversion of many Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50955:12"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1662.</note> To which, I say if your Ministry were such as this thou
speakest of, then indeed it were not safe to condemn it: But where are
these Converts thou speakest of; to be a Convert, is to be turned
from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God;
bring forth the Man that can witness thee to be a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
this way, that he may give us an Account of the true Hope, if he
have it in him: <hi>But Men cannot gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of
Thistles;</hi> so thou being such an Evil Tree, as thou hast manifested thy
self in these Queries to be, how can a true Convert be expected from
such a Ministry? But thou say'st, its in Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that many
stubborn Sinners have been brought down unto their Faces, and to
confess that God is in you of a Truth: But I say, it will be hard for
thee to bring forth such a Man; for when I use to come amongst you
to declare Truth against your Deceit, as the Lord ordered me, I found
a heap of hard-hearted Sinners, more like to destroy the Creature,
than to be Witnesses of Truth. O shameless Men that bring forth
such bad Fruit! And yet, with a Whores Fore-head, dare take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which speaks of Prophets in God's Church in God's Power, and
apply it to your selves, who deny the sufficiency of Christ's Light
in Man; and know nothing but meerly by the Letter without, as thou
for thy own particular hast made manifest, and so are sensual, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spirit, as was noted in the third Query.</p>
            <p>I observe also, in this present Twelfth Query, the Ignorance of the
Grace of God; for when thou hast falsly Boasted of your Ministry
what is hath done, thou say'st, is not this the Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Salvation? <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. I say no; your Ministry, not being the
true, is far from being the Grace of God there spoken of; But if it
were the true Ministry, it were not that Grace there spoken of; for
the true Ministry is but a service to that Grace, not the Grace it self;
for the Grace of God is that which hath appeared unto all Men, and
that which brought Salvation to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> as God's Gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Words or Works, and which was the Teacher of the Apostles
themselves, as well as others: And so when People would have been
setting up <hi>Paul</hi> for his Ministry's sake, he denied it, as nothing in
comparison of the All-sufficiency of the Grace of God, and the Word
thereof, to which only at best he was but a Servant. But if it could
be manifest, that any under or amongst you were Convinced of the
Evil of their Ways in some measure; and so in their Dark Minds
set upon a seeking after the unknown God, which is the most can be
found amongst you, and that rarely neither; this is no warrant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for them to stay with you, who are Ignorant of the Way
out of Sin unto God, neither is it any proof for you to be Gospel-Ministers,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50955:12"/>
nor your Ministry to be a Gospel-Ministry: For the Gospel-Ministry
is not only Convincing, but Converting and Perfecting, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 11, 12, 13. which work ye have utterly denied, and so shut out
your selves for ever from the Gospel-Ministry; and amongst the
Priests of the Letter, Law at best, must you be reckoned, which
made nothing Perfect; and hence it is that you are such bitter Enemies
to the Spiritual Ministration, or New Covenant mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.
And such earnest Contenders for the outward Shadows, outward Law,
Tythes, Temples, Days, Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is now every where found.
But for the True Power, and Gospel-Ministration, it is risen above
all your Languages and Tongues, and hath darkened the Glory of all
your Fleshly Forms and Likenesses: And the Babes of God are in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God turned, and turning from you unto this his Power that
perfects to God for ever: And <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his Host will not now
be able to hinder Praises to the Lord God for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 13. In this next Query thou goest on seeking false Covers to
hide thine and your Nakedness, asking; How can the <hi>Quakers</hi> Condemn
your Congregations, because of some Wicked Unprofitable Hearers,
when Christ himself (say'st thou) did not Convert all his Hearers?
And for this thou bringest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 20. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. and <hi>Isa.</hi>
49. 4. I say, all this will not cover your Nakedness, Oh ye Teachers! nor
your Congregations; for what have you to do to compare your selves
with Christ and his Holy Prophets? You that deny the Immediate
Revelations and Teachings of God's Infallible Spirit in these Days,
and instead thereof, set up Schools of Humane Learning to make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
by. O Hypocrites! When will you give over perverting the
right Ways of the Lord, and leading the Blind into the Ditch? You
that love to be called of Men, <hi>Master, Greetings in the Market, upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Rooms at Feasts, chief Places in the Synagogues,</hi> as the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
did, all which Christ dis-allowed: What have you to do to compare
your selves with Christ and his Prophets? They are not Hirelings, and
Fighters, and Pleaders for the Worlds Gain, as you are: And so, tho'
all that heard the outward Declaration, or Sound of Christ, or his
Prophets Words were not Converted, yet that makes nothing for you,
who have only a Sound, and so Convert none to God: But, as I said
before, beget them into your own Images, making them more able to
Dispute against the Life of Truth than some others, and so greater
will be your Condemnation: But now your Sheeps-Cloathing being
pull'd off, the Lord will be Glorified in his Power, in the Conversion
of many to himself without you: For he hath rejected your Confidence,
and laid waste your Mountain, and the Mountain of the Lords House
is on the top of all your Mountains in this great Day of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50955:13"/>
in all the Children of the Lord are taught of the Lord, and walk only
in his Light, which comprehends and teaches to avoid all the cunning
crafty Ways of the Serpent; and now, not in your Congregations, but
in that Holy Assembly, is <hi>the Swords beaten into Plow-shares, and the Spears
into Pruning Hooks, and no War any more learned, but under the Vine and
Fig-tree all sit eating their pleasant Fruits, and taking the Cup of Salvation,</hi>
and both Praying unto, and Praising the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But thou say'st, we have Drunkards, Fornicators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among us, as
well as you, and that they are with us at our Prayers (if we have any)
and that they are not so severely dealt withal as yours are; for, thou
say'st, some of yours cast them out, which we do not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, thou false Accuser, such are cast out from us, and from
the Church of God, and with us they can neither Eat nor Pray, but
with such as are Ignorant of Christ, and the Sufficiency of his Light,
and know no Light nor Teacher but a Letter without (as thou hast
manifested in thy Queries) they may both Eat, and Preach, and Pray;
and when you cast out Drunkards and Fornicators from amongst you,
you must cast out your selves, for in that Nature you and all Hypocrites
are; and so some of you are Drunk with Wine and strong Drink, and
some with the Cup of the great Whore, some in the outward Fronica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
others in the inward, and some in both; so that your Tables
are full of Vomit, and every Bed defiled amongst you. And for the
outward Drunkards and Harlots, and such like (though we cannot but
reprove and cast them out in that State) yet this we say of them, that
they may sooner enter into the Kingdom of God than you that judge
your selves free, and are not; for you are so Painted and Conceited,
<hi>that it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of Needle, than for you
to enter in,</hi> and this makes your Wound more Uncureable, for you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enter in your selves, nor suffer others.</p>
            <p>And for those words in thy Parenthesis, whereby thou questionest,
Whether we have any Prayer amongst us, shows thee to be a great
stranger to us and our Practice; for Prayer with the Spirit, and with
Understanding we allow, and are taught to practice, and say with the
Apostle, <hi>Pray continually;</hi> but the wicked Hypocrites the Lord rejects,
whose Prayers to God are Abomination; and so it would have become
thee to have said less of us, and to have judged more soberly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
of us, until thou hast known us better than thou hast done;
for thou hast little knowledge of us, it seems, by coming into our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
but only judgest by Here-say, and false Reports, which brings
thee under Condemnation and Shame, when the Light now searcheth
all things; but your Ways and Practices are well known to such as
are now come from amongst you, and so in that they cannot be deceived.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50955:13"/>
And now, <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> to proceed, I see much of the Wisdom of God
in bringing thee forth thus to manifest thy self in thy Queries; and
the next three Queries that follow, do, with those already mentioned,
fully manifest thy great Ignorance of the Reformation of things brought
to pass in Christ; for the Law had but a Shadow of the good things,
and yet thou stickest not to plead for it; and so thou hadst need learn
the first Principles of the Christian Religion, which thou remainest Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, before thou be a Christian thy self, much more seeing thou
takest upon thee to be Teacher of others; but to set down thy Queries
themselves, or so much of them as is the substance of the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 14. And thy fourteenth Query, is, Had not the Saints, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times,
their set places for publick Worship as well as we? Had they
not their Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. which Christ calls his Fathers House of
Prayer, and whips the Buyers and Sellers out of it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, You have indeed an outward Temple or
House made with Hands to Worship in of your own devizeing, the Old
Popish Mass-house, and so cannot be called the Fathers House of Prayer
so well as the <hi>Jews</hi> was; for the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was made by
God's Appointment for the outward Circumcission to Worship, in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Law, as a Figure of Christ's Body to be Magnified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he whipt Buyers and Sellers then out of the Figure, as he doth now
out of the Substance; but you have not only the Enemies Nature in
you, but you have brought forth his Work into open view in your
outward Temples also, which were never Built by God's Command,
and so there is Buying and Selling amongst you, as was amongst them,
as every Eye seeth: For there you Men made Priests, sell Words, the
Words out of dead Books to the People, and they give you their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Glebe-land, and Tythes for them: O filthy Merchandize! The
Lord hath shaken his Hand at your dishonest Gain, and is whipping
out such Merchants by his Powerful Truth out of his House; and your
dead Works, which you sell at so dear a Rate in your Stone-houses,
which you call <hi>Churches,</hi> shall no Child of Light ever buy of you: For
the true Bread of God, his free Gift, is now witnessed, Praises for ever:
One sort of Merchant Priests sell their Sermons and Mass to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for Money, another sort their Common-Prayer and Sermons, and
the third their Sermons and Directory.</p>
            <p>And thou, <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> pleadest also for Synagogues and Pulpits,
and when thou hast set down Scriptures that tell of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple,
Synagogues, and Pulpit, thou askest, if Christ and his Apostles did not
report to these places to instruct the People? To which I answer, First,
That whilst the <hi>Jewish</hi> People stood, Christ and his Apostles did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
go into their Temple and Synagogues to Preach the Gospel of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50955:14"/>
Kingdom, and so an end of those things, and to bring them out of these
things which they and you so much dote on, and plead for: but they
did never Command Christians to Build such amongst them, but told
them, <hi>Their Bodies were the Temples of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. <hi>and that those that
abide in the Faith, were the House of God,</hi> Heb. 2. And these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
never so confined themselves or others to any such place for the
Exercise of their Conscience in the Worship of God, but met as the
Lord Jesus and his Apostles did; much less did they stir up the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and drive the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their Temple and Synagogues, and the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> out of theirs, that so they might creep into their Houses, and
under another Form of Worship live upon the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priests Tythes,
Offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor upon the Maintenance of the Idolatrous Priests
of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the like Idols; as you Priests, to the shame of your
Profession, have done, and do at this day: What, have you driven the
Papists out of their Mass-houses, and do live upon their Priests Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Tythes, Glebe-lands, Smoke-mony, Garden-pence, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the rest of their Foolish things? What, cannot a Man be
Born, Marry, Live, nor Die, but you must have Mony for it! O Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and Filthy thing! stop your Mouths for ever, for your Folly is
manifest to all, and you can proceed no further: And so you Priests of
the last Order, called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> did not you drive out the Prelates out of
their Houses, which they had gotten from the Papists, and there you sate
down Feeding upon the Spoil of the People, as your Fathers had done,
and now think much that you are driven out again? And thus you fight
with, and drive out one another like wild Beasts, striving each of you
to get Power of others to be great in the Earth, and do what you will
in your fat Pastures. But, as I said, the Lord is arisen to whip you
all out, and to pull down your Nests, and to restore all things to their
Primitive Purity, as in the beginning before the Temples, Tythes,
Pulpits, and such things were.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I consider, that though I read that Christ and his Apostles
went amongst the People in their Temple and Synagogues, as we do at
this day, to Preach the end of these things, and so to bring People to
the Word that was in the Beginning, before all things, that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
might be in Spirit and Truth, as it ought to be, <hi>John</hi> 4. Yet I
never read, that either Christ or his Apostles got up into their Pulpit,
nor ever Commanded his to perk up into a Pulpit of Wood over the
People, as a Master of a Synagogue, to tell his Thoughts of the Letter,
as you do: For though <hi>Ezra,</hi> a Priest of the Law, had his Pulpit or Tower
of Wood to Read or Expound the Letter in, in those days, before the
Life was manifest; yet now the Life Christ Jesus is arisen, whose
Voice in the Heart, and in all places is to be heard, without a Pulpit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50955:14"/>
and without Mony, and without Price; and the Apostles Preached this
Gospel in Towns and Countries, where neither Temple, Synagogue,
nor Pulpit was, but Tumults rather; and so the Gospel is not a thing
that will set up its Servants in Worldly Honour, but indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>which he that hath an Ear may hear,</hi> but the Wicked is so Proud
in Heart, that neither Preacher nor Professor amongst them will stoop
to the simplicity of it.</p>
            <p>The next thing Considerable in this <hi>Query</hi> is, thy twisting and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to keep up the Honour of the old Mass-house, however, if it be
but a Name, though it want the Nature, yet if thou canst save that,
thou thinkest better that than nothing; and say'st, What, though the
Saints of God are called the Church; yet that cannot hinder the House,
where the Church meets, from being called a <hi>Church?</hi> A Profound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning!
What, is this the Fruit of your cried up <hi>Vniversities?</hi> What,
must every Place, where any People meet, be called by the Name of that
People? What Logick is this? Surely the Wisdom of the World
makes haste into its Nothing again; God is utterly Confounding it.
Do you call the place where the Parliament or Privy Council sit, the
Parliament or Privy Council? Do you call a Barn, or such a moon place,
where the Saints of God now a-days often meet, by the Name of a
Church? If we should Reason for the places where we meet, as you
do for yours, surely you would Laugh at us, and might then well
call us filly Women and Seducers indeed.</p>
            <p>But, to go on, thou bringest a Scripture as though thou would'st prove
the thing, and it is <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 37. but the place being well weighed
shames thee the more; for the words in that place are the words of a
Town-Clark, a Worshipper of Idols, and they are these, <hi>For you have
brought hither these Men, which are neither Robbers of Churches</hi> (as K.
<hi>James</hi>'s Translators of the Bible have it,) but in the Translation of
the Bible by <hi>Beza,</hi> it is, <hi>You have brought hither these Men, which have
neither committed Sacriledge; nor,</hi> &amp;c. if <hi>Paul</hi> had spoken to him or
others, and called a Stone-house a Church, as ye do, it had been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose; but the Heathen speaking there of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi>
improperly Translated <hi>Robbing of Churches,</hi> can neither be understood to
speak of a Christian Assembly, nor the place where they Assemble;
for the Covetous and Idolatrous Copper-smith, and his Rude Fellows,
matterr'd little what <hi>Paul</hi> had done to these; but this Sacriledge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, it must needs respect something that the Heathen had in
great Esteem: But thou bringing this to prove that a House may be
called a Church, because of the Church that may meet in it, is nothing
at all to the purpose; for thou wilt not say, it's like that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of <hi>Diana</hi> were the Church; for he that runs without Light must
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50955:15"/>
needs stumble, if not fall often. So <hi>J. R.</hi> walk more soberly, and take
some Light along with thee, when thou hast to do in such things.</p>
            <p>Then the last thing in this thy Query is a secret Confession of a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thy own Arguments in this matter; and thou say'st, What tho'
the Worship of God be not so tyed to any place, as formerly; yet there
should be convenient places for the Church to meet in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, The Worship of God now is not tyed to any set
place at all, and so all your set places, that you plead for, are in the
will of Man; and the true Church God both hath and will order it,
and provide convenient places for it to meet in, though the World
cannot hardly afford it on Earth a place to meet in at all. And for that
thou concludest and sayest, What though our Churches have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Abused to Idolatry; So were the Temples and Synagogues abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Idolatrous and Superstitious Worship, yet nevertheless did
Christ and his Apostles make use of them: I answer, What use Christ
and his Apostles made of Temple and Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is in
part before declared: To which this may be added;</p>
            <p>As for Christ, he was, according to the Flesh, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, and so he was to cleanse the Temple, a Figure of his
Body, and fulfil the rest of the Laws, Shadows and Customs, and so
end them all, and through the Gospel bring Life and Immorrality to
Light, and to Consecrate the New and Living Way through the death
of all old things; for he Nailed them all to his Cross, and they died
with him; but he arose from the Dead, and not to bring up the old Dead
things again, as thou <hi>J. R.</hi> and thy Generation would have, but to
make all things New; for saith he that sitteth on the Throne, <hi>Behold,
I make all things New,</hi> Rev. 21. 5. Glory to his Name for ever; but
none can see God in his Throne, but in the Light that comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from him, <hi>which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World;</hi>
which the Worlds Builders did always deny and reject, as they do at
this day: And for the use the Apostles made of the Temple or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was, as is formerly set down, to reason with
them there of things pertaining to the Kingdom of God; the <hi>Jews,</hi>
not the <hi>Christians,</hi> being Assembled there, as the Servants of God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the World <hi>Quakers,</hi> do at this day, to bring People both then
and now from the Shadows unto the Substance Christ Jesus, who hath
said of his Body, <hi>Destroy this Temple, and I will build it again in three
days;</hi> and so the three days being come and finished, the Temple that
is Holy was built again, and God Worshipped and Glorified in it;
but nothing that is defiled or loves a Lie can enter into, or be joyned
unto it: But the <hi>Jews</hi> were more reasonable in one thing than you <hi>Priests</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> are, for they suffered <hi>Paul,</hi> it seems, to Reason with them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50955:15"/>
several of their Sabbath-days in their Assemblies quietly; but now, if
any come amongst you upon the like account that <hi>Paul</hi> did, it's hard
for such to escape your Furious Hands, or a Prison in these days:
Whereby it appears your time is but short, you are so unreasonable and
full of rage.</p>
            <p>But the use that those Gospel-Ministers the Apostles made of the
Jewish Synagogues, will not serve your turns, O Parish-Masters! for
unless you may have them in your own dispose to bring the World
into them, to call you Master, and put into your Mouths, it will not
answer your lustful Mind: And so indeed, with you that have put the
Name of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> upon the Wild World; a great Stone-house
Fashioned to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, with an addition of an high Steeple
(<hi>Babel</hi>-like) with Bells in it, seems most convenient, though it was
not only acused too, but even built for Idolatry so much: But for the
little Flock of Christ in Cities, Towns and Villages, a less House when
they they need one, will be as much, if not more convenient: And to
conclude, whereas thou intimatest, that your great Stone-houses, which
thou callest <hi>Churches,</hi> though formerly used to Idolatry, yet now they
are free; I say, thou wilt want proof for this, so long as you continue
in the Worshipping and Serving of Creatures; (and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine
continues true, which saith, <hi>Covetousness is Idolatory;</hi>) unless you repent
and bring cleaner Vessels into your Temple than you do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. Thy Fourteenth <hi>Query</hi> was for Set-places, now this the
Fifteenth is for Set-times; and thou askest, Had not the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their Set-times for Publick Worship as well we?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, I say, the Saints amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> had their Set-times
for their Worship better than you; for they were under the Law, and
that was their Warrant; but you are neither under Law nor Gospel in
Truth, but ony Carnal lmitators in your Will, sometimes of the one
Customs, and sometimes of the other, as your Self-willed and Self-ended
Hearts in your blindness Prompts you unto; and so for this, I
say, Love the Light which Christ hath lighted you withal, and it will
lead you to Repentance from all your vain Observings; and in the
Light wait, that God's good Spirit you may know, and receive to
Teach you, and lead you into all Truth, according to the Promise;
and so wait in the Light that lets you see your wants, that's the Holy
Place, and wait there for him in his Fear, that comes in his own, not
Man's time; and be not as the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that think to be heard for their
much wording of it, nor spread abroad the Sails of your vain Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when you Pray as the <hi>Hyportes</hi> do, lest <hi>Satan</hi> Transformed carry
you about, and fill you with the Wind of his Frothy Spirit, making you
believe you Pray with Gods Spirit, when it is his own lying Spirit, as
his Custom is amongst you to work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50955:16"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 16. So thou having spent thy Strength in Pleading for your Set-Places
and Times, in Imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> thou goest in this Query,
endeavouring to prove your Work on these times, in those places,
from the likeness of them, to theirs then. And thus as you do, so do
the <hi>Papists</hi> for their Customs, for they Reason as thou do'st: For had
not the <hi>Jews,</hi> say they, a Temple and Synagogues; So we: Had not
they One High Priest? So we, who is called a Pope, had not they an
Altar, and Sacrifice outward? So we; Had not they their Set-Fasts,
and Musick in their Temples, and Quiristers, and Tythes, and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and such things? And so have we, say they: So saith <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>
here in this present Sixteenth Query: Had not the Saints in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Times the Scriptures Read in their Congregations, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21.
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. and sometimes Expounded, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 7, 8. and Prayed there,
Verse 6. and Singing <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms there, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7. &amp;c. and
Blessing the People in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 23. &amp;c. Well,
this was so under the Law, but what wilt thou infer from this, that
you may continue the Customs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in such things; that follows
not, unless you will deny the Ascension of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. from 8. to
17. for the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law, and so they had a Worldly
Sanctuary, and a Worldly Service, with divers Ordinances of that
Nature, until the time of Reformation by Christ raised up, and come
again in Spirit, and then says God, <hi>Behold I make all things New;</hi> and
so he that is in Christ is a New Creature, Old things passed away, all
things become New; New Temple, New Offerings and Service, New
Prayers, Singings, Preachings, which no Worldly Man can get into,
but all with the Holy Spirit and with Understanding: But thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
several places out of the Writings of the Apostles, and <hi>Luke,</hi> as in
<hi>Acts, Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to prove that the Apostles and Saints
use Praying, Preaching, Psalms, and Blessing amongst them: Yea, but
what is that to you, that deny that Infallible Spirit of God to be Head
in you that guided them; and so get the Worlds Wisdom, Acts, and
Helps instead thereof, to make you Ministers and Saints by. You
have indeed in some things a Form of their Works, but the Power
being found, not only wanting amongst you, but denied by you; the
Children of Light are necessitated to turn away from you, and thus to
witness against you.</p>
            <p>But thou say'st, Christ did not only Read the Letter in the <hi>Jews</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,
but also Preached from a Text of it: To which I answer,
For his Reading, he did upon account of being a <hi>Jew,</hi> to fulfil all that
Righteousness of the Law in his day till his Offering up; but that he
Preached from a Text, as you Priests do, I utterly deny. For his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that time was only this; He being Reading in the Prophet, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50955:16"/>
is mentioned in that Fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in providence meeting with
that place, which said, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath
Anointed me to Preach the Gospel, he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted,</hi>
&amp;c. And the Spirit of the Lord arising in him in Life and Power, and
Witnessing in him to the fulfilling of that Scripture in himself, <hi>He was
overcome with Love and Glory, and so closed the Book, and gave it again
to the Servant, and sate down; and so the Eyes of the People were sasiened
on him through Admiration, and Ravishments of Love and Spirit that was
upon him;</hi> and so as that Living Spirit gave him Utterance in the
Silence of all Flesh, he spoke to them, and Preached in many Gracious
Words the fulfilling of that Scripture in the Ears of that Day: And
this was Christs doing there.</p>
            <p>But, O you poor naked Teachers of <hi>England!</hi> &amp;c. What have you
to do to boast of this Example for warranting your Practice? There
was no choosing a Verse in a Chapter in the Will of Man, which you
think you can raise most words from, and so consult with your own
Imaginations and old rusty Books, how you may raise an Hours Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
from it, and so divine to please the itching Ears of Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
that they may give you outward Honour, Glebe-lands, Tythes,
Augmentations, <hi>Easter</hi>-Reckonings, and the like to please your Lusts;
and if need be to Fight for you, and lay their Sword and Law upon
all that will not hold you up, and Cry <hi>Peace</hi> to you: O Hypocrites!
How have you deceived the poor People with your long wrestings of
Scriptures? But now that the Spirit of Truth is come, it is leading us
into all Truth without your help, Praised be the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p>And so for Christ his Expounding out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
and opening the Understanding of the Disciples to know the Scripture
mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. And <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expounding and Testifying of the
Kingdom of God, and Perswading the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning Jesus, both out
of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and out of the Prophets mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. is
nothing to you who now-a-days (instead of Testifying to the Kingdom
of God, and opening the Understanding to know Scriptures, and the
Light of the World, which they witnessed unto) do Testifie of this
World, Pleading for your Carnal Ordinances, Set Places, Set Times,
Bowing one to another, and the like, as is manifest in these Queries;
and so instead of opening, shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against Men,
and so with those of old, <hi>will neither enter into the Kingdom of God your
selves, nor suffer others;</hi> but are under the Wo, as you and the People,
may Read all along in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. And for Singing of Psalms, it doth
not say, that the Saints Sung the very words of <hi>David,</hi> and no other,
and that in Rhime and Meeter, in Worldly Tunes, after Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
or with Organs, or so; but they Sing as the <hi>Spirit</hi> gave
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50955:17"/>
them utterance in plain words, as thou may'st Read in <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 24. &amp;c.
Which thou bringest for Singing, if that may be called Singing, this
was a Song by the Persecuted, not the Persecutors, which in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
Church of God at this day is often Sung, worthy Consideration,
but a shame for all Persecuting Priests and Professers to take these
words into their Mouths: And the same Apostle in that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 26. that saith, every one hath a Psalm, saith, <hi>I will Sing with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and with Vnderstanding;</hi> so then a Psalm was a Gift of the Spirit
spoken forth from the Understanding to the Edifying of the Hearer;
and they were to be silent when that Gift was Exercised as well as
others; but your Confused Noises and Temple-songs is but as Howling
in God's Ears, and his Childrens Ears in this day; for there the Proud
and Scornful Sing Falsly, and say, that they are not Proud and Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because <hi>David</hi> said so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. and so with, and amongst you
is <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms in words used, but the Holy Life and Innocent Love
that he Lived in, in Deeds denied, and so the Lord can take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in you.</p>
            <p>And for that Scripture thou bringest of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons Blessing
the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Name of God: And <hi>Paul</hi>'s commending of
the Churches in the closure of his Epistles to the Grace of God, makes
as little for your customary Blessings of, and speaking Peace to the
Wicked for self-ends, as the Preaching of Christ doth for your Daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Divining for Mony; for you are neither of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Order,
nor of Christ's Anointing; and so <hi>wash you, and make you clean, and
put away the Evil of your Doings,</hi> and God will Bless you, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
and better will it be for you to have the lowest place in that
Blessing, than the uppermost Room where you stand in the Cursed
Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 17. Thy Seventeenth and next Query is; Hath not Christ
Jesus sent out his Ministers to Disciple him all Nations, and to Baptize
them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and Promised
to be with them to the end of the World? <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Is not that
Baptism with Water? And having set down some Scriptures that speaks
of washing with Water, thou criest, Are not they then contrary to
Christ and his Apostles that deny Water-Baptism?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, That all this, if it were granted thee, is
nothing at all to thine and thy Brethrens Practice, who take a little
Water and sprinkle it on a Childs Face, calling it <hi>Christ's Baptism;</hi> for
there was Discipling, and Confessing of Faith, and the Holy Ghost,
before Baptizing, which cannot groundedly, by you, be said of Infants
of a day old, or so; and this thou sawest, which made thee so busie in
the words of that Query there following, to prove Infants sprinkling:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50955:17"/>
And first, Thou goest about to prove it, by saying, The Scripture
intimates that the Children of Believing Parents are Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 10. I say to the Children of Light, this Scripture intimates no such
thing at all, but plainly holds forth the contrary; for the words there
are, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Disciples Necks, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</hi> Now these Disciples here spoken
of, were not Natural Infants, but grown Men, Christian Believers, as
the First, and the Twenty-third, and Twenty-fourth Verses of that
same Fifteenth Chapter do plainly shew; and so if thou hadst not been
a Blind follower of the Blind Guide <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> whose Argument
this is, thou would'st not, it's like, have offered to bring this for this
purpose, for it shames you all for ever: But this Argument being too
weak for thee, thou endeavourest by another Argument, as little to
the purpose, to prove the Natural Infants Subjects of Water-Baptism,
because, say'st thou, they have received the Holy Ghost, or else how
could the Kingdom of God consist of such? To this I answer and say,
But which of the Natural Infants which you sprinkle hath the Holy
Ghost, and which not? How come ye to see this difference? Or you
will say, that all have it; if so, then may People have the Holy Ghost
ordinarily by Natural Birth, without hearing; then where is your
great Glorying of your Words or Sermons? But to proceed, thou
say'st, Can we imagine that God will give them the Kingdom, and
deny them Water-Baptism? I answer, God will give the Kingdom of
Heaven to whom it belongeth, and it consisteth not in outward Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or Washings, as Dipping, or Sprinkling, or so, but in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost: And thou that, with the
Papists, attributes so much to Water-Baptism, how comes it to pass,
that after all your Sprinkling the Children, as they grow up in Years,
many grow up in so much Wickedness and Vanity, as is every where
manifest? And as concerning Children of Believing Parents, we deny
them to be Believers that hate the Light, and believe not in it, but
say, <hi>it is Insufficient,</hi> as before is declared. But as for that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
which thou and thy Brethren usually bring for your Custom of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Sprinkling of Infants; I say, it makes nothing for you, who
sit down in some Fat Benefice or other, as times favour you, and there
Divine from the Letter, as is said, an Hours Discouse or two in a
Week to the People for Mony: Why go you not into all Nations, as
they did, and Disciple the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> if you will be warranted
by this Scripture? But whereas you take the Apostles for your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I query first, When did ever the Apostles go to the Schools
of the World so many Years to be made Ministers? Did ever the
Apostles seek to the Magistrates to compel People to pay them Wages,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50955:18"/>
as you do, or compel People by their Sword to conform to Christian
Doctrine? Or when did they sprinkle Infants, receive Tythes of the
People, or Sing <hi>David</hi>'s Prayers, Quakings in Rhime and Meeter, as
you do? When were they called <hi>Master,</hi> as you are? And many the
like things, wherein you differ as much from the Apostles, as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from Light, whereby you shew your selves to be Guided by a
contrary Spirit, (to wit) the Spirit of Error: So for ever be silent,
and stop your Mouths, for you are both out of the Apostles Doctrine
and Practice, as your Fruits make you manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. Thy Eighteenth Query is concerning the Supper; and thou
askest, Hath not Christ Jesus given us his own Example for the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>his Last Supper?</hi> And hath not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> delivered it to
the Church, and Commanded the Saints to do it in Remembrance of
Christ, <hi>and thereby to shew forth the Lord's Death till he come again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> we own; for <hi>Behold I stand at the Door and
knock,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and if any Man hear my Voice, and open to me, I will
come in and sup with him, and he with me:</hi> And for the Doctrine of
Christ, his Eating and Drinking with his Disciples, so we own it in
its place, and for its time; but what is that to you, who are both
out of the Doctrine and Practice of the Apostles, as by your Fruits is
manifest? <hi>And so you Eat and Drink unworthily, and thereby are guilty of
the Body and Blood of Christ; and so Eat and Drink Damnation to your
selves, and do not discern the Lord's Body:</hi> And so in witnessing against
you and your Practices in this State, we neither Vilifie Men, nor Jesus
Christ. And thou say'st, What a vain pretence is it to say, We Eat
Christ Spiritually? I say, it it vain, if it be but in Pretence; but if
it be in Truth, it is the greatest thing, for it is <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> and he
that thus Feeds upon Christ's Body is Alive to God: But you in all,
your other Eatings and Drinkings, are Dead whil'st you Live: And
so of you, that would keep People always in the Figures and Signs,
saying, <hi>The coming of Christ,</hi> spoken of 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 26. is never to be
witnessed here:</hi> I demand, Whether that Cup which the Apostle said,
<hi>The Cup of Blessing which we Bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood
of Christ; And the Bread which we Break, is it not the Communion of the
Body of Christ: For we being many are one Body, and one Bread; for we
are all Partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 15, 16, 17. I say, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was this outward Bread and Wine, yea or nay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 19. And in the next Query thou comest over with these things
again, saying, How can those Persons be Faithful to Christ Jesus, and
Obedient to his Gospel, that refuse to Pray, and Sing Psalms, and
Baptize with Water, and receive the Lord's Supper?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50955:18"/>
I answer and say, If any disobey God in any thing he commands
them unto, whether in any of these things, or in any other, they are
not Faithful to Christ and his Gospel; but those People thou here
secretly shoots at, are taught to obey God in all his Requirings, and
so to Glorifie him in their Bodies and Spirits, which are his; and so
are we clear before the Lord from this thy Charge, and also from
that which follows; for we Revile none, much less those that in
Conscience of their Duty to God observe them or any thing else: And
so the Reviler must lodge in thine own Bed, who fears not to Revile
and speak Evil of such in these days, as in Conscience to their known
Duty to God, Worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
            <p>But you whose Fear towards God is taught by the Precepts of Men,
in vain is all your Worship; for I Testifie for the Lord, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you do, though it had the very Form of the Saints Practice of
old, which yours have not, and not led thereinto by the Motion of
the Eternal and Infallible Spirit of Life, it is nothing but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Men, and Will-worship, and no better than Offering Swines
Blood, or cutting off a Dogs Neck: and for the endeavouring to keep
up your Custom of Praying, and Singing in mixt Congregations,
from the Example of <hi>Jews,</hi> or them that follow Christ; I say, your
Hypocritical Praying and Singing is good no where, but Rejected of
God; and I see thy P<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide all along, that would be comparing your
Congregations to those that followed Christ: Nay, nay, for though
there was One Devil, yet there was Eleven Saints; but when you are
searched, scarce One of many Twelves that hath any true Fear of God
before their Eye is to be found amongst you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 20 And whereas in thy last Query thou askest, Whether those
Persons that have Experienced the Operation of the Spirit of God in
the Gospels Preaching and Administrations, Convincing their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Melting the Hearts, Humbling the Spirits, and Turning them from
Darkness to Light, and have afterwards Tasted much Sweetness, and
have felt Soul-Ravishing Comforts in the Enjoyment of God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
have not the Witness in themselves that God doth own these,
and Bless these Priviledges to them. I answer, Yea, it is thus with
all that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Truth, have the Witness in themselves, that God doth
own these, and Bless these Priviledges to them. But those People
that go under the Name <hi>Quakers,</hi> have, to the Praise of God's free
Love, the Witness in themselves of such Fruits as these amongst them,
from the Virtue of the Everlasting Gospel, and its Administration.
And therefore we can Witness, that <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> and all such as
Condemn this Ministry and Work of God amongst us (as Heresie,
or so) are Deceivers, and that they are Strangers to Spiritual
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50955:19"/>
Communion with God,<note place="margin">1670</note> whatever in words they may Boast, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
meet with, and enjoy God where we (to his Immortal Praise,
be it in Truth spoken) do experience that loving Kindness and Goodness
which is better than Life it self: And therefore, how long may this
<hi>John Reynolds,</hi> or any other Seducer or painted Sepulchre talk, before
ever they can perswade these whom the Lord hath so loved, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their own Spiritual Senses and Experiencies? But to conclude,
Whereas this <hi>John Reynolds</hi> in his high swelling Words of his <hi>last Query,</hi>
and the 12<hi>th,</hi> boasts much of his own and his Fellows Experiencies of
Spiritual things, I refer the Reader to the rest of his <hi>Queries,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and to the answers to them all;
and to weigh all in the Ballance of Just Judgment, and it will appear to
him beyond words what may be Judged of them and us.</p>
