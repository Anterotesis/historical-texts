            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the late unhappy Troubles in <hi>England,</hi> it was the uſual Obſervation of Forreigners, who had been acquainted with this and other Nations, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Lady</hi> was the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, chaſt, and pious Woman in <hi>Europe;</hi> that ſhe was eminent for Reverence, Obedience, Faithfulneſs, and Affectionateneſs to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for diſcreet, frugal management of her
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48843:3"/>
Houſe and Family, for Sobriety, Retiredneſs, Taciturnity, Humility, Patience, and all other Graces and Vertues, wherewith the holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of old were endowed: Since which, by a general licentiouſneſs, during our late unnatural War, not only all kind of Sects, and with them Irreligion, Atheiſm, and Debauchery, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced amongſt the Men of this Nation; but alſo moſt of thoſe fore-mentioned excellent Qualifications are now at length (to the great grief of all ſober perſons) become more rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Women, then perhaps in any of our Neighbouring Countreys: which having been ſeriouſly and ſadly conſidered, it is by many Godly prudent men judged very expedient, that moſt earneſt endeavors ſhould ſpeedily be uſed by ſome extraordinary way of Education to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce (if poſſible) the Female Sex of <hi>England</hi> to their Priſtine Vertues; that ſo by their Godly Converſation, and good Examples, their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Children, and Servants may in time be won, and at length a general Reformation wrought in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Some have thought beſt to ſet their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be educated in the Maiden Schools in and about <hi>London,</hi> where either through the Unskilfulneſs, or Negligence; through the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48843:3"/>
or Covetouſneſs of the Miſtreſſes, too much minding their private profit, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs oft times hath not anſwered the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Parents and Friends; whereof there are divers lamentable Examples, and grievous Complainings.</p>
            <p>Others therefore (though of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi>) have choſen rather to be at the great Charges, and hazard of ſending their Daughters to be bred up (till the time of their Marriage) in ſome Popiſh Monaſteries of our next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countreys: whence they have return'd otherwiſe very vertuous, but generally tainted with, and enclined to <hi>Romiſh Superſtitions,</hi> and Errours.</p>
            <p>Some have aſſayed to educate their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alwayes at home, but thereby have found them apt to be corrupted, or betrayed by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (of whoſe unfaithfulneſs and viciouſneſs there is now a more general complaint than ever;) or elſe in continual danger to be ſtoln away by ſome debauched indigent Neighbours; or if they are rich Orphans, to be ſold by the Truſtees; whereof there are alſo divers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; or to be wholly ignorant and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the World; or at leaſt to want that handſome becoming Deportment, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48843:4"/>
uſually ſets off, and recommends young Ladies to good Husbands, and is to be acquired onely abroad in a vertuous converſe with others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Divers Gentlemen of this Kingdom have, of late for the Education of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, had recourſe to the Families of ſome <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> where perhaps a ſtricter Education may ſometimes be found, but then if any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be there had, it is uſually attended with this great miſchief, that thereby ſchiſmatical and rebellious principles are inſenſibly inſtilled into them, which may one day occaſion (if not timely prevented) the final overthrow of the preſent eſtabliſhed Church and State.</p>
            <p>Now the Premiſſes conſidered, and alſo, that for the Education of Sons in all Vertue and Piety, no way hath been found to ſucceed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter generally, then to let them paſs their youth in a Collegiate life, under the eye and care of a diſcreet, learned, pious Tutor, and under the regular Government of the Head and Fellows of a Colledge: It is not to be doubted but that ſome ſuch Collegiate life (if rightly inſtituted) may prove as ſucceſsful, and perhaps much more, for the Education of Daughters; and that thereby may be founded not onely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Seminaries and Nurſeries, out of which,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48843:4"/>
Perſons of Honour and Worth may at all times make choice of Vertuous Wives; but alſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion (whereof there is great want in <hi>England</hi>) may be made for ſober, pious, elder Virgins and Widdows, who deſire to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the vanities of the World, and yet employ their Talents to the benefit of the Publick.</p>
            <p>Theſe are therefore to give notice, to all whom it may any way concern, that near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in a pleaſant healthy Soil and Air, there is for both the purpoſes above-mentioned, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a large Houſe, with a Chappel, fair Hall, many commodious Lodgings, and Rooms for all ſorts of neceſſary Offices; together with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Gardens, Orchards, and Courts, all encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed and well ſecured with ſtrong high Walls: Alſo there is a Reverend, Learned, and Pious Divine in the ſame Pariſh, ready to officiate dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Morning and Evening as Chaplain; a grave diſcreet Lady to be Governeſs, with divers other Matrons, who having taken up a reſolution to live a retired, ſingle, and religious life, are to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Government of the Colledge, without expecting any gain, profit, or emolument for themſelves; but to beſtow <hi>gratis</hi> all their care and pains in governing the Colledge and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48843:5"/>
the young Ladies in their Education. Moreover, there will come at due times the beſt and ableſt Teachers in <hi>London</hi> for Singing, Dancing, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments, Writing, French Tongue, Faſhionable Dreſſes, all ſorts of Needle Works; for Confectionary, Cookery, Paſtery; for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling of Waters, making Perfumes, making of ſome ſort of Phyſical and Chyrurgical Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins and Salves for the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo prepared a Body of Statutes and Rules, whereunto all upon their Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to ſubmit themſelves; until the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, with the conſent of the Viſitor, who is a Perſon of great Eminency and Worth, ſhall think fit to alter, or repeal any of them, for the better promoting this Pious Deſign.</p>
            <p>If therefore any Honourable and Worthy Perſons deſire that their Daughters, or any Truſtees, that their Orphans, ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commoners or Penſioners of this Colledge; or any Devout Widdows or Elder Virgins, who intend not to marry, deſire to be admitted Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Aſſiſtants in this Government, and to lead the reſt of their dayes without cares and troubles of the World, to live with honour and reputation, to devote themſelves to the ſervice of God and the good of their Countrey, by

            <div type="part">
               <p>THe Reader may alſo take notice, That near <hi>London</hi> in a good Air, there is a like Deſign for a Colledge for OldMen, either Batchelors or Widdowers, who may for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſum of money be accommodated during life with Diet, Lodging, and all other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; where they may paſs the reſt of their dayes without trouble or care in a comfortable ſociety and converſe with men of the like age and condition, according to the pattern of a Colledge in <hi>Holland.</hi>
