            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Supplement, 1689. to a former
Treatise, concerning the East-India
Trade, Printed 1681.</head>
            <p>THAT the foregoing Treatise was not Calculated
for the present Conjuncture, the time when it
was Printed, and Published, will sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate;
but that which is at one time truly writ on
any Subject, is of use in all times.</p>
            <p>At that time, <hi>viz.</hi> about 1681. This Company had
raised the <hi>English</hi> Navigation and Power in <hi>India,</hi> much
beyond what it was in any former Age, as appears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of the said Treatise: But soon after that
destructive Trade of the <hi>English</hi> interlopers in <hi>India</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> took the advantage of that Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and those Civil Broyles between the <hi>English,</hi> to
surprize <hi>Bantam.</hi> Which troubles falling together upon
the Company, and soon after a general failure of Credit
in all publick Funds, caused very many Adventurers to
sell their Stocks, and was sufficient to have discouraged
any Men, not supported with the inward satisfaction, That it
was their Duty towards God and their Country, couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to assert and defend (according to their Trust) the
<hi>English</hi> Dominion and Interest in <hi>India,</hi> as it was Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
in a Joint-stock, exclusive to all others, which
it must ever be, and strengthened with the same Powers
and Authorities, as the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company have
from their Soveraigns, or else it will fall an unretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52964:2"/>
Victim between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Loss of <hi>England,</hi> and consequently the very great
abatement of the value of our <hi>English</hi> Lands.</p>
            <p>These considerations inculcated to the then Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
(not any private Interest of their own) engaged
their publick and well prepared Minds, not to despair of
the good of their Countrey, but to expose their whole
Stock to hazard, for recovery of the <hi>Pepper</hi> Trade to
<hi>England,</hi> which was thought to be lost upon the surprize
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to recover by Armes from the Great
<hi>Mogul,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Princes satisfaction for Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
received, and also those inestimable Priviledges
they had deprived the <hi>English</hi> of, in those Interloping
times, when they saw the Nation in <hi>India</hi> divided, and
contending among themselves, like <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi>
under the distinction of the Old and the New Company;
which latter Appellation the Interlopers assumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and under that Name made Contracts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Alliances with Princes and Governours in
<hi>India,</hi> without any Authority from their Soveraign, which
our Law accounts a Crime of a high Nature, and which
is in it self by the Experience and Confession of all Men,
of most destructive consequence, to any Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
Trading to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether those generous Resolutions were well or
wisely pursued by the Committee, and whether under all
the aforesaid pressures, they have behaved themselves
like true <hi>Englishmen</hi> and Lovers of their Countrey, will
best appear by a brief, plain, and true Narrative of what
they have done, since the publishing of the aforesaid
Treatise; and what now is the present State of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Interest in <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>These seven ships before-mentioned were Consigned

near one hundred thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Besides about thirty other armed small ships and Vessels,
constantly remaining in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Company have now upon their hands in <hi>England</hi>
unsold, above the value of seven hundred thousand
pounds in <hi>East-India</hi> Goods, for the supply of this and
Foreign Nations, whereas they do not know of fifty
thousand pound value of <hi>East-India</hi> Goods in <hi>Europe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold,
in any other <hi>European</hi> Companies hands, except the
Dutch Spice, of which they always keep great Stores, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the last age secured that Trade intirely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

The Company have within the said seven years last
past, so enlarged, and Fortified the English Fort of St.
<hi>George</hi> and their City of <hi>Madrass,</hi> upon the Coast of
<hi>Choromandel;</hi> that it is now one of the finest, and largest
Cities in those parts of the world, and secured by a good
Garrison, and containing at least one hundred thousand
Families of all Nations, which inhabit within that City,
and the Territory about it, all subject to such Laws for
Life and Goods, as the Company by vertue of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
think fit to impose upon them.</p>
               <p>The Customes and New Impost paid His Majesty by
the Company for two years, from <hi>August,</hi> 1685. to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
1687. amounted to two hundred fifty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
three hundred twenty six pounds, ten shillings and
one penny, as by particulars presented His late Majesty.
Since the Wars in <hi>India,</hi> it hath been less, by reason of
those Wars, but now the Wars are over the Companies
Customs are like to be more yearly, then they were in
either of the two years before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Company have built new Forts in, and otherwise
strengthened their Island of <hi>Bombay,</hi> and have ordered a
dry Dock to be built there, which they hope may be
finisht by this time, and all other conveniences for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
and fitting the biggest English ships, and sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all Stores needful for such purposes: which dry Dock
was the principal want, the English Nation underwent
for some ages before.</p>
               <p>And which is the most considerable National advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that ever was attempted by Englishmen in those
parts of the World, the Company have reduced the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of their Trade of <hi>Surrat,</hi> to their own Island of
<hi>Bombay;</hi> The Inhabitants whereof from four thousand
Families, which they were computed at, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52964:5"/>
first possessed that Island, are since increased to fifty
thousand Families, all subject to the Companies Laws.
And that Island lying upon the North Coast of <hi>India,</hi>
near <hi>Surrat,</hi> the Emporium of the Indian Trade, to <hi>Arabia,
Persia, Bussorah,</hi> and the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> is of inestimable value
to this Kingdom. The said Island hath cost the Company
in Fortifying, Garrisoning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at times above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand pounds <hi>sterling;</hi> and never produced any
return to the Company, nor ever would have been of use
to <hi>England,</hi> nor in a posture to defend it self; though it
be one of the best Ports in the Eastern World, if the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Trade had not been brought thither, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the English shipping to ride there, and load home
(and not at, and from <hi>Swally,</hi> or the River of <hi>Surrat</hi> as
formerly.) This was known to the former Committees,
and lamented long since, that such a Jewel as the Island
of <hi>Bombay</hi> should be in English hands, and we should
not have the heart to make use of it. But the truth was,
those former Committees durst not attempt such a change
of their Affairs, for fear of the charge of such a remove;
but especially for fear of angrying the <hi>Mogul,</hi> whose
people gained exceedingly by our ships riding in their
Ports, as well as by our Trade, and were out of fear of
<hi>Bombay,</hi> while it was in such a forlorn neglected conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore durst boldly injure and affront the
English, while they had the President, and all the Chief
of the Nation, and all their Estates as a Pawn continually
in their hands, to secure their patient suffering of all
contempts whatsoever. But the Case is now altered by
the Conduct, Cost, and Courage of the late Committees,
and the <hi>Moors</hi> must and will be civil hereafter. For as
there is no people kinder than those <hi>India</hi> Governours,
when they have to do with men, that Can and Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52964:5"/>
themselves, so there are no Men more Unjust,
False, Treacherous and Tyrannical than they are, when
they have to do with such, as are intirely within their
power.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogul</hi> being as is generally known, so great and
powerful a Prince, it was vulgarly thought a Vain or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Distracted attempt in the Company, to make any
War upon him, as well in respect of his boundless Riches,
and Power, as of the vast charges the Company should
be at, in sending and maintaining Warlike Ships, into so
remote parts of the World. Yet such hath been God's
blessing upon the Companies Armes, their unavoidable
necessity, and their righteous Cause, that That War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all mens Opinion has ended to the Eternal Honour
of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, in those parts of the World, and a
Peace concluded upon such honourable Articles. (The
Ratifications whereof from the <hi>Mogul</hi> himself in the
<hi>Persian</hi> Language, are brought home now by the Ship
<hi>Modena</hi>) that if a Blank had been delivered to the
Company in <hi>England,</hi> to write down their own Terms,
They would not have desired more than is granted by the
said Articles; The substance of which are as follows,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The Customes at <hi>Surrat</hi> to be two <hi>per
Cent.</hi> and no more, for Goods and Money; and
for what hath been taken more than that, to be
paid back and made good out of the Customs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That at but one place in the Kings
Dominions any Custom be paid, and having
paid Custom at one place, not to be disturbed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52964:6"/>
by any other, nor no manner of duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That no Custom be taken for any
manner of Provisions, and what Custom hath
been paid on that account, to be paid back.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whatever hath been Robbed from
the <hi>English,</hi> to be made good to them, by that
Place or Government, where the loss was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That no Custom be demanded for
what Goods may come from <hi>Mocha,</hi> and what
hath been taken for Custom of those Goods to
be paid back.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That we have a room in the Mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
to our selves, and appoint whom we
please to do our business there, and Coin our
own Money, and the Governour to have no
Command over those Sheroffs or Moneyers, that
are appointed by us for that work.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, What Goods may have passed the
Custom-house, and brought up again, not to be
lyable to pay Custom the second time.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, No Englishman shall serve in the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Dominions, and if any runs away from
Ships or Factories, to be seized and delivered up
to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52964:6"/>
Ninthly, Indico Custom to be at <hi>Rupees</hi> 2 and
three fourths per bale, and no more, and what
taken more then that, to be paid back.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, No demands nor no trouble to the
English at <hi>Surrat,</hi> must be given for what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
hath, or may be done by the English at
<hi>Bengala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventhly, That whatever is bought by
one Governour for the King, although he should
be turned out before the Money should be paid
for such Goods, yet the Money to be made
good, and no abatement made, nor any Goods
so Sold returned.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, That whatever any Officers may
buy or take, the Governour on the place to see
that we be paid for it.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, None shall offer any abuse to
our English, or other Servants of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, That whoever be our Debtors,
the Governour of the place see us paid, on
complaining to him out of hand.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, That no one give us any the
least disturbance at <hi>Swally,</hi> but we Land and
Ship Goods as we please there, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance,
or paying any Custom or other duties.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, That no Goods be over rated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52964:7"/>
at the Custom-house, and that Custom be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for goods bought in the <hi>Moguls</hi> Dominions,
as first cost at the place where bought, and not
to be rated at the place Exported, as worth there.</p>
               <p>To open the foregoing Articles, and to demonstrate
to persons unacquainted with the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of this Peace, and the inestimable value of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to the <hi>English</hi> Trade and Nation, would interrupt
the designed Brevity of this Addition. It is sufficient,
that the worst Enemies the Company have, must confess
if they will say what they think, they are much more
worth than all the Charge of the War, which they cannot
compute at less than Ten Hundred Thousand pound
<hi>Sterling,</hi> and were by themselves thought impossible to
be ever attained; and that no <hi>Englishman</hi> could live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
unsufferable Assronts and Exactions in the Interlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times, before the Company began their late War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Mogul,</hi> whereas now no Nation in <hi>India</hi> hath such
Honourable Terms with that great Monarch, nor none
so much respect from his Governours in all places; which
Honourable and Advantageous Terms the <hi>English</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
are like to enjoy forAges, because the former Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
the <hi>English</hi> had (which were never in any degree
comparable to these) were onely purchased by money
from his grear Governours, and broke at their pleasure,
when more Money could be got from other Nations vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with us in Trade, or <hi>English</hi> Interlopers; Whereas these
are not onely acquired by Armes, and confirmed by the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s own <hi>Phirmaund</hi> and <hi>Husball Hoocombe,</hi> but secured
by maintaining a strong <hi>English</hi> Garrison at <hi>Bombay,</hi> and
making that Island (which lies upon the principal parts of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52964:7"/>
the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, as the Islands of <hi>Scilly</hi> do upon
<hi>England</hi>) the seat of the <hi>English</hi> Dominion, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of their Trade on the North Coast of <hi>India,</hi> as <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
is to the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company on the South.
Which Transition alone, from <hi>Surrat</hi> to <hi>Bombay,</hi> could
never have been done without a War as was before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>

               <p>THE Treaty managed between the great Lord,
sent down by the <hi>Mogul</hi> for that purpose, (which
we hear was his Cousin Germain) and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
General after five weeks Negotiation, was left unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

               </p>
               <p>MAny times I sent your Excellency word, that the King's
<hi>Phirmaund</hi> would come from Court in a litle time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52964:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore I desired your stay at the Rivers mouth one week
more, and Orders would come from Court according to yours,
and my desire; but you would not continue at the Rivers
mouth, but weighed your Anchors and went away, because
of the lateness of the year and bad weather; since, the King's
`<hi>Phirmaund</hi> is come for you, and arrived here the 8th. of
<hi>May,</hi> which the King hath sent with a great deal of Affection
and Love towards you, which was brought by Persons that
attend his own Person, and it is according to your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
the King hath consented to every thing, and you are
Happy and Great, known to the World as the Sun is, and
whatever is in your mind, the King hath impowered me to
comply with; therefore it is fit for you to come away to Surrat
presently over Land, as you promised you would, when you left
<hi>Surrat</hi> Rivers mouth, on knowledge of the King's <hi>Phirmaund</hi>
being arrived here; therefore pray make all the haste you can,
and come and receive your <hi>Phirmaund</hi> from the great King
to your Honour, and let your business go on with a good heart,
and do you not fail to come away with all the speed you can;
I desire it a thousand times over, the <hi>Phirmaund</hi> is much for
your Profit; what I have received from Court concerning it,
I now send you the Copy of.</p>
