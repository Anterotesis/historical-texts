         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR Lord Ieſus being tempted by the Scribes and Phariſees with captious queſtions, ſatisfied them by the holy Scriptures. We in the like cauſe and kinde, are queſtioned, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. But wee eaſilie come out, and free our ſelues by the ſame meanes. For, we cut off with the ſword of the Word theſe knots of intricate Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wreathed of purpoſe to entangle mens mindes. A farre off, they ſeeme <hi>Gardian</hi> knots, but at hand no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Spiders webs, not able to endure the leaſt winde or breath of Truth. They catch nothing but Flies, but light and giddy ſpirits, carryed away with euery firſt blaſt of wordly hopes. Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> a man full of queſtions, hath propoſed them in diuers faſhions to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of ſpirits. We haue had our part: For hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing often-times ſhewed his dexteritie in his ſubtilly-conceiued, and finely-filed queſtions, they to whom he hath propoſed them, haue brought them vnto me, and deſired my anſwere vnto them. I haue alwaies ſatisfied them: but he ſuppreſſing my Anſweres, hath ſtill gone on to make new Queſtions, pleaſing himſelfe onely in the Office of an Inquiſitor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16853:4"/>There is good ſufficiencie required in making good and fit Demands, but more in giuing them apt Anſweres. To moue difficulties, without adding any Anſweres or Solutions, is like the Sunne in March, which drawes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but diſſolues them not. It may be becauſe hee is pearched in ſo high a place (as to be the Kings <hi>Confeſſor</hi>) he thinks he may ſecurely ſpit on euery Paſſenger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any returne of ſuch a wrong. Or happily he takes delight to cut out worke for idle joke. But it is eaſier to tye then vntie a knot. Or it may be that the ſtreame and torrent of his worldly or ciuill affayres do draw his minde ſome other wayes, and that the interpoſition of the earth doth ecclipſe the cleareneſſe and brightneſſe of his ſpirit. Theſe are the cauſes of his ſilence as farre as I am able to deuine: He then following his queſtioning courſe to put impediment to Miniſters in their better imployments hath lately put into the hands of ſome Honourable Perſonages,<note place="margin">Mounſieur de la Forſe.</note> 32. Queſtions, vnanſwerable as he accounts them. I haue readily and ſpeedily anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; and to returne him double pay, I haue ſent him 64. other Demands, to ſee whether he hath as good dexteritie and facilitie in anſwering as he hath edge and itch in asking and queſtioning. He ſhall much deceiue me, if he make any anſwere. He ſhould alſo be the firſt, that hath vndertaken to doe it. At the leaſt, this profit I ſhall receiue by it, that if he anſwere not my Demands, I ſhall be for euer hereafter freed from anſwering his: and he ſhall no longer vaunt (as hee hath often done) that we haue nothing to anſwere him.</p>
            <p>The Anſweres to the 22. and 29. Demands are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and much enlarged.</p>

And S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ſpeaking of Children borne of faithfull Fathers and Mothers, ſaith, that they be holy. By the ſtrength of this Couenant it commeth to paſſe that the Children of the faithfull ſo ſoone as they be borne doe belong to God. As for this abſolute neceſſitie of Baptiſme, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is abſolutely neceſſary to celebrate Baptiſme in the Church, ſith God that ſo commanded: as alſo according to the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. That, <hi>whoſoeuer is not borne of water and the ſpirit cannot enter into the Kingdome of God</hi>: we beleeue that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer voluntarily doth depriue himſelfe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and contemneth it, cannot be ſaued. For it is the contempt, not the want or depriuation of Baptiſme that bringeth condemnation. But to ſay that God cannot, or will not ſaue a childe without Baptiſme, or to beleeue that a childe being carried towards Baptiſme and dying by the way, is excluded from eternall ſaluation. 1. It is a cruell and raſh ſentence. 2. It is a tying of the grace of God to the water. 3. It is the committing of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of a childe into the power of a man, or of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife: for if they liſt to baptiſe the dying childe it ſhall paſſe into Paradiſe; if not, it ſhall not come there. 4. It is an accuſing of God, that he did prouide but badly for the ſaluation of Children borne vnder the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that they might not be circumciſed before the eight day. 4. Euen our aduerſaries themſelues doe hold that many are ſaued without Baptiſme of water, as ſundry Martyrs that were neuer baptiſed. They are much to blame therefore ſo to vrge this paſſage or Text of the third of <hi>Iohn,</hi> wherein themſelues doe ſay

                  </note> 6. This Baptiſme likewiſe of bloud is contrary to their Canons, which hold that the Sacrament is none, if he that bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hath not an intent to baptiſe: for dare they auow that the executioners conferred Baptiſme, or that euer they had any entent to baptiſe? 7. How many people alſo died there by Martyrdome without effuſion of bloud? 8. Alſo ſith Baptiſme is irreiterable (that is, not to be twiſe adminiſtred to one and the ſame perſon) what reaſon haue they, that Martyrdome of a perſon baptiſed ſhould not be a Sacrament, but the Martyrdome of a perſon not baptiſed ſhould be a Sacrament? 9. Doe not our aduerſaries make themſelues, mention of a Baptiſme of the Spirit, which they call <hi>Baptiſmum flaminis,</hi> which ſupplieth the default of the Baptiſme of water? and what elſe doe we ſay? 10. But if we craue formall examples out of the holy Scriptures, euery man knoweth that to the Iſraelites Circumciſion was the ſame which at this day Baptiſme is to vs, and that the neceſſitie was alike: and yet infinite people were ſaued vnder the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Circumciſion, as all the faithfull women, and ſuch as truly repented among the Niniuites. 11.

This do they place vnder the earth, yet tell they vs not where it ſhall be when the earth ſhall not be: nor whether theſe infants ſhall vndergoe the iudgement in the latter day, and what ſentence the Iudge ſhall giue: neyther doe they ſhew vs the reaſon wherefore the bodies of theſe children are throwne headlong into a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, which is in the Hoſpitall called <hi>Hoſtel Dieu,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> as vnworthy of Buriall.</p>

Againe, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt paid not otherwiſe for our fault, but by bearing the paine, he therefore payed for the paine, and there was but one payment for both: It is therefore the forging of a new Goſpell, to imagine that he paid more for the one then for the other: for if he hath fully paid for the fault, then alſo for the paine. And if he hath fully paid for our paine, the ſame was for our acquittall, and to diſcharge vs. 3. Likewiſe becauſe God is iuſt, it were iniuſtice to puniſh a man with ſatisfactory paine, that hath no fault, &amp; ſo conſequently is not faulty.

The tenne Commandements, and the Articles of faith, contained in the Creed, are there plainely layd downe and expounded.

               <p>HEre is a double ſlander, and an impoſture. For 1. where you ſay, we denie you may vſe the like Impoſition of hands, as did the Apoſtles; we denie not but you may if you can beſtow the like miraculous gifts as did the Apoſtles vpon the Samaritanes, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of your hands. Secondly, you imply that wee denie all Impoſition of hands: whereas we will grant you the like forme (though not altogether the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16853:20"/>
of impoſition of hands, as was vſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For as after <hi>Philip</hi> had catechiſed the Samaritanes, and taught them the chiefe points of Chriſtian Doctrine the Apoſtles came and prayed for them, and laid their hands on them: So after children or youth in their owne perſons, haue made publike and particular profeſſion of the ſumme of their faith, or Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme (which others in their name did ſummarily profeſſe for them, at their Baptiſme) we denie not but Prayer may be made for them, that ſtrength &amp; increaſe of the Grace of the holy Ghoſt may be giuen them, to liue and die in that Chriſtian faith, and newneſſe of life, whereof they haue made profeſſion. And that to thoſe prayers may well be added that ancient and Apoſtolike ceremonie of Impoſition of hands, betokening our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained deſires to the parties whom we preſent to God by our prayers.</p>
               <p>But herein is a notable Impoſture: that you would perſwade vs, that the Confirmation or Impoſition of hands,<note place="margin">

                  </note> vſed by your Popiſh Biſhops, is like that of the Apoſtles. Did they conſecrate Oyle mixed with Balme? did they croſſe it, breath vpon it, ſalute it, <hi>Aue ſanctum Chyſma.</hi> Haile, holy Chryſme? Did they annoynt the Samaritanes with ſuch Oyle? Make croſſes in their fore-heads, giue them kiſſes, and claps in their eares, binde their fore-heads with Fillets, and enioyne them not to waſh their faces or heads for ſeauen daies, as the Popiſh Biſhops doe, in their Confirmation? which being more like a May-game (as they vſe it) then a Sacrament (as they make it,<note place="margin">

               <p>It would make a man laugh to heare this Inquiſitour enquire whether in the Apoſtles Catechiſme there was euer an Article of Confirmation. For it were his part to proue that there was one, not ours to proue there was none. It is his part that affirmeth, to proue. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that, we dare not aſſuredly auow, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had any ordinarie forme of Catechiſme. And the ſixt Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> in the iudgement of our learned Diuines,<note place="margin">Caluin, Beza, Piſcator.</note> doth proue Confirmation to haue beene vſed by the Apoſtles, or by their approbation, yet doth it not proue Confirmation was an Article of their Catechiſme.</p>

               <p>THis likewiſe is calumnious as well as the former, and almoſt all the reſt. Wee deny not but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt among the Apoſtles; for it is of no importance.

All this is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without hauing power or iuriſdiction ouer the reſt of the Apoſtles, which is that kinde of Primacie for the which they plead ſo hard in theſe dayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For had the Apoſtles knowne that Ieſus Chriſt had giuen the ſuperioritie and command ouer the reſt vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> they would neuer after haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among themſelues about Primacie, and that euen the day before the death of IESVS CHRIST, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24.</p>

               <p n="5">5 Beſides that, ſay that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuperioritie of Iuriſdiction ouer the other Apoſtles, doth it therefore enſue that the ſame ought to be perpetuall in the Church? allſo, that if one man haue commaund ouer a few, that therefore one man muſt gouerne all the Church throughout the world?</p>

Doctors, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> dyed at Rome. Admit it were ſo: but Ieſus Chriſt dyed at Hieruſalem, ſhall the death of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at Rome be of greater force to deriue the Primacie to the Biſhop of Rome, then the death of Ieſus Chriſt in Hieruſalem, to deriue the Primacie to the Biſhop of Hieruſalem?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Againe, admit the Pope were Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; doth it follow that hee muſt ſucceede him in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip: for others will ſay that he is not his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor but in qualitie of Biſhop of Rome: and thereof there is farre greater appearance: for, likewiſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Hieruſalem was Succeſſor to Saint <hi>Iames</hi>; and the Biſhop of Epheſus ſucceeded Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that theſe Apoſtles were Biſhops of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and Epheſus; yet were they not their Succeſſors in the function of Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Finally, were the Pope Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor in qualitie of an Apoſtle, and of the head of the Church; had he not long ſince loſt this Succeſſion by reuerſing the doctrine of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and liuing in the eſtate of a temporall Monarch, not of a ſpirituall Paſtor? If then he be Succeſſour to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it is in like manner as ſickneſſe ſucceedeth health, and as an vſurper ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in place of him whom he hath expelled.
