            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Out of these resolutions, finding the libertie of this age to be such, as that <hi>quicquid libet licet,</hi> so men keepe themselues from criminall offences; and my mothers vndeserued wrath so virulent, as that I haue neither pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to resist it, nor patience to endure it, but must yeeld to this languishing consumption to which it hath brougt me: I resolued to breake the barren soile of my fruitlesse braine, to dictate something for thy direction; the rather for that as I am now a dead woman among the liuing, so stand I doubtfull of thy fathers life; which albeit God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from eight seuerall sinister assaults, by which it hath beene sought; yet for that I see that <hi>Quem saepè transit casus, aliquando inuenit,</hi> I leaue thee this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>veni mecum</hi> for thy Counseller, in which thou maiest

                  <p>Thou seest my loue hath carried me beyond the list I resolued on, and my aking head and trembling hand haue rather a will to offer, than abilitie to affoord further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Wherefore with as many good wishes to thee, as good will can measure, I abruptly end, desiring God to blesse thee with sorrow for thy sinnes, thankefulnesse for his benefits, feare of his iudgements, loue of his mercies, mindfulnesse of his presence; that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in his feare, thou maiest die in his fauour, rest in his peace, rise in his power, remaine in his glorie for euer and euer.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THO' the Design of this Publication is of so commendable a Nature in its self, as to need nothing to be said in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it; yet it may not be amiss, to make some Reflections in Prose, when the Ballad has escap'd the Censure of Verse, and take notice of the Clemency of those Gentlemen its Presumptious Author taxes with Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>We have seen, these two or three days last past, Papers publickly cry'd about, that dar'd the Face of Authority, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers abus'd that compose that Venerable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly that sat for the Redress of our Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and has been employ'd in asserting our Right and Liberties; yet has their Patience been such, as to shew us regard to those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses which bore none to Truth, and pass by Calumnies they were sensible the Good Laws they had oblig'd us with, could not deserve.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever the two Authors are, the scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous pieces of Scandal that comes from 'em, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

liament thought 'em beneath their notice, I could not but think my self oblig'd to send some Remarks of mine to keep 'em Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, since all the People of <hi>England</hi> are scandaliz'd in the Persons of those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present us.</p>
                  <p>And tho' I may not probably make such a Figure in Metre, as this Champion of Quality, or the Prose defender of Rebellion; I am certain I have spoken more Truth, and am ready to own my self to be of the same order of Men, which their way of writing points them out to be of. For if they are of that House they write in defence of, I dare affirm them to be the most unmannerly P—rs living; but his Stanza's are of such a Complexion, and his mercinary Paragraphs have such an unsavoury Tincture that I could not but think 'em two of our suburbian Hirelings; And as such, I have endeavour'd to treat 'em.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To gratifie the Desires of whole Bodies of Men, ought to be preferable to the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an idle Womans <hi>Petition,</hi> that had nothing in it against a Gentleman of establish'd Repuation, who had been Honourably Acquitted by due course of Law.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To declare War will be of more Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Kingdoms than Auxiliary Forces, which are enough to conserve our Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Confederates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le.</hi> That <hi>Suitable Supplies</hi> be granted to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty for the putting all these necessary things in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and that care be taken that such Taxes as are raised may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Supplies have been granted, and His Majesty has thank'd 'em for their ready Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Complying with his Desires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le.</hi> That the <hi>Thanks of this House</hi> may be given to those Gentlemen who so gallantly appear'd in the the behalf of their Country, with the <hi>Kentish</hi> Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have been so scandalously used for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> They may thank themselves for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, in endeavouring to be Representatives of the <hi>People</hi> themselves, and coming to Affront those who were theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le.</hi> Thus <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> You have your Duty laid before you, which 'tis hoped you will think of; but if you continue to neglect it, you may expect to be treated according to the Resentment of an <hi>injurd Nation; for Englishmen</hi> are no more to be Slaves to <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than to a King.</p>
                     <p>Our Name is Legion, and we are Many.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Thus, Gentleman, or <hi>Plebeian,</hi> or whatever thou art, thou hast been a mere Devil in endeavouring to sow the Seeds of Discord among thy Fellow Subjects, and may'st well subscribe with the Name of <hi>Legion,</hi> which has been made use of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for a <hi>Deuil</hi> of particular Eminence.</p>
