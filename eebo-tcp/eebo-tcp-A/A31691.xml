            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Character of a Grumbletonian,
OR, THE
New Malecontent.</head>
            <p>A Grumbletonian! What's that
— in the Popes Name? Why,
'tis the Firſt and Second Part
of <hi>Hickeringhil</hi> — a meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of <hi>Curſe-ye-meroz,</hi> and
<hi>The Black Non Conformiſt,</hi> as full of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
as of Nonſence: an abſolute Civil
Quaker, that finds as many faults with the
State as he with the Church, and both
for the ſame No-Reaſon. Tis a Hodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podge
of Malice, Scurrility, and Illnature,
who has ſeldome Wit enough to keep
him from Slavering, or if he does now and
then Stumble on ſome pleaſant Notion;
han't manners enough to keep his Wit
from Stinking. 'Tis a thing that was
never Born to be contented — he's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Twiſting and Wrigling, and has a
Worm in his Tail as long as that in his
Head, — ſee but how tenderly he Treads,
you'd think he was under <hi>Harry Hills'</hi>s
Courſe of Penance, and had all his Pea's
in his Shooes without Boyling 'em. 'Tis
a hard matter that's the Truth on't, to
tell what he is, ſince he hardly knows it
himſelf, nor, does the froward Chit know
what 'twoul'd have, tho' if any thing, it
muſt be ſome Bawble or other that quiets
him. He handles the Government as the
<hi>Turks</hi> do Slaves, when they come to be
Sold — Peeps all round it — Trys and
Gropes, whether it be Sound Wind and
Limb — Looks Marvellous earneſtly on its
Phyſiognomy, pretending to Read its
Fortune, and if he has any skill 'twon't
be long-liv'd, — and yet after all his pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ſharply as the Jeſuite with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective,
all the Wiſe Faults he can find
in't are, that the Noſe and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on't don't pleaſe him. He's hard to be
found, and yet every where, for he's as
diligent and indefatigable, as another that
runs too and fro on the ſame buſineſs, and
for the ſame Reaſon too, becauſe he
knows his time is ſhort. And now we
talk of the Devil — there's a certain place
within a Mile of an Oake, where
you are very likely to find him,
Settleing Church and State over a
Dozen Bottles of Claret! He's very ready
at Quoting Preſidents when they pleaſe
him, and pretends to carry as Humble
an Implicite Faith about with him as e're
a Catholick of 'em all, — and Reaſon too
— for this he finds a good Lazy Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
way of Grumbling, without the long
Fatigue of Enquiry and Argument. By
his Commending Tenderneſs of Conſcience
in others, you'd be almoſt Tempted to
believe he had ſome ſuch thing himſelf, —
and indeed who wou'd think any Man
wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d forſwear himſelf by way of Civil
Converſation or ſo, a Hundred times a
Day, and yet all o' the ſudden Start and
Bogle at one ſingle Oath of Allegiance?
one wou'd think he own'd a God too when
he ſeems afraid to Invoke his Name to a Lie,
or beleiv'd a Hell, when he ſays he dares
not comply for fear of Damnation.</p>
            <p>He's an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man Double gilt, — a meer
Teague Chriſtianiz'd, and Reform'd into
ſomewhat that looks like Humanity, —
but with much uſing the Gilding wears
off agen, and Miſtreſs Puſs muſt have a
touch at the Mouſe, tho' ſhe leaves her
Spark Catter-wawling for the loſs of
her. There's ſo much Diſcontent
and Ingratitude, and Baſeneſs, mixt
with ſuch a Profound Twang of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Cowardiſe in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb facs="tcp:44067:2"/>
of him, that Nature has as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
markt him out for Slavery, as if he
had great Lips and a Flat Noſe — he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reſembles the Inhabitants of the Cape
— bring 'em into any Country, Dreſs 'em
and give 'em Food fit for Humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they'l do nothing but lie upon the
Ground, and Pine themſelves to Death
for their old belov'd Hogſty, and long as
paſſionately as a Teeming Woman, for a
Sovoury Mouthful of their old Guts and
Garbage. He's of a very Ancient Family
that's the Truth on't, and can run ye up his
Pedigree as high as <hi>Peter Heylin</hi> cou'd his
own, or a High-lander his Princes, for
he'le tell ye, (if Modeſty don't a little
Confound him) that ſome of his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had a ſtrong Party among the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
in the Wilderneſs — and great Men
in the Congregation, he can aſſure ye ſome
of 'em were — no leſs Names then <hi>Korah,
Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> They call'd 'em
Murmurers then, but that's but an old
word for Grumbletonians. Tho' he's
heavy enough in ſome things where haſt is
requir'd, yet he's Nimble enough in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
— Woe wou'd be to a Serjeant at
Arms if he was oblig'd to follow him a
whole Day to take him into Cuſtody, for
he has a Thouſand Diſguiſes, and is almoſt
at once in as many places. — Here he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Shape of a Gentleman, and
Squats him down in a Coffee-Houſe like
the Toad at <hi>Eves</hi> Ear: Shakes Empty Poll
very Emphatically — takes up the Votes,
finds fault with one Damn'd Clauſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in 'em, Bites off the corner of 'em,
and throws 'em down in Dudgeon agen —
Snatches up the Gazet — Men of Merit are
not Prefer'd — (ay, there tis) here's a
Company of I known't who got in, and
he has nothing — not that he'd Act — no
— not for a World — he can't accept —
his Conſcience — O — it Grumbleth moſt
Obſtreperouſly, and there is no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſame. — Look ſharp Mr. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
— he's pulling up his Hatch, and if
ye don't have a care the Gentleman will
be a Baker, and his Calaſh a Cart before
ye can call the Conſtable, — for now all
o'th' ſudden he's an honeſt Country Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and mightily aggrieved that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
of the Nation are ſetled without his
Spade and Flail to lend Aſſiſtance — thinks
he has Sweat and Voted, and Stunk in a
Crowd to ſome purpoſe — Scratches his
Head, and with ſome dry Bob of good
King <hi>James</hi> — <hi>Exit Hobbinol</hi> — but wou'd
ye think it — who is now at the turning
of the next Corner? If theſe Cheating
Eyes don't deceive me he has got a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Gown on to hide his Cloven-Foot —
nay, — he'le pretend to be <hi>Hamet</hi> — <hi>Bon</hi>
— <hi>Hamet,</hi> — a Parſons Son too, — he has his
Ticket in's Hand, and you'le ſee him at the
Feaſt to Morrow, when the Sons of God met
together, we know who came among them —
Unfrock the Raſcal for ſhame, &amp; let him not
abuſe that Venerable Order — d'ye ſee, he's
in the Pulpit already — his Prayer is not
long — ſomewhat the ſhorter becauſe ye
hear no King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> —
his Sermon — the Ingratiude of this our
Age — prepare for Perſecution — Two or
Three ſilent Smiters more — and he's
Vaniſhed into the Tavern — where that
Diſguiſe is ſoon thrown off, and he gets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
— and yet what Reaſon ſhou'd
there be to ſay a Man's Diſguis'd when you
may Peep into the Soul of him, — for now
he appears in his proper Shape. — Now
keep out of the way — for he Vomits all
his Soul out — O this Parliament — here's
Arbitrary with a Vengeance, — <hi>Hoc eſt
Parliamentum — Habeas Corpus</hi> where art
thou? — this will never do — we will not
ſuffer our King to be thus — theſe Oaths
— theſe — certainly they'l never go down
without Buttering — Ay, Ay, — the Lawn
Sleeves down next — ye may ſee what
they'd be at — theſe Pack of — and then
he Tumbles under Board — and next
Morning as ſoon as his Head's Cool diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
Packets to this Mayor, and t'other
Alderman in the Country, to Wheedle or
Fright 'em into as great Knaves or Fools
as he is himſelf. — There's one Infallible
Mark more, by which you may be ſure of knowing
him through all his Diſguiſes — as
ſoon as he takes up this Paper — (a better
Looking-Glaſs then his own) he Starts
back at the ſight of his own ugly Face —
falls a foming like a Sweet Singer, and
Swears heartily the Authors a Fanatick,
tho' as Friend <hi>Ratcliff</hi> ſays, <hi>He might as well
have Gueſt him a Mahometan.</hi>
