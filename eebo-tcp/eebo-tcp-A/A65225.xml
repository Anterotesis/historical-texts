            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lord hath cauſed the ſolemn feaſts to be forgotten in Sion, and hath deſpiſed in the indignation of his anger the King and the Priest.</p>

In the ſeventh chapter of <hi>Nehemia,</hi> there is a long catalogue of the people, the Prieſts and the Levites, that had leave from the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and build the waſte places, eſpecially the Temple; their whole number is computed to be forty two thouſand three hundred and threeſcore, <hi>verſ.</hi> 66. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the grandees or chief are expreſſed by name, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and of thoſe I find moſt honorable mention of two above all the reſt, (as upon whoſe ſhoulders reſted the main of the work) <hi>Nehemia</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel;</hi> and therefore we ſhall inſiſt ſomewhat upon both, as we meet with them recorded in ſacred ſtory.</p>

remnant of the poor captive Jews, whoſe ſpirits were dejected with their tedious ſervitude and extream oppreſſion; and this might make <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> diffident of the event, and reaſon thus againſt it: The work is great that we are to undertake, and our ſtrength but little, and therefore in all probability our endeavors are like to be fruſtrated, and we to periſh in the undertaking.

Though you had no ſtrength at all, though you had no life at all left in you, though you were but an heap of dead and dry bones, God can bring you together, put new life in you, and cauſe you on a ſuddain to ſtart up a numerous Army, as in <hi>Ezeki<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What better could be expected, when the Prophets two ſtaves were once broken; the ſtaffe of Beauty, and the ſtaffe of Bands, <hi>Veritas Evangelica, &amp; unitas Chriſtiana,</hi> the true Doctrine and Uniform Diſcipline of the Church. When theſe, I ſay, were broken to pieces, behold an inundation of Sects and Hereſies like a ſecond Deluge over-flowed the whole Land, they came croaking about us like the Frogs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſwarming like the Locuſts out of the bottomleſſe pit. <hi>Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Icon Animorum,</hi> writing of the ſeveral Sects in Religion which he had obſerved in <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> his reign, tells a ſtory of a father and his two ſons who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted or made up a Church between themſelves, but theſe three not long agreeing, the two ſons Excommunicated the Father, and at laſt one ſon the other, ſo that theſe three made three diſtinct Churches in their conceipts, and each one the true.

ſtrangely prevented. The onely way they thought to enrich themſelves, was, to impoveriſh the Church, and ceaze upon the poor remains thereof. And whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> (long before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore could not be ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial) paid Tythes of all the ſpoiles, theſe men would make a ſpoile of all the Tythes; then the Prieſts received Tythes from the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, now the Soldiers would have taken Tythes from the Prieſts, though to the ruine of themſelves, and their poſterities, and the whole Nation, that would have been involved both in the guilt and puniſhment, as was the whole Nation of the Jews for the ſame ſin, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>For my part, I muſt confeſſe my fears, that the curſe which hath been upon out Nation of late years for this ſin of ſacriledge, amongſt other great and crying ſins, will not be taken off clearly (for we ſee Gods hand is ſtretched out ſtill againſt us in the late plague of immoderate rain and waters, which may breed a dearth, if not peſtilential diſeaſes) till ſatisfaction be made by reſtoring what hath been wreſted and raviſhed from the Church. It was the opinion of that great advancer of learning, <hi>Sir Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> in his conſiderations touching pacification and edification of the Church, preſented to King <hi>James,</hi> and well-worthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ofthis preſent Parliament, That all Parliaments ſince the 27 and 31 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who gave away Impropriations from the Church, ſtand in ſome ſort obnoxious, and obliged to God in conſcience, to do ſomewhat for the Church, to reduce the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony thereof to a competency; for ſince they have debarred Chriſts ſpouſe of a great part of her dowry, it were reaſon they made her a competent Joynture.</p>
            <p>And bleſſed be God that put it into the Kings heart to take care, that all Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters, ſhould out of their Impropriations augment the ſmall Vicaridges belonging to them in ſuch a reaſonable proportion, as the Tythes will well bear.

Was it not now high time for us to ſay with the <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 126.</note>Pſalmiſt? and indeed <hi>Nihil hic niſi vota ſuperſunt, 'Tis time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law;</hi> yea, all the Laws both of God and man. When all endeavours of men failed, and no hope of human help appeared, then was it Gods time to work; and work he did beyond all expectation, even to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As he ſtirred up the ſpirits of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemias</hi> to repair the breaches in the Jewiſh Church and State, ſo hath he done for us; we have a <hi>Nehemias</hi> and a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> as well as they, <hi>ex te erunt,</hi> and we have them of our ſelves. As it was our unhappineſſe, that like the ſpider we ſpun the web of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries out of our own bowels, and with our own hands pulled our own houſes upon our own heads; ſo it was our happineſſe again, that God hath raiſed up from among our ſelves <hi>Heroes,</hi> and men of renown, to ſtand in the gap, to turn our captivity as the Rivers in the South, to build up our waſte places and repair our breaches: For had we ſent abroad for builders, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to <hi>Hiram,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. they might have built a <hi>Babel</hi> inſtead of a Temple, and overthrown more with one hand than they ſet up with two. What tongue can tell, and what heart would not ake to think, what deſolations had been wrought in the earth, if the way to the Throne had been hewed out by the ſword of aliens and ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>England:</hi> Nay, had Sir <hi>George Booth's</hi> deſign gon on, in probability it might have coſt hot water, <hi>multo ſanguine &amp; vulneribus,</hi> &amp;c. and we had ſeen another <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But bleſſed be God, that as in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple there was no ax, nor hammer, nor iron tool heard in the houſe, while it was in building, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6, 7. ſo in raiſing the foundations of this great work, and bringing it to perfection, no ſword nor battle-ax, no inſtrument of vvar lifted up, no canon, nor muſquet, nor piſtol diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Time vvould fail me to tell of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and of <hi>Barak,</hi> of <hi>Samſon,</hi> and of <hi>Jeptha,</hi> of all our vvorthy Patriots in Parliament, in City, in Country, that by Votes, Declarations, or other vvays, joyn'd heads, and hands, and hearts, to the contriving, compaſſing, compleating of this glorious vvork. Give me leave to ſingle out one from the reſt, <hi>unus inſtar omnium,</hi> I hope vvithout envy I may name him, vvhoſe name vvill be like an oyntment poured forth, precious to poſterity, the Lord General <hi>Monck,</hi> vvho hath upon our ſtage acted both parts of <hi>Nehemia</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> to the life.</p>
            <p>As another <hi>Nehemias</hi> he carried on his work prudently and cloſely, he came up to our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or Metropolis, and was there ſome time before he told any man what God had put in his heart to do. <hi>Artis eſſe, celare artem,</hi> a man ſhews his art in concealing his art. An unſeaſonable diſcovery fruſtrates a good deſign, whiles a diſcreet ſilence fits it for maturity. Had he taken off his hood or veil at the firſt approach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God knows what reſiſtance he had found, but as long as he carried it in a clowd, and hung like a Meteor between heaven and earth, or as the Papiſts picture <hi>Eraſmus</hi> between heaven and hell, each party took him for their own, and ſo neither oppoſed him. True it is, he put many in a maze, and the whole City in great fears, when in a ſeeming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with, and obedience to the command of thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the ſupream authority, like <hi>Samſon</hi> he went away with the gates of the City, bars and all; but he ſo on made them amends by ſetting them <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> or in a much better condition than he found them.</p>

The ſame hand that brake their head, gave them a plaiſter. Then again, like <hi>Nehemias,</hi> he calls the Nobles and Rulers together, brings in the Secluded Members to conſult how our breaches might be made up; and to ſecure their ſitting, ſets a guard, and raiſeth a ſtrong Militia.

            <p>And may he not paſſe for a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> too? I am ſure like <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> he did his work <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by Gods Spirit.</hi>

            <p>Again, As <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> lived long in the King of <hi>Babylon's</hi> Court, yet retained his own true Religion, worſhipping the God of his fathers in his true way and manner as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him: So hath his Majeſty lived long in the Courts and Territories of forreign Princes, of different Religion from him, yet, with <hi>Job,</hi> he held faſt his integrity, ſtood like a <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> or Rock immovable againſt all ſurges of temptations that were raiſed to ſhake his faith, to alter his Religion, witneſſe the ſharp aſſaults (as we have heard) of Monſieur <hi>Militiere</hi> and others he met with beyond-Sea. Like <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> he bound himſelf to the maſt of a well-grounded reſolution, that no Romiſh Syrens could draw him out of the ſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which he

was baptized and educated, though that ſhip were like the other wherein Chriſt and his Diſciples ſailed, in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ready to ſink; and when he had no power viſible to defend himſelf, he would be ſtill <hi>the Defender of the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> therein following the great example of the beſt of Kings, his Royal Father, who to his death maintained the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and died a Martyr for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When <hi>Sanballat</hi> and others beyond the River of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their ſervice to joyn with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in carrying on the work, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 2. ſaying, <hi>Let us build with you;</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>You have nothing to do with us, but we our ſelves will build unto the Lord our God,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>And that he might be <hi>Charles the Great</hi> indeed, the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer of our breaches, he hath publickly declared his great Mercy in granting a general Pardon, and paſſing an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, yea, and preſſing this preſent Parliament to a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.

He hath ſhew d his <hi>Pitty</hi> in indulging a liberty to tender conſciences in matters of Religion, which diſturb not the peace of the Kingdom. He hath expreſt his great <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in being himſelf ſworn to govern, not by his arbitrary will, as our late Maſters did, but by the known Laws of the Land, leaving all his Subjects to be tryed by them.

How ſhall we praiſe him as he deſerves?
