            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN Obedience to your Lordſhips Command, I continue my Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, and I think it eſpecially my Duty ſo to do, as often as Accidents of any conſiderable moment happen among us. I have formerly told your Lordſhip of the mighty Giant living in theſe parts, ſo great of Stature, as it is thought no former Age can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel: He is about 15 Foot high, with Limbs in every part great, yet beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and proportionable. He is not above 30 years Old, his Name
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99344:2"/>
               <hi>KoorbmeP,</hi> Count of Mount <hi>YremoG,</hi> one of the higheſt Mountains in the Empire, and Lord of <hi>Notliw</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Mercia,</hi> the uſual place of his Reſidence. He was born of right Noble Parents, only one ſmall blot lay upon the Family; for that his Grandfather was a Senator, and ſate in the Aſſembly of the <hi>Angli</hi> (a great Nation of this Countrey) when they had murdered one of their beſt Princes, and exiled another. This young Giant in his Youth, ſeemed to be one of the moſt hopeful and towardly Perſonages in all the Land, and continued ſo many years, till happening into the company of <hi>Ebrietas,</hi> a moſt notorious Strumpet and Sorcereſs, ſhe ſo bewitch'd him, that he fell in Love with her; and having Carnal Knowledge of her Body, begot a Monſter, or rather Devil, call'd <hi>Inſania;</hi> which to the Admiration of all People, ſpoke as ſoon as 'twas born; and excited her Father to the perpetration of moſt unheard of Villanies. He, who before ſeem'd to be compoſed onely of Courteſie and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Kindneſs and Affability; was all on the ſudden chang'd into a Brutiſh Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and a Canibal. He preſently eat up one of his Friends, as a Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his future Cruelties; not out of need, but general Spleen to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; together with wanton Beſtiality. He bought up hundreds of huge devouring Creatures, not much unlike your Engliſh Maſtiffs; and with the Carcaſſes of his ſlain Gueſts he fed them: after he had firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd them to accept the loathſome Embraces of his ſhe <hi>Ebrietas</hi> Devil. He bought a Lion for the ſelf ſame purpoſe; and on a time, being ſet on by <hi>Ebrietas</hi> his Whore, againſt his Vertuous Lady; he lock'd the Lion into her Chamber, one whole day together; and coming home at Night he kill'd the Lion, becauſe the Lion had not devoured his Wife. Theſe things being told at Court, our Prince ſent General <hi>Lex</hi> to ſeize this Giant, as a Murderer, who took him by ſurprize, and made him Priſoner in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Tower. There was a Beautious Lady at our Court, of high Extraction, nearly ally'd to the Prince himſelf; her Name <hi>Leuitas;</hi> and (as it is Natural for Handſome Women to love great Men) ſhe entertain'd ſo much kindneſs for <hi>KoorbmeP,</hi> that ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Pardon and his Liberty, on his Paroll, ever after to live orderly, and obedient to the Laws; and to ſhun the company of <hi>Ebrietas,</hi> to whom he ow'd all his Faults and his Misfortune. But Liberty and Eaſe quickly perſwaded this mighty Man, to recant the Promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had made under reſtraint.</p>
            <p>The very firſt time he met with his Baggage <hi>Ebrietas</hi> (the Baſtard <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſania</hi> coming alſo into company; for they were ſeldome aſunder) ſhe prevail'd with him to devour <hi>Yenoc,</hi> a Perſon of Quality of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in the very Suburbs of this City; which ſo incenſed the Prince, that he was again ſeized, before he could reach his Caſtle of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liW;</hi> and now all People did expect nothing leſs than his Deſtruction, as a juſt reward of his Crimes. But it ſeems he was familiar with <hi>Pecunia,</hi> another eminent Witch (for you muſt know there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance in this Countrey) and ſhe ſo intoxicated the Underſtanding of the Evidence, and caſts Miſts before their Memories (as well as their Eyes) that they had nothing material to ſay againſt him: And ſo upon a ſolemn Tryal before his Juſt Peers, he was forc'd to be Publickly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and Diſcharged, with only a ſevere Reprehenſion. After this he liv'd indifferent quietly ſome few years together, and might have done ſo his life-time, if he could have excluded his Old Whore from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99344:2"/>
his Company. But ſhe and her Baſtard ſtill inſinuating themſelves into his Favour, rais'd an Army themſelves; and prevail'd with him to joyn with them, in a publick War againſt General <hi>Lex</hi> (the ſole Adminiſtrator of Affairs under our Prince) and on the 18th day of this preſent month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they entered in Hoſtile manner, into the Country of <hi>MahnruT Green,</hi> deſtroying all before them; Prince <hi>Noctis</hi> (under whoſe Government that part of the Country was) with all the ſtrength he could gather together, oppoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this mighty Giant, Force againſt Force; but notwithſtanding a brave Reſiſtance, <hi>KoorbmeP</hi> the Giant came unawares, and eat up Prince <hi>Noctis,</hi> and another famous Commander, his Friend and Confederate, whoſe Name I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; which had like utterly to have diſcumfitted our Party; till at laſt more Aſſiſtance coming in, by down-right Valour they forced the Giant to fly with his Followers. Great ſearch has been made after him, but without any effect hitherto. Madam <hi>Lenitas</hi> is baniſht the Court, it being partly her fault that all this Miſchief has happened. And now General <hi>Lex</hi> is ſent out with a great Army, to take the Giant dead or alive; and to fight the Army of <hi>Ebrietas,</hi> which we hear is grown very powerful; and moſt People believe will create a longer and more dangerous War, than that which once happened between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Neatherlands;</hi> or that now depending between our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and his <hi>Hungarian</hi> Rebels. Sir, By the next I expect to tell you, the Giant is made Priſoner; but when the Rebellion of the Witch <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietas,</hi> and her Confederates will be at an end, is out of my Proſpect, and beyond the Skill of the moſt cunning Aſtrologers in all our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
