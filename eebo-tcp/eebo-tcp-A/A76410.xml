         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Your early ioys to this Triumphant fate,</l>
            <l>Of the great Reſcuer our <hi>Albian Advocate</hi>
            </l>
            <l>At heavens iuſt bar, whence he receiv'd command,</l>
            <l>T' advance to th' ſtiffned Pharo'hs of the land.</l>
            <l>The peoples ſuffrages in's hands he brought,</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Moſes</hi> they cry'd by whom we'r taught</l>
            <l>The way from Egypts task's, thus heav'nly arm'd,</l>
            <l>H' approacht their Courts, 'tis <hi>Monck,</hi> who ſoon alarm'd</l>
            <l>Their fatted ſouls, th' Locuſts and Flyes ſaith he.</l>
            <l>The giddy factions that ſpread th' Iſle may be</l>
            <l>Good teſts of heavens diſlike, your troops of oaths,</l>
            <l>Are muſter'd all againſt you, yet here's thoſe,</l>
            <l>Would feign raiſe more, ſuch Saints in armour they</l>
            <l>Would beat God with's own weapons, and would pray</l>
            <l>Him from his throne. Having now corrected</l>
            <l>Theſe hard Task-maſters, he ſoon directed</l>
            <l>To th' weary'd People, his Meſſage was eaſe,</l>
            <l>In th' room of civil war to bring them peace,</l>
            <l>Th'unlimited bounds of ioy at this great change,</l>
            <l>Had ſoon arriv'd th' Senate, th' events were ſtrange,</l>
            <l>And dreadful there, hard hearts would not relent,</l>
            <l>But ſtreight two forc'rers with their Tackle were ſent,</l>
            <l>To countermiſs this truth, t' poſſeſs the world,</l>
            <l>Theſe were but knacks in State, we muſt be whirld,</l>
            <l>With various ſtreams, but ſtreight were their charms,</l>
            <l>By all reiected, ne'r the Churches arms</l>
            <l>More cheerfully embrac'd her fathers, then th' people him,</l>
            <l>Who brought their news of freedome which had been</l>
            <l>So long an exile, nor did this prophet faile,</l>
            <l>In his Embaſage, for ſoon the black veil</l>
            <l>Of horrid Tyrarany's withdrawn, th' chains gone,</l>
            <l>The priſon doors ſtand open; th' Ieſuits run</l>
            <l>To <hi>Rome</hi> again, and ſhiftleſs here have left</l>
            <l>Their new rais'd force, Infant Schiſms bereft</l>
            <l>Of Parents, whoſe errors be confuted,</l>
            <l>Enough with ſilence, ne'r points were thus diſputed,</l>
            <l>Yet reaſon tis, no argument needs the Sun,</l>
            <l>T' diſperſe contracted vapours, appear, tis done,</l>

            <l>But all in vain, Divine and ſavory reaſon</l>
            <l>That taught obedience, was ſoon made treaſon,</l>
            <l>By th' law of armes; The Counſells and Synodds all</l>
            <l>Of former Churches gave rules to call,</l>
            <l>Such heritiques to anſwer but we broke,</l>
            <l>Our Fathers rules, we gave the fatal ſtroke,</l>
            <l>To pious order, our zeal was ſacriledg,</l>
            <l>In State, our tenures all turned villanage,</l>
            <l>Theſe Tories of the Church he quickly tames,</l>
            <l>Swarm'd legions of furies he ſoon reclaim's</l>
            <l>His holy ſoul abhorr'd to hearken to,</l>
            <l>Phanatique dreams, he chaſt the dreamers too,</l>
            <l>Nor is this heart without attendants fit.</l>
            <l>His valiant hand, and prudent head may ſit,</l>
            <l>In th' chair of preſidents, records muſt be</l>
            <l>Great <hi>George</hi> bigbelly'd with thy hiſtory,</l>

            <l>Our twenty years red ſea, is now dry Land.</l>
            <l>The Royal and the Noble blood was ſpilt,</l>
