         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Covenant is the

an ingagement upon
the ſoule; and as in

ſea, the Mariners find

Coards and Anchors,

Period; ſo in civill

which the godly have
found out to winde up
their ſoules from irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

and now God

ſomething to hold our

and though God need
none of thoſe, but is
able to keepe us up by

is a God that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p>He that covenants

Thus far of the power of
the Covenant upon the ſoul
in that grand and heavenly
ingagement; now there is
a power reflexive, and that
is a returne it makes from
Heaven, and in that return
it brings with it ſomething
of God; for the ſoule going
up thither by a ſpirituall
might and holy violence,
brings away from thence
graces and bleſſings, and the
reſort of many temporall
mercies, as when <hi>Moſes</hi>
had been looking God in the
face, he brought a divine
luſtre upon his owne, home
with him.</p>
            <p>We ſee <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
had excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitances,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:120034:10"/>
the dedication
was kept with gladneſſe, and
ſinging and Pſalteries, and
the people offered themſelvs
willingly, and the buſineſſe
at Ieruſalem, and all the
affaires of Gods houſe went
better on in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 11. 3. 12. 27.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of <hi>Iudah</hi>
drew along with it the like
bleſſings; the Lord was

hath been in heaven alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
it came not only from

backe, and by the power of
that reflexive act, it hath
brought downe with it
cheerefull concurrencies &amp;
contributions in both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and there are divine
ſtirrings, and movings, and
aſpirations in the people of
late: and as in the Poole of

            <p>THeſe are ſuch

is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

a perpetuating quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and it is ſuch a

in at the felicitating of
a perſon or people:
<hi>Seeke firſt the kingdome

            </p>
            <p>The advancement of
Gods kingdom, was
alwayes the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the kingdome
of Iſrael; and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the one declined
and ſet in the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other: for
the Arke and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
departed together,
and both expired at
once in a dolefull
<hi>Ichabod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The advancement of
Chriſts Kingdome
hath been the deſigne
of God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120034:13"/>
and it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of the godly too:
<hi>God revealeth his ſecrets
to his ſervants, and we
have the mind of Chriſt.</hi>
Now knowing ſo
much of the counſels,
and deſignes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and minde of
God, we are carried
on by the ſame Spirit
to be aiding to that
deſigne: now though
the kingdom of Chriſt
be ſuch a name as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
glory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
yet it is not a

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120034:14"/>

and this kingdome of

working through

<hi>who can ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne:</hi>
the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this kingdom
is onely attainable by
a Reformation to the

word of God; &amp; here
we ſhall take occaſion
to part with all the
Models and Idea's w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
are not to be found in
holy Scriptures; it is
markt there as a grand
tranſgreſſion to walke
after <hi>the imagination of
our owne hearts:</hi> and
that was laid to <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam's
charge,</hi> That
his Prieſts, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
and worſhip,
were ſuch as <hi>he deviſed
in his own heart:</hi> God
will indure no ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallity
nor conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120034:15"/>
with himſelfe:
it is an incompleating
the worke of God to
build his houſe with
our own timber: and
as he made this world
at firſt onely after the
patterne of his owne
counſels, ſo in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
work of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a ſpiritualll
ſtructure for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
God thinks none
worthy of coordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in thoſe things
wherein his glory ſhal
be ſure to ſuffer in a
diſtribution with his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120034:16"/>
creatures, and his <hi>owne
Image</hi> hath ever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him beſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made the beſt
piece of his creation
according to it.</p>
            <p>And where this
<hi>kingdome of Chriſt is,</hi>
there is holineſſe of
Doctrine, holineſſe of
Government, holineſs
of Ordinances, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Life; GOD
hath had a people at
firſt whom hee made
his owne, by ſpeciall
adoption, by eminent
priviledges, by rare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120034:16"/>
providences, by lawes
and inſtitutions, by
worſhip and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
            <p>And now becauſe
<hi>darkneſſe in part is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Iſrael,</hi> God will
ſtill have a people that
ſhall be his, and have
their lawes and uſages
and forms from him;
their guidance &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
from him.</p>
            <p>This kingdome of
Chriſt is a company
of godly gathered by
his own Spirit, having
their Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120034:17"/>
in the midſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated
by an holy
and ſacramentall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ruled by the law
of his will and Spirit;
obeying his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands,
whither in ſilent inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
or lowder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
either by
<hi>a word behinde us,</hi> and
a ſaying, <hi>Seeke yee my

intimations and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of his will,
from ſuch wayes of
diſtribution &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
as hee hath
ordained; ſtudying
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120034:17"/>
what will adorne the
Goſpell of Jeſus
Chriſt, and thoſe that
walke in the light and
glory of it, <hi>Being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as by the Spirit of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>viz.</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Chriſts
kingdome, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
for ſinnes, are
ſuch as will bring <hi>God</hi>
into this kingdome,
and ſeat him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
his preſence,
as the Tabernacle and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120034:18"/>
Arke &amp; Temple were
the engagements and
enthronizations of, &amp;
myſterious fixations
of Gods divinity.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe an
advancement of the
nation too, ſetting it
higher then other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
of the Jewes,
<hi>That to them the Oracles
of God were committed.</hi>
Therefore they were
ſaid to dwell in the
light, when other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>ſat in the Region
and ſhadow of death.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:120034:18"/>
And that principle
of reformation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of
God and the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches,
brings us cloſer to
God, and conſociates
us with heaven, and
makes us arrive at the
higheſt myſtery, even
the <hi>deniall of our ſelves,</hi>
our owne inventions,
will-worſhip, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions;
pulling
down at once all our
relations to <hi>Rome</hi> and
Popery, and working
to the patern, ſo <hi>That
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120034:19"/>
things which ſhal be ſeen
ſhall not bee made of
things which do appear:</hi>
we ſhal likewiſe be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
to the Church
of Chriſt, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and purely and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically,
into the body
of Chriſt, we ſhall be
now in a capacity w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
them to partake equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of graces and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
and thus the
kingdom of Chriſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
power and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſtretches to
the breadth of that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120034:19"/>
Propheſie, <hi>Of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Gentiles,</hi> and
gathers ſtrength too
againſt the preſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
Monarchy;
&amp; by that other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

we obtain the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

wee approach into
tearms of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with God; if the

and the unrighteous man
his thoughts, God will
forgive and abundantly
pardon.</hi> What is it that

thickens the clowde

            <p>And our confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

but be powerfull in
the very notion; Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Leagues have
brought forth great
effects in States and
Kingdoms, in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
aydings and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtings;
and therefore
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent to <hi>Syria,</hi> and
<hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and
<hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

which was ſuch

that which made

            <p>I know there hath

narrower then this,

ſtrong ones too, and
by confederacies too;
yet thoſe were but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

Idolatry, ayded by a

yet theſe were
not from ſuch ſtrong
reſolutions, ſuch able

Covenant; they
were but ordinary and
civil contributions, &amp;
weak ſtrivings, and ſo
had ſhorter expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and relapſes, and
had little more of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
then brought
them into the fields,
and enabled them to
break down Images:
The Confederations
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:120034:25"/>

ſo many Princes

The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thoſe Princes

had recovered the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120034:25"/>
of declination,
three kingdoms ſtrike
into a ſacred League;
And now methinks I

to us, <hi>The Prince of the

me one and twenty
dayes, but loe Michael
one of your chief Princes
came in to help me, and

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:120034:26"/>
And for the Extirpation
of Prelacie, though it be a
government rivetted into
our Laws and uſages; and
into the judgments, and
Conſciences of ſome,
through a miſtaſten and
colluding Divinity, yet let
us not like the Iews, loſe
our Goſpel, with holding
our Laws too faſt; I know
this kingdom hath ever
been a retentive nation of
Cuſtomes, and old Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and it parted but
ſadly with its old <hi>Prga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi>
and with its latter
<hi>Antichriſtianiſme;</hi> in the

that Reformations in this
Nation, hath been with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120034:26"/>
ſuch little power and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for we have ever
eaſily gone back with a
new ſucceſſour, never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in ſo much of the
power of godlineſſe, as
ſhould be able to make us
live Proteſtants to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſucceſſion; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Idolatries of
late, were woven with
ſuch ſtrange and plauſible
Inſinuations; Epiſcopacy
was got upon the bottome
of miſ-interpreted Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
and the whole
Government upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Antiquity; and
the Innovations upon a
ſpirituall Decency and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120034:27"/>
Order; upon an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
Magiſtrality, and
Reverend Infallibility,
and prodigeous Policy; as
if theire were no way to
bring a Papiſt to Church,
but by going with him to
<hi>Rome</hi> firſt; if we conſidr
well we ſhall finde cauſe
enough to remove theſe as
not conſiſtent with the
holy ſimplicity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
of Jeſus Chriſt; nor
the ſpiritmall purity; we
were then trading with
Popery, when we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
thought, we had
not enough to ſerve us
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scriptures of God,
now we ſee they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete in Ieſus Xt;
let us caſt away thoſe weak
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120034:27"/>
&amp; beggarly rudime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
of the which <hi>we are now
aſhamed;</hi> &amp; they do not
ſavour the things of
God, who would now
(like <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Endor)</hi>
raiſe up <hi>Aron,</hi> and the
whole Hierarchy, and
bring us back again to
the Law, forcing us
under that cool ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
of <hi>Types</hi> &amp; <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
drawing the
curtains of the Law
before the light of the
Goſpel; we ſerve now
in the newneſſe of the

of the letter.</p>
            <p>

THe next thing I
obſerve, is the
Politicall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
thoſe ſound
maxims for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
duration, as the
preſervation of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary
rights, and
Nationall rights, and
Royall rights, that
they exceed not, nor
exorbitate; and this
is no more then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the kingdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation,
and to
keep the mixture even:
for we ſee that whileſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120034:28"/>
the power of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
would needs take
in ſuch poyſon'd prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as the Divines
and Privadoes did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill,
carrying up the
notion of a King into
an higher firmament
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> its own, the whole
State was in a poſture
of ruine: for nothing
hath more betrayed
kingdoms into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
alterations then
exorbitancy of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and States
muſt reſpect their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120034:29"/>
in their preſent
conſtitution; for thoſe
infuſe ſecret diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into al the Orders
&amp; ſubordinations, and
that ingagement ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to incline to their
own intereſts; &amp; then
in their inclinations &amp;
purſuit thither, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and ſtirres are
wakened, and there is
a noiſe of ſome new
&amp; treaſonable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
when it is but
the naturall workings
of each degree for its
owne preſervation; &amp;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120034:29"/>
hence have theſe late
aſperſions been borne
&amp; received, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and people being
carried on by the
ſtrength and violence
of a late predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
almoſt out of ſight
of their true funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
till they have
forgot their intereſts,
&amp; maligne thoſe that
would bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back:
and for the temper of
our Engliſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
I will not ſay
more to the praiſe of
the conſtitution, (ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120034:30"/>
many having ſpoken
before mee) than its
own duration, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this day, under
the ſucceſſion of ſo
many ages, and never
diſtemper'd, but when
the <hi>fiduciary</hi> power
would needs be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and taller then the
reſt, and entertaine
deſignes of trying
ſtrengths &amp; intereſts,
to ſee <hi>If the fire out of
the bramble would at
length come forth, and
conſume the trees of the
Forreſt.</hi> And whereas
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120034:30"/>
there are ſome other
ſubordinate principles
in order to theſe; as the
diſcovery of Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
and Malignants;
certainely they that
ſhall ſuffer any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to corrupt them to
ſecrecy, are men of
too narrow affections
for the latitude of a
kingdome; they are
only in the reputation
of Patriots and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's
to their countrey,
who have ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of ſpirit, as they
can open and cloſe as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120034:31"/>
the occaſion of the
State requires.</p>
            <p>And I do further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to a mutuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the peace
of the kingdomes, and
in ſpeciall of the
Reformation of the
Church in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, it is
bottom'd upon the
foundation of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is a
concentration of the
three eſtates in one;
and there is ſuch a
ſameneſſe almoſt in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120034:31"/>
the fundamentals of
the three, and there is
ſuch a Monarchicall
oneneſſe which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
into all, that if
any alteration begin
in any one of them,
it will ſoon like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(where there is
conſanguinity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſpread and make
over to the reſt; ſo
that there is as much
policy in ſuffering our
care and faithfulneſſe
to enlarge &amp; acquaint
it ſelfe with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:120034:32"/>
which are in no
other ſenſe foreigne,
than onely in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of place.</p>
            <p>And for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
preſervation of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it
is as concerning an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
as any of the
reſt; what godly ſoul
will repine to take up
the care of another
Church; he was (we
know) a ſanguinary
man that replyed, <hi>Am
I my brothers keeper?</hi>
And we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
there how God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120034:32"/>
cals for an account of
every relation at our
hands. It was an holy
principle that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Apoſtle <hi>To
take care of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi>
&amp; the more neer
wee approach to ſuch
endeavours, the more
neer we are to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
and activity of
God &amp; Angels, whoſe
buſineſſe and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
is univerſall;
and eſpecially ſhould
our care bee for that
Church and State,
which hath been the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120034:33"/>
conſervatory of the
Goſpell, and kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
that holy ſparke,
which wee in this
kingdom do warm our
ſouls by at this day;
ſhe was that <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
who kept the Word
of his patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of reſtraints in
this our Covenant, as
if we multiplyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
oaths, as if
like <hi>Sauls</hi> oath it had
<hi>troubled the land,</hi> there
is no ſuch true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as in theſe <hi>holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints;</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:120034:33"/>
nor is it any
diminutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Latitude, that
we cannot tranſgreſſe
nor exceed in this or
that; it is rather the
ſublimation of our
Liberty, and a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
into the <hi>glorious
liberty of the ſons of
God;</hi> and as it is the
higheſt perfection, <hi>non
poſſe peccare,</hi> not to be
able to tranſgreſſe; ſo
our eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is a degree to
that, for <hi>God, Angels,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:120034:34"/>
and <hi>Saints,</hi> are not leſſe
perfect, nor leſſe free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot ſin, but
is a firmation of ſoule in
the height of holineſſe, for
as it is the higheſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of ſin, not to be able
to do good, ſo it is the
higheſt perfection of
goodneſſe not to be able
to do ill; ſo that I know
none that hath a ſpirituall
and diſcerning ſoule, that
will complaine for want of
liberty to tranſgreſſe; or
that he is in heaven before
his time; ſuch chaines are
but <hi>chaines of gold,</hi> nay, but
the <hi>bracelets of the ſpouſe,</hi>
and as ir is the devills and
reprobates torment and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:120034:34"/>
miſery to be held in
<hi>chaines of darkeneſſe,</hi> ſo it
is the glory of the bleſſed
Saints and Angels to be
held in ſuch chaines of
light and holineſſe; and
none but <hi>Libertines</hi> will
complaine, that they are
walled in, and that their
luſts have not liberty to
anger God, and undoe
their Country.</p>
            <p>I obſerve another tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency
in it, there have
been many Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ioſiahs, Iehoſhaphats,</hi> and
<hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> the <hi>Forraigne</hi>
               <hi>Proteſtations</hi> and thoſe of
our owne, yet none that
hath ſuch a <hi>Spirituall</hi> and

               <hi>Politicall breadth</hi> in it, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

            </p>
            <p>I might take in other
particulars, but they are
ſuch as cleere up to your

thoughts have rouled up
themſelves into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>Since the <hi>Covenant</hi> is
of this tranſcendency and
excellency, ſo ſolemn and
ſacred, it were fit there
were ſome holy deſigne,
to worke it more cloſe to
the ſoules of thoſe that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:120034:35"/>
take it, all our <hi>happineſſe
ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>civill</hi> is now
in the ſucceſſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation
with our God,
&amp; therefore there would
be as much holy art uſed
in preſerving the ſpirits of
people in that height of
<hi>Covenanting,</hi> as there was
uſed in the rayſing them
up; God himſelf makes
<hi>conſervation</hi> as much his
buſineſſe as the <hi>creation</hi> of
the world, and therefore
ſome make it the ſame act
repeated againe.</p>
            <p>I ſhould thinke it not
unneceſsary, that thoſe
parts in it which have
moſt of the <hi>atteſtations,</hi> &amp;
<hi>invocation,</hi> &amp; <hi>imprecation,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:120034:36"/>
and moſt of the <hi>Politicall</hi>

ſet on by the miniſtery in
frequent inculcations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a <hi>Catechizing,</hi> and
by a civill ordinance, or
law to that purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde
the miniſtery, for
we complaine of looſeneſs
and neglect in former <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi>
and we take no

certainly the ſudden laying

them but the muſick

is the only reaſon of our
