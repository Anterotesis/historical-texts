            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45179:3"/>
hath not at all herein consulted his reputation and esteem of learning or abilities, which were very eminent in him, but hath descended to the plainness which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections require, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any art or elegancy of Ornament, as more becoming the sincerity of his paternal love. This was judged fit to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Reader might not be stumbled at the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with which he hath cloathed his most difficult cares and thoughts for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and withall to let you know that this copy was transmitted hither by a worthy hand, and saving the alteration of some Scoth words, which would puzzle the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

            <opener>
               <salute>SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral books in Print, written Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, Politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Piously of this very title of late years. I confess, most of them were of particular entendment to their own relations, the reason pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that they are not of such general observation and use;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45179:7"/>
others designed out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous ambition, of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by imitation such rare pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns as went before, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of wit and elegant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, discoloured sometime with urbane, facete Prophaness.</p>
            <p>Ido acknowledge 'tis a singular and the right way of transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans memory to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, especially to his own; it argues a kind of reverence that men bear to themselves when they can so impartially unbosome themselves in the account and register of all their Actions, and can shew no disliked experience of them, as to their own proper guilt. I do not hereby understand what concerns religion, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or extenuate his failings? but of moral transient Acts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45179:7"/>
to the evil of which no man is so strongly inclinable, but by the bias of a corrupt education.</p>
            <p>Many very sententious pieces are extant among Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this subject, but I know none Testamentary but among the Moderns, and of them we have some excellent Princes, and renowned States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>My care of you, whom I would have to consider your self, as the prop of an ancient Honorable Family, is no way less then theirs, however I am inferiour to them in Dignity and Judgment: and therefore I will trace a beaten way, rather then lose my self and you in a general discourse; what I come short of here, you cannot misse in their common places, and so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45179:8"/>
I may be sure I shall attain my end.</p>
            <p>Probably men may think I can adde nothing to that store, but if they consider my station, and how far concerned in these Times, they may rather expect novel Politicks from me, such a variation of the Latitude of the most approved and received maximes of State lying in the sphere in which I acted; but the managery of the Counsels of those times, were by success, or the monstrous guilt and fraud of the Politicians so irregular, that I cannot if I would bring them under Heads, though up and down as they occur I may point at them.</p>
            <p>I confess, 'twas my great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be so deeply engaged in these Fatal Times; I know the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45179:8"/>
always bickered with their Princes, and from the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that Custome, not any of our Kings have been free. 'Tis also true, the perpetual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily feuds among us, which by all the industry and Authority of our Princes, could never be so pacified, but that they revived again, and took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they had advantage to revenge their quarrel; (and yet like sudden floods which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently over-run, and as peaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly return within their banks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated to their due allegiance,) did easily perswade me that there was no such apparent danger in the first beginnings of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, betwixt the King and my Nation of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I had laid it for a maxime, that a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was sooner effected <hi>per</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45179:9"/>
               <hi>Gladium Oris,</hi> then <hi>per Os Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii;</hi> and certainly true Religion is rather a setler, then stickler in Policy, and rather confirms men in obedience to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment established, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them to the erecting of new; which they neither do nor can know, till it be discovered and declared. Wherein I did not look upon our intended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as any way taxable, since it had the whole stream of universal consent of the whole Nation; I never thought of those dire consequences which presently followed, till by that confusion my thoughts became distracted, and my self incountred so many difficulties in the way, that all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were applyed did the quite contrary operation; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45179:9"/>
therefore hath been said by me and others in this matter, you must repute and accept them as from a distracted Man, of a distracted Subject, in a distracted Time wherein I lived: and this shall serve to let you know how far I waded unwarily in that business.</p>
            <p>I will not however counsel you, if any such lamentable commotions (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) should break out, for my unhappiness, to withdraw your self, from interposing to quench and allay them as much as by your Authority you can, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was mistaken by some in my Actions, I did labour for a right understanding,) but be sure let your Allegiance keep the ballance; by no means stand like a neuter in the cause of your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45179:10"/>
King and Country. That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Solons,</hi> that every man that in a general Commotion was of neither party, should be adjudged infamous, is rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed of great men. Popular furies would never have end, if not awed by their Superiours, who supinely neglecting such outrages, not ordinarily, are rnined and depress'd in their own Estates and Honours, a late example whereof we had in our neighbour Nation; the People will soon learn their own strength, that <hi>Summa Potestas radicatur in voluntatibus Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> and from thence inferre, that the popular power excels the power of the Noblesse.</p>
            <p>Great men therefore, are in some sort as necessary as good men, as power is as requisite as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45179:10"/>
wisedome, where they are both wanting, <hi>Imperium in Imperio quaerendum est.</hi> Your famous Ancestors by both these, have kept their Vassals (and what is well done in one canton of the Kingdome is like to be imitated throughout,) in a quiet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and good comportment many generations, and I question not but you will find the same reverence from them, if you do not degenerate.</p>
            <p>Do not content your self with the bare titles of greatness, <hi>Principis tantum nomen habere non est esse Princeps,</hi> that power is vain which never exerts it self forth into Act.</p>
            <p>The loosness of these late Times will require at first a gentle hand, while you have got the bridle in the mouths of your
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45179:11"/>
Family, Dependants and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, then you may curbe them, and reduce them to the former obedience they once willingly paid. I have had a difficult task with them, yet by one means or other I kept them in order; nor will they be ever serviceable to their Supreme, if they be not in a due subjection to you, their immediate Lord.</p>
            <p>Take all fair occasions of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Soverain service, let that be your only Emulation with other Noble Houses, supply the great and necessary distance of your Prince from this his Native Kingdome, by a close applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your self to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, if not in a publick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, yet in your private sphear, which will soon advance you to higher Trusts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45179:11"/>You have a great task to do, you must from the bottome climb up to the mount of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a very abrupt and difficult ascent; which yet, nevertheless by observing the sure footings of some of your progenitors, and the slips of others, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly those recent slidings of mine own, (for other they are not) you may at last attain the top, and by your own merit and your Princes favour, your House may be Culminant again.</p>
            <p>If it shall so happen, as I des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair not of it, (ancient merit with good Princes (such as without flattery I may say the most of ours were and are like to be,) will out-last their longest displeasure,) have a care then of that Precipice; let no revenge or ambition blind you into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45179:12"/>
you may poise your self with your wings of Honour and Greatness, but venture not, nor presume to fly.</p>
            <p>Covet not with immoderate hast Lands, Riches, Honour, for it is seldom that men whose rash desires and designs are laid out that way, compass their full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and for the most part meet with a destiny far other then they expected; and when they are once so disappointed, Fortune or rather Providence so much amazeth the judgment even of wise men, as in time of danger they know not what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution is best to be taken. You will not be necessitated through the want of these three, so as to reach at them unlawfully, and endanger what you have in possession, and your self toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45179:12"/>I do not much regret your private life, nor should I labour to bring you into State Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for there is no course more comely, nor any resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so well beseeming a wise man, having made proof of his own vertue, as to retire himself from Court and Company, for so he shall shun the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of contempt, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of a perpetual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I have tryed and found the many perplexities that attend that life, and have reaped no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but calumny and envy, though I do not say this is the fate of all Statists; this I am sure, the best way of coming there, is without popular fame or over-vogued merit, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the interest of a Favourite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45179:13"/>But who so cannot endure the envy and hate that are the attendants thereof, must set down with his present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not meddle with, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise great matters; for great Honours being desired of many, it is of necessity that he that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pireth unto them, must be for his advancement thereunto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, and for his Authority ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which, although they be well managed and used, yet those who hate and envy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading themselves they might be better handled, endevour to oppress that power as fearing it might be worse.</p>
            <p>You will have time after the setling of your own private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to cast about for some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable advantages for your self. Time is the best Counsellour,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45179:13"/>
rather let Magistracy want you, then you want it; which you may effect, if by a wise mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you can slight those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signia</hi> which the world knows your Ancestors have born with commendation and honour, and who have added more lustre to them, then the want of them can take from you.</p>
            <p>Keep a firm and amicable correspondence with your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours howsoever, but so that it be far from giving any suspition of making parties or factions; this is chiefly attained by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous compliance and noble familiarity, that's the way to be loved and Honoured, which works so many good effects, as daily experience sufficeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any express example to prove them of great force. If
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45179:14"/>
you be happy in this particular, this will be your certain repose, and may not be reckoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Externa bona Fortunae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To compass this, take an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act care that your actions be just, be not offended at every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, wink sometimes at your wrong, but beware of unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary revenges. I leave you ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies enough, 'twill be meat and drink (as the English Proverb) to them, to see you froward and quarrelsome; bear off all the affronts that be put upon you with an inviolable invincible mind, and let them see you are above them; Master all your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions and affections, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline them that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your most necessary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>You will be freed, by this

your retirement from publique employment, of adulation and flattery, and by that means will the better and more plainly and sincerely converse with your self, and be able to give a near judgment what you are, and of your abilities and defects, which is the most necessary knowledge in the world, and which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense the disuse of other Policy. <hi>E Coelo descendit,</hi>

            <p>This I thought fit in general, as to the Condition I shall leave you in, to direct and advise you; only one word more: I charge you to forget, and not harbour any animofity or particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against any man concerning me. Such heart-burnings have been the destruction of many a Noble person in this Kingdom, and I know not of any person so given, but the very same measure hath been meeted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him again. The Cup is gone round, and therefore content your self; but above all I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to have more regard to Christianity, then covertly or basely to kill a particular Enemy by secret assault or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,

            <p>AS you are the greatest part of me, and in whom I may promise to my self a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of succession, so have I also a paternal care (more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me now) towards you: I shall therefore in some particular directions to you, as the monuments of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, advise and counsel you, in what shall be necessary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for your several condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>First, therefore make not hast
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45179:16"/>
to put your selves out of the government or charge of those to whose care and tuition I have committed you; if any thing happen that shall offer you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in another station of life, then I leave you, I require you to consult with them first. I have laid a sacred obligation upon them to assist and aid you in all matters, which if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or contemn, you will soon find your selves left to the world, as a ship to the raging sea, without Furniture or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors.</p>
            <p>Above all, bear that constant filial duty to your Mother, which her piety and tenderness in your Education, most justly call for at your hands; her great indulgence towards you, and her entire affection to me in all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45179:17"/>
my suffering of late, deserve very much at my hand; and therefore I charge you to shew that respect to her for me, which I would have done my self, and in which, in all the time of our wedlock you have known me to have continued. Fail not in any outward circumstance of honour and reverence to her, that so by your dutiful beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and carriage towards her, some of the harshness and aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her present condition may be alleviated.</p>
            <p>To your Eldest Brother, who is the Prince of your Family, shew your selves obedient and loving; he is my substitute, your Honour is bound up in his, in him it now rests, and may for a while not appear in its lustre; take heed therefore you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45179:17"/>
do not by any dis-respect quite extinguish it; your due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of him will preserve it in the minds of all men, who are not strangers to the ancient worth and merit of <hi>Our House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With one another maintain a mutual love and confidence: This happiness you may have by my adversity to indear your selves more to one another, lay out no affection upon the world, but keep the entire stock for your selves. Let that equal love which I bear you, and which I leave with you, be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated among you, by a constant amity to one another; which will be the better Cemented by your religious and godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, wherein I trust you have been so well instructed, that my memory shall not be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45179:18"/>
charged or blamed for your education.</p>
            <p>Keep a Decorum in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, value not your selves the worse for one riot or attempt of fortune made upon me; mind not her temporary outrages; vertue is the true standard, such allays pass not with her, fix your self upon your own worth, and no engine of fate can remove you from that Basis. Pusill animity is a vice almost needless to be warned of, because noble minds do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>niti contra,</hi> and bear up against their extremities, till they have either surmounted them by their bravery, and ascended to their first height, or levelled them by their patience and equanimity, plain'd their difficulties, and made them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45179:18"/>
even with their contented minds.</p>
            <p>The small Portions I have left you, (though the world miscounts them as great matters, and I could wish they amounted to their sums) you must improve as talents, serve your necessities with them, not your pleasures; what the Royal Bounty may hereafter do by way of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may do with it as may be most subservient to your Honour; you will not be liable to great expences, you are free from any dependency on Court, where men spend money, on a vanity called Hope. As for marriage, (of which I shall speak more largely hereafter and of which in the beginning of this Monition, I gave you a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) your vertue must supply
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45179:19"/>
dower, though I trust I have left a Competency (with your vertues) to match you to any family in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behave your selves therefore prudently, decently, and warily to all people, that so you may gain the general good will and benevolence of all; imitate the example your Mother hath set before you; stand upon your guard against all pleasures, or other baits or allurements that shall tempt you to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful actions or desires, which may practise upon you either in your Conscience, or in your Reputation: and resolve this as a sure rule with your selves, that no person is wise or safe, but he that is honest.</p>
            <p>Fear your Creator, and serve him with all your might, begin
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45179:19"/>
all your works and actions with him, 'tis he onely can succeed and prosper them. If you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue your own designs upon your own bottome, the conclusion will be your own ruin, for he can wither and blast at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sinful undertakings. I shall never despair of Gods blessing upon you, nor doubt his all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for you, if you apply your self to him, and make his fear the rule of your Lives.</p>
            <p>You, see that to be descended of great Personages, is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the strokes of fortune; but to be descended of a Heavenly race, will carry you out of the reach of those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which are incident to Humanity.</p>
            <p>Imploy therefore your time in renewing your alliances there,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45179:20"/>
probably your consanguinity and relations here, may stand off from you, like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in his adversity. Desertions are usual in this case; you need how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not much care for this worldly friendship, as long as you have dependance on the Favour of Heaven.</p>
            <p>What is abated here to you in the transitory felicites and pleasures of the world, (from which you have no such cause to wean your selves altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) will be easily recompenced in your enjoying him who is the foundation of all good, and from whom all happiness is derived to his Creatures.</p>
            <p>To whose Protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you and your ways, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to bless and prosper them, to his glory, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Religion.</head>
            <p>THis being your greatest concernment the director of all your actions, I cannot use my Paternal Authority to better purpose, then in adjuring you and straightly charging and requiring you, to be constant and zealous in the Religion now left established in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I will not take upon me now to decide controversies arisen betwixt ours and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in matters of Discipline, they agreeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in Doctrine; all that I shall say is, that their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have not been used here,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45179:21"/>
and you have been bred up without them, and the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> otherwise affected, and therefore, you shall do well to continue in this Kirk, though I would rather have it your own choice, then any other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatsoever. Diversity in any thing distracteth the mind, and leaves it waving in a dubious perplexity, and then how easy is it to sway the mind to either side; this is most true and experienced in Religion; you must therefore obfirmate your eares, and confirm your judgment, being once satisfied of the Excellency of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and having received the true and sincere Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Neither would I have you only fixt and constant in your Religion, but also very devout
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45179:21"/>
in the practise of it; that as heretofore your ancestors have been eminent for Honour, you that come short of them by this <hi>deliquium</hi> or Eclipse of it in me, may nevertheless exceed them in the true way to it, by your Zeal and Piety: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that he that is not truly religious, will hardly be esteemed such, since nothing is of less continuance then Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and dissimulation, and if your religion be such, such will your greatness and honour be, a fained thing and a meer shadow.</p>
            <p>The observance of Religion, and the exercise of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, do become none so much as illustrious persons, other glories have lifted them beyond the pitch and reach of men, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45179:22"/>
this is a ray of the Divinity which advanceth them neer to the Diety, and like the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond out-shines the lustre of all other Jewels. A religious heart and a clear conscience will make you truly conspicuous; it is as the mother of all other vertues; what brave effects of obedience to Princes hath it wrought in Subjects? look back to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times and the Emperors, how courageous were they in all enterprises, hardy and resolute in dangers, liberal to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, ready to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most devoir in the distrest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Empire? and this from one pious principle, that in serving their Prince, they served God, whose Leiutenant he is, nor was there any difficulty over which their faith did not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45179:22"/>Nevertheless, some have taxed, and it hath been along and strong imputation, that this Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> doth teach se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against, or at least the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Authority of their Princes. For my part I know no such matter, nor did I ever embrace or adhere to such opinions, though censured for them; if any mans entempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature hath vented such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tenets, or his rash presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption ventilated such questions, I have nothing to do with them, I disown and disclaim them; and therefore to remove this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from you also, I charge you to make your duty to your Soveraign one of the chief points of your Religion, so far forth as it may consist with your obedience to God, who ought
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45179:23"/>
to be served best, and in the first place. There is such a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between both those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that commonly they go together.</p>
            <p>Whatever the late miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages have been by the peoples strugling for their Liberty of Conscience, as they are past, so they have left the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be prevented for the future: and no doubt the good temperament of the King, with an easie indulgent hand of his Ministers, will keep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the scandal of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War.</p>
            <p>'Tis a maxime of State, that where Princes and People are of a different Religion, they will not well agree; yet Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern experience, and since the Reformation arrived to a setled
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45179:23"/>
constitution and Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, evinceth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as at present in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the quite opposite reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are peaceably and quietly profest. But God be thanked, there is no such contrariety in the religion professed in these two neighbouring Kingdomes, which may not (without ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity and interest keep the breach open,) be reconciled, All impatient zeal being turned into an aemulation of Loyalty to the King.</p>
            <p>Cherish and maintain the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, painful able Preachers. Nothing brings more contempt upon, or aviles religion, and the service of God, in the eyes of the vulgar, then the necessities,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45179:24"/>
wants and miseries, of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; what esteem you confer upon them, will soon redound and reflect again upon you. What the Heathen said of their Poets, that by their means and writings, famous men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were transmitted to immortality, who otherwise would have lain un perpetual oblivion; is very true of Evangelical Doctors, their prayers, and their instructions, and their recommendations of you, together with your own endeavour after Holiness, which is the only Fame and Glory, will transmit and place you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Heaven, and establish you here living and dead in the good will and praise of all men.</p>
            <p>Let charity be a chief ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in your religion, both in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45179:24"/>
giving and forgiving. As you shall have abilities, indulge the poor, and let them in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure partake with you in your outward blessings and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the other, as you are always liable to offences, so be always as apt and prone to pardon or pass them by, which in the greatest adversities you can undergo, will never be out of your power to do.</p>
            <p>Frequent the Church and the Houses of God, let no business invade or intrude upon your religious Houres; what you have destined to the Service of God, is already sacred to him, and cannot without great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness be alienated from him, and conferred upon others; use private prayers, as well as go to the publick Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:45179:25"/>For other duties necessary for a Christians practise, I refer you to the discipline and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Kirk, it being needless to repeat them here, being so exactly laid down by her, whom I take to be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Church.</p>
            <p>For search all religions through the world, and you will find none that ascribes so much to God, nor that constitutes such a firm love among men, as does the Establish'd Doctrine, (I except the Schisms amongst us) of the Protestant Church among you: In whose Armes I leave you, and Her to the everlasting protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and guidance of God.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Marriage.</head>
            <p>HAving devoted your self principally to the Service of God, and subordinatly to your Prince which includes your Country; the next duty or affection, you owe to your self in the ordering or governing of your life, according to your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inclinations and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And among the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and strong sways of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I reckon marriage, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in great and noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, where interest forbids per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual virginity; nor ever since the suppressing of Nunneries, and such Monastick Privacies
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45179:26"/>
and renunciations to the world, have we had in this Kingdome, many, if any of the daughters of <hi>Jephtha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marriage no doubt was one of the greatest favours that God conferred on mankind, and when he bestows a vertuous mate, whose humility, chastity and affection, are eminently great, he doth renew his first intentions of kindness to man, and gives grace upon grace, and infinitely happy is he that can find and make such a choice. 'Twas therefore well said by him, that discoursing of this subject, affirmed that God did oftentimes reward the good works, the honesty and piety of a man, by the offer and tender of a good wife; for Parents could only give wealth and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45179:26"/>
riches, lands and estates to their children, but God only could give them prudent and discret women.</p>
            <p>In the contracting therefore of marriage, vertue is more to be considered then money, beauty will rivall with either of them, and oftentimes gets pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session sooner then both; but then it quickly loseth it again, as having not those stays and supportations which each of the other have in themselves.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, vertue is first to be Courted, and the <hi>Primitia,</hi> the first fruits of our Love should be offered up at her shrines; but yet reserving the stock to sacrifice to the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contingencies and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which befall the wedded state, by the additional helps
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45179:27"/>
of handsomness and wealth.</p>
            <p>But be not overblinded with beauty, 'tis one of the greatest deceits Nature is guilty of; not that it is so in those persons to whom she is graciously and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally pleased to bestow it, (for 'tis the most exact copy of her illustrious self,) but in the fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination and witchery it darts through the eyes into the minds of men; you cannot but pay homage to it, but let that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute redeem yon from a total Conquest: Remember, that it is but clay, more refined and set off with a better varnish, and being all on the outside, lies open to weather and consuming time, and sometimes to present misfortunes; while that which is internal stands the shock, and endures all brunts, like a strong

fortified garrison, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shews like a weak gay Army in the Field, ready to be vanquisht at the first encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Money is the sinew of Love, as well as war, you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happily in wedlock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; the other are Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards, but they are not of the Trump-suit, and are foiled by every sneaking misadventure; vertue is supprest, and cannot emerge and dilate it self in the streights of a narrow fortune; and beauty is betrayed to the necessity of keeping it so, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in a pinching condition, leanness and deadpaleness would usurp the place where full blown Roses sate, with Love before Nor was it ever known, that a beautiful woman driven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45179:28"/>
to want, escaped the offers and importunities of men, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of pitying and supplying her distresses, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees have gain'd upon her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pudicity, while she satisfies her self, that out of (miserable) gratitude she could do no less.</p>
            <p>I do much approve of crosse marriages between families, which have been so allied for many descents together, so as they be not in that proximity in which the House of <hi>Austria</hi> matches. By the race we guess of the production,—<hi>De for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus creantur fortes</hi>—and that adds a firm monument to both Houses, being so incorporated into one another. However men reckon it for glory in Heraldry, to bear almost the whole armes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45179:28"/>
of the Kingdome in one Escut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon. Methinks honour there looks like a river, which bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into several rivolets loseth it self in them; whereas streams that take in another large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent, carry all before them, and run directly into the Ocean, and disembogue themselves with a name.</p>
            <p>If you are not affected that way, there is variety enough in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but whatever you do, consult with your Honour first, do not embase your blood by matching below you, it will soon breed distast and dislike in your self, which will cause ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and revenge in her, and entail contempt upon your issue and posterity. Such embraces will be like the twining of the Ivy about the Oake, suck up
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45179:29"/>
moisture from the root, while the branches are withered, and the stock falls to the ground, never like to reflourish again.</p>
            <p>As you match your Peer in honour, let her be so in years, a difference in age is a secret fire raked up for a time, which will afterwards break out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume your quiet: when either of your desires and strength answer not the vigour of the youngest, then the sparkles will fly by such violent collisions and clashings that will soon set your Family in combustion.</p>
            <p>After your choice made and pitch'd upon, and a vow passed, keep your self religiously to it, (the breach whereof, is a vulgar common sin in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore the more detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you) knowing there can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45179:29"/>
be no dispensation from it, and nothing but misery after it joyned with shame and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>In the state of marriage carry your self affectionately and discreetly, and keep strictly the rites of it, that no jealousie, that canker worm of conjugal love fret that silken knot which tied you together. Owe nothing to one another in zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of affection, which will soon beget such a mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the rest of your life will be but an advantagious repetition of your first joys, and adde number to your contents and pleasures, as to your years.</p>
            <p>Let not the secrets of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage pass beyond the chamber, for he little regards his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or his wives chastity, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45179:30"/>
blazes or discovers what is done there, and no slyer debauchery is there to women, then what by such luxuriant freedome of their Husbands tongues, is prompted to their wandring and strong imaginations.</p>
            <p>I pray for, and wish your good success in this great affair, and commend you to him, who is only able to grant it you.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Court.</head>
            <p>YOu are not thither bound, and I am not sorry you are forbidden resort thither, as to any employment or traffique; 'tis a place difficult of access, shut up with Rocks, Shallows, and Sands, and not one adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in twenty comes off a saver. Besides, 'tis a place of a most incertain air, full of damps and exhalations, spread with clouds and over-cast, and sometimes again scorching hot in the sudden rise and depression of favourites.</p>
            <p>But if your curiosity shall invite you to the danger, when time
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45179:31"/>
may look with a better aspect upon you, remember these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of mine own, who both at distance, and at close view have well considered it.</p>
            <p>First then, as to the favour of your Prince, which is the most desirable thing in the world; 'tis rather an illustrious care, then a contentful possession; nor do wise men ever busie themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, because the tranquility of spirit, which they seek for, is not to be found amidst the confusions of the Court: and to guard a mans self from the misfortunes there, and the envy which the graces of Princes do contract upon their favourites; there is no way better then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and retiredness. You must know that 'tis meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45179:31"/>
weakness, which causeth Princes to raise favourites, to aid and support them in the weight and multitude of affairs, and sometimes in such secrets which are heavier upon the mind then all the rest; the sad effect whereof every age hath given an example.</p>
            <p>You must at your entrance, resolve to encounter the accosts of contempt, scorn, discontents and repulses, with a bold fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and take no notice of slightings and injuries done you by the great ones. A thing I always judged grievous to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind, and yet these are ordinarily the steps to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If you shall find favour at Court, beware your covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after new boons, make you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45179:32"/>
not forget the old ones; and if then you receive denials, guard your self, that the distaste be not more prevalent to run you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actions of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then reason can be to keep you in your duty.</p>
            <p>Extraordinary diligence and affected assiduity are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, whereby men think to prevene their advancement; on the contrary, if men neglect and seem careless of promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, attending when the merit of their actions shall offer it them, Time or fortune seldom fail to conduct them to true and permanent glory.</p>
            <p>It hath been an old Adage, a young Courtier, an old Beggar; men spending estates in riot in such consuming places as Cities, in a fruitless expectation, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45179:32"/>
then carry home nothing but repentance.</p>
            <p>A cholerick person is not fit to be a Courtier, for if he should go about to revenge himself of the indignities, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado's, deceits, and tricks put upon him, he shall suffer more in an hour, then he shall be satisfied for in ten years.</p>
            <p>You must do at <hi>Rome,</hi> what others do there, be sure to fing no other aires then which most please the Prince. 'Twas <hi>Solons</hi> comparison of Courtiers, who resembled them to Counters, with which men use to cast ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; for as in changing their places, they stand sometimes for more, sometimes for less; so Princes do the same with them, now advancing them in honour and dignity, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45179:33"/>
debasing them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the scorn and derision of all men, so that it is truly sad, that men have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of losing themselves at Court, and finding of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at Home.</p>
            <p>Old Courtiers are like old ships, brought into Harbors and there laid up, never to be put to Sea to any new adventure.</p>
            <p>'Tis a tart Sarcasme or Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical pass upon the Court that one said; At the Court are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests to Baptise, and change names; for there, the vain-glorious ambitious man, is called honourable; the prodigal, magnificent; the coward, wise; the wise, hypocrite; the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, subtle; the adulterous, amorous; the covetous, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; and what confidence
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45179:33"/>
can any man repose in friends there, whose greatness renders them the more intractable. 'Tis very difficult to find vertue at Court, but it is more difficult to keep it.</p>
            <p>He that sins and repents, and returns again to his sin, sins more grosly then at first; so to leave the Court, and return again, is such an errour that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable; save with this, that the return was to sell vertue, and gain wealth, since it is a great kindness of fortune or puissance of vertue, to escape that gulf.</p>
            <p>Against the envy of the Court as against the Plague, there is no better preservative, then retreat and eloingment; a remedy practised very often but with different success; it being very dangerous for popular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45179:34"/>
and such as have had great Commands to absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without leave or dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it not only breeds sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions and jealousies of their disaffection, and consequently of the danger of a Rebellion, but likewise exposeth them to the unobstructed designs and malice of their enemies, which seldome end but in ruin.</p>
            <p>This is generally the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Courts, wherein you must understand there is not the least concurrence of the Prince to give any such cause for it, but that by Tradition the Grandees walk by as by a rule; and since Monarchy was, Court arts have been, and can vie precedency with any mystery. I never knew any great Favourite, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised any new ways of his own:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45179:34"/>
some have been nobler and more magnificent then others, freer in access and more affable, but yet still kept close to their Court-lessons, nor could ever their private vertues gain upon their publick Concerns.</p>
            <p>It is possible a man may get an Estate at Court, but it is more probable he may lose one; that which is got there, through how many curses and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations it passeth; that which is lost, with how many woos, and tears, and deprecations goes it! so much is a Court worse then a Lottery.</p>
            <p>While you can therefore pay your devotion, your Loyalty to your Prince at home, and probably be better accepted; what need have you of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous unnecessary pilgrimage to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45179:35"/>
the shrine, to pay a personal adoration; your oblation there can be nothing less but your quiet and Estate in lieu, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will present you with a trinket or some other bauble, which you will be ashamed to carry home again.</p>
            <p>Fear God, Honour the King, Live at Home, and Love your Neighbours.</p>

            <p>AS you have not that rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freedome of choice of your society; suspicion on the one hand, and reason of State on the other hedging you up, and impaling you within a narrow scantling; so neither can the iniquity of any the worst fortune leave a man in such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, in which a guide, a friend, (by whose Counsels and sweet converse either, he may extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himself from, or avoid the tediousness of his troubles,) may not be had. What therefore you shall lack in the multitude
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45179:36"/>
of friends, who like flies fasten on the sweets of Honour, Fame, Riches, &amp;c. you will find no great loss in, if it be your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to find out but one or two, such an Oligarchy of friendship, whose unity in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and fidelity, will richly compensate the many Cyphers that attend on greatness.</p>
            <p>To make a right choise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you must first propose to your self the inconstancy of man, the most changeable, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature in the world. Every breath of wind fans him to a various shape, think not therefore of making a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship fixt and eternal. How ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently have men loved some, even beyond the desire of dying for them, when in a moment, as it were one hasty ebullition
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45179:36"/>
of choler hath rendred them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding offensive, nay, hath sunk them into our hate and execration? see the fast hold which man doth take of man! 'tis let go and unfastned in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the clacking of the tongue, a nod, a frown, or such like nothing; we cancel leagues with friends, make new ones with enemies, and break them ere concluded. The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this will keep you from overw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning any man, and from a total trust and confidence in him, and beget in you a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer exercise, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a firmer reliance on your own vertues and abilities.</p>
            <p>Nothing sooner corrupts or rottens friendship, then an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasty entertaining of it, like praecoce fruit that's ripe before
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45179:37"/>
its season. Jndgement is the only cement that closeth and binds the affections of men: where that's wanting, 'tis like building with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the structur's like to fall on our own head. I never knew any yet so good, but some have thought him vile, and hated him; nor contrarily, any so bad but some have thought him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and loved him; either the ignorance, the envy, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of those that judge do constitute a various man: in some report hath foreblinded Judgment, in some, accident is the cause of disposing us to love or hate. The soul is often led by secrete uninvestigable ways and motions to love, she knows not why. But 'tis time alone and long probation, which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45179:37"/>
fail to give right informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when Nature, Art and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, may deceive you. Every man may keep his mind if he lists in a Labyrinth. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tis a room by us inscrutable, into which Nature has made no certain window, but as he himself shall please to give you light, which is in such transient glimmerings that it rarely strikes any thing but the eye, leaving us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to grope again in the dark.</p>
            <p>I remit you to your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, you have converst in the world (troublesome enough for many years) with all sorts and all humours of persons; but for your better guidance herein, I shall give you these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of friendship, which my longer observation hath found
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45179:38"/>
to be true characters of it.</p>
            <p>He who is really your friend, will give you Counsel before you ask it, and thats the reason a man cannot keep a friend by constraint, nor oblige secrecy by coercion.</p>
            <p>Most men regard their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and therefore use their friends as men use beasts, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend and look to them, from whom they receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and advantages, and so deny themselves, and want the most desirable fruition in the world, which is natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal amity; which all the creatures maintain among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and yet know not nor are able to consider, what and how great the force of that friendship is; for every one loves it self, not out of hope
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45179:38"/>
of any reward and recompence to it self for it, but, because of the nearness and dearness it owes it self. Which if the samething be not done in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, it is impossible to find a true friend.</p>
            <p>He that loves you extremely, will hate you most deadly, therefore sober, moderate friendship is the best; and since friends must be had, if your happiness be to find good ones, beware you incur not that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness of changing them: Remember, that he is in the best condition who is best furnished with the best men for his friends, nevertheless, let no obligation to them, make you dispence with your Conscience or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; have always a care not to trust any thing to your most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45179:39"/>
privado, but what you cannot keep from time: A small distast will discover those faults, which a heap of years have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. 'Twas <hi>Bias</hi> his Counsel that men should so love, as if every day were a renewed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and not to affect repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Let no man (which is the chief law of friendship,) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of you, which is not lawful, or which is not within your power; nor do you use friends as men use flowers, smell to them as long as fresh, and green, and fragrant, and then lay them aside, for so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly friendships conciliated by interest or fancy, usually termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Beware especially of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary love, when your money fails, that leaves you, when true
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45179:39"/>
affection follows beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>Your vertues will make and get you friends throughout the world, Love has Armes which will joyn the distant Corners of the universe; out the good offices you do at home, as they keep mens eyes upon them, and serve as well as remembrancers, will afford you a continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>Believe it, nothing will gain you so much respect, (the first and best ingredient to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) as your uprightness and sincerety, greatness was always suspicious, without any conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous proofs of a more then ordinary integrity; nor will true glory wait long on a false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, observance is her maidof honour, &amp; what recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45179:40"/>
she gives must be founded on desert.</p>
            <p>In a word chuse such friends as I have left you, they will be the more yours, because of your own affiance to them, and so you will have a double interest in them, your election and mine.</p>

            <p>THis is in some men a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and curiosity only, in others wisedome and design, and accordingly they make their different returns; it hath been all along the practise of this Nation, and with very good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: (to go to a forraign war is rather a transplantation then travel, passing only out of the bounds of one Country, into the confinements and limits of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so I reckon I have said nothing to you concerning this subject in my maximes of war,) and I cannot conceive any better divertisement (besides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45179:41"/>
it will afford you) for your present condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer</hi> begins his <hi>Odysseis</hi> in the praise of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> with this title and character.—<hi>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; urbes,</hi> as the most apparentest demonstration of his wisedome. Some men there are, that have seen more with their eye, then some ambitious Princes did ever comprehend in their thoughts, 'Tis a pleasure and felicity when the mind embraces but a glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thought of the beauteous fabrick of the universe, and is with a kind of delight trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to some peculiar part of it, whose felicity and pleasures or wealth, have won upon its running fancy; if this be so in the imagination, what delight and fruition is there, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45179:41"/>
view, and passage, and abode in the most remarkable countries of the world. Men expect rich returns in <hi>East-India</hi> Ships, and men that are far tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellors, beget great expectation of their wealth; if they come home empty, they bankrupt their Credit, and dye in their Countries debt, and that narrow dark prison of their pride, buries them in utter oblivion, who might have made the wide world their Monument.</p>
            <p>The story of the wandring Jew was a pleasant fiction, the punishment consisted only in his not having a Centre, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he could as well want it as the rest of his Nation. The moral would hint, what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved man must he be who hath so often gone the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45179:42"/>
crost the Lines, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited the most remote and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse corners of the world; seen so many varieties in Nature and Providence, reconciled by the tract of time.</p>
            <p>One Journey will shew a man more, then twenty descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, relations or maps; what a desolate life do Tortoises live, who cannot be rid of their shells? No man can endure confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he that hath lived lock'd up in one Kingdome, is but a degree beyond a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was never out of the bounds of his parish. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless all men are not fit for travel, wise men are made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fools worse. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires after nothing but the gue-gaws, the antick-fashions, and gestures of other lands, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45179:42"/>
becomes the shame of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by disgracing his own in carrying nothing of worth or esteem from thence, and by bringing censure and imputation upon forraign places where he conversed, by importing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their vices. They vent abroad their domestick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and utter here, them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond sea.</p>
            <p>If you would advantage your self by travail, you ought to note, and then comment upon your observations, remembring as well the bad to avoid it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the good into use; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing of these things to the Pen, they will pass from your memory without leaving any profitable results behind them.</p>
            <p>Let no hast therefore hurry
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45179:43"/>
you through any considerable or remarkable place, but stay and view what is worthy in it, and be sure to register it with your pen, it will very much fasten it in your memory; the charactering of a thought in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will fix it ready for your use; he that doth this, may when he please rejourney all his travails at home.</p>
            <p>Solid persons are the best proficients by travail, they are not so prone to be inquinated by the dross and feces of the vices, and taking vanities of forraign Countries, being abler to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves to such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which may sooner facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their inquisition. Pliance and outward freedome, and a seeming carelesseness is the readiest way to get into strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45179:43"/>
and to learn from them.</p>
            <p>Policy and negotiation I commend far before Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Learning, though never so deep and knowing. When you are abroad, the best way is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the best, and not to chuse by the eye but the ear, (which your own inexperience will soon warn you of) but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low report.</p>
            <p>For the Government, and things relating to the State, your advice and instruction is no where to be had but at Court, for the Trade, Commerce and Traffick, in great Cities among Marchants; for their Religion and Church affairs amongst the Clergy, but I rather chuse the universities, where you may happly meet with an addition of the rest. For the Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes

and Manners, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; and for the Country and rural knowledge, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and such as we call the Yeomanry.</p>
            <p>All rareties are to be seen, and therefore I advise you not to travail without store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be ready at all occasions; especially Antiquities, for these shew us the science and abilities of those times before us; (the moderns always preferring their arts and inventions to former ages) that by comparing of them with the present, we may be able to give a judgment, how the world thrives or goes less in all such learning.</p>
            <p>Above all, think no travail too far nor discommodious to see and visit rare and eminent men, there is no monument like
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45179:44"/>
a vertuous learned person; living by him we shall be sure to be something the better, we shall find somewhat in him to inflame and excite our minds to strain to the like pitch, and so extern them, in a brave imitation of his excellent qualities. To such men you must carry your self with all submiss reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting the dignity of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that are relucent in them; and that awe you seem to stand in, will soon invite his Candour to a free reception and neer entertainment of you, for learned men are rarely proud or stately.</p>
            <p>Judgment is the onely thing that is necessary for a travailor and therefore I approve not of your going abroad, nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your children if God shall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45179:45"/>
send you any, till they have grown to a good competency of discretion, which yet I would have seconded by the assistance of a Tutor, when it shall be any of your inchnations this way. I pray God bless you abroad, and return you as an Honour to your King, Country and Friends.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Housekeeping and Hospitality.</head>
            <p>THis is a generosity very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in Noble persons, and the greatest demonstrations they are so: 'Tis as well respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the quality of it as the quantity, and according to the condition of every man; you may be as free in a moderate entertainment as in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses and superfluities of your Table, which then becomes a snare, where it should be a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the greater extreme is that of niggardliness, and but a little less then vileness
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45179:46"/>
or baseness, in the eyes of your Neighbours, which will soon bring contempt and dis-esteem upon you, which you must by all means (as reckoning it the worst evil can befal noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,) avoid and decline. The English are so careful of their Honour in this point, that they do abridge themselves of other Grandezza's which their Estates would afford them, in coming to Court, Masquing, &amp;c. to sacrifice with the due rites to their Penates their Houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, to whom their Ancestors had devoted their prime sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and which the Genius of their neighbouring people as by a religious custome expected from them.</p>
            <p>So much was not required at the hands of any Scotch Noble
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45179:46"/>
man, as from an Esquire there of 2000l. <hi>per annum,</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lies in the condition of our vassals, and their Tenants and Neighbours; which being perhaps now to be more assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, both by some use and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding our Nation hath of the English Customes, and the greater correspondency and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendship, that is likely toa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise between them, (which is now more advanced by the war, then by the long projected union;) I would advise you as far, and as soon, as you are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the English manners in this particular. It will beget you a good respect; and favour purchased from hence is most durable.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly at home, without urgent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45179:47"/>
and necessary occasions call you from thence. The entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your House will afford strangers, though it be never so ample and abundant, will want that condiment and sauce of Hospitality, your own company. Men usually affect their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords company, though they pay for it; much more will the honour of your presence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your frank and liberal treatments, to the gratitude of all persons who shall resort to your House and Table.</p>
            <p>Be not only courteous your self to all comers, but see your servants be so too. Kind rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and admittance is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary before meat, as digestion afterwards; and he that would have thanks for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it is past must bespeak
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45179:47"/>
it before it begin at his board, that his victuals and chear be but a rumination of his first kindnesses, and that his Porch be as free as his Hall.</p>
            <p>Keep about you therefore no morose, cross conditioned ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and as near as you can retain men of a good aspect, and as far as you can be assured of them to be of fair and civil demeanour. Such will not only be an ornament and honour to you, but of much advantage; for as it will invite persons of quality and civility to you, which will be credible for you, so will it shame and deter the ruder, and more ungoverned sort of people, who meeting with such dissonant humours, will soon abstain or soon be civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:45179:48"/>Let not your entertainments be tedious, knowing that is not the way to keep them all along the year, and therefore substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dishes must make up your bill of fare, in stead of French Quelque choses. Money and time is fruitlessely spent in those vanities, and are for no mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine contentment and palate; and if such be not your guests, your expences will be <hi>thrown away,</hi> when others reckon them <hi>laid out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above all things avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in drink. Luxury in feeding seldome carries men beyond their stomack and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, though never so many provocations be used to lure them on; but in the abundance of wine men are sottishly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45179:48"/>
beyond themselves, and the excess in it, makes them the more covetous and raging after it; especially where they think or find they cannot be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, unless they comply with your humour, and can requite your charges no other ways, then by the loss of their sense and modesty.</p>
            <p>I would have you therefore detest that barbarous German mode of drinking to victory, by a beastly subduing of those, whom you have invited, and humanely welcomed, and bid to your Table, 'Tis one of the greatest vices our Gentry hath brought from thence, amidst all those Trophies which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly gained there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more caution is to be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45179:49"/>
used, lest it insinuate it self easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their converse, whose company you shall do well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to esteem as an honour; but yet use your discretion and my experience as an Antidote against that humour, which you may do plausibly and indiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible enough.</p>
            <p>Suffer no person to depart your house in discontent that shall not by rudeness or some other unhospitable way deserve your dis-respect; on the other side, permit no tumultuous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly persons to stay within your dores. Every ordinary mans house is his Castle, but a Noblemans is that and a Palace both, where there is reverence due to you as well as a bare power and command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:45179:49"/>On publique Anniversary Thanksgiving days, you must expend above your ordinary provisions. The solemnity due to those festivals, takes it's weight from the observation of the Nobility, whose magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences at those times are the most forcible impressions to make the people remember and call to mind, (which will also keep them in their duty,) the mercy's and favours of such days. This will more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern you, who by all means and ways must endeavour to reconcile your self to the government.</p>
            <p>But be surest, that the poor whose condition will not suffer them within your doors, may not be out of your heart, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45179:50"/>
that a constant care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be made for them: from whom I assure you, you shall find the greatest return and thanks, if not by them, yet for them.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Tenants and other concerns of Estate.</head>
            <p>YOu will be at a loss in this particular, by reason of the difficulties I shall leave upon my Estate, and the several claims made by pretended titles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which will be eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown; it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require your utmost diligence and circumspection, having so many enemies about you.</p>
            <p>I look upon your old demeans of the Family, as the most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue in your possession, and therefore you must retain and caress with all manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of kindness, the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45179:51"/>
present and ancient possessors and enjoyers of those lands, who by their long dependance on your family, are so addicted to it, that they will not desire upon any ordinary conditions to be alienated from you, if you seem not to slight them or your own interest.</p>
            <p>It is utterly impossible you should be totally deprived of your inheritance among them, so long as you bear my name; nor do I know my self every part of my estate there, so far is it out of the reach of confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: many were the Homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Services done me, which were without book.</p>
            <p>For my novel acquists and purchases, they have so much envy of the state already upon them, that I would not advise
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45179:51"/>
you by stirring on them to draw more upon you: your old rents will be estate enough for you, if you can secure them. I never look'd upon any thing I had from the Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> other then as a present satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for what I had expended; what it wants or exceeds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was never intended to be put to your account.</p>
            <p>'Tis no time now, nor is it your interest to stand at that distance formerly maintained; many have been the forfeitures of the Scotch Nobility, yet I never knew any so dangerous as yours is like to prove; for I will not dissemble that odium and envy against me, how justly I have said elsewhere. So there lies upon you a necessity of counterwalking all ways to your
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45179:52"/>
ruine: you must move pity, (and that I think no hard matter in your case) and you will soon find affection which will easily be improved into trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the ready way to secure your Estate.</p>
            <p>If by such means, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I do not, as I said before; despair of your total restitution, if not to your Dignities and Honour, yet to your Lands and Revenues,) you shall be possest, remember you deal gratefully with such, as have dealt honestly and faithfully with you; and consider you may not strain thiugs to that heigth, which usually great men do in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for that the wings of your greatness are clipped, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow out again suddenly; and that your safety now instead
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45179:52"/>
of mightiness, consists altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the love, and not in the fear of your Tenants.</p>
            <p>Redeem that hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure laid upon me, of being a cruel rigid Landlord, and strive to vanquish those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by a complacent carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which to my best disposed temper (as times were) proved insuperable.</p>
            <p>Avoid as much as in you ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all suits and controversies, such collisions will give light to discoveries; set down by any losses or injuries, which you cannot remedy without publick trial, and give place to such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as will overbear you.</p>
            <p>Recollect first your scattered fortunes, and let a sedentary quiet life have confirmed you in the possession of what you
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45179:53"/>
have, so shall you not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered (if then you be put to vindicate your right to what you enjoy) by that which you have not.</p>
            <p>Contract your Estate into as few mens hands as possible, change not those to whom you have let your lands formerly, or used or dealt with other ways; especially displace not such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who are acquainted in the managing of it, for besides the ease, you will find security in so doing.</p>
            <p>As I would not have you suffer under that great depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of worth, a base poverty, so neither would I have you to be abused by the chargeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of being very rich, to avoid both, you must live in a free and open way, neither like
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45179:53"/>
               <hi>Diogenes</hi> nor <hi>Dives:</hi> but yet the more men are inquisitive after the secrets of your Estate, the greater will your wisedome be, the closer to conceal it, and that you may do without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for it is in your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Your Estate will be safer however, in the reputation of things past, (men looking on my disposal and ordering of it to be providential and munite enough) then by your own wisedome or any new present, foundation or conveyance, which takes off a great deal of envy from you,</p>
            <p>Keep within the compass of what fortune soever God shall bless you with; if you can be content you shall frustrate the ruinous designs of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45179:54"/>
against you; who can tell but all this may be for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: greater shocks have been given to Estates, which have but riveted and rooted them the faster, instead of overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>Whomsoever you intrust with the stewardship of your Estate, be sure to trust your self most, and keep a strict account of your disbursements and receipts, besides, that it is a good diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, yon will find it very profitable, and will contain and preserve your servants in their duty, and consequently in your favour.</p>
            <p>Make not any necessity by your imprudence or prodigality, whereby yon must be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to borrow money by secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or mortgage, or anticipate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45179:54"/>
your revenues, the first will engage you to do the like cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies for your friend, and that's never without danger; and the other two are basely dishonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will soon bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon your person, and be a moth in your Estate.</p>

            <p>THe times succeeding I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine to be very happy and peaceable, and therefore a course of life befitting the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the age you live in, will be to betake your self to your Studies.</p>
            <p>You have read men a good part of your life, and are pretty well versed in that deep and profound knowledge, that will be of use you in the bustles and encounters of the world; you must also have some provision to pass away the quiet; and blessed calme of life: but herein pray observe these Cautions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:45179:55"/>1. That the study of vain things is a laborious idleness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is no way which leads ingenuous spirits more easily, and with more certain appearances of honour and goodness, to delicacy, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unmanliness, then learning and study.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That to study only to pass away time, is a most inept curiosity, and an unthrifting of time, and very misbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing active and noble spirits.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though good letters be the best informers, yet company and conversation are the best directors for a Noble Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Deportment.</p>
            <p>You must therefore so order your studies, that you make them subservient to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45179:56"/>
of your Honour, Estate, and Interest, and that they entrench upon no time, which should be employed about them.</p>
            <p>Your vacant and spare hours, you cannot better afford to any thing then to Books; nay, there is a necessity of making such leasure time, if the multiplicity of business press to fast upon you; remembring that of a great Emperour, whose affairs were not only urgent, but full of trouble and care in a new attained Empire,—<hi>Nulla dies sine linea,</hi> not a day must pass without some improvement in your studies.</p>
            <p>Your own choice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will best direct you what books you shall read, and to what science you shall chiefly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45179:56"/>
apply your self, though I think it pedantical, and unworthy and unhandsome for a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or person of Honour to be affectedly excellent in any one, it seems as ridiculous as <hi>Nero's</hi> mad ambition of being counted the chief Fidler and best Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the world.</p>
            <p>History and the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, (I may say) are the most advantagious and proper studies for persons of your quality, the other are fit for Schoolmen, and people that must live by their learning; though a little insight and tast of them, will be no burden to you; your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in them joyned with your Authority may be of good use to your Conntry in awing of pragmatick professors, either of Law or Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:45179:57"/>I do not reckon the Laws of the Kingdome any particular study, for they must be your constant practise, your place many instruct you in them, as to the executory part of them, for the pleading part of them that's below you.</p>
            <p>Keep always an able Scholar for the Languages in your house, besides your chaplain, who may be ready at hand to read to you out of any book, your fancy or judgement shall for the present pitch upon, you will find him to be of great use and service to you, and give him salary accordingly.</p>
            <p>Thinke no cost too much in purchasing rare books; next to that of acquiring good friends I look upon this purchase; but buy them not to lay by, or to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45179:57"/>
grace your library, with the name of such a manuscript, or such a singular piece, but read, revolve him, and lay him up in your memory where he will be far the better Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Read seriously whatever is before you, and reduce and digest it to practise &amp; observation, otherwise it will be <hi>Sysyphus</hi> his labour to be always revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sheets and books at every new occurrence which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Oracle of your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Trust not to your memory, but put all remarkable, notable things you shall meet with in your books <hi>sub salva custodia</hi> of pen and inke, but so alter the property by your own Scholia and Annotations on it,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45179:58"/>
that your memory may speedily recur to the place it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to.</p>
            <p>Review frequently such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandums, and you will find you have made a signal progress and proficiency, in what ever sort of learning you studied.</p>
            <p>After your studies give your mind some relaxation by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exercises, but never use them afer fulness, sleep, or osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, for then they abate much of the recreation and delight they afford after intentness of the mind on any business; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is but a continuation of the dream in the stirring slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of sport and play.</p>
            <p>In the choice of your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, affect none that are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robust and violent, that, instead of remitting, unbending the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45179:58"/>
bow, will break it; but let them be moderate, and withall virile and masculine, such as is riding the great horse, shooting at marks out of crosse-bows, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers or Harquebuse. Tennis is not in use among us, but only in our capital city, but in leiu of that, you have that excellent recreation of Goff-ball, then which truely I do not know a better.</p>
            <p>Do not make a toil of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by over-exercising your self; play not to wearisomness, which may nauseate the recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another time to you. As near as you can, play with compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons your equals, but if they are not at hand, pleasure will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with any play-fellow, nor are you tied there to any strict rules of honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45179:59"/>Let your exercises be design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this end, to settle your mind, to beget you a stomack and appetite, and fit you for other succeeding business.</p>

            <p>BY your recess from all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique business, you will be apt and prone to fall into some supiness and negligence, and indulge your self inordinate pleasures, if you keep not a strict guard over your incli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bent that way to which most men naturally are very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore, that great actions were never found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain delights, and nothing is less generous then pleasure, and nothing more corrupting the seeds of vertue, and that finally it ends in dislike and regret.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:45179:60"/>I acknowledge, that youth the time of delight, is so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient and momentary, and man such a slave to himself, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the troubles that beset him, he will find time, and space to bestow on his voluptuousness; but you have past those heats of youth, and are arrived to a staid age, in which your debordery to vice, would be most shameful and odious.</p>
            <p>But of all pleasures take heed of gaming, that's the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and yet the most bewitching temptation. A vice which hath got footing amain among us, and alienated many fair lands and possessions from ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; you may guess at its goodness by its extraction, born (as I may say) in a dissolute camp,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45179:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where its first stake was the price of life, though contented here with livings and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. You have losses more then enough already, do not therefore put any more to the injurious disposal of fortune, by dicing or carding, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther game. That's the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sign of dissoluteness you can give the world, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim you a vicious as well as bankrupt person.</p>
            <p>Give not your mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or drinking, these <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi> are as bad a Game as the former. This will presently bestialize you, and take away the signature God hath stamp'd upon you. A drunkard!

of Honour, but sink your Estate and all together, in that Deluge of Ebriety. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Twas observed by <hi>Cato,</hi> that none came sober to the destruction or overthrow of that State but only <hi>Caesar;</hi> most certain it is, that none shall ever be called to the maintaining of a State, whose debaucheries have made him uncapable of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself.</p>
            <p>Avoid converse with women of ill report, that you be not fascinated by their beauty or arts, to the lessening of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love you owe your wife; men take it for a felicity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the favour of the company of fine women, but they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to what dangers they oblige themselves, and what burdens they impose upon themselves to the secret ruin
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45179:61"/>
of their Estates, for nothing is so chargeable as an imperious beauty.</p>
            <p>Neither seek nor entertain pleasures when they present themselves in their gaudy bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but with a noble constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy keep your mind fast shut against their charmes and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rements; but find some other diversion, the business whereof may send those vagrants packing. I do much commend Hunting and Hawking, and other field pastime.</p>
            <p>'Tis a dispute and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether to do ill or to do nothing, <hi>Male agere aut nihil agere,</hi> is the worst, and therefore in the next place shun Idleness. The life of man resembles Iron, which being wrought into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and used, becomes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45179:62"/>
bright and shining, else un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought the rust eats and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes it; so is it with noble persons, if they exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and put forth their parts to the service of their Country or in other honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they become conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously glorious; better, industry should wear out and so polish a man, then to lye by of no use and service, and wast away in sloth and idleness.</p>
            <p>Nothing in the universe stands still, the Heavens and those orbes of light are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, and though the Earth move not sphaerically, (as <hi>Copernicus</hi> fancied) yet there is a continual <hi>motus</hi> in that too in her productions: An idle man is a <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious company spoils and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45179:62"/>
ruins all that come near his example. I do not admire to see Gentlemen given over to vicious courses of life, seeing they affect a lazy greatness, without the props of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to support it. 'Tis action that keeps the soul sweet and sound.</p>
            <p>I would have you keep no retainers neer you meerly for show, but onely as many as you can well employ in their several offices; if you do, you must expect no service nor atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, till they have first served their own pleasures, and besides you will have to answer for their lewdnesses.</p>
            <p>You will have such a fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and sent from any business you have been diligent in, as those that stir amongst perfumes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45179:63"/>
and spices, shall when they are gone, have still a grateful odor with them.</p>
            <p>If you grow not better by employing your self, yet this benefit will surely accrue to you, that you both keep your self from being worse, and shall not have time to entertain any sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of evil from without.</p>
            <p>There is a kind of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel waiting upon diligence, that ever carries a Laurel in his hand to crown her; and fortune ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancients was not to be prayed unto, but with the hands in motion. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy was that man of the world, or the enjoyments of it that never did ought, but only lived and died; and it is none of the ordinariest happiness, to be endued with a mind that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45179:63"/>
loves noble and vertuous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</p>
            <p>Life and Honour consist both in action, nor can they find a worse sepulchre then in the sluggards field.

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Considerations of life.</head>
            <p>NO man is so miserable as he whose life is hated by all, and his death desired by as many.</p>
            <p>I have known men that have suffered by fortune unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having the calamity in their view, have been so far transported beyond themselves, that their rage and fury even before justice, hath proved their sufficient defence.</p>
            <p>Our trouble will never be at an end, if we interest our selves in other mens businesses.</p>
            <p>Great deliberation and slow resolution is required in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45179:64"/>
affairs of the world, for as in the trade of navigation, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness of the Sea is decryed and charged with several ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, so is it not otherwise in the affairs of men, where passion and unruly violence have overset many gallant designs and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises.</p>
            <p>In matters in which you seem to have right on your side and justice also, a speedy dispatch is more needful then to languish through the delay of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; on the other side, if you suspect the justice of your cause, the dispute and continuance of the difference is most profitable, and hesitation is better then resolution, the disease better then the cure.</p>
            <p>Be not dejected by knowing you are constrained to begin
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45179:65"/>
with small designs, for great affairs often begin from occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions far disjoyned and remote from the end to which their undertakers aspired, for the beginning of designes reaches not so far as the issue.</p>
            <p>Many small troubles are like letters of a small print they trouble and offend our eyes, without the help of the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of reason and judgement; but great adversities we read presently and more easily.</p>
            <p>Sundry affections and passions of men may conceal themselves, but gladness is of the nature of fire, which manifests it self the more it is stifled and smothered.</p>
            <p>Follow not the fashion of the world, who, rather delight in praising of vertue then in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:45179:65"/>No life is so full of content as to live by ones self, and meddle not with other mens matters.</p>
            <p>It is impossible for any man to live by such a rule of reason, which the fresh occurrences of things, time and custome, may not innovate upon, and withall have informed him so much, that in what he pretended to be well skill'd, he is a meer novice, and that which he esteemed rare and excellent, to be unworthy of his most undervaluing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>Most happy are those, who keeping a constant tenour of life pass through it without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in the managery of business, or else live in a continual quiet and repose in privacy and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:45179:66"/>It is a demonstration of the greatness of spirit and of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to forget that which is lost and cannot be recovered, to give way to thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing the amends other ways.</p>
            <p>The body is pleased and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created only, during the time only of its pleasure, whereas the mind of man foresees future contentments and enjoyments, and suffers not the memories of past felicities to slip her repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Youth giveth a tast and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what may be expected from men; the rest of our time and seasons of our life, are appointed and designed to reap, gather and receive the profits of what was sown in that age.</p>
            <p>'Tis folly to complain of life, more to be troubled at the end
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45179:66"/>
of it, by the reason we ought more to complain of our birth, that made and produced us mortal, then of our death, which will render us immortal.</p>
            <p>To be long or short lived is no more then this, we come either sooner or later (no great choice) to our grave. He is very desirous of life, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to dye when all the world is weary of him.</p>
            <p>'Tis not white or gray hairs, nor wrinckles in the face, beget a present respect for men, but a life honourably passed, conferrs glory and renown, and places the deserved wreaths on their Temples,</p>
            <p>'Tis a strange insatuation in man, that he never takes thought how to l ve vertuously, but is very careful how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45179:67"/>
his life from a loose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that it lies in the power of a man to live well, but it is out of his power to live long.</p>
            <p>A life among Roses, ends in a death among Thornes and Thistles, which proceeds always from those intemperances and disorders our pleasurers sway us to.</p>
            <p>Life is a continual longing, and a continual nauseating, and all humane reason, judgement, and art cannot by any ways remedy it, and who would be a slave to such vicissitudes?</p>
            <p>They are very miserable who have nothing but a heap of years to prove they have lived long, but infinitely unhappy are they who survive their credit and reputation.</p>
            <p>There is no better defence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45179:67"/>
against the injuries of fortune and vexation of life, then death.</p>
            <p>Make your Estate the bound of your desires, and not your desires the limits of your Estate, but the best and equalest boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary to both is death.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Prince.</head>
               <p>THere is nothing in the world which wins more upon the affections of men, or makes a Prince more reverenced and desired then clemency; it is also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that he keep himself in a constant tenour, duely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering that gravity (which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty requires) with debonarity and sweetness; that all accesses to him be easie, that he caresse and esteem, and give kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to all persons of worth,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45179:70"/>
discountenancing the vicious, and casting out flatterers, lyers, and such like, of whom no service may be expected.</p>
               <p>'Tis the excellence of a Prince to use his clemency in pardoning such as offend, and for which offence any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, equitable excuse may be alledged, as also in abating the rigour of the law to such, who transgress not out of custome, and are otherways persons of repute and of vertue, and whose faults are not atrocious; for if he exercise his clemency other then so, without these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he will be rather cruel, and unjust, then merciful; whereas counterpoising it with equity; his justice is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed against it, being reduced and applied to its true cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45179:70"/>It is less dishonourable for a Prince to be vanquish'd by Armes, then by munificence and bounty.</p>
               <p>That revenge which a Prince takes from his sense of a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injury is always esteem'd ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and too severe though never so just.</p>
               <p>'Tis fatal to all Princes, who have swayd Scepters in their minority, to be embroyled with troubles and seditions in the beginnings of their raign, and tormented by some of their subjects desirous of novelty; but when they have attained to age and the full exercise of their power, they have quickly learned to chastise and punish those insolencies and outrages committed against them in their youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:45179:71"/>Ordinarily Princes do not use to love such, who are acquainted, see and reprehend their vices; nevertheless, they cannot so carry them, but that notice will be taken; nor avoid the censure which is become the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk.</p>
               <p>Neighbour Princes must not go see or frequent Campagnia's of war, lest in so doing, they draw upon themselves hatred and envy.</p>
               <p>A Prince must be constant in retaining his good friends and servants, and entertain no sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster opinion of them, without great, just, and apparent cause; to govern himself by his own counsel, and to be master of himself, that is, of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and opinions, by reducing them to sage and mature advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:45179:71"/>The Prince who is too cruel in the punishment of crimes, whether supposed or true, gives occasion of censure, that it is out of covetousness after the condemneds goods, and that he is swayed more by avarice then justice.</p>
               <p>Princes must have a care they suffer not any subject, to grow near them in such grandeur and puissance, which, their boldness may soon make redoubtable to them; but must cut them in the root: for if that greatness once be radicated, it is almost impossible to pull it up without the absolute ruin of those who attempt it, as of late experience <hi>Wallenstein</hi> Duke of <hi>Freid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath often happened that the memory of a good Prince
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45179:72"/>
deceased, hath been of good stead to his vicious successors, degenerating from his vertues, and hath made their government tolerable.</p>
               <p>A Prince ought to be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and careful, that he be not surprized by the ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of craving Courtiers, in pardoning faults which he ought to have punished.</p>
               <p>Princes must not make use of (like private men) artifices and slights, which will soon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their persons and Estates.</p>
               <p>Couragious Princes are most commonly subject to love <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which are oftimes link'd together.</p>
               <p>Kings must sometimes visit the remotest parts of their Country, that their subjects may see by their care of them,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45179:72"/>
that they are truly the Pastors of the people.</p>
               <p>The children of Kings are to be taught to speak low and gravely.</p>
               <p>It is necessary that a great Monarch should be universally knowing. Private men for their direction, content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with one single vertue, but a Soveraign must have all; for who hath more need of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wisdome, then he who deliberates, and resolves, such great and important affairs? who ought to be more just, then he who governs the laws? who ought to be more reserved, then he to whom all is permitted? and who hath more need of courage and valour, then he who protects and defends all?</p>
               <p>Truth never or seldome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45179:73"/>
the ears of Princes without a disguise, or blemish'd by the injury and cunning of those, who would indirectly gain the favour of the Prince without deserving it.</p>
               <p>A Prince ought to take Counsel when it pleases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not at the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if he be not sufficient of himself, he will hardly be well advised if he be not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the conduct of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person, who is solely and entirely to govern him, and whatever good shall be effected by his Counsels ought to be ascribed to the prudence of the Prince, rather then his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>The best Counsel that can be given to Princes, who are well advanced in years and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45179:73"/>
old age, and who must leave unexperienced raw suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, is to treat rather of peace and alliances with their neighbours, then to enterprise a war.</p>
               <p>A King is obliged as diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carefully to keep the goods of his Crown, as a Tutor those of his Pupil.</p>
               <p>A Prince must be punctual in his religion, for nothing so sadly presages his ruin, as his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in that, and therefore his most lively thoughts must be intent on it, and in serving God without hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>It much imports a Prince, to preserve union and friendship with his brothers, as being the dearest part of himself, and as ready to his assistance, as his own eyes, his hands, and his feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:45179:74"/>Princes must beware of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting what's above their strength, or to enterprise any thing in which they are not sure to come off with honour.</p>
               <p>Kingdomes, Treasures, the robe of purple, the Diadem, are not such splendid ornaments of a Prince, as vertue and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for a Prince that knows himself to be but a man will never be proud.</p>
               <p>Those Princes then begin to lose their estates, when they begin to break the ancient laws, manners and customes, under which their subjects have long lived; for Princes must have as much regard to the safety of their subjects, (which consists in the protection of the laws) as of their lives.</p>
               <p>A Prince newly come to the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45179:74"/>
Crown, must especially avoid giving any occasion to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to wish and sigh for the government of his predecessor, as the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tiberius,</hi> after <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Princes send Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, they must chuse such whose manners and qualities are suitable and agreeable to the Court whither they are sent.</p>
               <p>A good Prince does not only do good to the good by making them better, but also to the bad by restraining them from being worse; and the felicity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is the true glory of Kings.</p>
               <p>Princes are mistaken that think to raign over men, without permitting God to rule over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:45179:75"/>The request of a Prince is equal to a commandement.</p>
               <p>Princes sometimes disgrace their favourits for their good, and restore them again for their hurt.</p>
               <p>A Prince who truly is and effectually appears to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is always feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by his subjects, who will never rebell or revolt from him, believing that he is under the particular protection of God.</p>
               <p>Offences which Princes take are like fixed pillars, but their love like the spokes in a running wheel.</p>
               <p>Princes bestow offices, Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites give admission, nature good extraction, parents patrimony, and merits give honour, but w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sedome and discretion come
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45179:75"/>
from God alone, and are not in mans disposing.</p>
               <p>Kings have diverse sorts of thunder as well as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that which tears and rends all that resist it in solid bodies; and that which passes the soft and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The science which we learn by books, is water out of a Cistern, that which we gain by experience is living water, and in its spring; so though among scholastick men we find coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and refined polite spirits, yet Princes take not usually such as they intend for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from the schools though they be knowing and able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; for 'tis business and action that strengthens the brain, while contemplation weakneth it.</p>
               <p>'Tis dishonorable for a great
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45179:76"/>
Prince or Monarch to defend and maintain with his Quill, which his prodecessors have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested with their Lance.</p>
               <p>A Prince that would get much, must pardon much; though 'tis a maxime among Grandees, especially such as are raised from obscurity, that though they be mortal, yet the indignities done them are immortal.</p>
               <p>'Tis folly to solicite tediously great men, for a thing which cannot be obtained.</p>
               <p>The good words of a Prince, accompanied with promises are most forcible and powerful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</p>
               <p>'Twas a precept of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, to his son King <hi>Philip</hi> the second, to exercise himself always in some vertue befitting and convenient
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45179:76"/>
for a King, to the end that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his subjects in admiration of his actions, no time should be given their thoughts to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other affections.</p>
               <p>He must never see the picture of fear any where, but on the shoulders and backs of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>It is not only a sign of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and clemency, but also of a superlative courage, when Kings take no notice of ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mens speeches.</p>
               <p>Nothing can please a good King so much as concord among his subjects, whereas that makes a Tyrant to fear them.</p>
               <p>A Prince must by all means prevent, (flighting not the smallest things) and obviate factions and conspiracies; for as the loudest storms and tempests,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45179:77"/>
are caused by secret exhalations and insensible vapours; so sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and civil wars, begin often from light occasions, and which no man would think could come to such an issue.</p>
               <p>The retinue and train of a Prince, let it be never so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd and ordered, is always very troublesome to the places through which they pass.</p>
               <p>'Tis a true foundation and principal maxime of State, to have an eye, to the growing greatness of a neighbour Prince, and to have always a jealous fear of his power; this makes the friendship between them more firm and durable; for when they have reason alike to dread one another, either of them will but coldly attempt a breach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:45179:77"/>The will of a Prince is to be executed, not interpreted.</p>
               <p>Princes commonly pay flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in their own coin, for they dissemble the vices of the Princes, and they dissemble the lies of the flatterers.</p>
               <p>At the death of a Prince, 'tis discretion to seem neither sorrowful nor glad.</p>
               <p>A Prince cannot be said to be potent, who is not strong at sea, and cannot joyn maritime to his land-forces.</p>
               <p>When mean Princes pass the limits of mediocrity, they are neer past the bounds of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>It is necessary, that a Prince defer nothing to the deliberation of his Council of Estate, which hath not first past the Counsel of his Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:45179:78"/>It is not good to frequent the presence of a Prince whom you have offended; he was well advised, who having provoked his Soveraign, protested, that he would never see his face more but in picture.</p>
               <p>They must be strong and down-right blows, that can bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down a puissant crown.</p>
               <p>The Treaties between Princes should resemble <hi>Drusus</hi> his building or <hi>Templum fidei,</hi> which were constantly clear, nothing of obscurity, nothing feigned, and without any cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>This should be a lesson and Rule for all Princes, that the faults which they suffer and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate in their subjects, are as so many burdens laid upon their own shoulder, and of which they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45179:78"/>
must give account to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of him to whom they as much as other men are subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Great Princes ordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring petty ones into their snares, or to do their affairs at their expence; they embarck themselves in their quarrels, and forget and leave them out in the accomodation of them, and under colour of defence and assistance keep those places for their own, which were put into their hands for gage and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nothing renders a Prince more contemptible then nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardliness, for 'tis odious in all men, but specially in them, who as they are placed in an ampler and more opulent fortune then
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45179:79"/>
other men, ought to be more liberal and free from base, parsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and covetousness.</p>
               <p>The greatness of that Prince is sure and stable, which his subjects know to be as much for them, as above them.</p>
               <p>A Prince mounted on high will have high aspiring thoughts. 'Twas great <hi>Alexanders</hi> speech, that it was proper to good Princes to do well, and to hear ill.</p>
               <p>It were very expedient that a Prince who inherits his Realm, should inherit also the Ministers of State, to aid him in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; those that have been used to the managery of affairs, are of more knowledge then those that newly enter upon the administration, who
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45179:79"/>
being ignorant of the causes and first designes, either spoil all presently, or so turn the course of the policy of the State, that confusion follows.</p>

               <p>IT hath been the glory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that she hath sent forth as many famous warriours into the world as any Nation whatsoever; of later years more especially, in the <hi>Swedish</hi> and Imperial war under that great Captain <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> as also in <hi>Russia, Poland, Pruss,</hi> and most parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Most of those Hero's were persons of very good extraction and noble families; neither should I mislike it if any of you, except my son Lorne should undertake an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable expedition. His ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitudes and affairs at home,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45179:80"/>
will require more of thè gown then the sword: for truly I do count glory so atcheived, to be the more solid and durable, as having that stiffe composition of the steel in it, whereas the other comes by the plume, and is apter to take wing and be gone. Besides, our Name challengeth you into the field, our Ancestors were eminent for the military way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall here lay you down some maxims of approved use, taken from the most experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced caplains, and some of my own observations.</p>
               <p>Courage is an innate moral vertue placed in the mind, whereby it overlooks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns all difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers standing in its way, to the attainment of glory; 'Tis the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45179:81"/>
sublimer of all other vertues, by means whereof they do exert themselves in their greatest strength and beauty.</p>
               <p>Courage is an exposing of the body to the utmost hazards and dangers, and venturing through the most invincible hardships; for of how little concern is that man that cannot elevate himself above common discourse?</p>
               <p>The Laurels and the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are not half so glorious, as the slashings of the Sword, the explosion of the Musquet, and those wounds which men fairly gain in the service of their Princes.</p>
               <p>In a generous soul age enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not Courage.</p>
               <p>Nothing more touches a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man to the quick, then to see the event not answer expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45179:81"/>
and that fortune gives law to vertue.</p>
               <p>Matters of danger, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, are the true objects of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, every vertue is tyed to rules, and bounded with limits, not to be transgressed, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes alter all goodness if they be pitch'd upon. Courage los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its merited honour, if will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness and overguided petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy overbear it; a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reason, without prejudice to a mans honour may justly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand a rash and inconsiderate resolution.</p>
               <p>Nothing in the world can truly be said to be great, if that heart be not so, that despiseth great things.</p>
               <p>'Tis natural for brave spirits, not to hold their tongues in the very face of danger, or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45179:82"/>
or in fear of servitude.</p>
               <p>A great heart neglects cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, fot by how much the more generous it is, the less it regards the lustre and splendor of exteriour things, esteeming it self its own Theatre.</p>
               <p>Bees turn not Droanes, nor courages ever abate or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>By the way, I observe that none have ever arrived to an eminent grandeur, but who began very young.</p>
               <p>There's no place where a man cannot enter into which a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam can penetrate; nothing so constant and so firm, but what a firmer courage can beat and shake it.</p>
               <p>Noble souls are ashamed to see that thing which they cannot remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:45179:82"/>They are to be esteemed valiant and magnanimous, who repell injuries and not those that do them.</p>
               <p>'Tis better to trust in valour, then in policy.</p>

               <p>VVAr is either forraign or intestine, Civil war always hath been, and for ever will be the most destructive and ruinous, more pernicious then all the other evils of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and pestilence, which angry heaven can inflict upon Cities or Kingdoms designed for utter ruin; so passionately <hi>Livy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses its unnatural fury.</p>
               <p>Men enterprise a war, either relying on the strength and assistance of God, or else upon humane power; when men therefore are provided with neither of these, when trial is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45179:83"/>
made, captivity, or some such misfortune is the conclusion, nor are the best armed both these ways, sure of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>In a war that's just, (for I allow no other,) the ancient men ought to counsel, and the young to execute.</p>
               <p>To do nothing out of course or without orders in war, is of very ill consequence; for while time is spent in waiting for them, <hi>occasio res gerendae perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> many noble designs are lost; the reason is, because directions being to be had at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they usually come too late for execution; and 'tis the nature of war to produce every moment some unlook'd for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</p>
               <p>'Tis better to attain if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45179:84"/>
by peace the half of our demands, then by war the whole, for a war is sooner kindled then extinguished.</p>
               <p>War proceeds from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and malice of men, but the success of it depends on the good will of God.</p>
               <p>In domestique broils, the greatest victory is never to be victorious, rather to level de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by a peace then mount to them by a conquest.</p>
               <p>By prevention, revulsion and diversion, oftentimes men have gained by the war, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confidence makes men losers.</p>
               <p>A Civil war is nothing but the flux and reflux of conquests and losses.</p>
               <p>In war it's punishable with death to hold a place, which is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45179:84"/>
not cenable by the military rules, else every hen roost would make an army stay in its march.</p>
               <p>In a fair war, a man may see from whom to guard himself, but in a slubbered peace, a man knows not in whom to trust.</p>
               <p>When the heart of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery fails, all commands are to no purpose; for fear casts a mist over their memory, and the practique without courage is to no purpose in times of necessity.</p>
               <p>The events of war are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, small skirmishes end in a set battle, which is fought often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more out of eagerness and heat of blood, then prudence.</p>
               <p>Mischief in the beginning of a civil war, though not well supported at first, grows higher like the luxuriant branches of a fruit-bearing tree; but if a good
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45179:85"/>
Patriot like a Gardner put in his pruning hook, the suckers are soon cut off, and the stock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire.</p>
               <p>All manner of stratagems are lawful in war, though not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable in State-policy. The sight and shew of new engines of war to the besieged, hath been the only cause of their surrender.</p>
               <p>Money is the sinew of the war, but without the fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a large treasure will soon shrink.</p>

               <p>VVHo commands in any place, ought to put a sentinel upon his mouth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unadvised slip from him; &amp; bear such a countenance, that the fair out-side may varnish his severity within. Men that are cholerick, though they may be apt for learning, yet are not fit to command.</p>
               <p>Negligence is no point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse in a governour of a strong important place, for if a truce or (may be) a peace be concluded on, yet he ought to consider that he is not concerned in that peace, having in his custody that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45179:86"/>
which is well worth the breaking of it.</p>
               <p>Never think of governing others, till you have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your self.</p>
               <p>To command and obey that which is commanded, is the most exquisitest art; these two keep a City free from sedition, and preserve concord.</p>
               <p>Diversity of commands is dangerous, for that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them cannot be sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, sor when one sees his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel or command is not followed, he grows regardless, and may be out of emulation is the cause of hindring the others (though better) counsel to take effect.</p>
               <p>It is convenient and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that those who command, keep a distance from their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to beget in them a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45179:86"/>
and awe towards him.</p>
               <p>Merit is the only lawful ascent to places of trust, and he who thinks to climbe without it, may at the return miss the steps, and precipitate himself.</p>

               <p>BY the bloody sword victory is obtained in an hour, but to keep up the reputation of it is matter of trouble through the whole life.</p>
               <p>There is no victory so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that which is got with the least effusion of blood on the conquerors side, and which conserves the honour and justice of his cause.</p>
               <p>He only accounts himself vanquished, who is satisfied that neither stratagem, nor treachery, nor fortune, had any thing to do in his overthrow, but only clear valour in a noble and just war.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:45179:87"/>He that hath vanquished his enemies, may make no difficulty of subduing himself.</p>
               <p>It is of no great moment, with what provisions or furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of men and armes a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is atchieved, for that conquer rour is more renowned, who by a handful of men attain'd it, being succoured and seconded by his valour alone.</p>
               <p>When the original is lost, men must be content with the copy; and to take all in good part what the conqueror pleaseth without replying a word.</p>

               <p>FOrtune hath more force then reason in the decision of war, yet it can do little harm to us, so long as it takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our honour.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to know how to remove the machine of a great design, nnless we know also when to let it alone, and to comply with time and necessity.</p>
               <p>'Tis God that dissipates the devices of the Nations, and brings to nothing the designs of the people; the King is not saved by the strength of his arms, nor shall the mighty man escape by his great power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:45179:89"/>As the understanding of a man is not always in vigour, nor the body in health, so many times men enterprizing great things, fall and hazard themseves, lose their hopes and designs, and sometimes their lives.</p>
               <p>Idleness and luxury have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued more armes, then ever were vanquished by plain force: what a fatal intemperance and sloth was that of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> after the battle at <hi>Cannae,</hi> to suffer the <hi>Romans</hi> to make head again?</p>
               <p>Mature deliberation ought ever to be used; but when armes are to determine, speedy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is best: because no delay in that enterprise is fit, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be commended before it be ended, and victory has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:45179:89"/>Souldiers must be encouraged in all fortunes to stand resolved; that which was the enemies good luck to day, to morrow may be theirs; they must not be daunted with any passed misadventure, ever attending a time and opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which commonly cometh to pass where mens minds are united; for common danger must be repelled with union and concord.</p>
               <p>Some conquests are of such quality, as albeit a victorious Captain merit triumphal honour, yet a modest refusal becomes his greatest glory; as some noble <hi>Romans</hi> did out of bravery of mind before the Emperours, and some for the envy of it, did forbear it afterwards.</p>
               <p>To enter into needless dangers

was ever accounted madness, yet in times of extreme peril and apparent distress, bold and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous attempts are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est security, and are usually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with good events.</p>

            <p>GReat personages may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taint or crime, but not free from suspition; the first is in their own power, the second depends in the ill will of others.</p>
            <p>Toleration is the cause of many evils, and renders diseases or distempers in the State, more strong and powerful then any remedies.</p>
            <p>It most commonly proves true, that a Council composed of divers Nations, (such as was projected by <hi>Cromwell</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> during his usurpation, in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45179:91"/>
constituting a representative of three Kingdomes in one body,) are of different judgments and tempers, though never so well pack'd together: But yet that is a far worse diversity, which proceeds from the variety of particular passions, that corrupt the fountain and source from whence the advice and counsel of publique affairs is to be drawn.</p>
            <p>'Tis a received maxime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong conspirators, not to have any thing pass between them in writing, but orally and by word of much.</p>
            <p>Men would seem to be very jealous of their honour, when for words spoken in prejudice or diminution of it, they commence fuits and processes against the speakers of them, but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45179:91"/>
so below agenerous spirit, and which argues more weakness of mind, then that they cannot contemn words that are vain and uttered in hast. I can set my approbation to this, that I never knew any man that got advantage by so doing.</p>
            <p>For men who have high thoughts and low fortunes, 'tis better to live privately and meanly in a village, then beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly and disrespectedly at Court.</p>
            <p>Men of vertue and honour steer a course contrary to that of the world, as do the planets above.</p>
            <p>Nothing is so sociable or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable as man, the one is caused by nature, the other by vice.</p>
            <p>The pleasure or grief of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45179:92"/>
things takes up the room in our thoughts of what is past, or what is to come, so infirm is the most sublimate humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son subjected to the attempts of fortune.</p>
            <p>Prudence ought to begin all affairs, for that repentance is to no purpose in the end, wisedome rather prepares then repairs. Wise men walk not always in the same way, not keep always the same pace, they advise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the occurrence of affairs, and vary according to the alterations of time and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
            <p>It belongs to prudent men to foresee that adversity and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes come not before their time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>then all the wisedome of the world cannot stay them and it appertains to valiant men,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45179:92"/>
when they are come, to bear them couragiously.</p>
            <p>Prudence without vertue, is rather subtilty and malice, yea is quite another thing then pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Nothing ought to be done violently or precipitantly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, you must wind up the strings gently to make them tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Musick sounds a great deal sweeter, when they are looser, then when straighter wound.</p>
            <p>He is sure not to fail, who has vertue for his guide, and fortune for his companion; but he that travails such away, must begin young, else he will come late to his journeys end.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates from truth, is in the ready way to all sorts of mischief, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45179:93"/>
it hath often been seen, that such who have laid their hopes in lying and dissembling to others, have deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to their own ruin.</p>
            <p>The most absolute perfection of men cannot be resembled better then to a Pomegranate, which is never without some rotten kernels.</p>
            <p>Nothing more grieves sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to pay Subsidies and Taxes, then when they see their money wasted or ill employed, who otherwise where they pay a penny would willingly give a crown, for they take notice that when once the door is opened to impositions, under pretence of continuing but so long time, it is seldome shut again, this is true in all tyrannical or absolute governments.</p>

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:45179:93"/>Nothing appeases or quels a sedition sooner then the presence of the Prince, nor ought he for any fear or cause whatsoever absent or hide himself, our late troubles speak this too evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>It is an ill practise, that they who have been the greatest sticklers in state troubles and commotions, should be the greatest gainers by the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of them.</p>
            <p>Seditions whose originals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be traced, are always the most dangerous.</p>
            <p>The due correction of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous people brought again to obedience, ought to be regulated by examples and means accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the time, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and humour of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the Laws must give place to policy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:45179:94"/>Always observe, that a paltry ordinary fellow in a great sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is commonly the chief, and such an one is harder to be spoken or treated with, then any Prince or General.</p>
            <p>In a civil war betwixt subjects of the same Prince, misery fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the vanquished, cruelty and impiety, haunts the conquerors, ruin and destruction both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>That people can never be at ease, whose Prince is indebted.</p>
            <p>Let this be a lesson to the people to contain themselves within the bounds of their duty, for by engaging in the quarrels of the great ones, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly plunged in the mire, while their leaders trample over them to security.</p>
            <p>Nothing is impossible or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasible,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45179:94"/>
for an enslaved people to do against Tyrants and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>He that keeps himself strictly to the observation of the Divine Laws, cannot erre in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and he that is a good Servant of God, will never be an ill Subject to his Prince.</p>
            <p>Such a Prince, and such a People, I pray God for ever to maintain and continue in these Nations.</p>
