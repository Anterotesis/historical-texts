         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

opportunity of Congratulating with the

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving altered the Method of this
Treatise, and made considerable
Additions to it, it may justly be
expected that I should give some Account
thereof to the Reader. In the Preface to the
former Edition, I acquainted him, that I had
taken Notice of five Matters of Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
1. That the World was formed out of
a <hi>Chaos,</hi> by the Divine Wisdom and Power.
2. That there was an universal Flood of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in which all Mankind perished, excepting
some few which were saved in an Ark or Ship.
3. That the World shall one day be destroyed
by Fire. 4. That there is a Heaven and a Hell,
an <hi>Elysium</hi> and a <hi>Tartarus,</hi> the one to reward
good Men, and other to punish wicked,
and both eternal. 5. That bloody Sacrifices
were to be offered for the Expiation of Sin.
And that of four of them I had occasion to
treat in this Book; of two, that is to say, of
<pb facs="tcp:96662:5"/>
the Dissolution of the World by Fire, and the
Eternal State that was to succeed (in reference
to Man) either in Heaven or Hell, more
directly: of the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Primitive <hi>Chaos</hi> and Creation, and the
General Deluge, occasionally and by way
of digression, at the request of some Friends.
But now this Treatise coming to a second
Impression, I thought it more convenient to
make these several Discourses upon these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
substantial Parts of my Work, and to
dispose them according to the priority and
posteriority of their Subjects, in order of time,
beginning with the Primitive <hi>Chaos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning these Traditions, it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
what the Original of them was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were of Divine Revelation, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
invention. In answer whereto,</p>
            <p>As to the Second, That there was once a
General Deluge, whereby this whole sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
World was drown'd, and all Animals,
both Man and Beast destroyed, excepting only
such as were preserved in an Ark; it being
matter of Fact, and seen and felt by <hi>Noah,</hi>
and his Sons, there can be no doubt of the
Original of that.</p>
            <p>The First, concerning the <hi>Chaos</hi> and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, if it were not ancienter

               </gap>re, it is likely it had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:96662:9"/>
the <hi>Chaos</hi> from the second Verse, <hi>And the
earth was without form and void, and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.</hi> But if it were
more ancient, it must still in all likelihood be
Divinely revealed, because Man being created
last, and brought into a World already filled
and furnished: And God being an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and also a Free Agent, who could as well
have created the World in a moment, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as successively, it was impossible for
Man by reason to determine, which way he
made choice of.</p>
            <p>The Third, Concerning the future Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Destruction of the World by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Conflagration,</hi> there being nothing in
Nature that can demonstrate the necessity of
it: and a second Inundation and Submersion
by Water, being in the Course of Nature an
hundred times more probable, as I have shewn
in the ensuing Discourses: And therefore we
see God Almighty to secure Man against the
apprehension and dread of a second Deluge,
made a Covenant with him, to give him a
visible Sign in confirmation of it, never to
destroy the World so again: And the Ancients
who relate this Tradition, deivering it as an
Oracle or Decree of Fate. <hi>Ovid Metamorph. 1.
Esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur affore tempus,
&amp;c.</hi> was likewise probable of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96662:10"/>
The Fourth, That there shall be a Future
State, wherein Men shall be punished or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
accordingly as they have done ill or
well in this Life, and that State Eternal: thô
the first part may be demonstrated from the
Justice and Goodness of God, because there
being an unequal distribution of Good and
Evil in this Life, there must be a time to set
things streight in another World; yet it being
so difficult to Human Reason, to reconcile the
Eternity of Punishments, with the Justice and
Goodness of God, this second part of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had need be well back'd by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to make it credible and current among
Men.</p>
            <p>As for the Last, tho' I meddle not with it
in this Treatise, yet I will take leave to say
so much concerning it, That I think those
who held Sacrificing to have been a positive
Command of God, and to have had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
from Divine Institution, have the better
reason on their side. For that it is no eternal
and indispensable Law of Nature, is clear, in
that our Saviour abolished it. And many of
the Ancient Fathers look upon Sacrificing as
so unreasonable a Service, that therefore they
thought God commanded it not to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Patriarchs; and though he did command
it to the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet he did it only in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
to their weakness because they had
<pb facs="tcp:96662:10"/>
been used to such Services, and also the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
round about them, to restrain them from
Idolatry, and Sacrificing to strange Gods,

alledge of the Institution of Sacrifices or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
them to the <hi>Iews</hi> satisfie, whatever
truth there may be in it: For it is clear, that
the main end and design of God in institutiing
of them, was for Types and Adumbrations of
that great Sacrifice of Christ to be offered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross for the expiation of sin: and
consequently it is probable, that those also
that were offered by the Ancient Patriarchs
before the Law, had their Original from some
Divine Command or Revelation, and the like

reason of their Institution, in reference to
Christ.</p>

that Men as they are mutable, so they
love change, and affect variety of Authors as
well as Books. Satiety even of the best things
is apt to creep upon us. He that writes much,
let him write never so well, shall experience,
that has last Books, though nothing inferiour
to his first, will not find equal acceptance. But

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Being too hasty in huddling up,

I cannot wholly acquit my self of blame.
I know well, that the longer a Book lies by
me, the perfecter it becomes. Something
occurs every day in Reading or Thinking,
either to add, or to correct and alter for the
better. But should I defer the Edition till the
Work were absolutely perfect, I might wait
all my Life-time, and leave it to be published
by my Executors. Now my Age minding
me of the approach of Death; and Posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Pieces generally proving inferiour to
those put out by the Authors in their Life-time,
I need no other excuse for my hast in
publishing what I write. Yet I shall further
add in extenuation of the fault, if it be one,
that however hasty and precipitate I am in
writing, my Books are but small, so that if
they be worthless, the Purchase is not great,
nor the Expence of Time wasted in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of them very considerable. Yet is not
the worth of a Book always answerable to
its bulk. But on the contrary, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Place this Half-sheet next after p. 132 before the 3 Plates.</p>
            <p>REflecting upon the length of this Discourse
concerning the Original of these Bodies,
I am suspicious that the vulgar and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Reader will be ready to demand, <hi>What
needs all this ado? To what purpose so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words about so trivial a Subject? What
reference hath the consideration of Shells and
Bones of Fishes petrified to Divinity?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall in a few words shew the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of this Disquisition concerning formed
Stones, and the Determination of their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>1st,</hi> If we adhere to their Opinions who
hold them to have been original Productions
of Nature, in imitation only of the Shells and
Bones of Fishes: We put a Weapon into the
Atheists hands, affording him a strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove that even Animals themselves
are casual Productions, and not the effects of
Counsel or Design. For to what end are these
Bodies curiously figured and adorned? if for
no other but to exhibit such a Form, for the
Ornament of the Vniverse, or to gratifie the
Curiosity of Man; these are but general ends,
whereas the parts of every Species of Body are
formed and fitted to the particular Vses and
Conveniences of that Body. And if Nature
would delineate or imprint Figures upon Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
only to be Spectacles to Man, one would
think it should not have made choice of those
<pb facs="tcp:96662:6"/>
of the Shells and Bones of Fishes, but rather
of such as were absolutely new and different
from any frequently seen or belonging to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
which serve rather to amuse than delight
him. But 2ly, we find in the Earth not only
Stones formed in imitation of Shells; but real
Shells, Teeth and Bones of Fishes, or Bodies so
like them, that they are not to be distinguished
by Figure, Texture, Colour, Weight, or any
other Accident. Now what greater Argument
can the Atheist desire to prove, that the Shells
of Fishes were never designed by any provident
Efficient for their Defence, or their Bones for
the sustaining of their Bodies, but that the Fish
and Shell containing it, and the Bones sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, did casually concur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that there
should be real Shells produced without any Fish
in them, and that in dry places where no Fish
ever did or could breed, or indeed live, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Fish-bones, where there never was nor could
be any Fish.</p>
            <p>Doth it not than concern a Divine to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this Objection against the Bodies
of Animals being the effects of Counsel and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and provided with an answer to it. For
my part I must needs confess that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
weighs so with me, whether from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Prolepsis</hi> my self, and I think most other
Men have of the Prudence of Nature in all its
Operations, or from mine own observing that in
all other things, it acts for ends, that it is alone
<pb facs="tcp:96662:6"/>
sufficient to preponderate all the Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the contrary Opinions, though I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them to be of great force and hard to be
answered, and to incline or rather constrain me
to allow that these Bodies were either real
Bones and Shells of Fishes, or owe their Figure
to them. I cannot (to use the Words of <hi>F. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna</hi>)
prevail with my self to believe, that
Nature ever made Teeth without a Iaw, or Shells
without an Animal Inhabitant, or single Bones,
no not in their own proper Element, much less
in a strange one, Who even of the Vulgar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
any considerable part of an Animal
which he sees not the use of, is not apt present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ask what it serves for, as by that innate
<hi>Prolepsis</hi> I mentioned before, presuming it was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot made in vain, but for some end and use. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any of us should find in the Earth the
compleat <hi>Skeleton</hi> of a Man, he must be as cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dulous
as the Atheist, if he could believe that
it grew there of it self, and never had relation
to any Man's Body. Why then should we tbink
that the entire <hi>Skeletons</hi> of Fishes found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Earth, had no other Original? nor
ever were any part of living Fishes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> If we chuse and embrace the contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That these Bodies were the real
Shells and Bones of Fishes, or owe their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
to them, we shall find that this also is urged
with many and almost unsuperable Difficulties,
the principal of which I have already produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb facs="tcp:96662:7"/>
and shall here omit, repeating only two
that refer to Divinity.</p>
            <p>1. These Bodies being found dispersed all
over the Earth, they of the contrary Opinion
demand how they come there? If it be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That they were brought in by the general
Deluge; in contradiction thereto, they argue
thus. If these Stones were found scattered sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and indifferently all the Earth over, there
might be indeed some reason to imagine that
they were brought in by the Floud; but being
found in some particular places only, either ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thick in great Beds of Sand and Gravel,
or amassed together in huge Lumps, by a stony
Cement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such Beds must in all likelihood have been
the effect of those Animals breeding there for
a considerable time, whereas the Floud conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
upon the Earth but ten Months, during
half which time it's not likely that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were covered; and yet there are found of
these Bodies upon very high Mountains, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the <hi>Appenine</hi> and <hi>Alps</hi> themselves.
Whence they conclude, that they were neither
brought in by the Floud, nor bred during the
Floud, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t some other way produced. For if
they were the Shells of Fishes, or their Bones,
the Water must needs have covered the whole
Earth, even the Mountains themselves for a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch longer time than is consistent with the
Scripture-History of the Floud, and therefore
we must seek some other original of these Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96662:7"/>
If we stick to the Letter of the Scripture-History
of the Creation, that the Creation of
Fishes succeeded the Separation of Land and
Sea, and that the six days wherein the World
was created, were six natural Days and no more,
it is very difficult to return a satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this Objection: I shall therefore only
add a conjecture of my own, and that is, That
possibly at the first Creation, the whole Earth
was not all at once uncovered, but only those
parts whereabout <hi>Adam</hi> and the other Animals
were created, and the rest gradually after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
perchance not in many Years; during
which time these Shell-fish might breed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
all the Sea over, the bottom whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elevated and made dry Land, the Beds of
Shell-fish, must necessarily be raised together
with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2.</hi> It will hence follow that many Species of
Animals have been lost out of the World, which
Philosophers and Divines are unwilling to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
esteeming the Destruction of any one <hi>Species</hi>
a dismembring of the Vniverse, and rendring
the World imperfect. Whereas they think the
Divine Providence is especially concerned and
solicitous to secure and preserve the Works of
the Creation. And truly so it is, as appears,
in that it was so careful to lodge all Land-Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
in the Ark at the time of the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
and in that of all Animals recorded in
Natural Histories, we cannot say that there
<pb facs="tcp:96662:8"/>
hath been any one Species lost, no not of the
most infirm and most exposed to injury and
ravine. Moreover it is likely, that as there
neither is nor can be any new Species of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
produced, all proceeding from Seeds at first
created; so Providence without which one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Sparrow falls not to the Ground, doth
in that manner watch over all that are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that an entire Species shall not be lost or
destroyed by any Accident. Now I say, if these
Bodies were sometimes the Shells and Bones of
Fish, it will thence follow, that many <hi>Species</hi>
have been lost out of the World, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
those <hi>Ophiomorphous</hi> ones, whose Shells
are now called <hi>Cornua Ammonis,</hi> of which
there are many Species, none whereof at this
day, appear in our or other Seas, so far as I
have hitherto seen, heard or read. To which I
have nothing to reply, but that there may be
some of them remaining some where or other in
the Seas, though as yet they have not come to
my Knowledge. For though they may have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
or by some Accident been destroyed out
of our Seas, yet the Race of them may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and continued still in others. So though
Wolves and Bevers, which we are well assured
were sometimes native of <hi>England,</hi> have been
here utterly destroyed and extirpated out of this
Island, yet there remain plenty of them still in
other Countrys.</p>
            <p>By what hath been said concerning the nature
<pb facs="tcp:96662:8"/>
and original of Stones, I hope it may appear,
that this is no idle and unnecessary Discourse,
but very momentous and important; and this
Subject, as mean as it seems, worthy the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration of Christian Philosophers
and Divines; concerning which, though I have
spent many thoughts, yet can I not fully satisfie
my self, much less then am I likely to satisfie
others.</p>
            <p>But I promise my self and them more full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
shortly from the Labours of those who
are more conversant and better acquainted with
these Bodies than I, who have been more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
in searching them out, and happy in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
them, who have been more curious and
diligent in considering and comparing them, more
critical and exact in observing and noting their
nature, texture, figure, parts, places, differences,
and other accidents, than my self, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

1. That it seems impossible, that the Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the first Animals should actually include the
innumerable Myriads of those that may proceed
from them in so many Generations as have been, and
shall be to the end of the World: This shewn not to

Members of Animals already formed do pre exist in

as to produce a Calve's-head, or Dog's-face, or the
like monstrous Members. Several Answers to thus

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">That the Creation of the World out of
a Chaos is not repugnant to the
Holy Scripture.</head>
               <p>THis Opinion of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> if soberly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
not as self-existent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced,
but in the first place created by
God, and preceding other Beings, which
were made out of it, is not, so far as I can
discern, any way repugnant to the Holy
Scripture, but on the contrary rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
and agreeable thereto. For <hi>Moses</hi> in
the History and Description of the Creation
in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> saith not that
God created all things in an instant in their
full state and perfection, but that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
gradually and in order, from more
imperfect to more perfect Beings, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the Earth, that is, the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous
Globe, which was made <hi>tohu vabohu,</hi>
without form and void, the Waters cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96662:20"/>
the face of the Land, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
separated from the Land, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together into one place. Then he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the Land and Water first Plants,
and then Animals, Fishes, Birds, Beasts, in
Order, and last of all formed the Body of
Man of the Dust of the Earth.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is no particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of the Creation of Metals, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass
and other Fossils, they must be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the word <hi>Earth,</hi> as the Water it
self also is in the second Verse of this first
Chapter.</p>
               <p>It seems therefore to me consonant to the
Scripture, That God Almighty did at first
create the Earth or Terraqueous Globe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in its self the Principles of all simple
inanimate Bodies, or the minute and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
indivisible Particles of which they were
compounded, of various but a determinate
number of Figures, and perchance of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
magnitudes; and these variously and
confusedly commixed, as though they had
been carelesly shaken and shuffled together;
yet not so, but that there was order obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the most Wise Creator in the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. And not only so, but that the
same Omnipotent Deity did create also the
Seeds or Seminal Principles of all Animate
Bodies, both Vegetative and Sensitive; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96662:20"/>
disperst them, at least the Vegetative, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the superficial part of the Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the Notion of such an Earth as
this is, the Primitive Patriarchs of the World
delivered to their Posterity, who, by degrees
annexing something of sabulous to it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon it the name of <hi>Chaos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next work of the Divine Power and
Wisdom was the separation of the Water
from the dry Land, and raising up of the
Mountains, of which I shall treat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>To which follows the giving to both Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
a power of hatching, as I may so say,
or quickening and bringing to perfection the
Seeds they contained; first the more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as Herbs and Trees; then the more
perfect, Fish, Fowl, Four-footed Beasts, and
creeping Things or Infects. Which may be
the meaning of those Commands of God,
which were operative and effectual, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to the Earth and Water a power
to produce what he commanded them, <hi>Gen.
1. 11. Let the Earth bring forth Grass,</hi> &amp;c.
and <hi>v. 20. Let the waters bring forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
the moving creature that hath life, and
fowl that may fly above the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. And
v. 24. <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living
creature after his kind, cattel and creeping
thing, and beast of the Earth after his kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96662:21"/>
So the Earth was at first cloathed with all
sorts of Herbs and Trees; and both Earth
and Water furnished with Inhabitants. And
this the Ancients understood by their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But whether out of prae-existing Seeds, as
I suppose, or not, certain it is that God at
that time did give an extraordinary and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
power to the Land and Water of
producing Vegetables and Animals: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there were as many of every kind
brought forth as there were Seeds created
at first; or as many as it seemed good to
the Divine Creator to produce without
Seed; there remained no further ability in
those Elements to bring forth any more;
but all the succeeding owe their original to
Seed; God having given to every <hi>Species</hi> a
power to generate or propagate its like.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the separating the Land and Water,
and raising up the Mountains.</head>
               <p>SUpposing that God Almighty did at first
create the Terrestrial Globe, partly of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and more ponderous, partly of fluid and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96662:21"/>
lighter parts; the solid and ponderous must
needs naturally subside, the fluid and lighter
get above. Now that there were such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts created, is clear, and therefore it
is reasonable to think that the Waters at first
should stand above and cover the Earth:
and that they did so, seems evident to me
from the testimony of the Scripture. For
in the History of the Creation in the first
Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse 2. it is said, That
<hi>the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters,</hi> intimating that the Waters were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost.
<hi>And God said,</hi> verse 9. <hi>let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
under the Heaven be gathered together
into one place, and let the dry land appear.</hi>
Whence, I think, it is manifest to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
Reader, That before that time the
Land was covered with water. Especially
if we add the testimony of the holy <hi>Psalmist,
Psalm 104.</hi> vers. 6. &amp; 9. which is as it were
a comment upon this place of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where
speaking of the Earth at the Creation, he
saith, <hi>Thou coveredst it with the deep as with
a garment; the waters stood above the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ...
and ver. 9. <hi>That they turn not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to cover the Earth.</hi> And that this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together of waters was not into any
subterraneous Abyss, seems likewise clear
from the Text. For it is said, That God
called this Collection of waters <hi>Seas,</hi> as if it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96662:22"/>
been on purpose to prevent such a mistake.</p>
               <p>Whether this separation of the Land and
Water, and gathering the waters together
into one place, were done by the immediate
application and agency of God's Almighty
Power, or by the intervention and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality
of second Causes, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
It might possibly be effected by the
same Causes that Earthquakes are, <hi>viz.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Fires and <hi>Flatuses.</hi> We see what
incredible effects the Accension of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hath: it rends Rocks, and blows up the
most ponderous and solid Walls, Towers and
Edifices, so that its force is almost irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Why then might not such a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
quantity of such Materials set on
fire together raise up the Mountains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
how great and ponderous soever they
be, yea the whole Superficies of the dry Land
(for it must all be elevated) above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
And truly to me the Psalmist seems to
intimate this Cause, <hi>Psalm 104. 7.</hi> For after
he had said, <hi>The waters stood above the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi>
he adds, <hi>At thy rebuke they fled, at
the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</hi>
Now we know that an Earthquake is but a
subterraneous Thunder, and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follows, <hi>The mountains ascend, the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
descend,</hi> &amp;c. If there might be a high
Hill raised up near the City <hi>Troezen,</hi> out of

beside the Gulph of <hi>Baiae,</hi> which I my self
have view'd and been upon. It is by the
Natives called <hi>Monte di cenere,</hi> and was raised
by an Earthquake <hi>Sept. 29. 1538.</hi> of about
one hundred foot perpendicular altitude;
though some make it much higher: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Stephanus Pighius</hi> it is a Mile ascent
to the top, and four Miles round at the foot:
We indeed judged it not near so great. The
People say it bears nothing; nothing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
use or profit I suppose they mean: else I
am sure there grows <hi>Heath, Myrtle, Mastick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi>
and other Shrubs upon it. It is a
spungy kind of Earth, and makes a great
sound under a Man's feet that stamps upon
it. The same Earthquake threw up so much
Earth. Stones and Ashes as quite filled up the
<hi>lacus Lucrinus,</hi> so that there is nothing left
of it now, but a fenny Meadow. If such
Hills, I say, as these may be, and have been
elevated by subterraneous Wild-fire, <hi>Flatus</hi>
or Earthquakes, <hi>Si parvis liceat componere
magna,</hi> if we may compare great things with
small, why might not the greatest and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mountains in the World be raised up in
like manner by a subterraneous <hi>Flatus</hi> or
Wild-fire, of quantity and force sufficient
to work such an effect, that is, that bears as
great a proportion to the superincumbent
weight and bulk to be elevated, as those
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96662:23"/>
under these smaller Hills did to theirs?</p>
               <p>But we cannot doubt this may be done,
when we are well assured that the like hath
been done. For the greatest and highest
Ridge of Mountains in the World, the <hi>Andes</hi>
of <hi>Peru,</hi> have been for some hundreds of
Leagues in length violently shaken, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that happened in the year 1646. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Arca Noae,</hi> from the
Letters of the Jesuits. And <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of

more then all this, we read that in the time
of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the first, there
was an Earthquake that shook all the known
World. Whilst this Innovator, [that is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi>]
was yet alive (saith <hi>Amm. Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

Earthquakes suddenly raged all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the like whereto neither Fables nor true
Antiquities ever acquaint us with, or make
mention of. For soon after break of day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
smart and violent flashes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
preceding, the stable and ponderous
mass of the whole Earth was shaken and
made to tremble; and the Sea with revolved
waves was driven backwards, and forced so
far to recede, that the bottom of the great
Deeps and Gulfs being discovered, multiform
Species of Fishes forsaken by the water were
seen lying on the Mud: and those vast Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
and Mountains which the primigenial
Nature had sunk deep and concealed under
immense waters (as we had reason to think)
saw the Sun beams. Wherefore many Ships
resting upon the dry ground, the Mariners
wandring carelesly up and down through
the small reliques of the waters, that they
might gather up Fishes and other things with
their hands; The Sea-waves, being as it
were grieved with their repulse, rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and making their way backward
through the fervid Shallows, violently dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the Islands and extended Shores
of the Continents, threw down and levelled
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96662:24"/>
numerable Edifices in Cities and where else
they were found. Where see more of the
effects of it. Of this Earthquake we find
mention also in <hi>Zosimus</hi> and <hi>Orosius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this story be true, as certainly it is, we
have no reason to doubt of the possibility of
the Dry land being thus raised at first by
subterraneous Fire. And with us agrees
the learned</hi> Thomas Lydyat <hi>in his</hi> Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Disquisition concerning the origine of
Fountains, <hi>&amp;c. being of opinion not only
that it might be so, but that it was so. I
shall give you his own words,</hi> Vbi aliud
quoque summae admirationis plenum Terrae mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs
atque Ignis subterranei effectum notandum
venit, montium sci. generatio. <hi>And then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mentioned the raising up Islands in the
Sea by subterraneous Fires, he proceeds
thus,</hi> Quomodo etiam omnes montes qui uspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
sunt, unà cum ipsis terris Continentibus
(quae nihil aliud sunt quàm sparsi in Oceano
majores montes sive insulae) in mundi primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis,
(quando nimirum ignis quo de loquimur,

<hi>That is,</hi> After which manner also
all the Mountains in the World, together with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96662:25"/>
the Continents themselves, (which are nothing
else but great Mountains or Islands scattered
in the Ocean) in the beginning of the World,
when the fire of which we speak was first kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the bowels of the Earth by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator, were (as it is most highly
probable) originally raised up: the Sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
into the cavities and depressed places,
and by the most wise counsel of the supreme
Deity leaving room for terrestrial Animals to
inhabit. <hi>Then which nothing can be said
more consonant to what we have written:
And I was highly pleased and satisfied to
find such Philosophy in so learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in confirmation of this Doctrine,</hi>
Strabo <hi>himself, though he had not, nor could
have any knowledge at all of the prodigious
effects of Gunpowder, yet makes no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to affirm the possibility of raising up
as well the Continents and Mountains as the
Islands by Earthquakes and subterraneous
Fires; toward the latter end of the first
Book of his Geography discoursing thus:</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96662:25"/>
                  <hi>That is,</hi> For Earthquakes
and Eruptions of <hi>Flatus</hi> [Blasts] or sudden tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of the submarine Earth, or bottom of the
Sea, may swell and elevate the Sea; so that not
only small lumps or masses of matter, but even
Islands may be raised up in the midst of it.
Neither if small Islands can be raised, may not
great ones too; neither may Islands be heaved
up, and not Continents as well. And <hi>Sicily</hi>
may as well be thought to have been thrown up
out of the Deep by the force of the <hi>Aetnaean</hi>
fire, and sticking together to have continued
above water, as to have been a piece broken
off from <hi>Italy. And the like may be said of
the Islands of</hi> Lipara <hi>and</hi> Pithecusae.</p>
               <p>Of the possibity of doing it we need not
doubt, when we have sufficient proof of the
thing done in lesser Islands thus heaved up
in the midst of the Sea, by submarine fires.
<hi>Strabo</hi> lib. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

That is,
<hi>Between</hi> Thera <hi>and</hi> Therasia <hi>flames issuing
out of the Sea for four days, (so that the whole
Sea boil'd and burned) blew up by little and
little, as if it had been raised by Machines,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96662:26"/>
and composed of great lumps or masses, an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
of twelve furlongs circumference.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that the Island <hi>Hiera</hi>
near <hi>Italy,</hi> in the time of the Social War,
together with the Sea it self, did burn for
several days. His words are, <hi>In medio Mari</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Strabo</hi> lib. 1. reports, That about
<hi>Methone</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Hermione,</hi> there was
Earth raised, and as it were blown up to the
height of seven Furlongs by a fiery breath
or exhalation, which by day time was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
by reason of heat and sulphureous
slench, but smelling sweet by night, and
shining so as to be seen asar off, likewise cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a heat, as to cause the Sea to boil
for five Furlongs, and to render it troubled
for the space of twenty; raising up therein
a Baich or Bank of Stones as big as Towers.</p>
               <p>These Instances I alledge principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they seem to demonstrate a possibility
of the accension of fire in the Earth when
it was wholly covered with Water, and had
no entercourse or communion with the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
or external Air: which is the main and
most material Objection against the elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the dry Land at the beginning by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
fires.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96662:26"/>
You will say, If the Mountains be thus
heaved up by subterraneous fires, the Earth
must needs be hollow all underneath them,
and there must be vast Dens and Caverns
disperst throughout them.</p>
               <p>I answer, 'Tis true indeed, so there are;
as may undeniably be proved by instances.
For the new Mountain we mentioned at <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teoli,</hi>
that was thus raised, being of a Mile
steep ascent, and four Miles round at the foot,
a proportionable Cavity must be left in the
Earth underneath: And the Mountain <hi>Aetna</hi>
at the last Eructation alone having disgorged
out of its bowels so great a flood of melted
Materials, as if spread at the depth and
breadth of three foot, might reach four times
round the whole Circuit of the <hi>Terraqueous
Globe,</hi> there must likewise an answerable
Vault be left within. You will demand,
How then comes it to pass, that they stand
so firm, and do not founder and fall in after
so many Ages. I answer, that they may
stand, appears by the foresaid new-raised
Mountain. For notwithstanding the Cavity
in and under it, it hath stood firm and
staunch, without the least sinking or subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
for above an hundred and fifty years:
neither is there any great sinking or falling
in at <hi>Aetna</hi> it self; at least in no degree an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to its ejected matter. This asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96662:27"/>
is confirmed by the unanimous vote and
testimony of all Writers, Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
who have handled this Subject. But
<hi>Alphonsus Borellus</hi> supposes them not to have
duly considered the matter, and calculated
the quantity of the ejected materials and the
bulk of the Mountain, and compared them
together; but to have been carried away by
the prejudices and perswasions of the People,
who looking upon the top of the Mountain
at a distance, think it but a small thing in
comparison of the ejected Sand and Ashes
that covered whole Countries; and those
vast Rivers of liquid stones and other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
that ran down so many miles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he by a moderate computation found out
that the total of what the Mountain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged
at the last eruption amounted not (as
I remember) to the fourteen thousandth
part of the Solidity of the whole Mountain.
The reason is the strength and firmness of
their Vaulture and Pillars, sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the superincumbent weight. And yet
in some places there are sinkings and fallings
in, which have afterwards become Valleys
or Pools of Water. But as for the Cavities
that are lower than the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
the Water, where it could insinuate
and make its way, hath filled them up to
that height. I say where it could make its
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96662:27"/>
way, for that there are many empty Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
even under the Sea it self, appears by the
shaking and heating too of the very Water
of the Sea in some places in Earthquakes,
and raising up the borders or skirts of it, so
as to drive the Water a great way back; and
the raising up new Islands in the middle of
the Sea; as <hi>Delos</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and <hi>Anaphe,</hi>
and <hi>Nea,</hi> and <hi>Alone,</hi> and <hi>Hiera,</hi> and <hi>Thera</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> Hist lib. 2. c. 87. and <hi>Thia</hi>
in his own time; and <hi>Therasia</hi> in the <hi>Aegean</hi>
in <hi>Senaca</hi>'s time, which was heaved up in
the sight of many Mariners then present and
looking on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not ignorant, that the learned Man
I lately quoted, I mean</hi> Alph. Borellus, <hi>in his
Book</hi> De Incendiis Aetnae, <hi>is of opinion, that
the middle part, or as he calls it, the kernel of
that Mountain is firm and solid, without any
great caverns or vacuities, and that all those
vaults and cavities in which the fire rages
are near the superficial or cortical part: And
derides those who fancy that</hi> Aetna, <hi>the</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olian
<hi>Islands,</hi> Lipara, Strongyle, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius
<hi>do communicate by subterraneous
channels and passages running under the
bottom of the Sea. But saving the respect
due to him for his learning and ingenuity,
there is good Authority on their side; and
our ratiocinations against the possibility of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96662:28"/>
such a thing must give place to the clear
proof of matter of fact.</hi> Iulius Ethnicus

I shall insert but one passage out of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Reader to the fore-quoted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
for the rest.</hi> Hisce calamitatibus (<hi>saith
he</hi>) dum jactamur, ego curiosiùs intuitus
<hi>Strongylum, 60</hi> ferè milliarium intercapedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
dissitum, illum insolito modo furere notavi,
<hi>&amp;c. i.e.</hi> While we were tost with these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
I beholding curiously the Island <hi>Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli</hi>
about 60 miles distant, observed it to
rage after an unusual manner, for it appeared
all filled with fire in such plenty, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cast forth mountains of flame: a spectacle
horrid to behold and formidable to the most
undaunted Spirit. In the mean time there
was a certain sound perceived as it were of
Thunder, but by reason of the great distance
from whence it came somewhat obscure, which
by degrees, proceeding forward in the subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
conduits, grew greater and greater,
till it came to the place just underneath us,
[<hi>they were at</hi> Lopez <hi>by the Sea</hi>] where it
shook the Earth with such a roaring or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
and fury, that being not able to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer upon our Legs, we were forced, to
support our selves, to catch hold upon any
shrub or twig that was near us, lest our limbs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96662:29"/>
should be put out of joynt by too much shaking
and concussion. At which time happened a
thing worthy of immortal and eternal memory,
<hi>viz.</hi> the subversion of the famous Town of S.
<hi>Eusemia; which he goes about to relate. As
for</hi> Vesuvius, <hi>if that be not hollow down to
the very roots and foundations of it, how
comes it to pass that at the times of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations
it should vomit out such stoods of
boiling Waters? as if we had not read of
them in Histories, and been told so by our
Guide when we ascended that Mountain,
we must needs have perceived our selves by
the mighty guls and channels in the sides
thereof, it being of it self near the top so
spungy and dry, that it is more likely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
then to cast off much rain in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time. And again, what causes the Sea
to recede at those times, and that to so great
a distance, that the Galleys have been laid
dry in the very Haven of</hi> Naples?</p>
               <p>Howbeit, I cannot positively assert the
Mountains thus to have been raised. But
yet whether without means, or by whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
means it were, a Receptacle for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
was prepared, and the dry Land and
Mountains elevated, so as to cast off the
Waters, on the third day, and which is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
the Cavities made to receive the
Waters, and the whole <hi>terra firma,</hi> or dry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96662:29"/>
Land with its Mountains were so proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
one to the other, as that the one was
as much depressed below the Shores, as the
other was elevated above them. And, as if
the one had been taken out of the other,
the Sea with all its Creeks, and Bays, and
Inlets, and other Appendants was made, and
is very near equal to the whole dry Land
with its Promontories and Mountains, if not
in <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet in bulk or dimensions,
though some think in both. Which equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is still constantly maintained, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all Inundations of Land, and Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Sea; because one of these doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
nearly ballance the other, according to
the vulgar Proverb we have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>What the Sea loses in one place, it
gains in another.</hi> If any shall demand, How
the Sea comes to be gradually depressed, and
deepest about the middle part; whereas the
bottom of it was in all likelihood equal
while the Waters covered the whole Earth?
I answer, the same Cause that raised up the
Earth, whether a subterraneous fire or <hi>status,</hi>
raised up also the skirts of the Sea, the ascent
gradually decreasing to the middle part,
where, by reason of the solidity of the Earth,
or gravity of the incumbent Water, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
was not elevated at all. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
fire in those parts where its first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96662:30"/>
or greatest strength was, raised up
the Earth first, and cast off the Waters, and
thence spreading by degrees, still elevated
the Land, and drove the Waters further and
further; till at length the weight of them
was too great to be raised, and then the fire
brake forth at the tops of the Mountains,
where it found least resistance, and disperst
it self in the open Air. The Waters also,
where they found the bottom sandy, or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
made their way into all those Cavities
the fire had made and left, filling them up as
high as the level of the Ocean. Neither let
any man imagine, that the Earth under the
Water, was too soft and muddy to be in this
manner raised by subterraneous fire; for I
have shewn before, that the bottom of the
Sea is so saddened and hardened by the
weight of the incumbent Water, that the
High-ways, beaten continually by Horses and
Carriages, are not more firm and solid. But
omitting this (which is only a conjecture)
I shall discourse a little more concerning the
Equality of Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>It hath been observed by some, That where
there are high Cliffs or Downs along the
Shore, there the Sea adjoyning is deep; and
where there are low and level Grounds, it is
shallow: the depth of the Sea answering to
the Elevation of the Earth above it: and as the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96662:30"/>
Earth from the Shores is gradually higher
and higher, to the middle and parts most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Sea, as is evident by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents
of the Rivers, they requiring a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
declivity to carry them down; so the
Sea likewise is proportionably deeper and
deeper from the Shores to the middle. So
that the rising of the Earth from the Shores
to the Mid-land is answerable to the descent
or declivity of the bottom of the Sea from the
same shores to the Mid-Sea. This rising of
the Earth from the Shores gradually to the
Mid-land, is so considerable, that it is very
likely the Altitude of the Earth in those
Mid-land parts above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the
Sea, is greater than that of the Mountains
above the leve of the adjacent Lands. To
the height of the Hills above the common
<hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth do answer in <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s
Opinion the extraordinary Dephts or
Whirl-pools that are found in the Sea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
beneath the ordinary bottom of the
Sea, as the Hills ascend above the ordinary
face of the Land. But this is but a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of his, and to me it seems not very
probable, because it is not likely there should
be in the Sea extraordinary Depths of that
vast length and extension, as those huge
Ridges of Mountains that run almost quite
through the Continents. And because I have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96662:31"/>
observed the Waters of Rivers that slow gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but especially of the Sea to level the
bottoms of their Channels and Receptacles,
as may be seen in those parts of the Sea whose
bottoms are uncovered at Low-water; and
in dry Lands that have been deserted by the
Sea, as the Fens in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the
<hi>Craux</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be a perfect Level, as far as one can
ken. Though possibly the motion of the
Sea may not descend down so low as those
Depths, and so may not level the bottoms
of them.</p>
               <p>But against what I have said concerning
the levelling of the bottom of the Sea, it
may be objected, That Mariners and Divers
find no such thing, but the quite contrary,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the bottom of the Sea is as une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
as the Land, sometimes ten or twelve
Fathoms on one side of the Ship, and One
hundred on the other, as Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> tells us
in his <hi>Relations about the bottom of the Sea,</hi>
consonant whereto are the Accounts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<hi>And I have</hi> (saith my worthy Friend

               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, That I should indeed
have excepted such places as are rocky, which
bear a very little proportion to the Latitude
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96662:31"/>
and Extent of the Sea, and are for the most
part not far off the Land. I my self have seen

the Coasts of <hi>England,</hi> and a good part
of the Low-Countreys, of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi>
that I think I may boldly pronounce in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
That where the bottom of the Sea is
not rocky, but Earth, Owze or Sand, (and
that is incomparably the greatest part of it)
it is by the motion of the Waters, so far as
the reciprocation of the Sea extends to the
bottom, brought to a level; and if it should
be now unequal, would in time be levelled
again. By level I do not mean so as to have
no declivity (for the reciprocation preserves
that, the floud hindring in good measure the
constant carrying down of the bottom) but
only to have an equal, uniform and easie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
from the Shores to the Deeps. Now
all those Reports of Divers and Navigators
refer for the most part to rocky places. For
Mariners seldom sound but in such places,
and in shallows; and Urinators have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to dive where the bottom is level and
sandy. And that the motion of the Waters
descends to a good depth, I prove from those
Plants that grow deepest in the Sea, because
they all generally grow flat in manner of a
Fan, and not with Branches on all sides like
Trees; which is so contrived by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96662:32"/>
of Nature, because the edges of them
do in that posture with most ease cut the
Water flowing to and fro: And should the
flat side be objected to the Stream, it would
be turned edgewise by the force of it; because
in that site it doth least resist the motion of
the Water: whereas did the Branches of
those Plants grow round as in Trees,
they would be thrown down backward and
forward every Tide. Nay not only the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baceous
and woody submarine Plants, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <hi>Lithophyta</hi> themselves affect this
manner of growing, if they be any thing
ramose and rise to a considerable height, as
I have observed in various kinds of <hi>Corals</hi>
and <hi>Pori.</hi> Hence I suspect those Relations
of Trees growing at the bottom of the Sea,
and bringing forth Fruit there. As for the
<hi>Maldiva Nut,</hi> till better information. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to <hi>Garcias</hi> his Opinion, That the Trees
that bare those Nuts were of old time, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Land on which they grew, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
by the inundations of the Sea, and
there hardned in the Earth, and afterwards
cast up by the working of the Sea again.
Which thing is very probable; for to this
day some of those <hi>Maldiva</hi> Islands are now
and then drowned and swallowed up by the
Sea. Further I do believe, that in the great
depths of the Sea there grow no Plants at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96662:32"/>
all, the bottom being too remote from the
external Air; which though it may pierce
the Water so low, yet I doubt whether in
quantity sufficient for the vegetation of
Plants. Nay, we are told, that in those
deep and bottomless Seas there are no Fish
neither: yet not because there are no Plants
or Insects to feed them; for that they can
live upon Water alone, <hi>Rondeletius</hi> his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
about keeping them in a Glass, doth
undeniably prove; but because their Spawn
would be lost in those Seas, the bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too cold for it to quicken there. This
Answer and Discourse, though it be inserted
into another Treatise, yet properly belongs
to this place, to which I have therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
it, begging the Readers excuse for this
repetition. I now proceed.</p>

Ocean, as far as hath been hitherto observed
in most places, it is manifest that that [pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity]
is near equal to the altitude or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Mediterraneous places above the
Shores; that is to say, as much as these are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated,
and stand up above the Horizon of
the Shores; so much are the Channels of the
Seas depressed below it: or, as much as the
Earth riseth from the Shores towards the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterraneous
places; so much is it by little and
little more and more depressed to the middle
parts of the Ocean, where the greatest depth
for the most part is.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Brerewood</hi> in his Enquiries pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our purpose, supposeth the depth of the
Sea to be a great deal more than the height
of the Hills above the common surface of the
Earth.—<hi>For that in making estimation of the
depth of the Sea, we are not to reckon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
only the height of the Hills above the
common</hi> Superficies <hi>of the Earth, but the
advantage or height of all the dry Land
above the</hi> Superficies <hi>of the Sea: Because the
whole mass of the Earth, that now appeareth
above the Waters, being taken, as it were,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96662:33"/>
out of the place which the Waters now possess,
must be equal to the place out of which it was
taken; and consequently it seemeth, that the
height or elevation of the one should answer
to the depth or descending of the other.</hi> And
therefore, as I said, in estimating the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Sea, we are not to consider only
the erection of the Hills above the ordinary
Land, but the advantage of all the dry
Land above the Sea. Which latter, I mean the
height of the ordinary Main Land, is in my
opinion more in large Continents above the
Sea, than that of the Hills is above the Land.
For that the plain and common face of the
dry Land, is not level or equally distant
from the Center, but hath great declivity
and descent towards the Sea, and acclivity
or rising toward the Mid-land part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it appear not so to the common view
of the Eye, is to reason notwithstanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.
Because, as it is found in that part of
the Earth which the Sea covereth, that it
descendeth lower and lower toward the midst
of the Sea; (for the Sea which touching the
upper face of it is known to be level by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and evenly distant from the Center, is
withal observed to wax deeper and deeper
the further one saileth from the Shore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Main) Even so in that part
which is uncovered the coursings and stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96662:34"/>
of Rivers on all sides from the Mid-land
parts towards the Sea (whose property we
know is to slide from the higher to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
evidently declare so much.<note n="*" place="margin">De fide Orthod. l. 2. c. 10.</note> This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
with <hi>Damascen</hi> supposes, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenness
and irregularity, which is now seen
in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth, was caused
either by taking some parts out of the upper
face of the Earth in sundry places to make
it more hollow, and laying them in other
places to make it more convex: or else
(which in effect is equivalent to that) by
raising up some, and depressing others to
make room and receipt for the Sea: that
Mutation being wrought by the Power of
that Word, <hi>Let the waters be gathered into
one place that the dry land may appear.</hi> This
proportioning of the Cavities appointed to
receive the Seas, to the protuberancy of the
dry Land above the common <hi>Superficies</hi> of
the Ocean, is to me a sufficient Argument,
to prove, that the gathering together of the
Waters into one place, was a work of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and design; and if not effected by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Finger of God, yet at least governed
and directed by him. So the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the place to receive the Sea, to have
been prepared by God, <hi>Psalm 104. 8.</hi> Now
in things of this nature, to the giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
whereof whatever <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96662:34"/>
possibly invent, can be but meerly conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
those are to be most approved that
come nearest to the Letter of Scripture, and
those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> with it to be rejected, how
trim or consistent soever with themselves
they may seem to be: this being as much,
as when God tells us how he did make the
World, for as to tell him how he should have
made it.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, That the
present Earth looks like a heap of Rubbish
and Ruines; And that there are no greater
examples of confusion in Nature than Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
singly or jointly considered; and that
there appear not the least footsteps of any Art
or Counsel either in the Figure and Shape,
or Order and Disposition of Mountains and
Rocks. Wherefore it is not likely they
came so out of God's hands; who by the
Ancient Philosophers is said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and to make all things in number, weight
and measure.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That the present face
of the Earth, with all its Mountains and Hills,
its Promontories and Rocks, as rude and
deformed as they appear, seems to me a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beautiful and pleasant object, and with all
that variety of Hills, and Valleys, and Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
far more grateful to behold, than a
perfectly level Country without any rising
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96662:35"/>
or protuberancy, to terminate the sight: As
any one that hath on the one hand seen the
Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> or any the like Countrey exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
level, and extending on all sides further
then one can ken, or that hath been far out
at Sea, where nothing is to be seen but Sky
and Water: and on the other, from the
Downs of <hi>Sussex</hi> enjoyed that spatious and
ravishing prospect of the Countrey on one
hand, and the Sea on the other, comparing
both objects, must necessarily confess.</p>
               <p>2. They are useful to Mankind in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them convenient places for habitation,
and situations of Houses and Villages; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as Skreens to keep off the cold and nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

both more comfortable and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Winter; and promoting the growth of
Herbs and Fruit-trees, and the maturation of
their Fruits in Summer. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sides, casting off
the Waters they lay the Gardens, Yards and
Avenues to the Houses dry and clean, and so
as well more salutary as more elegant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Houses built in Plains, unless shaded with

               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:96662:35"/>
3. A Land so distinguished into Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Valleys and Plains is also most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the entertainment of the various
sorts of Animals, which God hath created,
some whereof delight in cold, some in hot,
some moist and watery, some in dry and
upland places, and some of them could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
find nor gather their proper food in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Regions. Some Beasts and Birds we
find live upon the highest tops of the <hi>Alps,</hi>
and that all the Winter too, while they are
constantly covered with Snow, as the <hi>Ibex,</hi>
and <hi>Rupicapra</hi> or <hi>Chamois</hi> among Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds,
and <hi>Lagopus</hi> among Birds.</p>
               <p>4. The Mountains are most proper for the
putting forth of Plants; yielding the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
variety, and the most luxuriant sorts of
Vegetables, for the maintenance of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
proper to those places, and for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
Uses, partly also for the exercise and
delight of such ingenious persons as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to search out and collect those Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to contemplate and consider their Forms
and Natures, and to admire and celebrate
the Wisdom of their Creator.</p>
               <p>5. All manner of Metals, Minerals and
Fossils if they could be generated in a level
Earth, of which there is some question, yet
should they be dug or mined for, the Delfs
must necessarily be so flown with Water,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96662:36"/>
(which to derive and rid away no <hi>Adits</hi> or
<hi>Soughs</hi> could be made, and I much doubt
whether Gins would suffice) that it would
be extremely difficult and chargeable, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to work them at all.</p>
               <p>6. Neither are the very tops of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mountains barren of Grass for the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and fattening of Beasts. For on the
Ridges of the high Mountains of <hi>Iura</hi> and
<hi>Saleve</hi> near <hi>Geneva,</hi> and tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of <hi>Rhoetia</hi> or
the <hi>Grisons</hi> Countrey, which are the highest
of all the <hi>Alps,</hi> excepting the <hi>Vallesian</hi> and
<hi>Sabaudian,</hi> there are multitudes of Kine fed
in Summer time, as I my self can witness,
having in my Simpling Voyages on those of
<hi>Iura</hi> and <hi>Saleve</hi> observed Herds of Cattel
there, and many Dairy-houses built, where I
have been more than once refreshed by their
Milk and Milk-Meats. Nay there are but
very few, and those of the highest Summits
of the <hi>Alps</hi> that keep Snow all Summer:
and I was told by the Inhabitants, that one
time or other, in seven or eight years space,
for the most part there came a Summer
that melted all the Snow that lay on them
too.</p>
               <p>7. Another great use and necessity of
the Mountains and Hills is for the Generation
and Maintenance of Rivers and Fountains,
which (in our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that all proceed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96662:36"/>
from Rain-water) could not be without them,
or but rarely. So we should have only
Torrents, which would fail in Summer time,
or any dry Season, and nothing to trust to,
but stagnating Water reserved in Pools and
Cisterns. Which how great an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it would be, I need not take pains to
shew. I say that Fountains and Rivers
would be but rare were there no Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
For upon serious consideration I find
that I was too hasty in<note n="*" place="margin">Observat. Physical, &amp;c.</note> conclnding, because
I had observed no Fountains springing up in
Plains, therefore there were, or could be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
none; and do now grant that there
is reason to believe the Relations made of
such. For the whole dry Land being but
one continued Mountain, and ascending
all along from the Sea to the Mid-land, as
is undeniably proved by the Descent of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
even in plain Countries; the Water
sinking into the Earth, may run under
ground, and according as the Vein leads it,
break out in the side of this Mountain, though
the place as to outward appearance be a
Plain.</p>
               <p>I shall now add, That though it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that without Mountains there may be
Springs, if there should be Rains, (which
it is somewhat questionable were there no
Mountains, whether there could be or no, at
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96662:37"/>
least in hot Countreys) yet is it probable,
that most of those Springs we find in Plains
or depressed places distant from Mountains
may come along in subterraneous Channels
from the next Mountains, and there break
out. Monsieur <hi>Blundel</hi> related to the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Academy, what device the inhabitants
of the lower <hi>Austria,</hi> which is encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Mountains of <hi>Stiria,</hi> are wont
to use to fill their Wells with Water; They
dig in the Earth to the depth of twenty or
five and twenty feet, till they come to an
<hi>argilla</hi> [clammy earth] then they bore a hole
in the midst of a stone about five or six in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
broad, and through it bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the <hi>argilla</hi>
so deep till the Waters breaks forcibly out;
which Water it's probable comes from the
neighbouring Moun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ains in subterraneous
Channels. And <hi>Cassinus</hi> observed, That in
many places of the Territory of <hi>Modena</hi> and
<hi>Bologna</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> they make themselves Wells
of springing Water by the like artifice. They
dig in the Earth till they come to the Water
(which stagnates in common Wells) which
they draw quite out. Then within this new
digged Well they make two cylindrical
Walls, concentrical one to another; the space
or interstice between them they fill and
ramm close with well wrought <hi>Argilla</hi> or
Clay, to keep out the ambient Water;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96662:37"/>
which done, they sink the Well deeper into
the ground, and continue the inner Wall so
low till the Earth underneath seems to swell
by the force of the Water rising up: And
lastly, they bore this Earth or Soil with a
long Wimble; whereupon the Water breaks
forth through the hole with a great force,
so that it doth not only fill the Well, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows
and waters the neighbouring fields
with a constant stream: By this means the
same Seigneur <hi>Cassini</hi> made a Fountain at
the Castle of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> that cast up the water
five foot high above the level of the ground.
It is very probable that these waters descend
by subterraneous passages from the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
Mountains, which are about ten miles
distant. If such things may be done by Art,
why may they not also by Nature? Nay,
that the like are done we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the <hi>Lacus Lugeus,</hi> or <hi>Zirchnitzer-Sea</hi>
in <hi>Carniola,</hi> which after it is empty of
water running out at holes or pits in the
bottom, (which it doth yearly in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time, in the Months of <hi>May, Iune,</hi> or
<hi>Iuly</hi>) in the Autumn when it rains mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
the water spouts out of some of the
forementioned pits two or three fathoms
perpendicularly, but when it rains very hard
and long together, especially with Thunder,
then the water breaks forth with great force,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96662:38"/>
not only from the foresaid pits, but likewise
at a thousand other Caves and Holes, spirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several fathoms high, from some perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly,
from others obliquely, so that
there is not a pleasanter sight then this; and
in a short time fills the lake. A full descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and an account of all the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of
this admirable Lake see in <hi>Philosoph Transact.</hi>
Numb. 191. p. 411. &amp;c. So we see water
may be brought down from the Mountains
and raised up naturally in strait Channels
with that force, and to that height, as to
exceed all the artificial jets in the World, if
not in the altitude of the spout, yet in the
bigness of the stream abundantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This end and use of Mountains I find as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by Mr.</hi> Halley <hi>in his Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the original of Springs and Rivers,
in these words:</hi> This, if we may allow final
causes <hi>(and why may we not? what needs
this hesitancy and dubitation in a thing that
is clear?)</hi> seems to be the design of the Hills
that their ridges being placed through the midst
of the Continents, might serve as it were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembicks
to distil fresh water for the use of
Man and Beast, and their heights to give a
descent to those streams to run gently like so
many veins of the Macrocosm, to be the more
beneficial to the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:96662:38"/>
But some may say, Granting there be some
use and benefit of moderate Hills and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings;
what necessity is there of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Ridges of vast and towring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
hiding their Heads among the Clouds,
and seeming for Altitude to contend with the
Skies? I answer there is very great use of
them for repelling the Vapours exhaled by
the Sun-beams in the hot Regions, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
their Evagations Northward, as we
have already shewn, and shall not repeat.
I might add hereto,</p>
               <p>8. Those long Series and Chains of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are of great use for Boundaries and
Limits to the Territories of Princes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
to secure them on those parts
from sudden Incursions of Enemies. As for
the rudeness and confusion of Mountains,
their cragged and broken Rocks and Cliffs,
and whatever other Disorder there may be
among them, it may be accounted for, from
the manner of their first Generation, and
those other mutations they have been since
obnoxious to, by Earthquakes, Eruptions of
<hi>Vulcano</hi>'s, foundering and falling in of their
Props and Foundations, and by time and
weather too, by which not only the Earth
is washed away, or blown off from the
Stones, but the very Stones and Rocks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
corroded and dissolved, as might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96662:39"/>
be proved by Instances, could I spare
time to do it.</p>
               <p>To sum up all relating to the Division
and Disposition of the Water and Earth in
brief.</p>
               <p>1. I say, the Water being the lighter Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth naturally occupy the upper place,
and stand above the Earth, and so at first it
did. But now we see it doth not so; the
Earth being contrary to its nature forcibly
elevated above it; being (as the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
phraseth it) founded above the Seas, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
above the Floods: and this because
it was best it should be so, as I shall clearly
prove and deduce in particulars in another
Discourse.</p>
               <p>2. The dry Land is not elevated only
upon one side of the Globe; for then had
it had high Mountains in the middle of it,
with such vast empty Cavities within, as
must be equal to the whole Bulk raised up,
the Center of Magnitude must needs have
been considerably distant from the Center
of Gravity: which would have caused a
very great and inconvenient inequality in
the Motion of the parts of the Earth: but
the Continents and Islands are so equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperst
all the Globe over as to counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
one another, so that the Centers of
Magnitude and Gravity concur in one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96662:39"/>
3. The Continents are not of exactly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
and level <hi>Superficies</hi> or Convexity. For
then the Parts subject to the Course of the
Sun, called the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> would have
been, as the Ancients fancied them, unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
for Heat and Drought. But there are
huge Ridges and extended Chains of lofty
Mountains, directed for the most part to
run East and West; by which means they
give free admittance and passage to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
brought in by the Winds from the
<hi>Atlantick</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> Oceans; but stop and
inhibit their Excursions to the North and
South, either condensing them upon their
sides into water, by a kind of external De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation;
or by streightening and constipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them compelling them to gather into
Drops, and descend down in Rain.</p>
               <p>These are great things, and worthy the
Care, Direction, and Disposal of the Great
and Wise Creator and Governour of all
things: And we see they are accordingly

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Creation of Animals; some
Questions resolved.</head>
               <p>AS to the first Creation of Animals I
have already proposed two Opinions,
both consonant or reconcileable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>1. That God Almighty did at first create
the Seeds of all Animals, (that is, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
themselves in little) and disperst them
over the superficial part of the Land and
water, giving power to those Elements to
hatch and bring them forth; which when
they had done, and all the Animals of these
created Seeds were produced and perfected,
there remained no more ability in them to
bring forth any more; but all the succeeding
owe their Original to Generation.</p>
               <p>2. Because some will not admit that God
at first created any thing imperfect, we did
propose that he might by his Almighty
Power, out of the Water and Earth, make
the first set of Animals in their full state and
perfection, (as it is generally believed he did
<hi>Adam</hi>) and give to each <hi>Species</hi> a power by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96662:40"/>
generation to propagate their like. For his
commanding the Waters and Earth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
such and such living Creatures, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that he did himself efficaciously form
them out of the Earth and Water; as when
he saith, <hi>Let there be light, &amp;c.</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not that he did permit or command
something else besides himself to produce
light; but that he did by his own Almighty
power effectually create it. Indeed the
Scripture doth in this manner interpret it
self: For whereas it is said <hi>verses 20.</hi> and 24.
<hi>Let the waters bring forth,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Let the
earth bring forth the living creature,</hi> &amp;c. in
the next verses it follows, <hi>And God created
great whales and every living creature that
moveth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And God made the beast of teh
earth,&amp;c.</hi> But now there may a further
Question or two be moved concerning the
Creation of Animals.</p>
               <p>1. Whether God created at first a great
number of every kind of Animal all the
Earth over, in their proper Places and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates;
or only two of each <hi>Species,</hi> a Male
and a Female, from which all the rest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by generation? This latter opinion
I find embraced by some modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and it may be made probable by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:96662:41"/>
First from the Analogy to Mankind.
There being at first only one Man and one
Woman created, it is very likely, there
were no more of any other Creatures, two
being sufficient in a short time to stock the
World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because at the time of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Deluge there were only two of each
kind (of unclean Beasts) preserved in the
Ark; and if two might then suffice, why not
as well at the first Creation? And if there
were no need of creating more, what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
that there were more created?</p>
               <p>But the first Opinion, That there were
many at first created, seems more consonant
to Scripture, which in the mention of the
Creation of Aquatic Creatures useth the word
<hi>Abundantly,</hi> Gen. 1. 20. <hi>And God said, Let
the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly
above the earth in the open firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
And in the next verse it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
<hi>the waters did bring them forth abundantly.</hi>
So that at least of Birds and Fishes there
were many individuals at first created. As for
Plants, certain it is that they were created
dispersedly all the world over; they having
no locomotive power, but being fixt to a
place, and the Seeds of many of them being
ponderous, and not portable by winds or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96662:41"/>
any other means, and yet those of the same
<hi>Species</hi> to be found in far distant places, and
on the tops of high Mountains as remote
from each other, as the <hi>Helvetick</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian
Alps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Concerning the Creation of Animals
there may yet a further Question be moved,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whether all Animals that already have
been, or hereafter shall be, were at first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
created by God? or whether hath he
given to each kind of Animal such a power
of generation, as to prepare matter and
produce new individuals in their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
Some are of opinion that God did
himself at first actually create all the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Animals that ever were or ever shall
be, and that there is no such thing as any
production of new ones. For, say they,
what were that but a creation of such indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals?
And what did God at the first
Creation more then, if this be true, we see
every day done, that is, produce a new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
out of matter, which it self prepares:
All the difference is the doing that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
which the Creature must take time to
do. For as for the preparation of matter,
that must be made fit, be the Agent never
so Omnipotent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96662:42"/>
Besides, the Animal-parent cannot be the
Agent or Efficient in the generation or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and nourishing of the <hi>foetus.</hi> Because
that is a work of Art and Reason, which
brute Creatures are not endued withal, nor
indeed doth Man himself understand any
thing of the process of generation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
neither is conscious of what is done in
the Womb, so far is he from being the doer
of it.</p>
               <p>Again, it is most probable, if not certain,
that most Animals have in them from the
beginning the Seeds or Eggs of all the
young they shall afterward bring forth, which
when they were spent and exhaust the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
becomes barren or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ete. So we see
all the female <hi>foetus</hi> of viviparous Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds
are brought forth with their <hi>Testes</hi> or
<hi>Ovaria</hi> in them, which are esteemed parts
of their bodies; and all Birds have in them
from their first formation their Ovary or
Egg-cluster, containing the Seeds of all the
Eggs they shall ever lay. Now had the
Creature a power of producing new ones,
what need was there that there should be
so many at first formed in them? and why
might they not breed them as well after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as at the beginning?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96662:42"/>
Hereupon these Philosophers argue thus:
Suppose we that God did at first create two
Animals, a Male and a Female: The Female
must be created with its <hi>Ovaries</hi> or <hi>Testes,</hi>
which (as we said) contained so many
Seeds or Eggs as the Creature should ever
bring forth young. So it is clear that not
only the first pair, but the first generation of
Animals were actually created. Again, this
first generation from their first appearance
had each of them (the Females I mean) its
<hi>Ovaria</hi> or Clusters of Eggs, every one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had in like manner its Animalcule in it;
so that this second generation was also crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the first. The same may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of the third and fourth, and so on of
all the generations that shall be as long as the
World lasts.</p>
               <p>Against this Doctrine it may be objected,
First, That it seems impossible that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varies
of one Female should actually include
and contain the innumerable myriads of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
that may proceed from it in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Generations as have been and shall be
during the continuance of the World. Who
can conceive such a small portion of matter
to be capable of such division, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such an infinity of parts?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:96662:43"/>
But to this it may be answered, That our
sight doth not give us the just magnitude
of things, but only their proportion, and
what appears to the Eye as a Point, may be
magnified so, even by Glasses, as to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
an incredible multitude of parts; nay,
some Animals there are so small, that if a
grain of Sand were broken into 8000000
of equal parts, one of these would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the bigness of one of those Creatures,
as Mr. <hi>Lewenhoek</hi> affirms. And Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>
proceeds further, and says, that he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
some so exceeding small, that Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Millions might be contained in one
drop of water. If these whole Creatures
be so incredibly little, what shall we think
of their parts containing and contained, their
Entrails and Muscles, their Ovaries and Eggs?
But for a sensible demonstration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,
I had almost said infinite, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of matter, I might refer the Reader
to the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
his Discourse concerning the strange
subtlety of <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>luviums.</hi> I shall mention one
or two Experiments. He dissolved one
grain of filed Copper in Spirit of <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armoniack,</hi>
and upon this Solution he poured
so much distilled water by degrees, as till
the fair and deep blew colour grew some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pale without being too dilute to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96662:43"/>
manifest. And then carefully weighing the
Vessel and the Water, and subducting the
weight of that out of this, he found the
weight of the Liquor alone, when reduced
to grains, to amount to 28534, so that a
grain of Copper communicated a tincture
to 28534 times its weight. Now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the weight of Copper to the weight
of Water of the same bulk is <hi>proximè</hi> as 9
to 1, a grain-weight of Copper is in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
but the ninth part of as much Water as
weighs a grain; and so the formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
number of grains of Water must be
multiplied by 9, to give us the proportion
between the tinging Body and tinged Liquor;
whence it will follow, that a single grain of
Copper gave a blewness to above 256806
parts of limped Water, each of them as big
as it. And to prosecute this Experiment
further, he mixt together equal parts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
colourless Water, and of the said
tincted Liquor, and found, that though the
colour were very faint and dilute, yet an
attentive Eye could easily discern it to be
blewish: whereby it appears that one grain
of Copper was able to impart a colour to
double the quantity of Water above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that is to 513612 grains of Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:96662:44"/>
                  <hi>Other Experiments there are in the same
Discourse made in odorate Bodies:</hi> Having,
<hi>saith he,</hi> for curiosity sake suspended in a pair
of exact Scales, that would turn with a very
small part of a grain, a piece of <hi>Amber-greece</hi>
bigger then a Walnut, and weighing
betwixt an hundred and sixscore grains, I

had opportunity to make the trial, discover
even upon that balance, any decrement of
weight in the <hi>Amber-greece,</hi> though so rich
a Perfume lying in the open Air was like in
that time to have parted with good store of
odoriferous steams. And a while after su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending
a lump of <hi>Asa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oetida</hi> 5 days and a half,
I found it not to have sustained any discernible
loss of weight, though, in spite of the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable

Atmosphere replenished with foetid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eams of Animals? The same Author in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

would not only intimate the kinds of Game,
whose scent he chanced to light upon, but
would discover where Partridges had been
(though perhaps without staying in that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96662:44"/>
place) several hours before. He further
tells us, That a very sober Gentleman of his
acquaintance, who had often occasion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
Blood-hounds, assured him, that if a
Man had but passed over the Field, the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent
would lye, so as to be perceptible enough
to a good Dog of that sort for several hours
after. And an ingenious Hunter likewise
assured him, That he had observed, that the
scent of a flying and hunted Deer will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
continue upon the ground from one
day to the next following. He proceeds
further, And now we may consider these
three things; <hi>First,</hi> That the substance left
upon the ground by the transient tread of a
Partridge, Hare or other Animal, that doth
but pass along his way, does probably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to the grass or ground but some of
those effluxions that transpire out of his feet,
which being small enough to escape the eye,
may probably not amount to one grain in
weight, or perhaps not to the tenth part of
it. <hi>Next,</hi> That the parts of fluid Bodies,
as such, are perpetually in motion, and so
are the invisible Particles that swim in them,
as may appear by the dissolution of Salt or
Sugar in Water, and the wandring of aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Vapours through the Air, even when the
eye perceives them not. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> that
though the Atmosphere of one of these small
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96662:45"/>
parcels of the exhaling matter we are
speaking of may oftentimes be exceeding
vast in comparison of the emittent body, as
may be guessed by the distance at which
some Setters or Bloodhounds will find the
scent of a Partridge or Deer; yet in places
exposed to the free Air or Wind, 'tis very
likely that these steams are assiduously carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from their fountain to maintain the
forementioned Atmosphere for six, eight or
more hours, that is as long as the scent hath
been observed to lye, there will be requisite
a continual recruit of steams succeeding one
another. And that so very small a portion
of matter, as that which we were saying the
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omes</hi> of these s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udged to be,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bly to impregnate an Atmosphere
in comparably greater than its self, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it with almost continual recruits, we
cannot but think, that the steams it parts
with, must be of extreme and scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
minuteness. So far the Author.
To which I shall add, That by the steams, I
suppose, he means the minute Particles of
which the steams are compounded. Now
these minute Particles themselves must be
compound Bodies, because they affect the
sence in a particular manner, so that a saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Creature can distinguish by them, not
only Species but Individuals; as a good Dog
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96662:45"/>
by the foot will find out his Master, though
not only several other Creatures, but seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Men have passed that way. Unless we
will groundlesly affirm, that those Particles
are the <hi>minima naturalia,</hi> and that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
discerns them by their figure, or their
disserent manner of motion.</p>
               <p>A second Objection of <hi>Brunnerus</hi> (as I find
him quoted in <hi>Peyerus</hi> his <hi>Merycologia</hi>) is this,
<hi>Si cuncta Animalium membra jam formata ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istant
in ovo,</hi> &amp;c. If all the Members of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
already formed do exist in the Egg,
though for their smalness they escape our
sight; I cannot conceive, how by the force
of imagination alone in a pregnant Woman,
can be produced sometimes Calves heads or
feet, sometimes a Dog's face, or other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Members; these productions being a
certain and experimental proof, that the parts
and members of Animals are formed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated
originally in the Womb or Egg.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Peyerus</hi> replies, who then forms,
who delineates such monsters? Shall we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
God the Creator? But he is just, and
doth not make enormous things: or will
you blame Nature? That is the constant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and will of God, which never is defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Will you lay the fault upon the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
vertue or power residing in the Womb
or Seed, and acting those things? But that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96662:46"/>
is a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> it is nothing, it is an Idol.
There remain two things to which the cause
may justly be imputed, The <hi>imagination of
the Mother,</hi> which may and doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
effect wonderful things in the Body of
the tender <hi>Embryon;</hi> and <hi>the Devil.</hi> If you
refuse to admit the former, you are obliged
to accept the latter. And truly the Devil
may, God so permitting, many ways abuse
Men, and transfigure the young in the Womb,
to punish the wicked and nefarious actions
of degenerate Mankind indulging themselves
in obscene imaginations, or preposterous
and unnatural impurities and pollutions. But
do these errours and enormities take away
the order of Nature? by no means, for
from what is rare and extraordinary and
seldom happens, there is no consequence to
be drawn. For though Monsters are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
born, nothing hinders but that we
may still think, that the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Foetus</hi> may be prae-existent and latent
in the Eggs; and the event may teach us,
that those <hi>Idea's</hi> or <hi>Embryo's</hi> may by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
cause be marred and deformed in the
Womb; as Wax, though it be already figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
while it is soft is easily altered, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving new impressions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96662:46"/>
But against this Answer we may thus
plead in defence of <hi>Brunnerus;</hi> As to what
is said of the Devil, it seems to be but a
shift or refuge to have recourse to when we
are at a loss, and pinch't with an Argument;
as in the ancient Stage-plays, when they
were put to a plunge, they were forced to
bring in some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to help
them out. And as for the imagination of
the Mother, strange it is, that that should
have any influence at all upon the formation
of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> the Mother not knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that's done in the Womb; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conscious to her self of any power to
form or act any thing there; the <hi>Foetus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an external thing to her, and no more a
part of her, then an Egg is of the Hen that
sits upon it, affording nothing to it but
warmth and nourishment. And we see Eggs
may be hatched by the artificial heat of an
Oven, without the incubation of a Hen.
But granting that the imagination of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may transform the <hi>Foetus,</hi> why may it
not as well originally form it out of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
matter; and then what need of an Idea
or minute Animalcule in the Seed? But
whatever may be said of Men, how come
Monsters in Brutes, which according to <hi>Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi>
are meer Machines, and have no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
or perception at all?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:96662:47"/>
But not to lead the Reader into a Maze
or Labyrinth, and leave him there, for my
own part I must confess, that the Argument
for the praexistence of the <hi>Faetus's,</hi> or their
creation from the beginning, taken from
the due number of Eggs that are in every
Female from her first formation, and her
being eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te after they are spent, weighs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much with me, as I know not how to
quit my self of it. And on the other hand,
if those stories concerning Dogs and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
&amp;c. found in the wombs of Women
be true (which are well attested) I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it very difficult, to give an Account

Reasons for which I have given in another
<note n="*" place="margin">Wisdom of God in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Discourse, and shall not here repeat.</p>
               <p>The new Opinion of Mr. <hi>Lewenhoek,</hi> that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96662:47"/>
all Animals proceed from an Insect or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcule
in the Male-sperm, among other
Reasons, I am less inclinable to, because of
the necessary loss of a multitude, I might
say infinity, of them, which seems not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the Wisdom and Providence of
Nature. For supposing every Male hath in
him all the Animalcules that he shall or may
eject; they may, for ought I know, amount
to millions of millions, and so the greatest
part of them must needs be lost. Nay, if
we take but one Coit, there must, in unipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Creatures at least, abundance be lost.
But if we suppose the <hi>Foetus</hi> to be originally
in the Egg, it is not so. For the Eggs of
all sorts of Creatures are so proportioned to
the nature of the Animals, the time that
they live, the time and number of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,
and the number they bring forth at
all times, that they will much about suffice
for the time the Creatures are fit to breed
and nourish their young: so that they may,
if need be, be all brought forth and come to
perfection.</p>

the General Deluge in the days of

concerning the Deluge.</head>
               <p>FIrst then, I shall produce some Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Ancient Heathen Writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Deluge.</p>
               <p>The first shall be that of <hi>Berosus,</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> in the fifth Chapter of his
first Book of <hi>Iewish Antiquities,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. That is, <hi>Berosus</hi> the
<hi>Chaldaean</hi> relating the Story of the Deluge
writes thus. It is reported, that there is
some part of the Vessel [the Ark] still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
at the Mountain of the <hi>Gordyaeans;</hi>
and that certain Persons scraping off the
<hi>Bitumen</hi> or Pitch, carry it away; and that
men make use of it for Amulets, to drive
away Diseases.</p>
               <p>A second Testimony the same <hi>Iosephus</hi>
affords us in the same place, and that is, of
<hi>Nicolaus Damascenus;</hi> who, saith he, gives
us the History of the [Ark and Deluge] in
these words; About <hi>Minyas</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96662:49"/>
is a great Mountain called <hi>Baris;</hi> to which
it is reported, that many flying in the time
of the Deluge were saved, and that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
person was carried thither in an Ark,
which rested on the top of it; the reliques
of the Timber whereof were preserved
there a long time. Besides these, <hi>Iosephus</hi>
tells us in the same place, that <hi>Hieronymus</hi>
the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who wrote the <hi>Phoenician</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
and <hi>Mnaseas,</hi> and many others,
whose words he alledges not, make mention
of the Flood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> superadds two Testimonies more.
The one of <hi>Melon</hi> to this effect. There de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from <hi>Armenia</hi> at the time of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
a certain man, who together with his
Sons had been saved; who being cast out of
his House and Possessions, was driven away
by the Natives. This man passing over the
intermediate Region, came into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
part of <hi>Syria,</hi> that was then deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
This Testimony makes the Deluge
Topical, and not to have reached <hi>Armenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is of <hi>Abydenus</hi> an ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96662:49"/>
foretold, that there should be a great Flood
of Waters upon the fifteenth Day of the
Month <hi>Desius;</hi> and commanded him to hide
all Writings [or whatever was committed
to writing] in <hi>Heliopolis</hi> of the <hi>Sypparians.</hi>
Which so soon as <hi>Sisithrus</hi> had performed, he
presently sailed away to <hi>Armenia,</hi> where
what God had predicted to him, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
came to pass [or came upon him].
The third day, after the Waters ceased, he
sent forth Birds, that he might try whether
they could espy any Land uncovered of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But they finding nothing but Sea, and
not knowing whither to betake themselves,
returned back to <hi>Sisithrus.</hi> In like manner,
after some days he sent out others with like
success. But being sent out the third time,
they returned with their feet fouled with
Mud. Then the Gods caught up <hi>Sisithrus</hi>

Deluge, in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> bringing in a certain
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest, who related to <hi>Solon</hi> out of
the Sacred Books of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that before
the particular Deluges known and celebrated
by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> there was of old an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great Inundation of Waters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
of the Earth; which seems to be
no other than <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Book <hi>De Solertia Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi>

us, That those who have written
of <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood, report, that there was
a Dove sent out of the Ark by <hi>Deucalion,</hi>
which returning again into the Ark, was a
sign of the continuance of the Flood, but
flying quite away, and not returning any
more, was a sign of Serenity, and that the
Earth was drained.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Ovid</hi> and other Mythologists

the Father and Restorer of Mankind, whose
right the Kingdom was. 6. The sending out
of a Dove, to try whether the Waters were
abated, and the Flood gone off, is (we have
seen) by <hi>Plutarch</hi> attributed to <hi>Deucalion.
7. Lucian</hi> in his <hi>Timon,</hi> and in his Book <hi>De

&amp;c. Deucalion <hi>was the only Man that was
left for a second Generation, for his Prudence
and Piety sake: And he was saved in this
manner. He made a great Ark, and got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
it, with his Wife and Children: And
to him came Swine, and Horses, and Lions, and
Serpents, and all other living Creatures, which
the Earth maintains, according to their kinds
by pairs; and he received them all, and they
hurt him not; for there was by Divine Instinct
a great friendship among them; and they sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in the Ark, so long as the Waters
prevailed.</hi> And in his <hi>Timon</hi> he saith, <hi>That</hi>

               </p>

and Seventy Years or thereabouts after
the general Deluge. I acknowiedge also a more
ancient Flood in <hi>Attica</hi> in the time of <hi>Ogyges,</hi>
about Two hundred and thirty years before
<hi>Deucalion</hi>'s, by which the Countrey was so
marred, that it lay waste and uncultivated

               <head type="sub">Of the Causes of the Deluge.</head>
               <p>WHat were the instrumental Causes or
Means of the Flood? Whether
was it effected by natural or supernatural
Means only? Whether was God no further
concerned in it, than in so ordering second
Causes at first, as of themselves necessarily
to bring it in at such a time?</p>
               <p>First, Those that hold this Deluge was
altogether miraculous, and that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
created Waters on purpose to serve
this occasion, and when they had done their
work destroyed them again, dispatcht the
Business, and loose or cut the Knot in a few
words. And yet this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is not so
absurd and precarious, as at first sight it may
seem to be. For the World being already
full, there needed not, nor indeed could be
any Creation of Water out of nothing, but
only a Transmutation of some other Body
into Water. Now if we grant all Natural
Bodies, even the Elements themselves, to be
mutually transmutable, as few Men doubt,
and some think they can demonstrate; why
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96662:53"/>
might not the Divine Power and Providence
bring together at that time such: natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
as might change the Air or <hi>Aether,</hi>
or both together into Water; and so supply
what was wanting in Rains, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Eruptions of Springs. To them that
argue the Improbability of such a change,
from the great quantity of Air requisite to
the making of a little Water; it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That if Air, and all Bodies commixt
with it, were together changed into Water,
they must needs make a bulk of Water of
equal quantity with themselves, unless we
will grant a Peripatetical Condensation and
Rarefaction; and hold that the same Matter
may have sometimes a greater, sometimes a
lesser quantity or extension.</p>
               <p>This Cause [the conversion of Air into
Water] the Learned Jesuite <hi>Athanasius Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>

this Deluge, in which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> raised
fifteen Cubits above the highest by Mountains,
was not, nor could be effected by natural
Causes; but by the right hand of the most

how far the power of Nature can extend,
and where it is limited. To conclude, this
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> hath the Suffrages of most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men. But because the Scripture assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Causes or Means of the Inundation,
makes no mention of any conversion of Air
into Water, but only of the breaking up the
Fountains of the Great Deep, and the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Windows of Heaven, I suppose
those Causes may be sufficient to work the
Effect, and that we need not have recourse
to such an Assistance.</p>

As for those that make the Deluge Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and restrain it to a narrow compass of
Land; their Opinion is, I think, sufficiently
confuted by a late ingenious<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</note> Author, to
whom therefore I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>I shall not undertake the Defence or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of those or any other <hi>Hypothesis:</hi>
only tell you which at present seems to me
most probable, and that is theirs, who for a
partial cause of the Deluge, assign either a
change of the Center of the Earth, or a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
depression of the Surface of the Ocean,
and a forcing the Waters up from the subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Abyss through the Channels of the
Fountains that were then broken up and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p>First then, let us consider what Causes the
Scripture assigns of the Flood; and they are
two: 1. The breaking up the Fountains of
the great Deep: 2. The opening of the
Windows of Heaven. I shall first treat of
this last. By the opening of the Windows
of Heaven, is (I suppose) to be understood
the causing of all the Water that was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
in the Air to descend down in Rain
upon the Earth; the effect hereof here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
being a long continuing Rain of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days. And that these Treasuries of the
Air will afford no small quantity of Water,
may be made appear, both by Scripture and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96662:55"/>
Reason. 1. By Scripture, which opposes
the Waters that are above the Heavens or
Firmament, to those that are under them;
which if they were not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in some
measure equal, it would never do. Gen. 1. 6.
<hi>God is</hi> said <hi>to make a Firmament in the midst
of the Waters, and to divide the Waters
which were under the Firmament, from the
Waters which were above the Firmament.</hi>
And this was the work of a whole day, and
consequently no inconsiderable thing. By
the Heavens or Firmament in this place, is to
be understood the inferiour Region of the
Air, wherein the Fowls fly: who <hi>Gen. 1. 20.</hi>
are said to <hi>fly above the Earth, in the open
Firmament of Heaven;</hi> though elsewhere it
be taken for the Celestial Regions, wherein
the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>2. The same may be made appear, by
Reason grounded upon Experience. I my
self have observed a Thunder-Cloud in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
to have in less than two hours space
powred down so much Water upon the
Earth, as besides what sunk into the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and thirsty ground, and filled all Ditches
and Ponds, caused a considerable Flood in
the Rivers, setting all the Meadows on flote.
[And Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> in his <hi>Scarborough Spaw</hi> tells
us, of great Spouts of Rain that ordinarily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96662:55"/>
fall every year some time or other in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that set the whole Countrey in a
Flood.] Now had this Cloud, which might
for ought I know, have moved Forty miles
forward, stood still and emptied all its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the same spot of Ground it first
hung over, what a sudden and incredible
Deluge would it have made there? and yet
what depth or thickness of Vapours might
remain uncondensed in the Air above this
Cloud, who knows? Now it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that not only the Air upon the dry
Land, but also all that covers the whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
is charged with Vapours, which are
nothing else but diffused Water: all which
was brought together by Winds, or what
others Means seem'd good to God, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to destil down in Rain upon the Earth.
And you may easily guess that it was no
small quantity of Water that was supplyed
this way, in that it sufficed for a Rain that
lasted Forty natural days. And that no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Rain neither, but Catarracts or Spouts
of Water; for so the <hi>Septuagint</hi> interprets
the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>And the Catarracts or Spouts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
were opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return now to the first Cause or Means
of the <hi>Deluge</hi> assigned by the Scripture, and
that is the <hi>breaking up of all the Fountains
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96662:56"/>
of the great Deep.</hi> By the <hi>great Deep</hi> in this
place, I suppose, is to be understood the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Waters, which do and must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
communicate with the Sea. For
we see that the <hi>Caspian</hi> and some other Seas,
receive into themselves many great Rivers,
and yet have no visible Outlets: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by Subterraneous Passages, must needs
discharge their Waters into the Abyss of
Waters under the Earth, and by its interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into the Ocean again.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea doth not (as
I sometimes thought) communicate with the
<hi>Ocean</hi> by any subterraneous Passages, nor
thereby impart any Water to it, or receive
any from it, may be demonstrated, from
that the <hi>Superficies</hi> of it is lower than the
<hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ocean, as appears from
the Waters running in at the Streights of
<hi>Gibraltar;</hi> for if there were any such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
the Water keeping its Level,
the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> being the lowest, must
by those Passages receive Waters from the
<hi>Ocean;</hi> and not the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which is (as we
have proved) the highest, from the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean.</hi>
But that it doth not receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by Subterraneous Passages is most likely,
because it receives so much above Ground.
Hence it necessarily follows, that the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
spends more in Vapour than it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96662:56"/>
from the Rivers; which is Mr. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
Conclusion; though in some of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
or <hi>Hypotheses</hi> he is, I think, mistaken,
as 1. In that he numbers the <hi>Tyber</hi> amongst
his nine great Rivers, each of which may
yield ten times as much Water as the <hi>Thames;</hi>
whereas I question whether that yields once
so much; and whereas he passes by all the
rest of the Rivers as smaller than it; there
are two that I have seen in <hi>Italy</hi> it self,
whereof the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Arnus,</hi> on which
<hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Pisa</hi> stand, seemed to me not
inferiour in bigness to the <hi>Tiber;</hi> and the
other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Athesis</hi> on which <hi>Verona</hi>
stands, I could not guess to be less than twice
as big. 2. In that he thinks himself too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
in allowing these nine Rivers to carry
down each of them ten times so much Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the <hi>Thames</hi> doth. Whereas one of
those nine, and that none of the biggest nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>viz.</hi> the River <hi>Po,</hi> if <hi>Ricciolus</hi> his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses</hi>
and Calculations be good, affords
more Water in an hour, than Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the <hi>Thames</hi> to do in a day; the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Effusions of the <hi>Po</hi> being rated at eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
millions of Cubical Paces by <hi>Ricciolus;</hi>
whereas the daily ones of the <hi>Thames</hi> are
computed to be no more than twenty five
millions three hundred forty four thousand
Cubical yards of Water by Mr. <hi>Halley:</hi> but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96662:57"/>
a Geometrical Pace contains five Feet, <hi>i. e.
1<hi rend="sup">••</hi>
                  </hi> of a Yard. Now if the <hi>Po</hi> pours so much
Water hourly into the Sea, what then must
the <hi>Danow</hi> and the <hi>Nile</hi> do? each of which
cannot (I guess) be less than troble of the
<hi>Po. Tanais, Borysthenes</hi> and <hi>Rhodanus</hi> may
equal, if not exceed it. Howbeit, I cannot
approve <hi>Ricciolus</hi> his <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> judging
them to be too excessive, but do believe that
as to the whole Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> comes nearer the
truth. Sure enough it is, that in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi>
the Receipts from the Rivers
fall short of the Expence in Vapour: though
in part of it, that is, the <hi>Euxine,</hi> the Receipts
exceed, as appears from that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Current sets outward from thence
through the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus,</hi> and <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
evaporate more than it receives from
the Rivers, yet I believe, the Case is not the
same with the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; the <hi>Superficies</hi>
whereof seems to me not to bear any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
proportion to the Waters of the Rivers
that run into it, than that of the <hi>Euxine</hi>
doth to its: which we have observed not to
spend the whole Receipt in Vapour.</p>
               <p>You'l say, Why then do not great Floods
raise the Seas? I answer, as to the <hi>Caspian,</hi>
if it communicates with the Ocean, whether
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96662:57"/>
the Rivers bring down more or less, its all
one; if more, then the Water keeping its
Level, the <hi>Caspian</hi> raiseth the <hi>Ocean;</hi> if less,
then the <hi>Ocean</hi> communicates to the <hi>Caspian,</hi>
and raises that. But as to the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi>
we may say, that when it receives
more on the one side, it receives less on the
other, the Floods and Ebbs of the <hi>Nilus</hi> and
the other Rivers counterbalancing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Besides by reason of the Snows lying
upon the Mountains all Winter, the greatest
Floods of those great Rivers in <hi>Europe</hi> do
not happen when the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
leàst in the Winter time; but in the
Spring.</p>
               <p>You'l demand further, if the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
evaporates so much, what becomes of all
this Vapour? I answer, It is cast off upon
the Mountains, and on their sides and tops
is condensed into Water, and so returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by the Rivers unto the Sea.</p>
               <p>If you proceed to ask what becomes of
the Surplusage of the Water, which the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi>
receives from the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and
spends in vapour; I answer, It seems to me
that it must be cast further off over the tops
of the Mountains, and supply in part Rain
to these Northern Countries: for we know
that the South-wind brings Rain, with us and
and all <hi>Europe</hi> over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:96662:58"/>
As to the great Ocean, I do not believe
that it evaporates so much as the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean;</hi>
both 1. Because the whole <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi>
excepting the <hi>Euxine,</hi> lies in a hot
Climate, and a great part of it as it were
in a Valley, Ridges of high Mountains, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
on one side, and the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Apennine,</hi>
&amp;c. on the other running along it. And
2. Because the Surface of the whole <hi>Ocean</hi>
bears a greater proportion to the Waters it
receives from the Rivers of at least this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
than that of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> doth
to its. And therefore I think also that Mr.
<hi>Halley</hi> exceeds in his Estimate of the Heat
of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea-water. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perswade my self, that were it all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt,
I mean the hotter part with the cooler
all the Surface over to such a thickness, it
would equal the heat of our Air in the hottest
time of Summer. But I leave that to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trial and Enquiry.</p>
               <p>Here give me leave to suggest, that we are
not to think, that all the Vapours that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our Rains and Dews proceed from the
Sea; no, a great part of them, <hi>viz.</hi> all that,
when condensed, waters the Earth, and serves
for the Nutrition of Plants and Animals, (if
not the same individual Water, at least so
much) was exhaled out of the Earth before,
and returned again in Showers and Dews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96662:58"/>
it. So that we receive no more from
the Sea, than what the Rivers carry back,
and pour into it again. But supposing Mr.
<hi>Halley</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheses</hi> to be good, and that the
<hi>Ocean</hi> doth evaporate, and cast off to the dry
Land 1<hi rend="sup">12</hi> of an Inch thickness daily, and this
suffices for the Supply of all the Rivers; how
intolerably extravagant must their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
be, who suppose the Rivers of all the World
together to yield half an Ocean of water
daily? Though I must confess my self to be
at a loss as to those vast Rivers of <hi>America</hi>
of ninety Miles broad; for if they should
run with any thing a swift Current, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
inestimable what a quantity of water
they may pour forth. All therefore that
I have to say of them is, That we want a
true History and Account of their <hi>Phoenomena</hi>
from their Fountains to their Out lets.</p>
               <p>But in contradiction to what I have said
concerning the water keeping its level, and
flowing in only at the Straits mouth, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that it is the concurrent and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Vote and Suffrage of Mariners, Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers
and Philosophers, that there is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
at the Straits of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Bosphorus,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick Sound.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>M. Marsilly</hi> affirms, That the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
water in the Channel of the <hi>Thracian
Bosphorus</hi> is driven Northward into the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96662:59"/>
                  <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> whilst the upper flows constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the <hi>Euxine</hi> Southward. And that
that which flows from the South is salter
and heavier; which he found by letting
down of a Vessel close shut up, fitted with a
Valve to open at pleasure, and let in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
water, which being brought up and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was observed to be ten Grains heavier
than the upper. That the upper and lower
flow contrary ways, he found by the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Nets, which being let down deep from
Vessels that were fixed, were always by the
observation of the Fishermen, by the force
of the Current driven towards the <hi>Black Sea:</hi>
and by the letting down of a Plummet; for
if it were stop't and detained at about five
or six foot depth, it did always decline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Marmora</hi> or <hi>Propontis,</hi> but if it
descended lower, it was driven to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part, that is, the <hi>Euxine.</hi> But I think
these Experiments are not sufficient to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
and demonstrate such an under-current,
because possibly there might be some mistake
in them: and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> mentions no such
thing as any under-current there. But yet
the same Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> endeavours to prove an
under-current by two Experiments: The
first is the running Tide and Half-tide in the
<hi>Offing</hi> between the <hi>North-Foreland</hi> and <hi>South-Foreland.</hi>
Now where it flows Tide and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96662:59"/>
Half-tide, though the Tide of Flood runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft,
yet the Tide of Ebb runs under-foot,
that is, close by the Ground. See <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Transactions,</hi> Numb. 158. p. 564.</p>
               <p>The second is, an Experiment made in the
<hi>Baltick Sound:</hi> In one of the King's Fregats
they went with their Pinnace into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Stream, and were carried violently by
the Current: soon after they sunk a Bucket
with a large Cannon Bullet to a certain
depth of water, which gave check to the
Boats motion, and sinking it still lower and
lower, the Boat was driven a head to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
against the upper Current, the Current
aloft being not above four or five Fathom
deep; and the lower the Bucket was let fall,
they found the under-current the stronger.</p>
               <p>To all this I reply; That I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how waters can run backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the same Channel at the same time.
For there being but one declivity, this is as
much to affirm, as that a heavy Body should
ascend. It is a crossing of Proverbs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
making Rivers ascend to their
Fountains, affirming that to be done, which
all the World hitherto hath look't upon as
absurd and impossible. And therefore the
Matter of Fact had need be well attested:
which when to me it shall be, I must then
<hi>manus dare,</hi> yield up the Bucklers, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96662:60"/>
some means to solve the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose we that the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
it self into the Ocean by an under-cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
there must be a declivity to carry it
down, and consequently the upper-Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of this under-current must have its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
too, and likewise the contiguous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the upper-current, and so the
upper current must needs ascend in its course
inwards. If you say it's forc'd in by the
motion of the Ocean, that seems unlikely,
because it runs in constantly, as well Ebb as
Flood. And therefore there seems to be no
better account of it than the Superficies of the
<hi>Ocean</hi> being higher than that of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the breaking up of the Fountains of
the <hi>Great Deep,</hi> is I conceive meant, the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
great Issues and Apertures for these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
waters to rush out. You will say,
how could that be, sith the water keeps its
level, and cannot ascend to a greater height
above the common Center, than the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
of the Sea is, much less force its way,
remove Obstacles, and break open Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?</p>
               <p>I answer, According to them that hold
that all Rivers come from the Sea by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Passages, it is no more than daily
happens. For they must needs grant, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96662:60"/>
the water in the Subterraneous Channels, is
raised as far above the level of the Ocean,
as are the Heads and Fountains of great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Which considering the height of their
first springs up the Mountains, the length
of their Courses, and the swiftness of their
Streams for a great part of the way, is very
considerable, a constant declivity being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to their descent. And therefore I
can by no means assent to the Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Plot,</hi> (if I understand him aright)
<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Nat. Stafford, <hi>p. 79.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the Valleys are as much below the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Sea, as Mountains are above it.</hi>
For how then could Rivers descend down to
the Sea through those Valleys; the Sea would
rather run into them, and make <hi>Sinuses;</hi>
or else, if they were enclosed, the water
would stagnate there, and make Pools.</p>
               <p>If this be done by way of Filtration (which
seems to be the most likely Means of raising
the water) I do not see, but these Filters may
suck up the whole Ocean; and if Apertures
and Outlets large enough were made, pour
it out upon the Earth in no long time. But
I cannot be fully reconciled to this Opinion,
though it hath great Advocates, especially
the fore-mentioned very Learned and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Person Dr. <hi>Robert Plot.</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Subterraneous waters: I grant a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and Communication of Seas by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96662:61"/>
Channels and Passages: I believe
that wherever one shall dig as deep as the
level of the Sea, he shall seldom fail of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the water making its way through Sand
and Gravel and Stones. In like manner as it
is observed of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> that in Floud-times
all the neighbouring Wells and Cellars
are filled with water, and when the River
decreases and sinks again, those waters also
of the Wells and Cellars diminish, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
fall back into the River, so that there
are scarce any Wells or Fountains in the
Plains near the River, but their waters keep
the level of the Rivers, rising and falling
with it.</p>
               <p>But this inferiour constant Circulation and
perpetual motion of water, seems to me not
yet sufficiently proved and made out. I think
that the Patrons and Abbettors of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
have not satisfactorily demonstrated,
how it is, or can be performed. To what
is offered concerning the Center of Gravity
being nearer to our Continent, by reason of
the Preponderancy of the Earth, and the
Waters lying as it were on an heap in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

have. Moreover, I am of Mr. <hi>Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s
Opinion, that there may be, and is a
vast Continent toward the Southern Pole
opposite to <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> to counterpoise
them on that side; nay, I do verily believe,
that the Continents and Islands are so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
scattered and disposed all the
World over, as if not perfectly and exactly,
yet very nearly to counter-ballance one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so that the Globe cannot walter or
reel towards any side: and that the Center
of the convex Superficies of the Sea, is the
true Center of the whole Terrestrial Sphere,
both of Motion and of Gravity. I add also
of Magnitude: which is exceedingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
as well for the facility as the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Earths diurnal Motion. This
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Continents being disperst
equally on all sides of the Globe, makes these
Centers concur in one point, whatever cause
we assign of the raising up the dry Land at
first. Whereas if we should suppose the dry
Land to have been raised up by Earth-quakes
only on one side of the Globe, and to have
cast off the water to the other, and also that
the water could find no way into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
that were left within; then the watery
side must needs Preponderate the Land-side,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96662:62"/>
and bring the Center of Gravity nearer to
its own <hi>Superficies,</hi> and so raise the Land
still a great deal higher, and make a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
distance between the Centers of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
and of Gravity. In our <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
of the equal dispersion of the Continents
and Islands no such thing would happen: but
each Continent taking it with all its internal
Caverns, whether lighter or heavier than its
bulk in water; that is, whether the water
did make its way into the Caverns thereof,
or did not, (for in the first case it would be
heavier, (in the second lighter) would have
its counterpoise on the opposite side; so that
the Centers would still concur. The case
would be the same if the dry Land were
discovered, and the Mountains raised by the
immediate application of the Divine Power.
2. The Sea being no where above a <hi>German</hi>
Mile deep (for which we have good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)
in most places not half so much,
taking then as a middle term half a Mile.
Suppose it every where half a Mile deep,
(the Earth below the Sea, we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suppose of different Gravity) what
proportion hath this half Miles thickness of
water to the whole Terraqueous Globe, whose
Semidiameter is by the account of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
Three thousand four hundred and
forty <hi>Italian</hi> Miles. What little advantage
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96662:62"/>
then can it have of the Earth opposite to it,
in point of Preponderancy? 3. Granting
the Center of Gravity should be nearer our
Continent: The Center being the lowest
place, and the Water a fluid Body, unless
stopped, (which it might indeed be, if it were
encompassed round with high Shores, as high
as the Mountains, without any Breaks or
Outlets in them) where it found declivity,
it would descend as near as it could to it,
without any regard of the Earths Preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy.
And though we should grant, that
the driness of the Shores might stop it, and
cause it to lye on a heap, yet would it run up
the Channels of Rivers, till it came as near
as possible to the Center of Gravity. Indeed
the Rivers themselves could not descend, but
must run towards the middle of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
All this I think will follow from this
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> by as good consequence, as the
waters being forced through the Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Channels out at the Springs. Again,
I do not peremptorily affirm, that all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
do proceed from Rain; only I contend,
that Rain may suffice to feed them, and that
probably it doth feed ordinary Springs. This
the Ingenious <hi>French</hi> Author doth well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
in the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and I believe it
is demonstrable in most other Rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:96662:63"/>
The little Brook that runs near my Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hath its Head or Source not above
four or five Miles off, where there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
eruption of water, all along its
Course receives small Rivulets on both sides;
which though they make a considerable
Stream at five miles distance from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head,
yet singly are so small, that they
may very well be conceived to drain down
from the higher Grounds that lye about
them. And taking the whole together, it
is a very considerable length and breadth of
Land, that contributes to the maintenance
of this little River. So that it may easily be
believed, that all its water owes its original
to Rain: Especially if it be considered fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that in Winter-time after the Rains are
fallen, the Ground sated, and the Ditches
full, the Stream of this River during the
whole Winter following, is for the most
part, unless in Frosts, double of what it was
in Summer. Which Excess can proceed
from nothing but Rain and Mists; at
least it would be rashness to assign any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cause, when there is so obvious and
manifest an one. Moreover, that Rain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
no small quantity of water, is clear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from great Floods, wherein it might be
proved, that in few days there descends
more water than would supply the ordinary
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96662:63"/>
Stream for a good part of Summer. Now
to compare great things with small; I have
seen many of the biggest Rivers in <hi>Europe,</hi>
the <hi>Danow, Rhine, Rhosne</hi> and <hi>Po;</hi> and when
I consider the length of their Courses, the
multitude of considerable Rivers and Brooks
they receive; and all these from their first
rise, made up by degrees of little Rivulets
and Gills, like my neighbouring Brook; the
huge Mountains and vast extent of higher
Grounds they drain. To me it seems (and
I have seen all their Streams near their Out-lets,
except the <hi>Danows,</hi> and it's after four
hundred Miles descent) that they do not
bear any greater proportion to the Rivers and
Rivulets they receive, and the immense
Tracts of Land that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed them, than my
Brook doth to its smalls Rills and compass of
Ground.</p>
               <p>But in this, I confess, I do not descend to
the niceness of Measuring and Calculation,
but satisfie my self with rude Conjectures,
taking my Measures, as the <hi>Cestrians</hi> say, by
the Scale of the Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It will here be objected,</hi> That the Rain
never sinks above ten Foot deep at most into
the Earth, and therefore cannot supply the
Springs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:96662:64"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This indeed, if it were true,
would much enervate, nay, quite overthrow
our Opinion: And therefore we must forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this Point, and effectually demonstrate
beyond all possibility of denial or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
That Rain-water doth sink down,
and make its way into the Earth, I do not
say Ten, or Twenty, nor Forty, but an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
nay, Two or three hundred Foot or
more.</p>
               <p>First then, in <hi>Pool-hole</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> of
<hi>Darbyshire,</hi> there are in some places constant
droppings and destillations of water from the
Roof: under each of which (to note that by
the by) rises up a Stone Pillar, the water
precipitating some of those stony Particles,
which it had washed off the Rocks in passing
through their Chinks. These droppings
continue all the Summer long. Now it
seems clear to me, that the Rain-water ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
its way through the Veins and Chinks
of the Rocks above it, and yet but slowly,
by reason of the thickness of the Mountain,
and straitness of the Passages, supplies that
dropping all the year round; at least, this is
much more rational than any different <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.</hi>
If the water distills down faster in
Winter time and wet Weather, than it doth
in Summer (which I forgot to ask) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
would infallibly prove our Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96662:64"/>
In confirmation of this Argument,
<hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> (as I find him quoted in
Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi>'s <hi>Scarborough Spaw</hi>) tells us, <hi>That
at the bottom of a solid Rock one hundred and
thirty Fathoms deep, he saw drops of water
distilling from it in a rainy season.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is well known, and attested
to me by the People at <hi>Buxton</hi> when I was
there, that out of the mouth of the same
<hi>Pool hole,</hi> after great and long continuing
Rains, a great stream of water did usually
issue forth. And I am sure it must make its
way through a good thickness of Earth or
Rocks, before it could come in there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What becomes of all the water
that falls on <hi>Newmarket-Heath</hi> and <hi>Gogmagog</hi>
Hills, I presume also <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> and
the like Spungy Grounds all Winter long,
where we see very little run off any way?
It must needs sink into the Ground more
than Ten Foot deep.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Many Wells, whose Springs
lye at least Twenty Foot deep, we find by
experience, do often fail in great Droughts
in Summer time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, In Coal Delfs and other Mines, in
wet Weather the Miners are many times
drown'd out, (as they phrase it) though no
water runs down into the Mouths of their
Pits or Sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts. Nay, Dr.</hi> Wittie <hi>tells us in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96662:65"/>
his</hi> Description of the Vertues of the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow
Spaw, <hi>pag. 105.</hi> That after great Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Rain, the Miners find the water
frequently distilling through the solid Earth
upon their Heads; whereas in Summer or dry
Seasons, they find no interruption from thence
at all.</p>
               <p>Further, to confirm this Particular, I
wrote to my Honoured Friend Sir <hi>Thomas
Willughby</hi> Baronet, desiring him to examine
his Colliers concerning it, and send me word
what report they make; and from him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this account. <hi>If there be Springs lye
before you come at the Coal, they carry the
Water away; but if there be none, it falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Works in greater or less quantity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Rains fall.</hi> Which Answer is
so much the more considerable, in that it
gives me a further clear Proof, that Springs
are fed by Rain water, and not by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
from the Sea; their original be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the Beds of Coal, they receiving
the Rain-water into their Veins, and deriving
it all along to their Fountains or Eruptions,
above the Coals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I might add out of him, [Dr.</hi> Witty] <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
pag. 85. That the <hi>Scarborow Spaw,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it breaks out of Ground within
Three or four yards off the foot of the Cliff,
which is near Forty yards high, and within a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96662:65"/>
quarter of a mile there is another Hill, that is
more than as high again as the Cliff, and a
descent all the way to the Cliff, so as the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
cannot lye long upon the Ground, yet it
is observable, that after a long Rain, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Spaw</hi> is altered in its taste, and
lessened in its operation; whereas a rainy day
or two will not sensibly hurt it. <hi>And now I
am transcribing out of this Author, give me
leave to add an Observation or two in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of Rains being the Original of
Springs. The first is</hi> (pag. 97<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>this;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>England,</hi> in the years 1654, 55. and 56.
when our Climate was drier than ever it had
been mentioned to be in any Stories, so as we
had very little Rain in Summer, or Snow in
Winter, most of our Springs were dried up,
such as in the memory of the eldest Men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had never wanted water, but were of
those Springs we call <hi>Fontes perennes,</hi> or at
least were esteemed so. <hi>He instances also a
Parallel Story out of</hi> Heylin'<hi>s</hi> Geography, <hi>in
the Description of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
relates;</hi> That in the days of <hi>Constantine</hi>
the Great, there was an exceeding long drought
there, so as in Thirty six years they had no
Rain, insomuch as all the Springs and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or Rivers, were dried up; so that the
Inhabitants were forced to forsake the Island,
and to seek for new Habitations for want of
fresh water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:96662:66"/>
                  <hi>The second is,</hi> p. 84. That in the <hi>Wolds</hi>
or <hi>Downs</hi> of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> they have many
Springs break out after great Rains, which
they call <hi>Gypsies,</hi> which jet and spout up a
great height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither is this Eruption of Springs after
long Rains, proper and peculiar only to the</hi>
Wolds <hi>of</hi> Yorkshire, <hi>but common to other
Countreys also, as Dr.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Britannia Baconica.</note> Childrey <hi>witnesseth
in these words:</hi> Sometimes there breaks out
water in the manner of a sudden Land-flood,
out of certain Stones, that are like Rocks
standing aloft in open Fields, near the rising
of the River <hi>Kynet</hi> [in <hi>Kent]</hi> which is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Common People a fore-runner of
Dearth. That the sudden eruption of Springs
in places where they use not always to run,
should be a sign of Dearth is no wonder. For
these unusual Eruptions, (which in <hi>Kent</hi> we call
<hi>Nailbourns</hi>) are caused by extream gluts of
Rain, or lasting wet Weather, and never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
but in wet years; witness the year 1648.
when there were many of them:—and to
our purpose very remarkable it was, that in the
year 1654. several Springs and Rivulets were
quite dried up, by reason of the precedent
Drought, which raged most in 1651, 1652,
and 1653. As the Head of the <hi>Stour,</hi> that
rises near <hi>Elham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and runs through
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> was dry for some Miles space:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96662:66"/>
and the like happened to the Stream that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Road-way between <hi>Sittingburn</hi> and
<hi>Canterbury</hi> at <hi>Ospring</hi> near <hi>Feversham,</hi>
which at other times ran with a plentiful Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but then wholly failed. <hi>So we see that
it is not infrequent for new Springs to break
out in wet years; and for old ones to fail in
great Droughts. And</hi> Strabo <hi>in his first Book
out of</hi> Xanthus <hi>the</hi> Lydian <hi>tells us, That in the
time of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>there was so great a
Drought, that Rivers, and Lakes, and Wells
of water failed, and were dried up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I cannot here also forbear to add, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
account he [Dr.</hi> Witty] <hi>gives of the
Supply of the Spring-well on the Castle-hill
at</hi> Scarborough; <hi>at which, I confess, I was
somewhat puzzled.</hi> This Well, <hi>saith he,</hi> though
it be upon the top of the Rock, not many yards
deep, and also upon the edge of the Cliff, is
doubtless supplied by secret Channels within
the Ground, that convey the Rain and Showers
into it, being placed on a dependent part of
the Rock, near unto which there are also Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
under an old ruinated Chappel, which after
a great Rain are full of Water, but are dried
up in a long Drought.</p>
               <p>As for what is said concerning the River
<hi>Volgas</hi> pouring out so much water into the
<hi>Caspian Sea,</hi> as in a years time would make
up a mass of water equal to the Globe of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96662:67"/>
the Earth; and of the hourly effusions of
the River <hi>Po</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>Ricciolus</hi> hath
computed to amount to 18000000 cubical
Paces of water. Whence a late learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath probably inferred, that all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in the World together, do daily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
half an Ocean of waters into the Sea,
I must confess my self to be unsatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
I will not question their Calculations,
but I suspect they are out in their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Opinion of Mr. <hi>Edmund Halley,</hi> that
Springs and Rivers owe their Original to
Vapours condensed on the sides of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
rather than unto Rains, I acknowledge
to be very ingenious, grounded upon good
Observations, and worthy of its Author; and
I will not deny it to be in part true in those
hot Countreys in the Torrid Zone, and near
it; where, by reason of the great Heats, the
Vapours are more copiously exhaled out of
the Earth, and its likely carried up high in
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rm of Vapours. The inferiour A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r at
least is so charged with them, and by that
means so very moist, that in some places
their Knives rust even in their Pockets; and
in the Night, so very fresh and cold, partly
also by reason of the length of the Nights;
that exposing the Body to it, causes Colds
and Catarrhs, and is very dangerous: Whence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96662:67"/>
also their Dews are so great, as in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to recompence the want of Rain, and
serve for the nourishment of Plants; as they
do even in <hi>Spain</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I shall first of all propose this Opinion in
the Words of the Author, and then discourse
a little upon it. After he had enumerated
many of the high Ridges and Tracts of
Mountains in the four Quarters of the World,
he thus proceeds:</hi> Each of which far surpass
the usual height to which the Aqueous Vapours
of themselves ascend, and on the tops of which
the Air is so cold and rarified, as to retain
but a small part of those Vapours that shall be
brought thither by the Winds. Those Vapours
therefore that are raised copiously in the Sea,
and by the Winds are carried over the low
Lands to those Ridges of Mountains, are there
compelled by the stream of the Air to mount
up with it to the tops of the Mountains, where
the water presently precipitates gleeting down
by the Crannies of the Stone; and part of the
Vapour entring into the Cavities of the Hills,
the water thereof gathers, as in an Alembick,
into the Basons of Stone it finds; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once filled, all the overp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us of water that
comes thither, runs over by the lowest place,
and breaking out by the sides of the Hills
forms single <hi>Springs.</hi> Many of these running
down by the Valleys or Guts between the Ridges
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96662:68"/>
of the Hills, and coming to unite, form little
Rivulets or Brooks. Many of these again
meeting in one common Valley, and gaining
the plain ground, being grown less rapid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a River: and many of these being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one common Channel, make such Streams,
as the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi>
which latter one would hardly think the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Water condensed out of Vapour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we consider how vast a Tract of Ground
that River drains, and that it is the sum of
all those Springs, which break out on the South
side of the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains, and on the
North side of the immense Ridge of the <hi>Alps,</hi>
which is one continued Chain of Mountains
from <hi>Switzerland</hi> to the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> And it
may almost pass for a Rule, that the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a River, or the quantity of water it
evacuates, is proportionable to the length and
height of the Ridges, from whence its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
arise. Now this Theory of Springs is
not a bare <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> but founded on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which it was my luck to gain in my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
at St. <hi>Helena;</hi> where, in the night time
on the tops of the Hills, about Eight hundred
yards above the Sea, there was so strange a
condensation, or rather precipitation of the
Vapours, that it was a great impediment to
my Celestial Observations; for in the clear
Sky the Dew would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96662:68"/>
each half quarter of an hour my Glasses with
little drops, so that I was necessitated to wipe
them off so often; and my Paper, on which I
wrote my Observations, would immediately be
so wet with the Dew, that it would not bear
Ink: by which it may be supposed, how fast
the water gathers in those mighty high Ridges
I but now named.—At last he concludes:
And I doubt not but this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is more
reasonable, than that of those who derive all
Springs from the Rain waters, which yet are
perpetual, and without diminution, even when
no Rain falls for a long space of time.</p>
               <p>This may, for ought I as yet see or know,
be a good account of the Original of
Springs in those fervid Regions, though even
there, I doubt, but partial; but in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and the more temperate Countries, I believe
the Vapours in this manner condensed, have
but little interest in the production of them,
though I will not wholly exclude them.
For,</p>
               <p>First, The Tops of the <hi>Alps</hi> above the
Fountains of four of the greatest Rivers in
<hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> the <hi>Danow,</hi>
and the <hi>Po,</hi> are for about Six Months in the
year constantly covered with Snow, to a
great thickness; so that there are no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
all that while that can touch those
Mountains, and be by them condensed into
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96662:69"/>
water; there falls nothing there but Snow,
and that continuing all that while on the
ground without Dissolution, hinders all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Vapours to the Earth; if any rose, or
were by Winds carried so high in that form,
as I am confident there are not. And yet for
all that, do not those Springs fail, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to run all Winter; and it is likely too,
without diminution; which is a longer time
than Droughts usually last; especially if we
consider that this want of supply, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and annual; whereas Droughts are but
rare and accidental. So that we need not
wonder any more, that Springs should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to run, and without diminution too,
in times of Drought. True it is, that those
Rivers run low all Winter, so far as the Snow
extends, and to a good distance from their
Heads; but that is for want of their acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
supplies from showers. Nay, I believe,
that even in Summer, the Vapours are but
rarely raised so high in a liquid form in
the free Air, remote from the Mountains,
but are frozen into Snow, before they arrive
at that height. For the <hi>Middle Region</hi> of the
<hi>Air,</hi> where the Walk of the Clouds is, at
least the superiour part of it, is so cold as to
freez the Vapours that ascend so high, even
in Summer time. For we see that in the
height and heat of Summer, in great Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96662:69"/>
storms, for the most part it hails: nay,
in such Tempests I have seen mighty show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of great Hail-stones fall, some as big as
Nutmegs or Pigeons Eggs; and in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
such heaps of them, as would load Dung
Carts, and have not been dissolved in a day
or two. At the same Seasons I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in some showers Hail-stones fall of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Figures, and throughout pellucid,
like great pieces of Ice, with several snags
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>angs issuing out of them: which how
they could be supported in the Air till they
amounted to that bulk and weight, is a thing
worthy to be more curiously considered.
For either they must fall from an incredible
height, the Vapours, they encountred by the
way, condensing and as it were crystallizing
upon them into Ice, and in time augmenting
them to that bulk; or else there must be
some strange and unknown faculty in the
Air to sustain them. That the superiour Air
doth support heavy Bodies better then the
inferiour, the flight of Birds seems to be a
clear demonstration. For when they are
mounted up on high, they fly with less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
and move forward with greater faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and are able to continue longer upon
the wing without delassation then in the
lower Air they could possibly do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they are to make great flights,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96662:70"/>
they soar aloft in the Air, at a great height
above the Earth. So have I often seen a

though their flight be swift, they seemed to
make but little way in a long time, and to
proceed on their journey with ease and very
leisurely by reason of their distance. And
yet one would think this were contrary to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

susperiour, should better support a weighty

progress in the superiour Air, as we
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96662:70"/>
see they do. And therefore possibly they
may be nearer the right, who suppose that
the Gravity of Bodies decreases proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to their distance from the Earth: and
that a Body may be advanced so high as
quite to lose its gravity and inclination or
tendency to the Center: of which I do not
see how it is possible to make experiment:
for to what is said by some to have been tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a bullet shot perpendicularly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
out of a great Gun, never descended
again, I give no credit at all.</p>
               <p>But to leave that, it is certain, that the
Vapours after they are mounted up to a
considerable height in the Air, are congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and turned into the immediate component
Principles of Snow, in which form I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they acquire a lightness, and are apt
to ascend higher than they could do, should
they retain the form of a humid Vapour;
as, we see, Ice is lighter than Water, out of
which it is frozen. But whether this be
the reason of their ascent or not, I am sure
of the matter of Fact, that these Snow-Clouds
do ascend far above the highest Tops
of the <hi>Alps;</hi> For passing over a Mountain
in the <hi>Grisons</hi> Country, on the very ridge, of
them, in the beginning of the Spring, it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nowed very fast during my whole passage
or six hours; and yet the Clouds seemed to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96662:71"/>
be as far above my head, as they do here in
<hi>England;</hi> and a great height they must be,
for the Snow to gather into so great flakes,
and to continue so long falling; nay, it may
be three times so long. Moreover, we see,
that the highest Pikes and Summits of those
Mountains are covered with Snow. And I
am assured, that all the Winter long at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
it Snows upon the Tops of the
<hi>Alps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the Spring time, when the Snow
dissolves, some of these Rivers that flow
down from the <hi>Alpine</hi> Mountains, run with
a full stream, and overflow their Banks, in
clear Sun-shine weather, though no Rain
falls, as I my self can witness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I presume, that all the rest do so too, as
the Inabitants affirmed. But in the Summer
time after the Snow hath been some time
melted, their Streams decay again, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any Vapours condensed upon them,
proportionable to the Droughts; neither are
there any Floods, but upon falls of Rain.</p>
               <p>3. That the Snow dissolved and soaking
into the Earth, is the Original of the <hi>Alpine</hi>
Springs; a probable Argument may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the colour of the Water of those
Rivers which descend from the <hi>Alps,</hi> at least
on this Northern side, which I observed to
be of a Sea-green, even to a great distance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96662:71"/>
from their Heads; which whence can it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
unless from the Nitrous Particles of the
Snow water, of which they consist? Another
also from the <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">Swoln Throats.</note>

an <hi>Endemial</hi> Disease of the Natives of
those parts, which Physicians and Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
attribute to the water they drink, not
without good reason; because, say they, it
consists of melted Snow, which gives it
that malignant quality.<note n="†" place="margin">De Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilit. Exerc. 60. Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaking

continet.</hi> But because <hi>Iulius Palmarius</hi>
may possibly be in the right, who imputes
this Disease to the steams of the Minerals,
especially Mercurial, wherewith these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
abound, which insect the waters, and
render them noxious to the nervous parts;
I shall not insist upon this particular.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of what I have said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Original of the <hi>Alpine</hi> Springs,
I shall add the Opinion of the Learned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus
Borellus</hi> concerning the Fountains
springing up or issuing out of the sides of
Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily, They are probably</hi>
(saith he) <hi>either generated, or at least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
from the melting of the Snow, which
doth perpetually occupy the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
And this is manifest, in that they are
not dimished nor decrease in Summer, as alse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96662:72"/>
it happens, but often flow more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
Lib. De incendiis <hi>Aetnae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> saith of Springs, that
they are perpetual and without diminution,
even when no Rain falls for a long space of
time. If he understands it generally of all
Springs, I add, that are accounted quick
ones too, I deny his assertion: that some
there may be of that nature, I grant: a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof may be given, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Out-let is too small to empty the water of
all the Veins and Earth that lye above it in a
long time. In our Native Country of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
there are living and lasting Springs ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at the feet of our small Hills and Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,
to which I am sure the Vapours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
very little; which is so obvious to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man, that I think I need not spend
time to prove it.</p>
               <p>Yet must I not dissemble or deny, that in
the Summer time the Vapours do ascend, or
are carried up in that form by the sides of
the Mountains to their highest tops, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them; for there falls no Snow there in
the heat of Summer; and that which lies
there, is for the most part dissolved. But
that Rain falls plentifully there, I my self
can witness; having been on the two highest
Tops of the Mount <hi>Iura,</hi> (which keeps the
Snow all Winter) on the one called <hi>Thuiri</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96662:72"/>
in a Thunder shower; and on the other, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>la Dolaz,</hi> in a smart and continuing Rain:
So that I will not deny, but in Summer time
the Vapours may contribute somewhat to the
Springs; as I have elsewhere intimated:
Clouds almost continually hanging upon the
tops of the Mountains, and the Sun having
there but little power.</p>
               <p>And now that I am discoursing of these
things, give me leave to set down an Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
I made in the last great Frost, the
sharpest that was ever known in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Man, which I had before met with in
Books, but did not give firm credit to, that
is, that notwithstanding the violence of the
Frost, all the Springs about us, brake out and
ran more plentifully than usually they did at
any other time: which I knew not what to
impute to, unless perchance the close stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Pores of the Earth, and keeping
in that part, which at other times was wont
to vapour away; which Account, I neither
then could, nor can yet fully acquiesce in.</p>
               <p>To this I will here add an Abstract of a
Letter written by my honoured Friend Dr.
<hi>Tancred Robinson.</hi>
               </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>

                     <p>YOV may peradventure meet with some
opposition against your Hypothesis of
Fountains, though indeed I am more and more
confirm'd in your Opinion of them, and the use
of the Mountains. <hi>Father Tachart</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Voyage to <hi>Siam,</hi> says, when he went up
to the top of the <hi>Table Mountain</hi> at the <hi>Cape
of Good Hope,</hi> the Rocks and Shrubs were
perpetually dropping and feeding the Springs
and Rills below, there being generally Clouds
hanging on the sides near the top. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
distillation of Vapours from the Ocean on
the many high Ridges of that great Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
may peradventure be one cause of the
wonderful fertility and luxury of the Soil
which produces more rare Plants and Animals
then any known Spot of Ground in the World;
the Discovery whereof is owing to the Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Wisdom of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
hath been frequently made by our
<hi>English</hi> Merchants in the <hi>Madera</hi> and <hi>Canary</hi>
Islands, (the first of which is near in the same
Latitude on the North of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> that
the afore-mentioned <hi>Cape</hi> is in on the South)
especially in their Iourneys up to the <hi>Pike</hi> of
<hi>Tenerist,</hi> in which, at such and such heights,
they were always wet to the skin, by the
droppings of the great Stones, yet no Rain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
head; the same I have felt in passing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96662:73"/>
some of the <hi>Alps.</hi> The Trees, which in
the Islands of <hi>Ferro,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and in <hi>Guiny,</hi>
are said to furnish the Inhabitants with most
of their water, stand on the sides of vast Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
<hi>Vossius</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Pomponius
Mela,</hi> affirms them to be <hi>Arborescent Feru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's;</hi>
though indeed, according to <hi>Paludanus</hi>
his dry'd Sample sent to the Duke of <hi>Wirten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
they seem rather to be of the Laurel kind;
perhaps there are many different sorts of them.
I believe there is something in the many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Travellers and Voyagers concerning
these Trees; but then I fancy they are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
when they say, the water issues out of
the Trees: The Vapors stop't by the Mountains
condense and distil down by the Boughs. There
being no Mountains in <hi>Egypt,</hi> may be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why there is little or no Rain in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and consequently no fresh Springs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their <hi>Caravans</hi> they carry all their
water with them in great <hi>Borracio's,</hi> and they
owe the Inundation of their River <hi>Nile</hi> to the
stationary or periodical Rains on the high
parts of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> This may be the cause that
the vast Ridge and Chain of Mountains in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi>
are continually water'd, when the great
Plains in that Countrey are all dry'd up and
parch't. This Hypothesis concerning the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of Springs from Vapours, may hold bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in those hot Regions within and near the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96662:74"/>
Tropicks (where the Exhalations from the Sea
are most plentiful, most rarify'd, and Rain
scarce) than in the Temperate and Frigid ones
(where it rains and snows generally on the
Vertices of the Mountains) yet even in our
<hi>European</hi> Climates I have often observ'd the
Firs, Pines, and other Vegetables near the
Summits of the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Appennines,</hi> to drop
and run with water, when it did not rain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
some Trees more than others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the density and smoothness of their
Leaves and Superficies, whereby the stop and
condense the Vapours more or less. The Beams
of the Sun having little force on the high parts
of Mountains, the interrupted Vapours must
continually moisten them, and (as in the head
of an Alembick) condense and trickle down;
so that we owe part of our Rain, Springs, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and Conveniencies of Life, to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Distillation and Circulation by the
Sun, the Sea, and the Hills, without even the
last of which, the Earth would scarce be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
This present year in <hi>Kent</hi> they have
had no Rain since <hi>March</hi> last; therefore most
of their Springs are dry at this very day,
as I am assur'd from good Hands. The
high spouting of water even to three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
perpendicular out of innumerable holes
on the Lake <hi>Zirknitz</hi> in <hi>Carniola</hi> after
Rains on the adjacent Hills, exceeds the

               <p>Since the receipt of this Letter, an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
(give me leave so to call it) occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to me, which much confirmed me in the
belief and perswasion of the Truth of those
Histories and Relations which Writers and
Travellers have delivered to us concerning
dropping Trees in <hi>Ferro, S. Thome, Guiny, &amp;c.</hi>
of which before I was somewhat diffident;
and likewise in the approbation of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
of my Learned Friend Dr. <hi>Tancred
Robinson</hi> for the solving of that <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
The same also induces me to believe, that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
may have a greater interest in the
production of Springs even in temperate
and cold Regions, than I had before thought.
The Experiment or Observation is this,</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>December 1691.</hi>
there happened to be a Mist, and that no
very thick one, which continued all day:
the Vapour whereof, notwithstanding the
Trees were wholly devested of Leaves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed
so fast upon their naked Branches and
Twigs, that they dropped all day at such a
rate, that I believe the water distilling from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96662:75"/>
a large Tree in twenty four hours had it
been all received and reserved in a Vessel,
might have amounted to a Hogshead. What
then may we rationally conjecture, would
have dropped from such a Tree; had it been
covered with Leaves of a dense Texture, and
smooth <hi>Superficies,</hi> apt to collect the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Vapour, and unite them into
Drops?</p>
               <p>It is clear by this effect, that Trees do
distil water apace when Clouds or Mists
hang about them; which they are reported
by <hi>Benzo</hi> constantly to do about the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Tree in <hi>Ferro;</hi> except when the Sun
shines hot upon it. And others tell us, that
that Tree grows upon a Mountain too: So
that it is no wonder, that it should drop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of water. What do I speak of
that Tree? all the Trees of that kind grow
on the sides of vast Mountains, as Dr. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
hath noted, yet he thinks that now and
then many Trees may run and distil in
Plains and Valleys, when the Weather has
been fair, but then this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> happens
very rarely; whereas in the other 'tis regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and constant. Besides that in hot Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Trees may in the Night time distil wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though the Air be clear, and there be
no Mist about them, seems necessarily to
follow, from Mr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Experiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96662:75"/>
Now if there be in Mists thus much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
condensed upon Trees, doubtless also
there is in proportion as much upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Earth and the Grass: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
upon the Tops and Ridges of high
Mountains, which are frequently covered
with Clouds or Mists much more; so much
as must needs have a great interest in the
production and supply of Springs, even in
temperate Countries.</p>
               <p>But that invisible Vapours, when the Sky
is clear, do at any time condense so fast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Trees, as to make them drop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
observed in <hi>England</hi> or elsewhere, no not
in the Night season; though I do not deny,
but upon the <hi>Appennine</hi> and Southern side of

However, considering the Penetrancy of such
Vapours, that in moist Weather they will
insinuate themselves deeply into the Pores of
dry Wood, so that Doors will then hardly
shut, and Chinks and Crannies in Boards and
Floors be closed up, I know not but that
they may likewise strike deep into the
Ground, and together with Mists contribute
to the seeding and maintenance of Springs,
in Winter-time, when the Sun exhales but
little; it being an Observation of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Therefore whenever in this Work I have
assigned Rain to be a sufficient or only cause
of Springs and Rivers, I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to exclude, but to comprehend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Mists and Vapours; which I grant to
have some interest in the production of them,
even in temperate and cold Regions; and a
very considerable one in Hot. Though I
cannot be perswaded, that even there they
are the sole Cause of Springs, for that there
fall such plentiful and long continuing Rains,
both in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies</hi> in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

something to their Original.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence we digressed,
that is, to the consideration of that <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
or Opinion, That all the Rivers of the
Earth discharge into the Sea half an Ocean
of waters daily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:96662:76"/>
I have read of some Philosophers, who i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
the Earth to be a great Animal, and
that the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea was
the respiration of it. And now methinks, if
this Doctrine be true, we have a further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to confirm their Opinion: For this
perpetual Motion of the water answers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well to the Circulation of the Blood; the
water moving faster in proportion to its
bulk through the Veins of this round Animal,
then the Blood doth through those of other
living Creatures. To which we may add
further, that to maintain this constant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
there is also probably about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earth a perpetual Fire, answering
to the <hi>Biolychnium</hi> in the heart: but if not
about the Center, yet certainly in profound
Caverns, and even under the very bottoms
of the Seas; to which some, and no mean
Philosophers, have attributed the Ebbing and
flowing of its waters.</p>
               <p>Let us then suppose that the Rivers do
daily carry down to the Sea half an Ocean
of water, and that the Rain supplies all that,
as our Opinion is, and see what we can infer
from thence: I think it will be granted that
ordinarily <hi>(communibus annis)</hi> the Rain that
falls in a whole year amounts not to above
one quarters continual Rain. Now if this

Mountains fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96662:77"/>
Cubits high. And yet the Scripture
doth not in plain terms say, that ever the
waters of the Flood arose fifteen Cubits above
the tops of the highest Mountains, as Mr.
<hi>Warren</hi> well observes.</p>
               <p>Besides, we are further to consider, that
this forty days Rain at the time of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
was no ordinary one, such as those that
usually distil down leisurely and gently in
Winter time, but like our Thunder-storms
and violent Showers, Catarracts, and Spouts,
which pour forth more water in an hour
then they do in four and twenty. So that
in forty natural days the Clouds would emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
out upon the Earth not eighty Oceans of
water, but above twenty times that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
If by the Windows of Heaven are
meant Catarracts, as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the word. And so we need not be to
seek for water for a Floud; for the Rain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
falling at that rate we have mentioned,
would if the Opinion of those men (who hold
that the Rivers discharge into the Sea half an
Ocean daily) were true, in the space of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
natural days afford water enough, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it run off no faster than usually it doth,
to cover the Earth, Mountains and all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did the Mountains help, but rather
hinder the descent of the waters down to the
Sea, straitning it into Channels, obstructing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96662:78"/>
its passage, and forcing it to take Circuits,
till it got above the Ridges and Tops of
them.</p>
               <p>As to this Argumentation and Inference
the case is the same if we hold that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
circulates through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Earth.
For supposing the Rivers pour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> half an
Ocean daily, and granting that in times of
Floods their streams are but double of their
usual Currents (though I verily believe they
are more than quadruple) and that the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Fountains be in like measure aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
it will follow that the daily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Rivers will amount to two
Oceans. Now at the time of the general
Deluge both these Causes concurred. For
there being a constant Rain of forty days,
there must on that account be a continual
Flood, and the Fountains of the great Deep
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing broken up, they must in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
afford as much Water as the Rain:
which whether it would not suffice in forty
natural days to produce a Flood as big as
that of <hi>Noah,</hi> notwit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>standing the continual
descent and going off of the Waters, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to the consideration of the Ingenious.
Especially if we allow, as is not unreasonable
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> suppose, that the Divine Providence
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> at first cause a contrary Wind to stop

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96662:78"/>
he raised an assisting one to carry
them off.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to add upon
this Subject, that is, that I do not see how
their Opinion can be true, who hold that
some Seas are lower than others; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the <hi>Red Sea</hi> than the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi>
For it being true that the Water keeps its
level, that is, holds its Superficies every
where equidistant from the Center of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
or if by accident one part be lower,
the rest by reason of their fluidity will spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
reduce the Superficies again to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
The Waters of all Seas communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
either above, or under ground, or both
ways, one Sea cannot be higher or lower than
another: but supposing any accident should
elevate or depress any, by reason of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or communication it would soon be
reduced to a level again, as might demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
be proved.</p>
               <p>But I return, to tell the Reader what I
think the most probable of all the Causes I
have heard assigned of the Deluge, which
is, the Center of the Earth being at that
time changed, and set nearer to the Center
or middle of our Continent, whereupon the
<hi>Atlantick</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> Oceans must needs
press upon the Subterraneous Abyss, and so
by mediation thereof, force the Water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96662:79"/>
and at last compel it to run out at
those wide Mouths and Apertures made by
the Divine Power breaking up the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the great Deep. And we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this to have been only a gentle and
gradual Emotion, no faster than that the
Waters running out at the bottom of the
Sea, might accordingly lowre the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
thereof sufficiently, so that none needed
run over the Shores. These Waters thus
poured out from the Orifices of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
upon the Earth, the declivity being
changed by the removal of the Center,
could not flow down to the Sea again, but
must needs stagnate upon the Earth, and
overflow it; and afterwards the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to its old Center, return also to their
former Receptacles.</p>
               <p>If any shall object against this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
because by it the Flood will be render'd To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical,
and restrained only to the Continent
we live in: though I might plead the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessariness
of drowning <hi>America,</hi> it being
in all probability unpeopled at that time; yet
because the Scripture useth general expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
concerning the extent of the Flood,
saying, <hi>Gen. 1. 19. And all the high hills that
were under the whole Heaven were covered;</hi>
and again, verse 22. <hi>All in whose nostrils
was the breath of lìfe, of all that was in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96662:79"/>
dry land died.</hi> And because the <hi>Americans</hi>
also are said to have some ancient Memorial
Tradition of a Deluge; and the Ingenious
Author of the <hi>Theory of the Earth</hi> hath by
a moderate Computation, demonstrated, that
there must be then more People upon the
Earth, than now: I will propose another
way of solving this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> and that
is, by supposing that the Divine Power
might at that time, by the instrumentality
of some natural Agent, to us at present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
so depress the Surface of the Ocean,
as to force the Waters of the Abyss through
the forementioned Channels and Apertures,
and so make them a partial and concurrent
Cause of the Deluge.</p>
               <p>That there are at some times in the course
of Nature extraordinary pressures upon the
Surface of the Sea, which force the Water
outwards upon the Shores to a great height
is evident. We had upon our Coasts the
last Year an extraordinary Tide, wherein
the Water rose so high, as to overflow all
the Sea-Banks, drown multitudes of Cattel,
and fill the lower Rooms of the Houses of
many Villages that stood near the Sea, so
that the Inhabitants, to save themselves, were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orced to get up into the upper Rooms and
Garrets of their Houses. Now how this
could be effected, but by an unusual pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96662:80"/>
upon the Superficies of the Ocean, I
cannot well conceive. In like manner that
the Divine Providence might at the time of
the Deluge so order and dispose second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as to make so strong a pressure upon the
face of the Waters, as to force them up to a
height sufficient to overflow the Earth, is no
way unreasonable to believe.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Hypotheses</hi> I propose, as seeming to
me at present most facile and consonant to
Scripture, without any concern for either
of them; and therefore am not solicitous to
gather together, and heap up Arguments to
confirm them, or to answer Objections that
may be made against them, being as ready
to relinquish them upon better information,
as I was to admit and entertain them.</p>

I shall content my self to have said
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96662:81"/>
in general, that it may rationally be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
there were then great Mutations and
Alterations made in the superficial part of
the Earth: but what they were, though we

knowledge of: and for Particulars, refer the
Curious to him.</p>
               <p>One malignant effect it had upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and probably upon other Animals too,
in shortning their Age, or the duration of
their lives; which I have touched before,
and shewn, that this diminution of Age, is
to be attributed either to the change of the
Temperature of the Air, as to Salubrity, or
Equality, (sudden and frequent changes of
Weather having a very bad influence upon
the Age of Man in abbreviating of it, as I
could easily prove) or else to the deteriority
of the Diet; or to both these Causes. But
how the Flood should induce or occasion
such a change in the Air and productions of
the Earth, I do not comprehend.</p>

               <p>ANother supposed Effect of the Flood,
was a bringing up out of the Sea, and
scattering all the Earth over an innumerable
multitude of Shells and Shell-fish; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these shell-like Bodies, not only on
lower Grounds and Hillocks, but upon the
highest Mountains, the <hi>Appennine</hi> and <hi>Alps</hi>
themselves. A supposed Effect, I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not yet agreed among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether these Bodies, formerly called
<hi>petrified Shells,</hi> but now a-days passing by
the name of <hi>formed Stones,</hi> be original Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of Nature, formed in imitation of
the Shells of Fishes; or the real Shells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
either remaining still entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt,
or petrified and turned into Stone,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96662:82"/>
or at least, Stones cast in some Animal Mold.
Both parts have strong Arguments and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.
I shall not balance Authorities, but
only consider and weigh Arguments.</p>
               <p>Those for the latter part, wherewith I
shall begin, are,</p>
               <p>First, Because it seems contrary to that
great Wisdom of Nature, which is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in all its Works and Productions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
every thing to a determinate end, and
for the attaining that end, make use of such
ways, as are most aggreeable to Man's reason,
that these prettily shaped Bodies, should have
all those curious Figures and Contrivances
(which many of them are formed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with) generated or wrought by a
<hi>Plastic Vertue,</hi> for no higher end, than only
to exhibite such a form. This is Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s
Argumentation. To which Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
<hi>That the end of such Productions, is,
to beautifie the World with those Varieties;
and that this is no more repugnant to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of</hi> Nature, <hi>than is the production of
most</hi> Flowers, Tulips, Anemones, <hi>&amp;c. of
which we know as little use of, as of formed
Stones.</hi> But hereto we may reply, That
Flowers are for the Ornament of a Body,
that hath some degree of life in it: a Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive
Soul, whereby it performs the actions
of Nutrition, Auction and Generation; which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96662:82"/>
it is reasonable should be so beautified. And,
Secondly, Flowers serve to embrace and
cherish the Fruit, while it is yet tender; and
to desend it from the injuries of Sun and
Weather; especially for the protection and
security of the <hi>Apices,</hi> which are no idle
or useless part, but contain the Masculine
Sperm, and serve to give fecundity to the
Seed. Thirdly, Though formed Stones
may be useful to Man in Medicine, yet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
afford us abundantly more uses, both in
Meat and Medicine.</p>
               <p>Yet I must not dissemble, that there is a
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in Nature, which doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
puzzle me to reconcile, with the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
observable in all its works; and seems
strongly to prove, that Nature doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>ludere,</hi> and delineate Figures, for no
other end, but for the Ornament of some
Stones, and to entertain and gratifie our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
or exercise our Wits. That is, those
elegant Impressions of the Leaves of Plants
upon <hi>Cole-state,</hi> the knowledge whereof, I
must confess my self to owe to my Learned
and Ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Edward Lloyd</hi> of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> who observed of it in some Cole-pits
in the way from <hi>Wychester</hi> in <hi>Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
to <hi>Bristol;</hi> and afterwards communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to me a Sample of it. That which he
found, was marked with the Leaves of two
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96662:83"/>
or three kinds of <hi>Ferns</hi> and of <hi>Harts-tongue.</hi>
He told me also, that Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> a <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner,</hi>
shewed him very good Draughts of
the common <hi>female Fern,</hi> naturally formed
in Cole, which himself found in <hi>Mendip</hi> Hills;
and added, That he had found in the same
Pits, Draughts of the common <hi>Cinquefoil,
Clover-grass</hi> and <hi>Strawberries.</hi> But these Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
are more diligently to be observed and
considered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are found in the Earth
at great distance from the Sea, real Shells
unpetrified and uncorrupted, of the exact
Figure and Consistency of the present natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sea-shells, and in all their parts like them,
and that not only in the lower Grounds and
Hillocks near the Sea, but in Mountains of a
considerable height, and distant from the
Sea. <hi>Christianus Mentzelius</hi> in his Discourse
concerning the <hi>Bononian Phosphorus,</hi> gives us
a Relation of many Beds of them found
mingled with Sand in the upper part of a
high Mountain not far from <hi>Bologna</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>

Mile distant (the name or the place is slipt
out of my memory) is a huge hanging
Mountain, broken by the violence of the
Torrents, caused by the confluence of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
descending from the Neighbouring
Mountains after frequent showers, throwing
down great heaps of Earth from it. In the
upper part of this broken Mountain are seen
many Beds or Floors of all kind of Sea-shells,
much Sand interposing between Bed and Bed,
after the manner of <hi>stratum super stratum,</hi> or
Layer upon Layer, as the Chymists phrase
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96662:84"/>
it. The Beds of Sand interceding between
these Rows of Shells were a yard thick or
more. These Shells were all distinct or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
one from another, and not stuck in
any one stone, or cemented together, so that
they might be singly and separately viewed
and handled with ones Hands. The Cause
whereof was their being lodged in a pure
Sand not intermixt with any Mud or Clay,
which kept the Shells entire for many Ages.
Yet were all these Shells, by reason of the
length of time they had lain there, easily
resoluble into a purely white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Calx</hi> or Ash.
<hi>Fabius Columna</hi> also observes, that in the
tophaceous Hills and Cliffs about <hi>Andria</hi> in
<hi>Apulia,</hi> there are found various sorts of Sea-shells,
both broken and whole, uncorrupt,
and that have undergone no change. And
<hi>Ovid in Metam. lib. 15.</hi>
                  <q>Et procul à pelago Conchae jacuere marinae.</q>
I am also informed by my learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Friend Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinson,</hi> That Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Settali</hi> shewed him in his <hi>Museum</hi> at
<hi>Milan,</hi> many <hi>Turbens, Echini, Pearl shells,</hi>
(one with a Pearl in it) <hi>Pectunculi,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other perfect shells, which he himself
found in the Mountains near <hi>Genoa;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
my said Friend took notice also of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96662:84"/>
several Beds of them himself, as he passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Mount <hi>Cenis,</hi> above fifty Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Sea; he assures me that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the great Stones about the Buildings
of <hi>London</hi> are full of shells, and pieces of
them. Moreover, my fore-mentioned
Friend Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> sent me perfect <hi>Escallop</hi>
and Sea-Urchin shells, exactly resembling
the like Sea-shells, both for figure, colour,
weight and consistency; which he himself
gathered up near <hi>Oxford.</hi> And hath lately
sent me word, That he found at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Rungewell-Hill</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> at a Village
called <hi>Hedley,</hi> three Miles South of <hi>Epsham,</hi>
at least Twenty Miles distant from the Sea,
some fossil Oysters, which by the confession
of Dr. <hi>Lyster</hi> himself, were indeed true Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shells
not petrified nor much decayed:
Nay, so like they were to Oysters newly
taken out of the Sea, that a certain Person
seeing of them, mistook them for such, and
opened one of them, expecting to find a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fish therein. Now that Nature should
form real shells, without any design of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
an Animal, is indeed so contrary to
that innate <hi>Prolepsis</hi> we have of the Prudence
of Nature, (that is, the Author of Nature)
that without doing some Violence to our
Faculties, we can hardly prevail with our
selves to believe it: and gives great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96662:85"/>
to the Atheists Assertion, That things
were made or did exist by chance, without
counsel or direction to any end.</p>
               <p>Add hereto Thirdly, That there are other
Bodies besides shells found in the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the Teeth and Bones of some Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which are so manifestly the very things
they are thought only to resemble, that it
might be esteemed obstinacy in any Man
that hath viewed and considered them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. Such are the <hi>Glossopetrae</hi> dag up in
<hi>Malta</hi> in such abundance, that you may buy
them by measure, and not by tale: and also
the Vertebres of Thornbacks and other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilagineous
Fishes there found, and sold for
Stones among the <hi>Glossopetrae,</hi> which have
no greater dissimilitude to the Teeth of a
living <hi>Shark,</hi> and Vertebres of a <hi>Thoruback,</hi>
then lying so long in the Earth, as they must
needs have done, will necessarily induce.
Mr. <hi>Doody</hi> has in his custody a petrify'd
lump of Fishes, on some of which the Scales
themselves still remain. And if the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
of these Bodies, is not enough to
convince any Man, that they are no Stones,
but real Teeth and Bones, <hi>Fabius Columna</hi>
proves it by several strong Arguments.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Those things which have a woody, bony
or fleshy nature, by burning are changed
first into a Coal, before they go into a <hi>Calx</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96662:85"/>
or Ashes: but those which are of a topha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
or stony substance, go not first into a
Coal, but burn immediately into a <hi>Calx</hi> or
Lime, unless by some vitreous or metallick
mixture they be melted. Now these Teeth
being burnt, pass presently into a Coal, but
the tophous substance adhering to them, doth
not so; whence it is clear, that they are of
an osseous, and no stony nature.</p>
               <p>Next he shews, That they do not shoot
into this form after the manner of Salts or
Crystal, which I shall have occasion further
to treat of by and by. Then he proves it
from the Axiom, <hi>Natura nihil facit frustra;</hi>
Nature makes nothing in vain. But these
Teeth, were they thus formed in the Earth,
would be in vain; for they could not have
any use of Teeth; as neither the Bones of
supporting any Animal. Nature never made
Teeth without a Jaw, nor shells without an
Animal Inhabitant, nor single Bones, no not
in their own proper Element, much less in
a strange one. Further he argues, from the
difficulty or impossibility of the Generation
of <hi>Glossopetrae</hi> in such places; because, among
<hi>Tophi</hi> and Stones in those dry places, there
could not be found matter sit for to make
them of. But granting that, he queries
whether they were generated at first all of a
sudden, or grew by little and little from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96662:86"/>
small to great, as Animals Teeth, whose sorm
they imitate, do. If the first be said, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
Whether the <hi>Tophus,</hi> out of which
they were extracted, were generated before
or after the Teeth were p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riected? If it be
said before, he asks, Whether there were a
place in it of the figure and magnitude of the
Tooth, or did the Tooth make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell a place?
If the <hi>Tophus</hi> were concrete before, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cavity, the vegetative power of the
Stone now in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th, could not by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orce make
it self a place in the hard and solid <hi>Tophus;</hi>
or if it could and did, the <hi>Tophus</hi> must needs
be rent. Against the production of these
Bodies in a compact Earth or Stone, <hi>Nic.
Steno</hi> argues thus; Things that grow, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding
themselves l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isurely or slowly, may
indeed lift up great weights, and dilate the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hinks and veins of Stones, as we see the
Roots of Trees sometimes do; but yet
while they do thus make room for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they cannot but be often hindred by
the resistance of some hard obstacle they
meet with, as it happens to the Roots of
Plants, which in hard Earth, being a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
ways writhen and compressed, recede
from the figure, which otherwise in soft Land
they are wont to retain: whereas these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies,
whereof we are new discoursing, are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll like one mother, whether they be dug
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96662:86"/>
out of soft Earth, or cut out of Stones, or
pluckt off Animals. Wherefore they seem
not to be at this day produced in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they are found, because (as we
have said) those things which grow in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
places are found strangely mishapen and
irregular, which these are not: nor was the
Earth compacted when they were there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for the same reason. <hi>Columna</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
If there were a place before ready
made in the <hi>Tophus,</hi> then was not that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
excavated in the <hi>Tophus</hi> by the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
nature of the Tooth it self; but the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
by its own nature and precedent cavity,
gave the form to the Tooth. If the latter
part be chosen, and it be said, that the Stone
by its vegetative power grew by degrees;
it may be answered as before, that could not
be; because the hardness of the <hi>Tophus</hi> could
not have yielded to the vegetative force of
the Tooth, but would rather have been rent
or divided by it; or rather the <hi>Tophus</hi> it
self must have vegetated, containing a cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or <hi>uterus</hi> of the shape of the Tooth, into
which an osseous humour, penetrating
through the Pores, and filling the cavity of
the <hi>Vterus,</hi> must there have co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gulated, and
taken the form thereof, as is observed in
Stones that have their original from a <hi>Fluor.</hi>
That both Tooth and Case might vegetate
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96662:87"/>
together he denies, because in all the Teeth
which he had seen, the <hi>Basis</hi> or Root was
found broken, and that not with an uniform
fracture, but different in every one. Which
Argument is not to be slighted, for that it
shews or proves, that there was no vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the case; because in all other figured
Fossils it is observed, that they are never
found mutilous, broken or imperfect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it reasonably be said or believed,
that these Roots or Teeth were by some
chance broken within the <hi>Tophi,</hi> but rather,
that when they were casually overwhelmed
and buried in that tophous Earth, they were
broken off from the Jaws of the Animal in
those volutations, and so in that manner mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated.
Against the generation of these and
the like Bodies in any hard Earth or Stone,
<hi>N. Steno</hi> argues thus, That they are not at
present produced in hard Earth, one may
thence conjecture, that in all the parts of
such Earth or Stone throughout, they are all
found of the same consistence, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
round on all sides with that hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For if there were some of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
anew at this present day, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
or ambient Bodies ought to give way
to them while they are growing, which they
cannot; and the Bodies themselves that are
now produced, would without doubt disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96662:87"/>
something wherein they differed from
those that were generated of old. Another
Argument to prove them to be true Teeth
and no Stones, he brings from their various
parts and figures, which must else have been
so wrought and formed in vain. The Tooth
being not one homogeneous Body, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of parts of a different constitution,
there must in the formation of it be made a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
election of humors, one for the root, one
for the inner part, one for the Superficies of it.
Then for the Figures, Magnitude, Situation or
Posture, and sitting of them; some are great,
and broad, and almost triangular; others
narrower and smaller, others very small and
narrow, of a pyramidal figure, some streight,
some crooked, bending downwards, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the neither side; some inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the left, others toward the right side:
some serrate with small Teeth, others with
great Indentures (which is observed in the
lesser triangular ones) some smooth without
any Teeth, as the narrow pyramidal ones.
All which things are observed in <hi>Shark</hi>'s
Teeth, not only by the Learned Naturalists,
but also by Fisher-men and Mariners. The
first row of Teeth in these Animals hanging
out of the Mouth, bend forward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
the second row are streight, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
toward the sides of the Mouth, where
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96662:88"/>
they are triangular and broad, the other
rows bend downward toward the inner part
of the Mouth. Thus far<note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. De Glosso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petra.</note> 
                  <hi>Columna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If these formed Stones be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
original Productions of Nature, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Shells and Bones, how comes it to
pass, that there should be none found, that
resemble any other natural Body, but the
Shells and Bones of Fishes only? Why should
not Nature as well imitate the Horns, Hoofs,
Teeth, or Bones of Land Animals, or the
Fruits, Nuts, and Seed of Plants? Now my
learned Friend Mr. <hi>Edward Lloyd</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
who hath been most diligent in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,
and curious in observing these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of any Man I know, or ever heard of,
tells me, That he never found himself, or
had seen in any Cabinet, or Collection, any
one stone that he could compare to any part
of a Land Animal. As for such that do not
resemble any part of a Fish, they are either
Rock Plants, as the <hi>Astroites, Asteriae tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,
&amp;c.</hi> or do shoot into that form, after
the manner of Salts and Fluors, as the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnites</hi>
and <hi>Selenites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Those that deny these Bodies to
have been the Shells and Bones of Fishes,
have given us no satisfactory account of the
manner of their Production. For that they
do not shoot into that form after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96662:88"/>
of Salts, may be proved by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
First, All Salts that shoot, their
Crystals or Concretions are of one uniform
substance, and their Figures are more simple,
and may be owing to the Figure of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
whereof they are compounded. In
other Bodies that shoot, as the <hi>Pyrites</hi> and
<hi>Belemnites,</hi> one may observe streight <hi>Radii</hi>
or Fibres proceeding from one Center. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Did those Bodies shoot into these
Figures after the manner of Salts, it seems
strange to me, that two shells should be so
adapted together at the heel, as to shoot out
to the same extension round, and the upper
and nether Valve be of different Figure, as
in natural shells. Thirdly, Were these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
produced in the manner of saline Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
it's strange there should be such
varieties of them, and their shapes so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and exactly circumscribed: so great a
diversity of Figures, arguing a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Salts, or of their modifications and
mixtures, than are likely to be found in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and the Concretions of Salts never,
that I have yet seen, appearing in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of Figure and due Circumscription,
as in these Bodies. This Argument <hi>Steno</hi> in
his Discourse concerning these Bodies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
and urges thus; Who can deny, that
the hexaedrical Figure of Crystal, the Cubes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96662:89"/>
of Marcasites, and the Crystals of Salts in
Chymical Operations, and infinite other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
coagulating and crystallizing in a fluid,
have Figures much more ordinate than are
those of <hi>Scallops, Cockles,</hi> and other Bivalves,
and also <hi>Periwinckles</hi> and <hi>Turbens?</hi> yet we
see in these simple Bodies sometimes the top
of a solid Angle cut off; sometimes many of
them without any order sticking one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
sometimes their Planes differing among
themselves in magnitude and situation; and
many other ways receding from their usual
Figure? Which being so, how much greater
and more notable defects must there needs
have been in Bodies that have a far more
compound Figure, such as are those which
unitate the forms of Animals, if they were
in like manner generated? Seeing therefore
in these Bodies, which are very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
these defects do seldom occur,
which in those other most simple Bodies are
very frequent; seeing there are no defects
observed in these compound Bodies, the like
whereto are not in like manner seen in the
Bodies of Animals. And seeing that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they are found they are exceeding
like both among themselves, and to the parts
of Animals, it is very unlikely they should
shoot into those Figures after the mannor of
Salts; but on the contrary, highly probable
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96662:89"/>
that they were originally the parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
the similitude of conformation in their
Pores, <hi>Striae,</hi> Hinges, Teeth, Prominences,
Threds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> almost necessarily inferring a
similitude of Original: which is an Argument
of the Government of some Principle, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to Matter figured and moved, in
their Formations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Were these Bodies nothing but
Concretions of Salts, or saline mixtures, it
seems no less strange, that so many Liquors
impregnated with all sorts of Salts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Juices, in all proportions, having been
at one time or other industriously or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
exposed to crystallize, and let stand
long in Vessels, there should never have
been found in them any such Concretions.
For if any had happened, we should doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have heard of them, and the Observers
would have improved such an Experiment
to the Production of the like Bodies at their
pleasure. So I have finished what I have to
alledge in defence of the latter part, That
these formed Stones were sometimes the real
Shells or Bones of Fishes, I mean the figured
part of them.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to set down, what may
be objected against this Opinion, or offered
in assertion of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That these
Bodies are primitive Productions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96662:90"/>
in imitation of the Shells and Bones of
Fishes.</p>
               <p>Against the former Opinion we have been
pleading for, it may be objected, That there
follow such strange and seemingly absurd
Consequences from it, as are hardly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
to Scripture, or indeed to sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
as,</p>
               <p>First, That the Waters must have covered
the whole Earth, even the highest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and that for a long time, there being
found of these Shells, not only in the most
mountainous parts of our Country, but in
the highest Mountains in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
and <hi>Alps</hi> themselves, and that not only
scattered, but amassed in great lumps, and
lying thick in Beds of Sand, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shewn. Now this could hardly be the
effect of a short Deluge, which if it had
carried any Shell-fish so high, would in all
likelyhood have scattered them very thin.
These Beds and Lumps of them necessarily
inferring, that they must have bred there,
which is a work of time.</p>
               <p>Now the general Deluge lasted in the
whole, but ten Months; and it's not likely
the Tops of the Mountains were covered
half that time. Neither is it less repugnant
to Reason than Scripture; for if the Waters
stood so high above the Earth, for so long a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96662:90"/>
time, they must by reason of their Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
be raised as high above the Sea too.
But what is now become of this huge Mass
of Waters, equal to six or seven Oceans?
May not the Stoicks here set in, and help us
out at a dead lift? The Sun and Moon, say
they, might possibly sup it all up. Yea,
but we cannot allow time enough for that;
for according to the moderate Draughts they
take now a-days, one Ocean would suffice
to water them many Ages, unless perchance
when they were young and hot, they might
need more drink. But to be serious, I have
no way to answer this Objection, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying,
that there are any Beds or great
Lumps and Masses of these formed Stones to
be found near the Tops of the <hi>Alps,</hi> or other
high Mountains; but yet there might be
some particular Shells scattered there by the
general Deluge. Unless we should say, that
those Mountains where such Shells are found
were anciently depressed places, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
raised up by Earthquakes. Another
thing there is as difficult to give an account
of, as of the Shells getting up to the Tops
of Mountains: that is, of those several Beds
or Floors of Earth and Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one above
another, which are observed in broken Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
For one cannot easily imagine whence
these Floor or Beds in the manner of <hi>strata
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96662:91"/>
super strata</hi> (as the Chymists speak) should
come, but from the Sediments of great
Floods, which how or whence, they could
bring so great a quantity of Earth down,
when there was but little Land above the
Sea, I cannot see. And one would likewise be
apt to think, that such a Bed of Sands, with
plenty of Cockle-shells intermixt, as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before in the Mountain near <hi>Bononia</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> must have been sometimes the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Sea. But before one can give a
right judgment of these things, one must
view the Mountains where such Layers and
Beds of Earth and Shells are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound: for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
they may not be elevated so high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the present Surface of the Sea, as one
would judge by the descriptions of them.
<hi>'Tis true</hi> (says my worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Robinson) that some Shells might have
been scatter'd up and down the Earth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments
of Armies, by the inhabitants of
Cities and Towns, whereof there are now no
remains. Mounsteur</hi> Loubere, <hi>the late</hi> French
<hi>Envoy to</hi> Siam, <hi>affirms that the Monkeys and
Apes at the</hi> Cape of Good Hope, <hi>are almost
continually carrying Shells and other Marine
Bodies from the Sea-side up to the Mountains;
yet this will not solve the matter, nor give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
satisfactory account, why these perfect shells
are disperst up and down the Earth, in all Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96662:91"/>
and Regions, in the deep Bowels of vast
Mountains where they lye as regularly in Beds
as they do at the bottom of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>secondly, It would hence follow, That
many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pecies of Shell fis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are lost out of the

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Philosophers hitherto have
been unwilling to admit, esteeming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of any one Species a dismembring
of the Universe, and rendring it imperfect:
whereas they think the Divine Providence is
especially concerned to secure and preserve
the Works of the Creation: and that it is so,
appears, in that it was so careful to lodge
all Land-Animals in the Ark at the time of
the general Deluge. The Consequence is
proved in that, among these petrified Shells,
there are many sorts observed, which are not
at this day, that we know of, any where to
be found. Such are a whole <hi>gentis</hi> of <hi>Cornua
Ammonis,</hi> which some have supposed to be
<hi>Nautili,</hi> though to me they do not seem so
to be, but a different <hi>Genus</hi> by themselves, of
which there have not any been seen either
cast ashore, or raked out of the Sea, at any
time, that ever I heard of. Nay, my very
Learned and Honoured Friend Dr. <hi>Lister</hi>
proceeds further, and saith, That when he
particularly examined some of our <hi>English</hi>
shores for Shells, and also the fresh Waters
and the Fields, that he did never meet with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96662:92"/>
any one of those <hi>Species</hi> of Shells found at
<hi>Adderton</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire, Wansford-Bridge</hi> in
<hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and about <hi>Gunthorp</hi> and
<hi>Beavoir</hi> Castle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any where else, but in
their respective Quarries. What can we say
to this? Why it is possible that many sorts
of Shell-fish may be lodged so deep in the
Seas, or on Rocks so remote from the shores,
that they may never come to our sight.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It follows also, That there have
been Shell-fish in these cold Northern Seas
of greater bulk and dimensions, than any
now living; I do not say in these, but in the
most Southernly and <hi>Indian;</hi> viz. <hi>Cornua Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis</hi>
of two foot diameter, and of thickness
answerable.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That there are no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
Shells that do in bigness much exceed
those of the natural Shell-fish found in our
Seas, save the <hi>Cornua Ammonis</hi> only, which
I suspect to have never been, nor had any
relation to any shells of Fishes: or to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
or resemble them, at least some of them.
Against this Assertion it may be objected,
That there are found in <hi>England</hi> may <hi>Pecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
bigger than any Shell-fish of that kind
which our Seas now afford. And that there
are no <hi>Nautili,</hi> or other testaccous Fishes
with us, comparable in bigness to that <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus</hi>-sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
of twenty eight pound found by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96662:92"/>
Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Keinsham.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That there may be Shell-fish in our
Seas, that do not at all, or very seldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
greater than we are aware of. I my
self, in company with Mr. <hi>Willughby,</hi> in the
Streight between the <hi>Isle</hi> and <hi>Calf</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi>
took up among the tall <hi>Fuci</hi> growing thick
upon the Rocks there, two or three of those
large <hi>Echini Marini</hi> or <hi>Sea-Vrchins,</hi> as big as
a Man's two fists, the shells whereof we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found cast up upon the shores of <hi>England,</hi>
nor ever heard that any Man else did. So
that I question not but there are lodged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rocks, and in the deeper places
of the Sea, remote from the shores, many
different sorts of Shell-fish, and excelling in
magnitude those that are commonly found
or known. And like enough it is, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flood there were many places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
and thrown up by the Sea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
dry Land, which had been Sea before;
which must needs be replete with these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
As for the <hi>Nautili,</hi> they are much
different from these <hi>Cornua Ammonis.</hi> For
the <hi>Nautili,</hi> at least all the Species of them
known to us, are (as Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> well observes)
extravagantly broad at the mouth, and have
not more than two other small turns at the
most, whereas the turns of the <hi>Ophiomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites</hi>
are proportionable one to another;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96662:93"/>
and in number many times four or five, and
sometimes six, if we may believe <hi>Aldrovand.</hi>
And there are <hi>Nautili lapidei,</hi> which do as
nearly resemble the <hi>Nautilus</hi> shells as any
other <hi>Cochlites</hi> do their respective Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types,
as Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> assures me he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
many in <hi>Museums.</hi> And the Learned
and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Richard Waller</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> in a Letter to
me dated <hi>Febr. 4. 87.</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of the <hi>Volutae,</hi> and in each Diaphragm, the
hole by which they communicate one with
another, by a string or gut in the Fish.
This was of a very hard Stone and large
size, weighing at least twenty eight pound,
though some part was broken off. Another
Argument that they have no relation to the
common <hi>Nautili,</hi> is, that they break into
pieces somewhat resembling Vertebres, as I
was first advised by the fore-remembred Mr.
<hi>Lloyd,</hi> and have since noted my self. I also
received from that very Ingenious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
Gentleman, happy in making na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Discoveries, Mr. <hi>William Cole</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi>
such an account of a sort or two of these
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96662:93"/>
                  <hi>Ophiomorphous</hi> Bodies, as is enough to stagger
any Man's belief, if not utterly to overthrow
his Opinion of their owing their original to
any Sea-shell; which take in his words. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others of this kind of Bodies which I
have observed, I shall instance in one, which
can be reduced to none but the</hi> Ophiomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,
<hi>which I found growing between the
thin Plates of a kind of brittle blew Slate in
large Rocks, some a furlong within the full
Sea-mark, and in some where the Water comes
not at highest Tides, only in great Storms,
when the Waves break, it is dasht sometimes
against them, being forced up by the Winds;
which being broken with a convenient Tool,
will shiver all into very thin Plates; between
which I have found in abundance of those Stones,
but as brittle as the Slate in which they grew,
and of the same consistence; but so thin, that
the broadest, being about four Inches, are not
so thick as a Half-Crown Piece, some not half
an Inch broad, were as thin as a Groat, and so
proportionably up to the largest, covered with
a Superficies as thin, and exactly of the colour
of Silver foil: and where the Sea-water wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, and they are exposed to the Sun and
Wind when the Tide is gone, they are tarnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and appear of a Gold, Purple, Blew and
Red; as any thing on which Silver foil is laid,
being exposed a considerable time to the Sun,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96662:94"/>
Wind and Weather, will do. These have the
same spiral Figures, and as regular as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Serpent-stones, and being taken off with
a Knife, leave the same Impressions on both
sides of the Slate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In some such Rocks of Slate, but much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I found some of those Stones of another
kind, thick in proportion to their breadth,
from an Inch to twenty eight Inches broad;
the broadest one was at the great end (on
which some Authors have fabulously reported
the Head to grow) six Inches thick: all of
them covered over with a white scale, which
will be taken off, one coat under another, as
Pearls or the shells of some Fishes. I saw
some impressions as big as the Fore-wheel of a
Chariot, <hi>&amp;c. What shall we say to this?
Were there ever any Shell-fish in ours, or
other Seas, as broad as a Coach-wheel? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as thin as a Groat? What is become
of all this kind of</hi> Ophiomorphite <hi>Shell-fish?
And yet (which is strange) both these kinds
by Mr.</hi> Cole<hi>'s description, seem to have been
covered with shells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what I have said concerning these <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiomorphous</hi>
stones not to have been <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tili,</hi>
I would not be thought to reflect upon,
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> detract from the Veracity or Exactness of
the Observations of Mr. <hi>Robert Hook,</hi> whom
for his Learning and deep Insight into the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96662:94"/>
Mysteries of Nature, I deservedly honour. I
question not, but he found in the <hi>Keinsham
Ophiomorphites</hi> perfect Diaphragms of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
distinct substance from that which filled
the Cavities, and exactly of that kind which
covered the out-side, being for the most part
Whitish, or Mother of Pearl coloured. Mr.
<hi>Waller</hi> fore-mentioned, attests the same,
writing in his Letter to me of <hi>Febr. 4. 1687.</hi>
that in the ordinary Snake stones there, the
shelly Diaphragms were very visible. In this
respect they do resemble <hi>Nautili;</hi> though
for their Figure they are much different, and
of a distinct <hi>Genus.</hi> I never broke any of
the <hi>Keinsham</hi> stones; but of those found about
<hi>Whitby</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> many; but could not
observe in them any shell-like Diaphragms,
only they broke into such pieces as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before. And my dear and much
honoured Friend Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinson</hi> writes
me, That he had broken several <hi>Cornua Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis,</hi>
but could never find any Diaphragms
or Valves in them, though he confesseth Mr.
<hi>Woodward</hi> shew'd him one with such in his
curious Collection of Petrifactions. So that
these Diaphragms are not to be found in all
the sorts of them. But if they be found in
some, it is a strong presumption, that they
were at first in all, however they came to
disappear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:96662:95"/>
In fine, these <hi>Ophiomorphous</hi> Stones do
more puzzle and confound me, than any
other of the formed Stones whatsoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s Description of those of
<hi>Keinsham,</hi> they seem to have been, or to
owe their original to shells; and yet there
is nothing like them appears at this day in
our or any other Seas, as far as I have seen,
heard, or read.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A second Argument to prove
these formed Stones never to have been
Shells, Dr.<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Nat. Oxs p. 117.</note> 
                  <hi>Plot</hi> affords us, Because that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those Shells, which so exactly represent
some sorts of Shell-fish, that there can be no
exception upon the account of Figure, but
that they might formerly have been Shells
indeed, at some places are found only with
one shell and not the other. Thus in <hi>Cowley</hi>
Common [in <hi>Oxfordshire</hi>] we meet only with
the gibbous, non the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lat shell of the petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>Oyster,</hi> and so of the <hi>Escallop-stones</hi> in
the Quarries near <hi>Shotover:</hi> which if they
had once been the shells of <hi>Oysters</hi> and <hi>Escal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops,</hi>
had scarce been thus parted. To this
I answer, That this Argument is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
conclusive; because there may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be some reason of it, though we know
it not, nor can easily imagine any. The
like Answer may be returned to his next Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:96662:95"/>
Thirdly, Because (saith the Doctor) I
can by no means satisfie my self, how it
should come to pass, that in case these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
had once been moulded in Shells, some
of the same kind should be found in Beds, as
the <hi>Conchites</hi> at <hi>Langley, Charlton, Adderbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and others scattered, as at <hi>Glympton,</hi> and
<hi>Teynton,</hi> and so the <hi>Ostracites</hi> at <hi>Shotover</hi> and
<hi>Cowley.</hi> Nor how it should fall out, that
some of these <hi>Bivalves</hi> should always be

                  </gap>ound with their shells separate, as the <hi>Ostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites</hi>
and <hi>Pectines:</hi> and others always closed
together, as the <hi>Conchites</hi> in all places I have
yet seen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Because many of these formed
Stones seem now to be <hi>in fieri,</hi> (which is the
Doctor's next Argument) as the <hi>Selenites</hi> at
<hi>Shotover</hi> and <hi>Hampton-gay,</hi> the <hi>Conchites</hi> of
<hi>Glympton</hi> and <hi>Cornwell,</hi> many of which were
of a perfect Clay, and others of Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
As for the <hi>Selenites,</hi> I grant them to have
been <hi>in fieri,</hi> because they are formed after
the manner of Salts by shooting or crystalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation;
but concerning the Clay Cockles, I
say with the Civilians, <hi>ampliandum.</hi> Since
the publishing of this Treatise, happening
to read Dr. <hi>Nicol Steno</hi>'s Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Bodies, in his <hi>Description</hi> of a <hi>Sharks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
I met with a very plausible Solution of
this Argument or Objection. First he gives
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96662:96"/>
us the History of these Bodies, or his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
concerning them; of which these
following are two, 1. That in <hi>Argilla,</hi> which
some english <hi>Potters Earth,</hi> and we may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Fat Clay, he had taken notice that
there were plenty of them on the <hi>Superficies</hi>
of the Earth, but within the Earth but a few.
2. That in the same <hi>Argilla</hi> the deeper you
descend downward, the more tender those
Bodies are, so that some of them at any the
least touch fall into Powder: and they also
that were on the <hi>Superficies,</hi> almost all of
them were without much ado reduced into a
white Powder. Now (saith he) seeing in such
kind of Earth, by how much deeper those
Bodies lye, by so much the softer they are,
and do less bear the touch, the Earth is so
far from producing them, that it doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destroy them. Neither is there any
reason to think, that they are therefore soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
because they are not yet arrived at their
perfection, or come to maturity: for those
things that are soft upon that account, while
they are in generating, have their parts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one another as it were by a kind of Glue
(as is seen in the tender shels of Pine-Nuts
and Almonds) but these Bodies, being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and destitute of all Glue, easily moulder
to Dust. Nor is it any Objection against our
Opinion, that on the surface of the Earth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96662:96"/>
their number seems to encrease, for that is
owing to Rains washing away the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Earth: but rather their consistence
when they are on the <hi>Superficies,</hi> being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and easily crumbled into Dust, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that their destruction begun in
the Earth, was interrupted by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Rain. But to give these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
their due, though they be not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
proofs, yet they infer a great degree
of probability, and shrewdly urge and shake
the contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>The other Arguments, the Doctor alledges,
admit a plausible solution, excepting such as
we have already touched, and given as good
an answer to, as either the matter will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or we were able to give.</p>
               <p>To the first, That there are found Stones
resembling Shell-fish that stick to Rocks: I
answer, That many of them might by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
be rub'd off the Rocks they stick to, or
thrust off by Birds insinuating their Bills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Shell and Rock, to feed upon their
meat; but by what means soever it be, that
they are sometimes broken off, the matter of
fact is certain; for we find many <hi>patellae</hi> cast
upon the shores by the working of the Sea;
Why then might they not be brought up by
the Flood?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:96662:97"/>
To the second, Why might not the Bones
of Whales, Sea-horses, all squamose Fishes,
the great shells of the <hi>Buccina, Murices, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chae
Veneris,</hi> and <hi>Solenes,</hi> and almost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the
crustaceous kind, as <hi>Crabs</hi> and <hi>Lobsters, &amp;c.</hi>
as well have been brought up and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
by the Flood, and afterward petrified,
as any of the testaceous kind? I answer, Of
the great <hi>Buccina, Murices</hi> and <hi>Conchae Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
there are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew or none found in our
Seas: It may be there are of them in the
Mountains and Quarries of the <hi>Indies,</hi> were
any Man so curious as to search them out:
Though it's likely but few, because being
great things, easie to be seen, and that part
of the World having been fully peopled soon
after the Flood, their beauty might invite
the Inhabitants to search them out, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them up. But secondly, Those other
kinds may possibly be less durable, and more
apt to be wrought upon, to moulder, decay,
and be dissolved in time by the Weather,
Rains and Moisture of the Earth, or were
not so susceptive of petrifying Juices.</p>
               <p>The Third Argument is already answered
in the precedent Discourse.</p>
               <p>To the Fourth Argument as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Selenites, Astroites</hi> and <hi>Belemnites,</hi>
we have answered already. That the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Brontiae</hi> cannot be the petrified Shells
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96662:97"/>
of <hi>Echini Spatagi</hi> the Arguments the Doctor
alledges out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Rondeletius</hi> do
not evin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. For though in some Seas they
may be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet in others are
they plentiful enough. In our own Seas at
<hi>Llandwyn</hi> in the <hi>Isse of Anglesey,</hi> we may
reasonably conjecture, they are more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than the common <hi>Echini</hi> any where
with us; because we found more of their
Shells cast up there on the shore, than of the
<hi>Echini</hi> in any shore about <hi>England:</hi> nay, so
common are they there, that even the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
have taken notice of them, and imposed
a Name upon them, calling them <hi>Mermayds
Heads.</hi> And though their Bristles or Prickles
were but small, yet were they not few or thin
set, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>How the Snake-stones about <hi>Huntly-nab</hi>
and <hi>Whithy</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> came to be included
in Globular or Lenticular Stones, is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to make out: for the Cliffs thereabout
being Allum-stone or Mine, wherein these
Snake-stones lye; the Sea in Spring-tides
and Tempestuous Weather undermines and
throws down part of the Shore or Cliffs,
which by the fall break in pieces, and the
<hi>Ophiomorphus</hi> stone being harder than the
rest of the Cli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, is broken off from it by the
fall, or its volutation in the Sea afterward,
with some part of the Cliff or Allum-stone
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96662:98"/>
slicking to each side of it where it is concave,
and by reason of its Figure and <hi>Striae,</hi> cannot
easily part from it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To dissemble nothing, I have my
self observed some Cockle-stones to have
seemingly different impressions or <hi>Striae</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same <hi>Superficies;</hi> which <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
it is very hard to give an account of. I have
also observed a large Stone almost as hard as
Marble, that was so marked every where
throughout with the impressions of Cockles
and their <hi>Striae,</hi> so crossing one another in
every part of it, that if it were nothing but
shells amassed together by a stony Cement;
those shells must have before their Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
been broken into infinite small pieces or
fragments, scarce any remaining entire;
which I do not see how any Floods or Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sea, could possibly effect.</p>
               <p>So I have finished what I had to say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this supposed Effect of the <hi>Deluge,</hi>
the bringing in of Shells, and scattering them
all over the dry Land. But yet I must not
dismiss this Particular, till I have said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to an Objection that presently occurs
to any one who considers this matter. The
Waters of the Flood having been supplied
partly by Rains, partly by the breaking up
of the Fountains of the great Deep, and not
by an Irruption or Inundation of the Sea,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96662:98"/>
how could any Sea-shells at all be brought
in by it?</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That the great Deep
communicates with the Sea; and the Waters
rising up out of the subterraneous Abyss, the
Sea must needs succeed, else would there have
been an empty space left in the middle of the
Earth; so that the Shell-fish might as well
come in this way from the bottom of the
Sea, as by an Inundation: in like manner as
the fish in the Lake of <hi>Carniola,</hi> called the
<hi>Zirchnitzer Sea,</hi> do descend annually under
ground through many great holes in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and return again by the same holes. To
all this I might add, that into the Lands near
the skirts of the Sea, and lower Hills, these
shells might in part be brought by particular
Floods, of which many we read of, and more
possibly than are recorded in any History
may have happened since the general <hi>Deluge.</hi>
Hence the chief Champions of the Opinion
of <hi>Mock-shells</hi> are not difficult to grant, that
in some Countries, and particularly along the
shore of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> there may
all manner of shells be found promiscuously
included in the Rocks or Earth, and at good
distances too from the Sea. Which are the
words of Dr. <hi>Lister,</hi> repeated and approved
by Dr. <hi>Plot.</hi> But this will not serve their
turn; for we have before proved, that in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96662:99"/>
middle part, and near the Center of our own
Country, at a great distance from the Sea,
<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> there are found not only
shell-like Stones, but real Shells, or Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells
(as some esteem them) for Figure, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Weight, Consistency, or any other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
not to be distinguished from true shells;
and that not such as have been accidentally
scattered there, but dig'd out of the Ground
in plenty, and of Fishes that are rarely found
in our Seas: Patterns whereof were sent me
by my Ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> who, I
hope, will ere long gratifie the Curious, by
publishing a general Catalogue of all the
<hi>formed Stones</hi> found in <hi>England,</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon them.</p>
               <p>And I have likewise proved by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that beyond the Seas, in high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and many Leagues distant from the
Sea too, there have been Beds of real shells.
I might have added <hi>Sharks</hi>-teeth or <hi>Glossope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae,</hi>
as both <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> and <hi>Georgius
Agricola</hi> testifie; if not in Beds, yet plentifully
disperst in the Earth. There are several Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Histories extant (as Dr. <hi>Tancred Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
informs me) of perfect shells found in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Bodies, in whose Glands they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
formed, which is a considerable
Objection, not easily to be removed.</p>

               <p>I Shall now Discourse a little concerning
such Changes as have been made in the
Superficial part of the Earth since the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge, and of their Causes.</p>
               <p>That there have been such I think no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and intelligent Person can deny, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so good Authority and Reason to prove
it. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> tells us, That the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests related to <hi>Solon</hi> the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Law-giver, who lived about 600 years
before our Saviour, that there was of old time
without the Straits of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> a vast Island,
bigger then <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> together, called
<hi>Atlantis,</hi> which was afterward by a violent
Earthquake and mighty Flood, and Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Water, in one day and night wholly
overwhelmed and drown'd in the Sea.
Whence it may be conjectured, that the Old
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96662:103"/>
and New World were at first continuous, or
by the Intervention of that Island not very
far remote from each other.</p>
               <p>That the Island of <hi>Sicily</hi> was of old bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off from <hi>Italy</hi> by the irruption or insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the Sea is generally believed, and
there is some memorial thereof retained in
the very name of the City <hi>Rhegium,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the <hi>Fretum</hi> that separates <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>Sicily,</hi> which signifies breaking off.

                  </q>
In like manner the Island called <hi>Euboea</hi> now
<hi>Negroponte,</hi> was of old joyned to <hi>Greece,</hi> and
broken off by the working of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Inhabitants of <hi>Ceylon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that their Island was anciently joyned to
the Main-land of <hi>India,</hi> and separated from
it by the force of the Sea.</p>
               <p>It is also thought, and there is good
ground for it, that the Island of <hi>Sumatra</hi>
was anciently continuous with <hi>Malacca,</hi> and
called the <hi>Golden Chersonese:</hi> for being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from afar, it seems to be united to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to come nearer home, <hi>Verstegan</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
and not without good reason, that our
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96662:103"/>
Island of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> was anciently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to <hi>Gaule,</hi> and so no Island but a <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula,</hi>
and to have been broken off from the
Continent, but by what means it is in his
judgment altogether uncertain: whether
by some great Earthquake, whereby the Sea
first breaking through might afterward by
little and little enlarge her passage; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were cut by the labour of Man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of commodity by that passage: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Inhabitants of one side, or the other,
by occasion of War did cut it, thereby to be
sequestred and freed from their Enemies.</p>
               <p>His Arguments to prove that it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
united to <hi>France,</hi> are, 1. The Cliffs
on either side the Sea, lying just opposite the
one to the other, that is, those of <hi>Dover</hi> to
those lying between <hi>Callice</hi> and <hi>Bouloin,</hi> (for
from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Callice</hi> is not the nearest Land)
being both of one Substance, that is, of
Chalk and Flint. 2. The sides of both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea plainly appearing to have
been broken off from some more of the same
stuff or matter, that it hath sometime by
Nature been fastned to. 3. The length of
the said Cliffs along the Sea-shore being on
one side answerable in effect to the length of
the very like on the other side, that is, about
six Miles. And 4. the nearness of Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in that place; the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96662:104"/>
distance between both, as some skilful Sailers
report. not exceeding 24. <hi>English</hi> Miles.</p>
               <p>Some of the Ancients, as <hi>Strato,</hi> quoted
by <hi>Strabo</hi> in the first Book of his <hi>Geography,</hi>
say, That the <hi>Fretum Gaditanum</hi> or Strait
of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> was forcibly broken open by
the Sea. The same they affirm of the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Bosphorus</hi> and <hi>Hellespont,</hi> that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
filling up the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, forced a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that way, where there was none before.
And in confirmation hereof, <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
in his Fifth Book gives us an Ancient
Story current among the <hi>Samothracians, viz.</hi>
That before any other Floods recorded in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
there was a very great Deluge that
overflowed a good part of the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi>
and the lower Grounds of their Island, when
the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea first brake open the <hi>Thracian
Bosphorus</hi> and <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and drowned all
the adjacent Countries.</p>
               <p>This Traditional Story I look upon as
very considerable for its Antiquity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
it seeming to contain something of
truth. For it's not unlikely that the <hi>Euxine</hi>
Sea, being over-charged with Waters by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Floods, or driven with violent
storms of Wind, might make its way through
the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> and <hi>Hellespent.</hi> But it will
be objected, That the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea doth emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it self continually by the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96662:104"/>
                  <hi>Hellespont</hi> into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and that
if it had not this way of discharge (the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
bringing in more than is spent by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour)
it would soon overflow all its shores,
and drown the circumjacent Countreys; and
so it must have done soon after the Flood;
and therefore it is not probable that <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrace</hi>
should have been inhabited before that
irruption, if any such there were.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, 1. That Monsieur
<hi>Marsilly</hi> thinks he hath demonstrated an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-current
in the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus,</hi> by
means of which the <hi>Euxine</hi> may receive as
much Water from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> as it
pours forth into it. But because I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
declared my self not to be satisfied
of the being and possibility of these under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents,
I answer, 2. The Annual receipts
from the Rivers running into the <hi>Euxine,</hi>
not very much exceeding what is spent in
vapour, who knows but that from the time
of the General Deluge till the Irruption
whereof we are discoursing, the <hi>Euxine</hi>
might yearly enlarge its Bason, and encroach
upon the Neighbouring Countreys?</p>
               <p>Natural Historians give us an account of
new Islands raised up in the Sea: <hi>Plin. Hist.
Nat. lib. 2. cap. 87. enumerates. Delos</hi> and
<hi>Rhodes</hi> Islands of note; and of less account
and later emersion <hi>Anaphe</hi> beyond <hi>Melos,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:96662:105"/>
and <hi>Nea</hi> between <hi>Lemnos</hi> and the <hi>Hellespont:
Alone</hi> between <hi>Lebedos</hi> and <hi>Teos,</hi> and among

most considerable and remarkable mutations
that have been made in the Earth have been
on the Sea-coasts, either by carrying on the
Land into the Lea, and atterrating the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Sea; or by drowning the Lands
near the Sea, by Irruptions and Inundations
thereof, or undermining or washing away
the shores.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort of Change by Atterration,
or making the Sea dry Land, we have an

and there supplied, might easily be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and converted into Sea again: and of
the great harms that these Parts have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
by the Irruption of the Sea sustained.
But now not only those low Places that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
upon the Sea, as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi>
but the greater part of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
though they lye not so low as they,
but of such height as no Inundation of the
Sea can any whit annoy them, though the
Sand-Banks and Downs on the Sea-side were
never so much broken or cut through, yet
are they as even and level as even <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Zealand</hi> themselves, which is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
demonstration, that they were once co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Water. For that Water will thus
level Ground, it often runs over, is clear
from Meadows, and from the bottom of the
Sea discovered at Low-water; and we have
Experience of no other Cause that doth or
can effect it. And therefore <hi>Lewis Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
erroneously argues <hi>Hubert Thomas</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to Count <hi>Frederick Palatine</hi> of the
<hi>Rhine</hi> of a Mistake, for saying in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> that the
Sea hath come up even to <hi>Tongres</hi> Walls,
now well nigh an hundred <hi>English</hi> Miles
from the Sea: among other good Reasons,
alledging for the proof thereof, that the
great Iron-rings are there yet remaining, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96662:106"/>
which the Ships that there sometimes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
were fastned. I say erroneously, seeing
all the Countreys between that and the Sea
are level, and of an equal <hi>Superficies,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Hills or Risings. 2. This appears
not only from the great plainness and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Ground, but in that the Soil ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
whence it seems naturally to follow,
that those Countreys were anciently the
Flats, Sands, or shores of the Sea. 3. In that
digging about two Fathom more or less deep
in the Earth innumerable shells of Sea-fish
are found, and that commonly in all places
both of Field and Town; and in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the great Bones of Fishes.</p>
               <p>Further (saith <hi>Verstegan</hi>) it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that albeit digging deep in the Earth in
<hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> great abundance of
shels and bones of Fishes are to be found; yet
digging in the Earth in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
none at all are perceived; howbeit on
the Sands on the Sea-shore there are very
many. The reason whereof may be because
those parts have been in time long past part
of the depth of the Sea: and the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> the flats or
shore; and on the flats, and not in the
depths, such kind of Shell-fish are naturally
nourished. This is a very plausible account.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96662:106"/>
But yet it hath been by experience found,
that if you dig deep enough, even in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it self, after many floors of several sorts
of Earth, you will at last come to Beds of
shells. For <hi>Varenius</hi> tells us, that sinking a
Well in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> after many beds or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Earth, Sand, Turf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
foot depth they came to a bed of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
mixt with Cockle-shells of four foot
thickness, which doubtless was of old time
the bottom of the Sea, and all the other
beds above it were brought down partly by
Floods subsiding and settling there, partly by
the working of the Sea spreading beds of
Sand upon the layers of the Earth, and so
interchangeably. But from this Experiment
it doth appear, that however deep the Sea
were thereabouts, yet it was not too deep to
breed or harbour shell-fish.</p>
               <p>Another great instance of Change made
in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth by atterration
is in our own Country, the great level of
the Fens running through <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi>
the <hi>Isle of Ely</hi> in <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi>
and <hi>Marshland</hi> in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Which that it
was sometime part of the Sea, and atterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Land brought down by Floods from
the upper Grounds, seems to me evident, in
that it is near the Sea, and in that there is
thereabout a concurrence of many great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96662:107"/>
which in Flood-times by the abundance
of mud and silt they bring down there sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding,
have by degrees raised it up: and
thirdly in that the whole Country is exactly
level, like the bottom of the Sea; it being
(as I have already said) the nature of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flowing over the Earth in time to level
and bring to a plain all places that are soft
and yielding, and not rocky, as is seen in
Meadows, and in the bottom of the Sea
discovered at Low-water.</p>
               <p>A third Instance is the <hi>Craux</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> anciently called <hi>Campus Lapideus,</hi>
of which <hi>Pliny</hi> saith it was <hi>Herculis praelio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
memoria;</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> out of <hi>Aeschylus</hi>
gives us a Poetical Fable, that the stones
were rained down by <hi>Iupiter</hi> in favour of
<hi>Hercules</hi> when he wanted Darts, that he
might cast them at the <hi>Ligurian</hi> Army, and
thereby break and scatter it. <hi>Posidonius</hi>
thinks it was once a Lake, which by fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
dried up; and so the stones came to
be equally dispersed over the bottom of it.
That it was a very ancient thing, is clear,
having its original in the fabulous times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Memoirs of true History: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to this day such a kind of place as it
was in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time. It appears so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to any one who hath viewed and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it, to have been once part of the Sea,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96662:107"/>
from its being exactly level, and strowed all
over with stones, as I have observed the
bottom of the Sea in many places to be, that
there is not the least reason to doubt of it.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Arnus</hi> in <hi>Tuscany</hi> now falleth
into the Sea six Miles below <hi>Pisa:</hi> whereby
it appeareth, (saith Dr. <hi>Hakewil</hi>) that the
Land hath gained much upon the Sea in that
Coast, for that <hi>Strabo</hi> in his time reporteth,
it was but twenty Furlongs (that is, but two
Miles and an half) distant from the Sea.</p>
               <p>I might to these add many other Instances
of Atterrations out of <hi>Strabo</hi> in his first Book;
as about the Outlets of <hi>Ister</hi> the places cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Stethe</hi> and the Deserts of <hi>Scythia:</hi> about
those of <hi>Phasis</hi> the Sea-coast of <hi>Colchis,</hi>
which is sandy, and low and soft. About
<hi>Thermodon</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> all <hi>Themiscyra,</hi> the plain
of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and the most part of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit the whole Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which
probably was covered originally with the
Sea, and raised up by the mud and silt
brought down by the <hi>Nile</hi> in its Annual
Floods subsiding there, as I shall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to shew afterwards.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Varenius</hi> rationally conjectures
that all <hi>China,</hi> or a great part of it, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
thus raised up and atterrated, having
been anciently covered with the Sea: for that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96662:108"/>
that great and impetuous River, called the
Yellow or Saffron River, coming out of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
and very often, though not at anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
seasons, overflowing the Countrey of
<hi>China,</hi> is said to contain in it so much Earth
and Sand, as make up a third part of its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The evenness and level <hi>Superficies</hi> of
this whole Country of <hi>China</hi> render this
Conjecture the more probable.</p>
               <p>In fine, the like Atterrations appear to
have been made about the Mouths of <hi>Indus</hi>
and <hi>Ganges</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and the River
<hi>de la Plata</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> and the <hi>Rhodanus</hi>
in <hi>France;</hi> and doubtless most other great
Rivers throughout the whole World.</p>
               <p>To all which if we add the spatious Plains
that are on each side most great Rivers from
their Mouths many Miles up their Channels,
as may be observed in the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> which probably were at first <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuses</hi>
of the Sea, landed up by Earth brought
down from the Mountains and upper Grounds
in times of Floods; it will appear that in this
respect there hath been a very great Change
made in the Terraqueous Globe, the dry
Land much enlarged, and the Sea straitned
and cut short.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:96662:108"/>
But you will say, Hath there been no
compensation made for all this: Hath not
the Sea other-where gained as much as it hath
lost about the Mouths of the Rivers? If not,
then the Sea will in time be so far landed up,
or straitned till it be compelled to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and overflow the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That where the shores
are Earthy or Argillaceous, or Gravelly, or
made of any crumbling and friable matter,
the Sea doth undermine and subvert them,
and gain upon the Land; which I could
prove by many Instances, some of which I
shall afterward touch. But whether the Sea
doth in these places gain proportionably to
what it loses in the fore-mentioned, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Vulgar Proverb, is to me some
what questionable.</p>
               <p>To proceed now to discourse a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Changes that have been made
by the Irruptions and Inundations of the Sea,
or by its undermining and washing away the
shores.</p>
               <p>That there have been of old great Floods,
and much Land laid under Water by Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Sea, is clear, many such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recorded in History.</p>
               <p>The most ancient of all, next to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Deluge in the days of <hi>Noah, viz.</hi> that
of <hi>Ogyges</hi> King of <hi>Boetia,</hi> or rather <hi>Attica,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:96662:109"/>
seems to have been of this nature: So doth
that of a great part of <hi>Achaia</hi> in <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
wherein the Cities of <hi>Bura</hi> and <hi>Helice</hi>
were overwhelmed and laid under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambden</hi> out of <hi>Gyraldus</hi> reports, That
anciently a great part of <hi>Pembrokeshire</hi> ran
out in the form of a Promontory towards
<hi>Ireland;</hi> as appears by that Speech of King
<hi>William Rufus,</hi> That he could easily with his
Ships make a Bridge over the Sea, so that he
might pass on foot from thence to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
This Tract of Ground being all buried in
deep Sands during the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>Second,</hi> was by the violence of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
storm so far uncovered, that many stumps
of great Trees appeared fastned in the Earth:
<hi>Ictúsque securium tanquam hesterni</hi> (saith <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus)
and the strokes of the Axes in them,
as if they had been cut but yesterday; ut non
littus jam, sed lucus esse videretur, mirandis
rerum mutationibus;</hi> so that now it made
shew of a Wood rather than of a Strand;
such is the wonderful Change of all things.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First of
<hi>England</hi> there happened a mighty Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereby a great part of the
Country was irrecoverably lost, and many
of the poor distressed People, being bereft of
their Habitation, came into <hi>England;</hi> where
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96662:109"/>
the King in compassion of their Condition,
and also considering that they might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to his Subjects, by instructing them
in the Art of Clothing, first placed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Carlisle</hi> in the North, and after remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them into <hi>South-Wales,</hi> where their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
hath ever since remained.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1446. there perished 10000
People by the breaking in of the Sea at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drecht</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and thereabouts; and about
<hi>Dullart</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> and in <hi>Zealand,</hi> above
100000 were lost, and two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Villages drowned, some of their Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Towers, when the Tide is out, still
appearing above water.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> of <hi>Antony</hi> in his <hi>Survey of
Cornwal,</hi> affirmeth, That the Sea hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
from that Shire the whole County of
<hi>Lioness.</hi> And that such a County there was
he very sufficiently proves by many strong
Reasons. <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> reports
out of ancient Records, That upon the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Coast, not far from <hi>Thanet,</hi> is a sandy
dangerous place, (which the Inhabitants call
<hi>Goodwyns Sands</hi>) where an Island (being the
Patrimony of Earl <hi>Goodwyn</hi>) was swallowed
up in the Year 1097.</p>
               <p>But the greatest Change of this kind that
ever was made (if it be true) was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion
of the vast Island o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Atlantis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have already spoken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:96662:110"/>
As for the Changes that have been made
by undermining and washing away the
shores, they have been partly the diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Land, and partly the raising up
of several Islands not far from the shores. So
the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea hath invaded the shores of
<hi>Pomerania,</hi> and destroyed a famous Mart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town
called <hi>Vineta.</hi> So the ancient Borough
of <hi>Donewich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi> is almost quite eaten
away and ruined by the Encroachments of
the Sea. And it is said that the Ocean hath
cut off twenty Miles from the North part
of the Island of <hi>Ceylan</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> so that it is
much less at this day than formerly it was.
And many the like Examples there are. And
for the raising up of Islands near the shore,
very likely it is that the Sea continually
preying upon the shore, and washing away
abundance of Earth from thence, cannot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it far to any great distance from the
shores, but lets it fall by little and little in
their Neighbourhood: which subsiding or
settling continually for some Ages, at last
the heaps ascend up to the very <hi>Superficies</hi>
of the Water, and become Islands. Hence
in the middle of the Ocean, there are no
Islands, or but a very few, because those
parts are too remote from the shores for any
Earth washed from thence to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if it were, yet the Sea thereabout
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96662:110"/>
is too deep to have any heap raised in it so
high: besides, the motions of the Water in
those depths, were there Earth enough, would
overthrow any heap before it could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
any thing near the top. But all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands
in general, a very few excepted, are
about the shores, or not far from the shores
of the great Continents. Which thing is
especially to be remarked in all the great
heaps or swarms of numerous Islands, they
being all near to the Continents; those of
the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea to <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperides</hi>
to <hi>Africa;</hi> and the <hi>Maldivae,</hi> (which
are thought to amount to eleven thousand)
to <hi>India:</hi> only the <hi>Flandricae</hi> or <hi>Azores</hi> seem
to be situate in the middle of the Ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these Changes about the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coasts,
by the prevailing of the Land upon
the Sea, in some places, and the Sea upon
the Land in others, the whole Continents
seem to suffer a considerable mutation by
the diminution, and depression or sinking of
the Mountains, as I shall have occasion to
shew afterward in the third Discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aelian</hi> in his eighth Book, <hi>cap. 11.</hi> telleth
us, that not only the Mountain <hi>Aetna,</hi> but
<hi>Parnassus</hi> and <hi>Olympus</hi> did appear to be less
and less to such as sailed at Sea, the height
thereof sinking. Of this lowring and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96662:111"/>
of the Mountains I shall not say much
in this place, but taking it for granted at
present; only in brief intimate the Causes
of it, assigned by that learned Mathematician
<hi>Iosephus Bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>canus,</hi> which are partly Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,
and partly Rivers, which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at out both the tops and sides and feet
of Mountains, and fill up the lower places of
the Valleys, making the one to encrease, and
the other to decrease; whereby it appears
(saith Dr. <hi>Hakewil</hi>) that what the Mountain
loseth the Valley gains; and consequently,
that in the whole Globe of the Earth nothing
is lost, but only removed from one place to
another; so that in process of time the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mountains may be humbled into Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys:
and again (which yet I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him) the lowest Valleys exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed into
Mountains. He proceeds, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> (as
<hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> reports in his Life) being
demanded what he thought, Whether the
Mountains called <hi>Lapsaceni</hi> would in time
be covered with Sea? answered <hi>Yes, unless
time it self fail;</hi> which answer of his seems
to confirm the opinion of <hi>Blancanus De Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
fabrica, cap. 4.</hi> where he maintains, That
if the World should last long enough, by
reason of this continual decrease of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the levelling of the Valleys, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96662:111"/>
Earth would again be overslown with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as at first it was.</p>
               <p>Beside these more eminent and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Changes, which in process of time, after
a long succession of many Ages, threaten
some great effect; indeed no less then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the World to its primitive state
before the separation of the Land and Water.
There have been many other lesser mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made either by Earthquakes and Eructa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of burning Mountains, or by great
Floods and Shots of Rain, or by violent or
tempestuous Winds and Hurricans, some
whereof are mentioned by Naturalists and
Historians, <hi>Strabo, Pliny, Seneca, Ovid,</hi> and
others.</p>
               <p>For Earthquakes, <hi>Posidonius,</hi> quoted by
<hi>Strabo,</hi> in his first Book, writes, That there
was a City in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> situate above <hi>Sidon,</hi>
swallowed up by an Earthquake, and that
almost two thirds of <hi>Sidon</hi> it self fell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though not suddenly and all at once, so
that there was no great destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of men happened. The same extended
almost over all <hi>Syria,</hi> though not violently,
and reached as far as some of the <hi>Cyclades</hi>
Islands; and <hi>Euboea,</hi> where the Fountains of
<hi>Arethusa</hi> in <hi>Chalcis</hi> were stopped up by it,
and after many days broke forth again at
another source: neither did it cease to shake
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96662:112"/>
the Island by parts, till the Earth opening in
the Field <hi>Lelantus</hi> vomited out of a River of
fiery Clay.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us, That <hi>Democles</hi>
mentions huge Earthquakes of old in <hi>Lydia</hi>
and <hi>Ionia,</hi> extending as far as <hi>Troas,</hi> by which
many Villages were swallowed up, and <hi>Sipy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
overthrown when <hi>Tantalus</hi> reigned, and
great Lakes made of Fens.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Duris</hi> saith, That the <hi>Rhagades</hi>
Islands by <hi>Media</hi> were so called from the
Lands about the <hi>Caspiae Portae</hi> being torn and
broken by Earthquakes, so that many Cities
and Villages were overthrown, and several
Rivers received alterations.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Demetrius Calatianus</hi> relating the
Earthquakes that happened throughout
<hi>Greece,</hi> writes, That a great part of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chades</hi>
Islands and <hi>Cenaeus</hi> had been drowned
thereby; and that the hot Baths at <hi>Aedep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
and in <hi>Thermophylae,</hi> having been stopt
for three days, slowed again, and those of
<hi>Aedepsus</hi> from new Sources. That the Wall
of <hi>Oreus</hi> on the Sea-side, and seven hundred
Houses, were thrown down; and a great
part of <hi>Echinus</hi> and <hi>Heraclea Trachinia;</hi> but
the whole building of <hi>Phalarnus</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

was the subversion of the noted
Town of <hi>S. Eufemia,</hi> which was quite lost
out of their sight and absorpt, and instead
thereof, nothing left but a stinking Lake.
But for a full account thereof I refer the
Reader to the said Preface.</p>
               <p>Not many years ago the famous City of
<hi>Ragusa</hi> was almost wholly subverted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by a terrible Earthquake; and <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
has lately been demolished by one. From
the <hi>West-Indies</hi> we hear frequently of great
Damages done in our Plantations by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.
The printed Transactions and Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
are full of these great Concussions and
Subversions.</p>
               <p>This present Year 1692. on the Seventh
day of <hi>Iune</hi> there happened a dreadful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
in the Island of <hi>Iamaica</hi> which made
great Ruins and Devastations throughout
the whole Country, but especially in the
Capital Town of <hi>Port Royal,</hi> which was
almost swallow'd up and overflow'd, by the
sinking of the Earth, and irruption of the
Sea: a full Account whereof contained in
two Letters, sent from the Minister of the
Place, the one dated <hi>Iune</hi> the 22d, the other
the 28th of the same Month, 1692. from
aboard the <hi>Granada</hi> in <hi>Port-Royal</hi> Harbour,
to a Friend of his <hi>England,</hi> and published by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96662:114"/>
Authority, I shall give the Reader, with
some Remarks.</p>
               <p>1. He tells us in general, That this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
threw down almost all the Houses,
Churches, Sugar-works, Mills and Bridges
throughout the whole Island: That it tore
the Rocks and Mountains [others tell us,
that it levelled some Mountains, and reduced
them to Plains] that it destroyed some whole
Plantations, and threw them into the Sea;
but that <hi>Port-Royal</hi> had much the greatest
share in this terrible Judgment.</p>
               <p>2. Then he acquaints us, what for to
save the Reputation of the People, and to
avoid the laying a perpetual blot upon them,
I should rather suppress and conceal, but for
the vindication of the Divine Providence and
Justice, and to deter others from the like
Enormities, I think necessary to publish,
That the Inhabitants of that Place were a
most ungodly and debauched People, and so
desperately wicked, that he was even afraid
to continue among them: for that very day
this terrible Earthquake was, as soon as night
came on, a company of lewd Rogues, whom
they call Privateers, fell to breaking open
Warehouses and Houses deserted, to rob and
ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e their Neighbours, whilst the Earth
trembled under them, and some of the
Houses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell upon them in the Act. [The

wandered up and down the Country, even
in the very smoke, during the last great

And those audacious Whores that remained
still upon the Place, were as impudent and
drunken as ever; and that since the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
when he was on shore to pray with
the brui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith positively, That there was not a more

whole Streets beyond it. Himself, with the
President of the Council, being in a House
near where the Merchants meet, hearing the
Church and Tower fall, ran to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
He having lost the President, made
toward <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Fort, because being a wide
open place, he thought to be there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecurest
from the falling Houses, but as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he saw the Earth open, and swallow up
a multitude of People, and the Sea mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in upon them over the Fortifications:
Moreover he tells us, That their large and
famous Burying place, called the <hi>Pallisado's,</hi>
was destroyed by the Earthquake; and that
the Sea washed away the Carcasses of those
that were buried out of their Graves, their
Tombs being dashed to pieces by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and concussion. That the whole Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
one of the fairest and goodliest that
ever he saw, was covered with the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of People of all Conditions floating up
and down without burial. That in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Earth, the Houses and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
sinking down together, some of these
were driven up again by the Sea which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
in those Breaches, and wonderfully esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96662:116"/>
Some were swallowed up to the neck,
and then the Earth shut upon them, and
squeezed them to death; and in that
manner several were left buried with their
Heads above ground, only some Heads the
Dogs have eaten, others are covered with
Dust and Earth by the People which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the place, to avoid the stench. So
that they conjecture, that by the falling of
the Houses, the opening of the Earth, and
the inundation of the Waters, there are lost
Fifteen hundred persons, and many of good
note, as Attorney General <hi>Musgrove,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost
Marshal <hi>Reeves,</hi> Lord Secretary <hi>Reeves,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Further he tells us, That after he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
into a Ship, he could not sleep all
night for the returns of the Earthquake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every hour, which made all the Guns
in the Ship to jar and rattle. And he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that the whole Town of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> will
in a short time be wholly swallowed by the
Sea: for few of those Houses that yet stand
are left whole, and that they heard them
fall every day, and that the Sea daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
upon them. That they had Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
from several parts of those Islands of
Misch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s done by the Earthquake. From
St. <hi>Anns</hi> they heard of above 1000 Acres of
Woodland changed into Sea, carrying with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96662:116"/>
it whole Plantations. And lastly, That he
was told by some, that they still heard bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings
and noises in the Mountains, which
made them very apprehensive of an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fire; which if so, he feared might
be more destructive then the Earthquake.
[But I think causlesly, (for I never heard or
read of any great destruction of Men made
by any eruptions of Fire, even out of burning
Mountains.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. The Account he gives of his own unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and strange preservation, take his own
words:</hi> After I had been at Church reading
Prayers, (which I did every day since I was
Rector of the Place, to keep up some shew of
Religion) and was gone to a place hard by the
Church, where the Merchants meet, and where
the President of the Council was; who came
into my Company, and engaged me to take a
Glass of Wormwood Wine as a whet before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he being my very great Friend, I staid
with him; upon which he lighted a Pipe of
Tobacco, which he was pretty long in taking;
and not being willing to leave him before it
was out, this detained me from going to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to one Captain <hi>Ruden</hi>'s, whither I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited;
whose House upon the first concussion
sunk first into the Earth, and then into the
Sea, with his Wife and Family, and some
that were come to dine with him: Had I been
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96662:117"/>
there I had been lost. But to return to the
President, and his Pipe of Tobacco; before
that was out I found the ground rowling and
moving under my feet, upon which I said to
him, <hi>Lord! Sir, what is this?</hi> He replyed
very composedly, being a very grave Man, <hi>It
is an Earthquake, be not afraid, it will soon
be over:</hi> but it increased, <hi>&amp;c. Then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
how he went to his own Lodging, and
found all things in order there, nothing stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of its place, and going into his Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony
to view the Street, he saw never a
House down there, nor the ground so much
a crackt: And that after he had prayed

in which Exercises he spent near
an hour and half, there came some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the place to him, desiring him to
go aboard some Ship in the Harbour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
himself, telling him that they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               </p>
               <p>5. The last thing I shall take notice of in
these Letters, shall be the influence and effect
this Judgment had upon the Remainder of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96662:117"/>
the People, to bring them to a sence of their
Sins and Repentance for them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon and begin a Reformation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of their Lives. It is a true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Vexatio dat intellectum: In their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they will seek me early.</hi> The pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the People appeared in that they
were so glad to see their Minister in the
midst of this Disaster, and so earnest with
him to come down and pray with them
when they saw him in the Balcony before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
and that when he came down
into the Street, every one laid hold on his
Cloaths and embraced him, so that with
their fear and kindness he was almost stifled.
And that not only at the instant of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
but afterwards when he went a-shore
to bury the Dead, and pray with the Sick,
and baptize the Children, and preach among
them, the People were over-joyed to see
him, and wept bitterly when he preached
to them. Fear is a more powerful Passion
then Love: and whatever creates terrour is
a more effectual Curb to restrain and rule
Men as well as Children, then any Favours
or Benefits the most powerful Motives of
Love and Affection: For though the <hi>Bonds
of Love</hi> are called the <hi>Cords of a Man,</hi> and
are indeed very strong ones to rational and
ingenuous Persons, yet the greatest part of

Mankind are so far degenerated, that <hi>they
have broken these bonds, and cast these cords</hi>
from them; and upon trial, one shall find
little of Gratitude or Ingenuity among
them.</p>
               <p>I shall add one or two Remarks upon the
precedent Paper.</p>
               <p>First, It is very remarkable that the day,
when all this befel <hi>Port-Royal</hi> and the whole
Island of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> was very clear, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
the least suspicion of any evil: so
that the Inhabitants had no warning at all of
it, but were surprised of a sudden, without
time sufficient to escape and save themselves.
For in the short space of three Minutes the
Town was shaken and shattered to pieces,
and sunk into, and covered for the greatest
part by the Sea. In which respect this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
resembled those on the Old World and
on <hi>Sodom,</hi> which, the Scripture tells us, were
to the People involved in them sudden and
unexpected; as also the second coming of
Christ, and future Dissolution of the World
by Fire is predicted to be.</p>
               <p>That the Cause of Earthquakes is the same
with that of Thunder, I doubt not, and most
learned Men are agreed; that is, Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Steams set on fire, the one in the
Clouds, the other in the Caverns of the Earth;
which is sufficiently proved from the great
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96662:118"/>
deflagrations and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruptions of <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s or
burning Mountains; they being always ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preceded or attended by Earthquakes;
and Earthquakes, even here in <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as far as I can understand, for the most
part accompanied with a noise. But now
of what nature this steam is that is thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
and what causes the accension, I
must confess my self not to be yet fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
That it is at least partly Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is certain, and well proved by Dr.<note n="*" place="margin">Philosoph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Transact. <hi>N. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
from the Sulphureous stink of waters
smelt before, and of the very Air it self after
them: That it conceives fire of its self, and
is not kindled after the manner of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the touch of fire, is as clear, there
being no fire praeexisting in the Clouds;
but how it should kindle, unless by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation
of parts after the manner of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
I cannot conceive. And if so, then
the steam must be a dissimilar Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of parts of different Natures; else
would there be no colluctation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no accension, the parts friendly
conspiring and agreeing in the same moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that water, either in
the gross body, or in vapour, may and doth
so far work upon some solid Bodies, as for
example, Quicklime, Hay in a Mow, the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96662:119"/>
Pyrites or Firestone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to cause an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calescency
and even an accension; but still
this is by the discord or contrariety of the
parts of water or vapour, and those of the
forementioned Bodies meeting and strugling
together. So in Tempests of Thunder and
Lightning, the fume contain'd in the Clouds,
which my honoured Friend Dr. <hi>Martin Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
supposes and proves to be no other then
the breath of the Pyrites, encountering with
the vapour of water, there may very likely
by the concourse and conflict of these two
be produced first a great heat, and afterwards
an actual fire.</p>
               <p>As for Thunder, after the steams inclosed
in the Cloud are once inflamed, I conceive
the fire goes not out till the end of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
but when the inflamed matter is so
much dilated that the cavity of the Cloud
cannot contain it, it rends the Cloud and
forces its way through where it is most
yielding, so much of the fire escaping at the
breach, till the Cloud overcomes the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the remainder, and closes it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and continues shut, till there be so
much of the Sulphu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eous steam anew infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as to have strength enough to tear it,
and break out the second time, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is repeated, till the whole steam be burnt
and consumed, and the fire go out; or till
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96662:119"/>
the Cloud be quite condensed and faln down
in rain. That this vapour or steam in the
Clouds heats gradually before it comes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
I think probable, because before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
considerable Tempest the Air beneath is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ultry (as we call it) that is, suffocatingly
hot.</p>
               <p>So likewise in the Caverns of the Earth
it is not unlikely that the steams or damps
that cause Earthquakes before ignition, may
be gradually heated by a colluctation of
parts; but their accension seems to be very
sudden, and in manner of explosion, like
that of Gunpowder; the succussion coming
unexpectedly without any notice-giving, and
being also very transient, and of short conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
I mean Earthquakes where there
are no eructations of fire, such as ours in
<hi>England</hi> are.</p>
               <p>There is a sort of Damp which some call a
Fire-damp or Fulminating-damp, of which I
had the first notice from my honoured Friend
<hi>Francis Iessop</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>An. 1668.</hi> whereof I find
a Relation since communicated by him in a
Letter to Dr. <hi>Lister,</hi> published in the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Transactions,</hi> Numb. 117. and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Account from him in Answer to some
Queries proposed by the Honourable Mr.
<hi>Boyl</hi> in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> Numb.
119. wherein he writes, That this sort of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96662:120"/>
Damp presently takes fire at the touch of a
lighted Candle, or other flaming Matter,
and flies out of the mouth of the bink or
shaft with a crack like a Gun. He instances
in three Persons that had been hurt by it;
one in the Coal-mines in <hi>Hasleberg</hi> Hills,
who had his Arms and Legs broken, and his
Body strangely distorted by it. A second
in those at <hi>Wingersworth,</hi> who going into a
bink, where this kind of Damp was, to fetch
some of his Tools, with a Candle in his
hand, found himself on a sudden environ'd
with flames, so that his face, hands, hair, and
a great part of his Clothes were very much
burnt. He heard very little noise, but one
who was working at the same time in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bink, and those that were above ground
heard a very great one, like a clap of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
wherewith the Earth shook; which
hearing, they ran in a great amazement to see
what the matter was, with their Candles in
their hands, which were twice extinguished,
but held upon the third Lighting. They
saw nothing, but met with an intolerable
stench of Brimstone, and an heat as scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as an Oven half-heated, which made them
glad speedily to quit the place. A third at
the same place met with the same accident:
and he fore-mention'd person happening
then to stand at the mouth of the fired bink,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96662:120"/>
was shot forth about two or three yards, and
had his head broken and boyd bruised against
the further side; the same also a third time
incurred the like disaster. That it shot off
the Turn at the mouth of the Pit to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
height. That they could perceive
no smell before the fire, but afterwards a
very strong one of Brimstone. That the
Damp hung about the top of the bink, and
therefore they were for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d to go with their
Candles very low, else it would have taken
fire. That the flame would continue in the
Vault two or three Minutes, sometimes more
after the crack. That he could never hear
of any Damps that kindled of themselves.
That from the breaking of these Fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-damps
proceeded a black smoke of the
smell and colour of that from Gunpower
fired.</p>
               <p>This sort of Fire-damp Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> tells
us, they have also in some Coal-works bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
on <hi>Mendip</hi> Hills. See <hi>Philosoph. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
1.</hi> And Mr. <hi>George Sinclair</hi> in a Land
called <hi>Werdy,</hi> west of <hi>Leith,</hi> which even in
the day-time is sometimes seen in Coal-works
in little holes, shining like kindled Sulphur.
But the most strange Fire-damp was that
which happen'd at <hi>Mostyn</hi> in <hi>Flintshire</hi> at the
same time with that at <hi>Wingersworth</hi> [1675.]
which as soon as the Colliers were scanted
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96662:121"/>
of Air appeared in the crevisses or slits of
the Coal, where water had been before, in a
small blewish flame, flashing and darting like
Sword-blades from side to side of the Pit:
and being kindled, had the same and more
violent effects than those of <hi>Hasleberg</hi> or
<hi>Wingersworth,</hi> leaving a foul ill-sented smoke
behind it. In the last there mention'd [phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losoph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Buckets and Rope was thrown up, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a good way from the Pit, and pieces
torn off from it scattered about the Woods.
And lastly the whole frame of the Engine
moved out of its place. The whole Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deserves well to be read.</p>
               <p>That which seems to me most strange and
Romantick is the motion of the Damp, that
as if it had been a living thing, it should fly
up with a long sharp flame to lighed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
set over the Eye of the Pit, and put
them out: And yet Mr. <hi>Iessop</hi> also mentions
a like motion in that of <hi>Wingersworth; For
of,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the bink where it was, they
held their Candles any higher then ordinary,
they could see the Damp, which lay near the
Roof, to descend like a black Mist, and catch
bold of the flame, lengthning it to two or
three handfuls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these Descriptions, this Damp should
seem to be but Gunpowder in a vapour, and
to partake the Sulphur, Nitre, and <hi>Bitumen,</hi>
as the Learned Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> well proves in his
<hi>Natural History of Staffordshire,</hi> C. 3. § 47.
to which I refer the Reader. But for the
accension of it, whether it ever takes fire of
it self, I am in some doubt. Mr. <hi>Iessop</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies
it of those of <hi>Hasleberg</hi> and <hi>Wingers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth;</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:96662:122"/>
and how far those Relators that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it are to be credited, I know not.</p>
               <p>If in this particular I were satisfied, I
should readily accord with the Doctor, That
our Earthquakes in <hi>England,</hi> and any others
that have but one single Pulse, owe their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
to the kindling and explosion of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damps.</p>
               <p>You will say, That fire is the cause of
Thunder we readily grant, because we see it
plentifully discharged out of the Clouds:
but what reason have we to think so of this
sort of Earthquakes, where we see no
lightning or eruption of fire at all? What
becomes of the inclosed flame?</p>
               <p>In answer hereto, I demand, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of it in the open Air? It diffuses it
self through the Caverns of the Earth, till the
deflagration be made, and is there dissipated
and dissolved into Fume and Ashes. It breaks
not forth, I conceive, because by reason of
the depth of the Caverns wherein it is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is not able to overcome the resistance
of the incumbent Earth, but is forced <hi>Quà
data porta ruere,</hi> to make its way where it
finds easiest passage through the strait <hi>Cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>
of the Earth: as in a Gun the inflamed
Powder, though if it were at liberty, and
found equal resistance on every side, it would
spread equally every way; yet by reason of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96662:122"/>
the strength and firmness of the Mettal, it
cannot tear the Barrel in pieces, and so
break out; but is compelled to fly out at
the muzzel, where it finds an open, though
strait passage. For the force of flame, though
very great, is not infinite.</p>
               <p>It may be further objected, We hear not
of any eruption of fire at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in this Island, and yet the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
and the roofs of the Caverns fell in,
therefore fire could not be the cause of this
Earthquake; for if it had, at those apertures
and rifts of the ground, it must needs have
issued forth and appeared abroad.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That the Vaults and
Cavities wherein the inflamed Matter was
imprisoned and the explosion made, lay deep
in the Earth, and were covered with a
thick and impenetrable Coat of hard stone,
or other solid matter which the fire could
not tear, but that above this coat there were
other superficial hollows in a more loose and
crumbling Earth, which being not able to
sustain the shock, and hold out against the
impetuous agitations of the Earthquake, the
roofs might yield, open, and subside, as we
hear they did, and give way to the Sea to
rush in and surmount them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:96662:123"/>
You will reply, This may be a tolerable
account of our <hi>English</hi> Earthquakes, which
are finished at one explosion, but what shall
we say to those of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> which like a
Tempest of Thunder and Lightning in the
Clouds, have (as we learn by this Relation)
several Paroxysms or Explosions, and yet no
discharging of fire?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That I conceive the
Caverns of the Earth wherein the inflamed
Damps are contained, are much larger there
then ours in <hi>England;</hi> and the force of the
fire joyned with the elatery of the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exceeding great, may of a sudden heave
up the Earth, yet not so far as to rend it in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>under, and make its way out, but is forced
to seek passage where it finds least resistance
through the lateral <hi>Cuniculi.</hi> So the main
Cavern being in a great measure emptied, and
the exteriour parts of the extended matter
within cooling and shrinking, the Earth
may subside again, and reduce the Cavern
to its former dimensions. Yet possibly there
may not be a perfect defiagration and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the fire, and so new Damps ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Earth, and by degrees filling
the Cavern, there may succeed a second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation
and explosion, and so a third, and
fourth, till the steams be quite burnt up and
consumed. But in this, I confess, I do not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96662:123"/>
satisfie my self. They who have a more
comprehensive knowledge of all the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi>
may give a better account.</p>
               <p>But as for those Earthquakes that are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the burnings of <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> they
are, I conceive, of a different nature. For
in them the fire burns continually, and is
never totally extinct, only after the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
in which, besides smoke and fire,
there is an ejection of abundance of Ashes,
Sand, Earth, Stones, and in some floods of
melted Materials, the raging is for a time
qualified; but the fire still continuing, and
by degrees increasing in the combustible
matter it finds in the hollows of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
at last swells to that excess, that it
melts down Metals and Minerals where it
meets with them, causing them to boil with
great fury, and extending it self beyond the
dimensions of the Cavities wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
causes great succussions and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings
of the Earth, and huge eruptions of
smoke, and casts out such quantities of Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Sand and Stones as we just now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and after much thunder and roaring by
the allision and repercussion of the flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
and from the sides of the Caverns,
and the ebullition and volutation of the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Materials, it forces out that boiling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
either at the old mouths, or at new ones,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96662:124"/>
which it opens where the incumbent Earth
is more thin and yielding. And if any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enters those Caverns, it mightily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the raging of the Mountain. For the
fire suddenly dissolving the water into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
expands it to a vast dimension, and by
the help thereof throws up Earth, Sand,
St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes, and whatever it meets with. How
great the force of water converted into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
is, I have sometimes experimented by
inadvertently casting a Bullet in a wet mold,
the melted Lead being no sooner poured in,
but it was cast out again with violence by
the particles of water adhering to the mold
suddenly converted into vapour by the heat
of the Metal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The People of this Plantation
being generally so ungodly and debauched in
their lives, this Earthquake may well be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
by this Gentleman, the Minister of
<hi>Port-Royal,</hi> a Judgment of God upon
them.</p>
               <p>For though it may be a servile complaint,
and popular mistake, that the former imes
were better than these, and that the World
doth daily degenerate, and grow worse and
worse. <hi>Aet as parentum pejor avis tulit hos
nequiores, mox daturos Progeniem vitiosiorem.</hi>
For had this been true, Vice would long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time have come to the height and

greatest possible excess: and this Complaint
hath been made as well in the best as worst
of times. Though I say this be partly an
errour, yet I do verily believe, that there are
certain times when Iniquity doth abound, and
Wickedness overflow in a Nation or City;
and that long Peace and Prosperity, and
great Riches, are apt to create Pride and
Luxury, and introduce a general Corruption
of Manners: And that at such times God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
sends some sweeping Judgment, either
utterly destroying such a People who have
filled up the measure of their iniquity, or at
least grievously afflicts and diminishes them.
So when in the old World <hi>the wickedness of
man was great upon the earth, and every i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
of the thoughts of his heart was
only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. <hi>And the
earth was corrupt before God, and filled with
violence, all flesh having corrupted their
ways,</hi> vers. 11. &amp; 12. God brought in the
Flood, and drowned them all. The like ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
we find executed on the Cities of
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> after such a monstrous
height of wickedness as the Inhabitants were
generally arrived at. And we shall find it
noted by Historians, That before any great
publick Calamity or utter Excision of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the People were become universally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and corrupt in their Manners, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96662:125"/>
all fear of God or sence of Goodness.
For God doth not stand by as an idle and
unconcerned Spectator, and suffer things to
run at random; but his Providence many
times interposes, and stops the usual course
and current of Natural Causes: Nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and affirm, That in all great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Revolutions and Mutations he hath the
greatest hand and interest; himself ordering
and governing them by his special Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendence
and influence. So though the
Instruments and Materials wherewith this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
in <hi>Iamaica</hi> was made, as a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
fire and inflamable materials, were
before in the Earth, yet that they should at
this time break forth and work, when there
was such an inundation of wickedness there,
and particularly and especially at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi>
this we may confidently say, was the finger
of God, and effected perchance by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of an Angel.</p>
               <p>Moreover, This Relator's being called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and stopped from going to a place, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if he had then gone he had certainly
perished, we have good reason to think an
effect of Providence, designing thereby his
preservation; as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Bishop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
his going out of the House wherein he
abode immediately before it fell down, was
rationally thought to be in respect of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:96662:125"/>
But to proceed; I should now have done
concerning Earthquakes, it being my design
only to take notice of such as have made
considerable mutations in the superficial part
of the Earth, passing by those, which after
a short trembling and succussion have left the
Earth as they found it, making no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all therein. But at the very time this
she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of Earthquakes was Composing, there
happening a notable one, though of this
latter kind, in our own Country, I was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the coincidence of it, with the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
before-mentioned, partly at the request
of the Bookseller, induced to make some
mention of it, and add what I knew or could
learn of its History; which is indeed very
little and inconsiderable, we having as yet
but a very lame and imperfect account of
the Accidents of it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>time</hi> when it happened, it was
the 8th of <hi>September 1692.</hi> about 4 Minutes
past Two of the Clock in the Afternoon, as
was observed at <hi>London;</hi> hereabouts I can
hear of no body that was so critical in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the time, only they agree that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Two of the Clock. Had we a punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and exact notice of the very Minute that
it happened in far distant places, we might
thence gather something concerning the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and progress of it. However it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96662:126"/>
that it happened in the <hi>Autumn,</hi>
one of the Seasons in which <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us
such effects are most frequent, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spring; and likewise in the Month
of <hi>September;</hi> in the which that about <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
in the Year 1683. fell out: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in a wet Season, as that also did;
though the Forenoon of the day was clear
and fair, yet in the Afternoon, when the
Earthquake was past it rained hard till Night,
the whole precedent Summer (to this I
mean) having been cold and wet: which
what influence it can have toward the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of an Earthquake, unless by stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Pores of the Earth, and hindring
the evaporation of those sulphureous steams,
which are the efficients of it, I know not,
The same Night succeeded some strokes of
Thunder and Flashes of Lightning both here
and at <hi>London,</hi> and since then we have had
great storms of Wind. I might have taken
notice, that for some Mornings before we had
smart Frosts for the time of the Year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since this was written and sent away in
order to printing, I am advis'd by Letter from
my honoured Friend Dr.</hi> Tancred Robinson,
<hi>that this Earthquake was not confin'd to some
Counties of</hi> England, <hi>as</hi> Middlesex, Essex,
Kent, <hi>Sussex, Hampshire,</hi> &amp;c. but spread far
into Foreign Parts; an Account whereof I
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96662:126"/>
                  <hi>shall give you in the Doctor's own words.</hi>
The Concussion or Vibration of our late Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
was felt in most parts of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> as also in <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>France:</hi> It affected places most upon the Sea-Coasts,
and near the great Rivers as <hi>Zealand,
Cologn, Mentz,</hi> and the Bridge of <hi>London.</hi>
It went not beyond 52 Degrees and 40 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
of Northern Latitude; how far it
reach'd to the South and East, is not yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known for want of good Intelligence, we
have already traced it beyond <hi>Paris</hi> to the
48 degree of N. Latitude, and beyond the
<hi>Rhine</hi> on the East to <hi>Francfort;</hi> so that we
know at present of 260 Miles square shaken by
it. The motions of some Machines were very
sensibly stop't or retarded by the <hi>Choc,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Pendulums;</hi> and there were some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Air (as to its smell, spring, and
gravity) both before and after. The time of
its happening here in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond the
Seas, seems to vary some Minutes, but that
may easily be accounted for by the difference
of <hi>Meridians. Thus far the</hi> Doctor. Dat.
Septemb. 22.</p>
               <p>The duration or continuance of it (as I
am informed by some curious and attentive
Observers) about <hi>London</hi> was about Two
Minutes; here not so long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:96662:127"/>
The manner of the motion, as I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by my Learned and Ingenious Friend
and Neighbour Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Physitian in <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi>
who had it from several intelligent and
observant Persons hereabouts, and that lived
in distant places, was first a manifest heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upwards, and after that a trembling, or
vibration, or agitation to and fro. So that
in the first respect, its motion seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
that of the Blood in an Artery
stretching the Channel as it passed.</p>
               <p>The motion of it was most considerable
upon Hills and in Valleys.</p>
               <p>The effect it had upon those who were
sensible of it was a swimming or dizziness in
their Heads, and this was general upon all.
In some it affected their Stomacks, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a loathing and inclination to vomit:
Some of the tenderer Sex found in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such a disposition as they have had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a swooning fit. All which must be the
effects either of the heaving or tremulous
motion, or both; and yet no motion of Boat
or Coach doth so suddenly affect and disturb
the Head or Stomack.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It was attended with a noise, as our
Earthquakes generally in <hi>England</hi> are, as is
observed by Mr. <hi>Pigot</hi> in that of <hi>Oxford</hi> in
the Year 1683. and by my self when I lived
in <hi>Sutton <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>field,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that happen'd there
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96662:127"/>
in the Winter time as I remember in the
Year 1677 and extended at least 40 Miles
in length into <hi>Worcestershire.</hi> The noise I
heard seem'd to be in the Air. This noise
hereabouts was heard but in few places, and
by few persons, but yet I am well assured by
some, and those of the Vulgar and Ignorant
sort, who reported it of themselves, having
no reason to seign it, and who had never
heard that any such thing accompanied
Earthquakes.</p>
               <p>From many of the fore-mentioned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
it may be collected, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
in which the inflamed Damp causing
this Earthquake was contained, lye deep in
the Earth, else could it not have shook such
a vast extent of Ground, both Hills and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
passing under the Channels of great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and even Creeks of the Sea, and not
being stop't by them; and if it had not lain
deep, it would in all likelyhood some where
or other have rent the Earth, and broken
forth. And yet notwithstanding the depth,
it should seem it found so much vent as to
affect the external Air, and create a sound:
for if the Caverns wherein the Damp was
had been close shut up with such a thick
Coat of Earth, I doubt whether the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and vibration of the soft Earth alone
would have produced such a noise abroad in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96662:128"/>
the Air; and the vapour of it also made a
shift to struggle through the Pores of the
Earth into the open Air, in such quantity as
to affect the sence; a sulphurous scent having
been observed in the Air both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Concussion.</p>
               <p>It is moreover very remarkable, That there
were some particular spots which were not at
all stirred in those Countreys where the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not far distant round about were shaken;
as <hi>Sturbridge-Fair</hi> before remembred, and
that where my Dwelling is; neither my self,
nor any of my Family, though they were
above stairs, nor any of our near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
being sensible of the least motion or
impression of it, and yet those living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
less then half a mile had their Houses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
shaken by it.</p>
               <p>It is also worth the noting, That both this,
and all other Earthquakes I have heard or
read of in <hi>England,</hi> have been very short,
and finished at one explosion; which is an
argument that the Cavities and <hi>Cuniculi,</hi>
wherein the enflamed matter is contained
and moves, are very strait and of small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions.
Explosion I call it, because by the
quickness of the motion it seems rather to
resemble that of Powder in a Gun, then that
of a Squib running in a Train of Powder.
Though others I have read of whose motion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96662:128"/>
was very slow; as that observed by the
Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and described in the
<hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> Numb. 11. Had
we certain knowledge where the greatest
force of this Earthquake was, we might
thence learn where its first accension was,
and which way it spread it self. But I have
not time to enlarge further concerning it, or
to give an account of all its <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> lest
I injure the Printer by stopping the Press:
neither indeed would it be prudence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, till we have a more particular and
perfect History of it.</p>
               <p>Since this was written and sent away to
the Printer, intelligence is come from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and all <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
part of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> were
shaken by this Earthquake, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the interjacent Provinces, which is a
clear demonstration of our Opinion, That
the inflamed Damp, which caused it, was
lodged deep in the Earth, the <hi>Cuniculi</hi> or
Caverns which contained it passing under the
very bottom of the Sea. It is also a great
confirmation of what we have delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Mountains of <hi>Aetna, Stromboli,</hi>
and <hi>Vesuvius</hi> communicating by Submarine
passages. Add hereto, that <hi>Gassendus</hi> in the
Life of <hi>Peireskius</hi> reports, That at the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Semo</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> there happened a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96662:129"/>
burning at the same time with that of
<hi>Vesuvius</hi> in <hi>Campania, viz.</hi> in the Year
1633. So that not only <hi>Vesuvius</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
with <hi>Aetna</hi> by subterraneous Vaults,
but also (as he rationally infers) <hi>Aetna</hi> with
the Mountains of <hi>Syria,</hi> the Tunnels run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
under the depths of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>
Sea, and those with the <hi>Arabian,</hi> and lastly
the <hi>Arabian</hi> with Mount <hi>Semo</hi> in <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That an inflamed Damp or subterraneous
Fire is the cause of all Earthquakes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and not only such as precede the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> may be proved by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
instance of an Earthquake happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>May 12. 1682.</hi> which shook the greatest
part of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and reach't
as far as <hi>Collen</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> an Account
whereof we have in the <hi>Iournal des Scavans</hi>
set forth <hi>Iune 1. 1682.</hi> inserted in the <hi>Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

That at <hi>Tonnerre</hi> the Houses and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
were so terribly shaken, as if several Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
with six Horses had driven along full
speed through the Streets; and that it threw
down several Rocks on the side of <hi>Bourbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
They tell also that it stop't a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
at <hi>Raviere</hi> hard by (which at fifty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from its head turns a Mill) for half an
hour.</p>
               <p>That it was perceived in <hi>Provence</hi> by the
shaking of Windows and Beds, and opening

to have: and that the Domestick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
as Sheep, Cows, Horses, and Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
did discover their fear by unusual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and cries. And the Sheep at <hi>Dijon</hi> in
<hi>Burgundy</hi> could not be stopt from getting
into their Stalls at four of the Clock in the
Afternoon, which were not then wont to
betake themselves thither till Sun-set.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Cities of</hi> Orleans, Troyes, Sens,

of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at <hi>Remiremont</hi> upon the <hi>Moselle,</hi>
where it exerted its greatest force, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down several Houses, insomuch that
the Inhabitants were forced to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Fields for six weeks time;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96662:130"/>
there was a noise heard like Thunder, and
flames frequently broke out of the Earth of
a noisome scent, but not Sulphureous, and
which burnt nothing, yet was there no rift
or chap in the ground, save only in one
place, the depth whereof was in vain
search't, and which afterwards closed up.
And before this Earthquake also flames ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for 4 days upon a Mountain near
<hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very strange and remarkable that the
flames that issued out were of the nature of
an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> and burnt nothing; and
that (as Monsieur <hi>Colbert</hi> writes) the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
raged every Night, and never in the
Day-time.</p>
               <p>Concerning Earthquakes, I shall only add
two Observations.</p>
               <p>1. That it is not likely that they spend all
their strength upon Cities, but do indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shake, break in sunder, and throw down
Mountains and Rocks; and seeing few Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there are but have been shaken, and
many ruined and subverted by them, and
levelled with the Ground; there is good
reason to think, that few Rocks or Mountains
have escaped their Fury, but have suffered
the like Concussions and Alterations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:96662:130"/>
2. That the Changes that have hitherto
happened in the Earth by Earthquakes have
not been so considerable as to threaten a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the present System of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous
Globe, should there be a like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of them to Eternity. Unless we will
except that unparall'd universal one, which
happened in the days of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the first
(which we have already mention'd) by which
the whole known World, both Land and
Sea, and its like the then unknown too, were
violently shaken; which might seem to be
a Prelude to the future Conslagration or
Destruction of the whole by such a confusion
and dashing in pieces of all the parts of it
one against another, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> speak
of.</p>
               <p>Of the Effects of burning Mountains or
<hi>Vulcanos,</hi> I have already said something, and
shall afterwards, have occasion to say more.
In brief, 1. They cast forth out of their
Mouths, and scatter all over the Country,
sometimes to a very great distance, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Sand and Ashes. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that in that noted deflagration of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius</hi>
in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour,
there was so much Cinders and Ashes vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of its flaming Tunnel, and with that
Fury and Violence, that they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
over Sea into <hi>Africa, Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:96662:131"/>
and on the other side were carried as far as
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they darkned the very Air, and
intercepted the Sun-beams. At which time,
by the fury of this burning and tempest,
the whole Mountain and Earth thereabouts
was so shaken, that two adjoyning Cities <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culanium</hi>
and <hi>Pompeii,</hi> were destroyed with
the People sitting in the Theater. And the
famous Natural Historian <hi>Pliny</hi> the Elder,
then Admiral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy, out of a
curiosity of searching out the Causes and
Nature of the Deflagration approaching too
near the Mountain, and staying too long
there, was suffocated with the sulphureous
smoke and stench thereof.</p>
               <p>Of another eruption of the same <hi>Vesuvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
we read, in the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour,
wherein the Ashes thereof transported in the
Air obscured all <hi>Europe,</hi> being carried as far
as <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and that the <hi>Constant ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi>
being wonderfully affrighted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(insomuch as the Emperour forsook
the City) in memory of the same, did year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
celebrate the Twelfth of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They also pour out huge Floods of melted
Minerals, Stones, and other Materials, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down like Rivers for many Miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as did the Mountain <hi>Aetna</hi> in that last
and most famous Eructation, disgorging such
mighty streams of fiery running matter, as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96662:131"/>
flowed down to <hi>Catana,</hi> above twenty Miles
distant, and advanced a considerable way
into the very Sea it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next thing I shall mention
is the extraordinary Floods caused by long
continuing showers, or violent and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
storms and shots of rain.</p>
               <p>The most ancient and memorable of this
kind is that of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> of which we have
already discoursed sufficiently. S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
in the Life of <hi>Hilarion</hi> (as I find him quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Dr. <hi>Hakewill</hi>) speaks of a Flood and
Inundation after the Death of <hi>Iulian,</hi> in
which <hi>Naves ad praerupta montium delatae

of a great Flood in the South part of

all the People attended therein the very end
of the World and Judgment-day; saying,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96662:132"/>
that by the violent descent of the Waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Nismes,</hi> there were removed divers old
heaps and mountures of Ground, and many
other Places torn up and rent; by which
accident there was found both Coin of Silver

Vessels of other Metal, supposed to be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at such time as the <hi>Goths</hi> invaded that

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which I shall add one of late date
happening in</hi> Sicily, <hi>a Narrative whereof
communicated in a Letter from</hi> Palermo,
<hi>dated</hi> Iune <hi>the 25th, 1682. I met with in
the</hi> London Gazette, <hi>Numb. 1742. in the
following words:</hi> We have an Account from
the Town of <hi>Tortorica,</hi> That on the sixth
Instant, about seven a Clock in the Evening,
after so great a darkness that no object could
be distinguished at the distance of four pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
there arose such a great storm of Rain,
Lightning and Thunder, which lasted six and
thirty hours, that about One a Clock the
next morning, great Torrents of Water,
caused by these Rains, fell down from the
neighbouring Mountains with so great rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
that they carried with them Trees of
an extraordinary bigness, which threw down
the Walls and Houses of the Town they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96662:133"/>
to beat against. The Waters were so
violent that they overthrew the Church of
St. <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and the Arch-Deacon of the
Town, who retired thither, perished there
with many other persons: there remaining
only one Abby, and about fifty Houses, and
those so shattered, that they fell one after
another. There were about six hundred of
the Inhabitants drown'd, the rest being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the Field gathering their silk, fled
to the Mountains, where they suffered very
much for want of Provisions. The Goods,
Trees, Stone, Sand and other Rubbish which
the Waters carried away, were in so great
abundance, that they made a bank above the
Water two Miles in length near the mouth of
the River, where before the Sea was very
deep. This Town is situate in that part
of <hi>Sicily</hi> called the <hi>Valley of Demona,</hi> on
the side of the River <hi>Tortorica,</hi> about five
and Twenty Miles from the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Sea.
The Towns of <hi>Randazzo</hi> and <hi>Francaville,</hi>
and several others, have likewise been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by this great Flood. It is added
that Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> casts out such abundance of
Water, that all the neighbouring Country is
drowned. <hi>Which if it be true, (as I see no
reason to doubt it) this is a further proof,
against</hi> Borellius, <hi>that the Caverns of</hi> Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<hi>are more then superficial, and reach
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96662:133"/>
down to the very Roots and Foundations
of that Mountain, communicating with
the Subterraneous Abyss, and the Sea its self,
from whence in all likelyhood these Waters
were derived, as is evident in those poured
out by</hi> Vesuvius.</p>
               <p>Many other Floods we read of in Histories,
whether caused by Rains or Inundations of
the Sea, is uncertain, and therefore I shall
not spend time in setting them down. The
effect of all which relating to the Earth in
general is, the wasting and washing away of
Mountains and high Grounds, the raising of
the Valleys and Bottoms, and consequently
levelling of the Earth, and landing up of the
Sea.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The last thing I shall mention,
which hath effected considerable Changes in
the Earth, is boisterous and outragious Winds
and Hurricanes, of which I need not give
Instances, they every year almost happening.
These I conceive have a great Interest in the
Inundations of the Sea we have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
These raise up those great Hills or
Downs of Sand we see all along the Coasts
of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and the Western-shores
of <hi>England,</hi> and the like places. These some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blow up so much Sand, and drive it so
far as to cover the adjacent Countreys, and
to mar whole Fields, yea to bury Towns
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96662:134"/>
and Villages. They are also a concurrent
cause of those huge Banks and Shelves of
Sand that are so dangerous to Mariners, and
bar up Havens, and ruin Port-Towns; of
which many Instances might be given.</p>
               <p>I find in Dr. <hi>Hakewil</hi>'s Apology, a story
or two shewing the great force and strength
of Winds; the one taken out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s
Book <hi>De ascensu mentis in Deum per scal. creat.
grad. 2. Vidi ego</hi> (saith the Cardinal) <hi>quod
nisi vidissem non crederem, à vehementissimo
vento effossam ingentem terrae molem, eámque
delatam super pagum quendam ut fovea altis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima
conspiceretur, unde terra eruta fuerat, &amp;
pagus totus coopertus, &amp; quasi sepultus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit,
ad quem terra illa devenerat:</hi> i. e. I
my self have seen, which if I had not seen,
I should not have believed, a very great
quantity of Earth, digged out and taken up
by the force of a strong Wind, and carried
up a Village thereby, so that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be seen a great empty hollowness
in the place from whence it was lifted,
and the Village upon which it lighted was
in a manner all covered over and buried in
it.</p>
               <p>The other out of <hi>Stow,</hi> who reports,
That in the Year 1095. during the Reign
of King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> there happened in
<hi>London</hi> an outragious Wind, which bore down
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96662:134"/>
in that City alone six hundred Houses, and
blew off the Roof of <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> with which
the Beams were born into the Air a great
height, six whereof being 27 foot long, with
their fall were driven 23 foot deep into the
ground, the streets of the City lying then
unpaved.</p>
               <p>Now then to sum up what we have said,
The Changes and Alterations that have been
made in the Superficial Part of the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous
Globe have been effected chiefly by
<hi>Water, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Wind.</hi> Those by <hi>Water</hi>
have been either by the Motions of the <hi>Sea,</hi> or
by <hi>Rains;</hi> and both either ordinary or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary:
The ordinary Tides and Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides
of the <hi>Sea</hi> do wash away the shores,
and change Sand-banks, and the like. The
extraordinary and tempestuous motions of
the Sea, raised by raging and impetuous
Winds, subterraneous Fires, or some other
hidden causes, overwhelm Islands, open <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum's,</hi>
throw up huge beds and banks of
Sand, nay vast baiches of Stone, extending
some Miles, and drown whole Countreys.
The ordinary <hi>Rains</hi> contribute something to
the daily diminution of the Mountains, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up of the Valleys, and atterrating the
skirts of the Seas. The extraordinary <hi>Rains</hi>
causing great Floods and Deluges, have more
visible and remarkable influences upon such
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96662:135"/>
mutations, doing that in a few days, which
the ordinary Weather could not effect, it may
be, in an hundred years.</p>
               <p>In all these Changes the Winds have a
great interest; the motion of the Clouds
being wholly owing to them, and in a great
measure also the overflowings and inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Whatever Changes have been wrought by
Earthquakes, Thunders, and Eruptions of
<hi>Vulcano's,</hi> are the effects of Fire.</p>
               <p>All these Causes co-operate toward the
lowring of the Mountains, levelling of the
Earth, straitning and landing up of the Sea,
and in fine compelling the Waters to return
upon the dry Land, and cover the whole
Surface of it, as at the first. How to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
this in a natural way, I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by a transmutation of the two Elements
of Water and Earth one into another, which
I can by no means grant. 'Tis true indeed,
the rocky parts of the Mountains may be
so hard and impenetrable, as to resist and
hold out against all the Assaults of the Water,
and utmost rage of the Sea; but then all the
Earth and Sand being washed from them,
nothing, but as it were their <hi>Skeletons,</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
extant above the Waters, and the Earth
be in effect drowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:96662:135"/>
But though I cannot imagine or think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any natural means to prevent and put a
stop to this effect, yet do I not deny that
there may be some; and I am the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
so to think, because the World doth
not in any degree proceed so fast towards
this Period, as the force and agency of all
these Causes together seem to require. For,
as I said before, the Oracle predicting the
carrying on the shore of <hi>Cilicia</hi> as far as
<hi>Cyprus</hi> by the Earth and Mud that the turbid
River <hi>Pyramus</hi> should bring down, and let
fall in the interjacent strait, is so far from
being filled up, that there hath not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
progress been made towards it, so
far as I have heard or read, in these 2000
years. And we find by experience, that the
longer the World lasts, the fewer Concussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Mutations are made in the upper or
superficial Region of the Earth; the parts
thereof seeming to tend to a greater quiet
and settlement.</p>
               <p>Besides the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the overwhelming and submersion
of Islands, and the straitning of it about
the Outlets of Rivers; and the Earth it
washes from the shores subsiding, and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bottom, seems not to be raised higher,
nor spread further, or bear any greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96662:136"/>
to that of the Land then it did a
thousand years ago.</p>
               <p>So have I finished my second Discourse
concerning the Deluge and its Effects; and
the Mutations that have been since made in
the Earth, and their Causes.</p>

               <head>THE
INTRODUCTION
TO THE
Third Discourse.</head>
               <p>THERE is implanted in the Nature
of Man a great desire and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
of fore-knowing future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and what shall befal themselves, their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96662:137"/>
Relations and Dependents in time to come;
the Fates of Kingdoms and Commonwealths,
especially the Periodical Mutations, and final
<hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the World. Hence in ancient
times, Divination was made a Science or
Mystery, and many Nations had their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
or Societies of Wise-men, Magicians,
Astrologers and Sooth-sayers; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Egyptians, Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
Hence the Vulgar are very prone to consult
Diviners and Fortune-tellers.</p>
               <p>To gratifie in some measure this Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that his People might not in any
Priviledge be inferiour to the Nations about
them, it pleased God, besides the standing
Oracle of <hi>Vrim,</hi> not only upon special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to raise up among the <hi>Iews</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Prophets, by immediate Mission; but
also to settle a constant Order and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them, for the maintenance and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
whereof, there were Colledges and
Seminaries instituted for the educating and
fitting young Men for the Prophetick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
These were the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
of whom we find so frequent menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it pleased God so far to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the weakness of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that in the
Infancy of their State, he permitted them
to consult his Prophets concerning ordinary
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96662:137"/>
accidents of life, and affairs of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
As we see <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Samuel</hi> about the
loss of his Fathers Asses: which it's not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would have done, had it not been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
and customary so to do. In the latter
times of that State, we read of no consulting
of Prophets upon such occasions. At last
also by their own confession, the Spirit of
Prophecy was quite taken away, and nothing
left them but a Vocal Oracle, which they
called <hi>Bath col, i. e.</hi> the Daughter of a Voice,
or the Daughter of Thunder, a Voice out of
a Voice. This Dr.<note n="*" place="margin">Horae He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br. in Matth. cap. 3. v. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Light foot</hi> thinks to have
been a meer Fancy or Imposture. <hi>Quae de
Bath Kol referunt Iudaei, ignoscant illi mihi
si ego partim pro fabulis habeam Iuduicis, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
pro praestigis Diabolicis.</hi> What the <hi>Iews</hi>
report concerning <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> I beg their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if I esteem them no other then either
Jewish Fables or Diabolical Illusions. It is a
Tradition among them, that after the death
of the last Prophets, <hi>Haggai, Zachary</hi> and
<hi>Malachy,</hi> the Holy Spirit departed from <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
But why, I beseech you, was Prophecy
withdrawn, if Coelestial Oracles were to be
continued? Why was <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
taken away, or rather not restored, by their
own confession, after the Babylonish Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity?
It were strange indeed, that God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away his ordinary Oracles from a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96662:138"/>
People should bestow upon them one more
or equally noble; and that after they were
extremely degenerated and fallen into all
manner of Impiety, Superstition and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a little after, if I may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak what I think, those innumerable
Stories, which every where occur [in the
Jewish Writings] concerning <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> are
to be reduced to two Heads: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The
most of them are meer Fables, invented in
honour of this or that Rabbin, or to gain
credit to some History. 2. The rest meer
Magical and Diabolical Illusions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Primitive Churches of Christians
planted by the Apostles, there was also an
Order of Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. God
hath set some in the Church, first Apostles,
secondarily Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. This Spirit of
Prophecy was an extraordinary and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Gift, as were the Gifts of Healing
and Speaking with Tongues, continuing
not long after the Death of the Apostles,
and Consignation of the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So that now we have no means left
us of coming to the knowledge of future
Events, but the Prophecies contained in the
Writings of the Holy Penmen of Scripture,
which, we must search diligently, consider
attentively, and compare together, if we
desire to understand any thing of what

shall befal the Christian Church or State in

               <p>This Text which I have made choice of

               <head type="sub">The Testimonies of Scripture concerning
the Dissolution of the World.</head>
               <p>1. THen, Let us consider what we find
delivered in the Holy Scriptures,
concerning the Dissolution of the World.
And first of all, This place, which I have
made choice of for my Text, is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the most clear and full, as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
in the whole Scripture; and will
give light for the Solution of most of the
proposed Questions. Vers. 10. <hi>The day of
the Lord shall come as a thief,</hi> &amp;c. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the third Question, Whether the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
shall be gradual or sudden? <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the Elements shall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
heat, the Earth also, and all the works
that are therein shall be burnt up.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Vers. 12. <hi>Wherein the Heavens being
on fire shall be dissolved, and the Elements
shall melt with fervent heat.</hi> This answers
the second Question, What the Means and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96662:141"/>
Instruments of this Dissolution shall be?
Vers. 13. <hi>Nevertheless we according to his
promise, look for a new Heaven and a new
Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</hi> This
gives some light towards the anwering of the
last Question, Whether shall the Heavens
and the Earth be wholly burnt up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
or only renewed and purified?
These Words as clearly as they seem to refer
to the Dissolution of the World, yet Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> doubts not to be understood of
the remarkable destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, he thus paraphrasing
them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verse 10.</hi> But the day of the Lord will
come as a thief in the night, in which
the Heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the Elements shall melt with
fervent heat, and the Earth also, and the
works that are therein shall be burnt up.</q>
               <p>But this Judgment of Christ, so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on the <hi>Iews,</hi> shall now shortly come,
and that very discernably; and the Temple
shall suddenly be destroyed, the greater part
of it burnt, and the City and People utterly
consumed.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:96662:142"/>
                  <hi>Verse 11.</hi> Seeing then all these things shall
be dissolved, what manner of Persons
ought ye to be in all holy conversation
and godliness.</q>
               <p>Seeing then this destruction shall thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
all, and now approacheth so near, what
an engagement doth this lay upon us to
live the most pure strict lives that ever Men
lived?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verse 12.</hi> Looking for and hastning unto
the coming of the day of God, wherein
the Heavens, being on fire, shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and the Elements shall melt with
fervent heat.</q>
               <p>Looking for the coming of Christ, for
our deliverance, and by our Christian lives
quickning and hastning God to delay it no
longer; that Coming of his, I say, which
as it signifies great mercy to us, so it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
very sharp destruction to the whole <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
State.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verse 13.</hi> Nevertheless we according to his
promise, look for new Heavens and a
new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:96662:142"/>
Instead of which we look for a new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
State, wherein all provision is made by
Christ for Righteousness to inhabit, according
to the Promise of Christ concerning the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that he should plant in the Evangelical
State.</p>
               <p>How he makes out and confirms this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase,
see in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this
place. So confident is he of the Truth of
this his Interpretation, that he censures the
usual one as a great Mistake, in his <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
on <hi>verse 10.</hi> where he thus writes; What
is here thus expressed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
conceived to belong to the end of the
World, and by others applies to the end of
this World, and the beginning of the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
or thousand years. And so, as S. <hi>Peter</hi>
here saith, <hi>verse 16.</hi> many other places in
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, and in the Gospel, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Matthew 24.</hi> are mistaken and wrested.
That it doth not belong to either of those,
but to this fatal day of the <hi>Iews,</hi> sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears by the purport of this whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,</hi>
which is, to arm them with Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Perseverance till that day come; and
particularly, in this Chapter, to confute
them who object against the Truth of Christ's
Predictions, and resolve it should not come
at all: Against whom he here opposes the
Certainty, the Speediness, and the Terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96662:143"/>
of its coming. That which hath given
occasion to those other common Mistakes, is
especially the hideousness of those Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which fell upon the People of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> beyond all that ever before are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have fallen upon them, or indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other People, which made it necessary
for the Prophets, which were to describe it
(and who use Tropes and Figures, and not
plain Expressions, to set down their Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
to express it by these high Phrases, of
the <hi>passing away</hi> and <hi>dissolving</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Elements, &amp;c.</hi> which sounding
very tragically, are mistaken for the great
and final Dissolution of the World. So far
the Doctor. Two things there are in this
Chapter which seem to contradict this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation;
First, That the Destruction
here spoken of, is compared with <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Flood; and the Heaven and Earth to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by this, made parallel, and of equal
extent to the World destroyed by that. Of
this the <hi>Doctor</hi> was well aware, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
grants that the seventh Verse, <hi>But the
Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the
same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
against the day of judgment, and perdition of
ungodly men,</hi> is to be understood of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and final destruction of the World by
fire, but the following Verses to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96662:143"/>
to the first part of the Atheists Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
viz. <hi>Where is the promise of his coming?</hi>
To me it seems, that all refer to the same
matter. The second thing which seems to
contradict the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Interpretation, is, the
Apostles citing for the instruction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Believers, and in Answer to
the Atheists Objection <hi>(Where is the promise
of his coming?)</hi> that place of the <hi>Psalmist,
Psal. 90. 4.</hi> That <hi>one day is with the Lord as
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day.</hi> For the Apostle seems to suppose, that
the time of Christ's coming, might possibly
be a thousand years off; and that they were
not to think much, or distruct the Promise,
if it were so: for though it were predicted
as a thing shortly to come, yet they were
to consider, that a thousand years in God's
sight is but a very short time; so that it
might be foretold as shortly to come, though
it were a thousand years off. Whereas it
might seem improper to mention a thousand
years to support them in expectation of
an Event that was not twenty years to
come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another place where mention is made of
Christ's coming to Judgment, and the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the World, is</hi> Matth. 24. <hi>to which
may be added as parallel</hi> Mark 13. <hi>and</hi> Luke
21. <hi>In which places you have considerable,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96662:144"/>
1. The Suddenness of Christ's coming,</hi> verse
27. As the lightning comes out of the East,
and shineth even unto the West, so shall the
coming of the Son of Man be. <hi>2. The Signs
of his coming,</hi> verse 29. Immediately after
the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be
darkned, and the Moon shall not give her
light, and the Stars shall fall from Heaven,
and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken.
<hi>3. The manner of his coming,</hi> verse 30. And
then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in
Heaven; and then shall all the Tribes of the
Earth mourn, when they shall see the Son of
Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with
power and great glory. And he shall send
his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet,
and they shall gather together his Elect from
the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to
the other. <hi>4. The uncertainty of the time
of his coming, and this dissolution as to us,</hi>
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no
not the Angels in Heaven: <hi>and</hi> Mark <hi>adds,</hi>
neither the Son, but the Father only.</p>
               <p>All this Prophecy Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
of the destruction of the City and
Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and whole Nation of
the <hi>Iews;</hi> as may be seen in his <hi>Paraphrase</hi>
and <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this place. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
our Saviour himself seems to limit
it to this, saying, <hi>verse 24. Verily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96662:144"/>
you, this generation shall not pass away, till
all these things be fulfilled.</hi> For if these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
look further than the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> even to Christ's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how could it be true, that that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should not pass away till all those things
were fulfilled? Whereas we see that that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is long since passed away, and yet
the end is not come? And indeed, Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
that understand them of the end of the
World, and Christ's second coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are hard put to it to answer this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> will have this word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be understood not of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Men then living, but of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Faithful, which should not fail till
the end of the World. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (saith he)
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates
a Generation not only from living
together in the same time, but from having
the same form and manner of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Polity; as in that place, This is the
generation of them that seek thee, that seek
thy face,</hi> O Jacob. <hi>Beza</hi> understands <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of the present Age, and will have it to be
of the same valor with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to refer not to all particulars
mentioned in this Chapter, but only to those
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96662:145"/>
which are spoken of the destruction of the
City and Nation of the <hi>Iews:</hi> But (saith
he) if any one urgeth the universal Particle,
<hi>Vertere licebit, Fiant omnia,</hi> viz <hi>quae ultimam
illam diem pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cessura dixit. Nam ab illo
tempore coeperunt fieri, &amp; adhuc perseverant
ill signa, suo demum tempore Filio hominis
venturo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the other side, 1. Some passages
there are in this Chapter, which are hardly
applicable to the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and the Dissolution of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
as <hi>the appearing of the Sign of the
Son of Man in Heaven, and the Tribes seeing
the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
with power and great glory. And his send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Angels with a great sound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.
2.</hi> The coming of Christ is in like
manner described in places which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
speak of his coming to Judgment at the
end of the World. As in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52.</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of the <hi>Trumpets sounding</hi> at the
time of the Christ's coming: and <hi>1 Thess. 4. 16.</hi>
it is said, <hi>The Lord himself shall descend from
Heaven with the voice of the Archangel, and
with the trump of God: and</hi> verse 17. <hi>We
that are alive shall be caught up together with
them</hi> [that are risen] <hi>in the Clouds to meet
the Lord in the Air.</hi> All which places are
perfectly parallel, and seem manifestly to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96662:145"/>
to the fore-mentioned words <hi>Matth. 24.
30, 31.</hi> I am apt to think that these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
may have a double respect; one to
the City, Temple, and Nation of the <hi>Iews:</hi>
another to the whole World at the great
Day of Doom: and that the former is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
typical of the latter: and so they have
a double completion; the first in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>Iewish</hi> Polity: In
reference to which it is truly said, <hi>This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
shall not pass away till all these
things be fulfilled.</hi> The second in the final
Dissolution of the World, which is yet to
come.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; Another place which is
usually understood of the Dissolution of the
World by fire, is <hi>2 Thess. 1. 7, 8. When the
Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven
with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,</hi> &amp;c.
Other parallel places may be seen, <hi>Rev. 6.
12. 13, 14. Rev. 10. 6. Rev. 21. 1. And I
saw a new Heaven and a new Earth, for the
first Heaven and the first Earth were passed
away, and there was no more Sea,</hi> Hebr. 12.
26, 27. These places speak more directly
of the Dissolution of the World, and the
coming of Christ to Judgment. Others there
are that speak only concerning the time of
it, <hi>1 Pet. 4. 7. But the end of all things is at
hand.</hi> James 5. 9. <hi>Behold the Iudge standeth
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96662:146"/>
before the door.</hi> 1 John 2. 18. <hi>Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
it is the last time;</hi> or as some translate
it, the last hour, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hebr. 10. 37.
<hi>Yet a little while, and he that shall come will
come, and will not tarry.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Luke 18. 17. <hi>I tell you he will avenge them
speedily.</hi> All these places the forementioned
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> still applies to that famous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of the destruction of the City, Temple
and Polity of the <hi>Iews;</hi> only in his Note
upon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
mentioned <hi>2 Thess. 1. 9.</hi> he hath
some qualification, saying thus, <hi>Mean while
not excluding the eternal torments of Hell-fire,
which expect all impenitent sinners that
thus fall, but looking particularly on the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
destruction and vengeance which seizeth
on whole Nations or Multitudes at once in this
life.</hi> And in conclusion hath left us but one
place in the N. Testament, to prove the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lagration of the World, <hi>viz. 2 Pet. 7. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now because some have been offended at
these Interpretations of his, others have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
very slightingly of them: I shall briefly
sum up what hath been alledged in defence
of them by this great Man.</p>
               <p>1. That the Prophets use to set down their
Predictions in Tropes and Figures, and not in
plain Expressions, <hi>(their Style being Poetical.)</hi>
And therefore in describing those hideous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96662:146"/>
Judgments which fell upon that People of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> beyond all that ever before fell
upon them, or indeed any other People, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound it necessary to employ those High and
Tragical Phrases of the passing away and
dissolving Heaven, and Earth, and Elements.
And that this was the manner of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
may be proved; because we find the
destruction of other places described in as
high Strains, as lofty and tragical Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as this of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For example,
that of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> Isai. 34. 9. <hi>The streams there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof
shall become burning pitch. It shall not be
quenched night nor day, the smoke thereof
shall go up for ever.</hi> And in the fourth
Verse he seems but to Preface to this Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in these words, <hi>And all the host of
Heaven shall be dissolved, and the Heavens
shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their
hosts shall fall down as the leaf falleth off
from the Vine, and as a falling Fig from the
Fig-tree; for my Sword shall be bathed in
Heaven: Behold it shall come down upon</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumaea.
And in the Burden of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
Chap. 13. 8, 9. we have these words, <hi>Behold
the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with
wrath and fierce anger to lay the Land deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
For the Stars of Heaven and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96662:147"/>
thereof shall not give their light:
The Sun shall be darkened in his going forth,
and the Moon shall not cause her Light to
shine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. All the Predictions in that famous place,
<hi>Matth. 24.</hi> to which all other places in the
New Testament relating to this matter are
parallel, are by our Saviour himself restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the
full completion of them limited to the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Age: Verse 34. <hi>Verily I say
unto you, This generation shall not pass till
all these things be fulfilled.</hi> What reason
then can we have to extend them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>3. In most of the places where this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ is mentioned, it is spoken of
as near, and at hand; as in the places last
cited. Now, (saith the Learned Doctor) in
his Note upon <hi>Luke 18. 7. I tell you he will
avenge them speedily.</hi> All which, if (when
it is said to approach and to be at the door)
it belonged to the Day of Judgment (now
after so many hundred years not yet come)
what a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were this? what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
of his coming? and consequently,
what an Objection against the truth of the
Christian Religion? As <hi>Mahomet</hi> having
promised after his death he would presently
return to life, and having not performed his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96662:147"/>
Promise in a thousand years is by us justly
condemned as an Impostor.</p>
               <p>4. That this place of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> out of
which I have taken my Text, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the end of the World, sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
(saith he) by the purport of this
whole Epistle, which is to arm them with
constancy and perseverance till that Day
come, and particularly in this Chapter to
confute them who object against the truth
of Christ's Predictions, and resolve it should
not come at all; against whom he here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the certainty, the speediness, and the
terribleness of its coming. And for that
other famous place, <hi>2 Thess. 1. 8, 9.</hi> that
it belongs to the same Period; see how he
makes it out in his Annotations.</p>
               <p>I shall now superadd some places out of
the Old Testament, which seem to speak of
the Dissolution of the World, <hi>Iob 14. 12. Man
lieth down and riseth not till the Heavens be
no more.</hi> Psal. 102. 5, 6. quoted <hi>Hebr. 1.
10, 11. Of old hast thou laid the foundations
of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works

<hi>And all the host of Heaven shall be dissolved,

Prophetick Books are full of figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
being written in a Poetick Style,
and according to the strain of the Oriental
Rhetorick, which is much different from
the <hi>European,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and excessive <hi>Hyperbola's</hi> and Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations,
which would either sound harsh
to our Ears, or import a great deal more
to us than they did to them. This is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to any one that reads their Books; and
may clearly be demonstrated from the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

that their Kings assumed to themselves
as well anciently as lately, <hi>viz. Sons of the
Sun, Brethren of the Sun and Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Stars, Lions crowned in the Throne

whole Heaven, and Virtue of the Firmament.</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:96662:148"/>
Now we cannot possibly imagine them so
vain as to think themselves litterally to be
such: no sure, all they meant by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
was that they were great, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and powerful. Now the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Books of the Old Testament being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in a Style somewhat conformable to the
Oratory of those Countreys, are not (I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive) in every title to be so exactly
scanned and litterally expounded, but so to
be interpreted as a <hi>Iew</hi> or an <hi>Asiatick</hi> would
then have understood them. And this I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think, because there be divers passages
in the Prophets, which cannot be verified in
a strict literal sense; as in the place before
quoted, <hi>Isa. 34. 9.</hi> It is said of the <hi>streams of</hi>
Idumaea <hi>that they should be turned into pitch,
and the dust thereof into brimstone; and the
Land thereof should become burning pitch,
and should not be quenched night nor day;
but the smoke thereof should go up for ever.</hi>
And of the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> it is said, <hi>Ezek.
26. 14. It shall be built no more.</hi> And <hi>verse
19. When I shall make thee a desolate City,
like the Cities that are not inhabited, when
I shall bring up the Deep upon thee, and
great waters shall cover thee.</hi> And <hi>verse 21.</hi>
which is thrice repeated, <hi>I will make thee
a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though
thou be sought for, thou shalt never be found
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96662:149"/>
again, saith the Lord God.</hi> And yet we see
that the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> though it was indeed
wholly dis-peopled at that time, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
transferring themselves into <hi>Africa,</hi>
when it was besieged by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi>
yet was it afterward peopled again, and
continues a City inhabited to this day. And
of <hi>Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it is said that <hi>there should none
remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that
it should be desolate for ever,</hi> Jer. 51. 62. Isai.
13. 20. and of the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Vers. 29.
<hi>that it should be a desolation without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant.</hi>
And though indeed this Prophesy
was, I think, as to the City, at last verified in
the Letter; yet did <hi>Babylon</hi> long continue a
great City after this Prophesy: And the
Land of <hi>Babylon</hi> is now inhabited, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this day a great City not far from the
place where <hi>Babylon</hi> stood. So that these
places import no more, then that there should
be a very great Destruction and Devastation
of those Cities and Countries. As for those
places in the Old and New Testament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mention is made of the last Days and the
last Times, it is clear that they are to be
understood of the Age of the Messiah, all
the time from the Exhibition of the Messiah
to the end of the World. <hi>Isaiah 2. 1. And
it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
Mountain of the Lords House shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96662:149"/>
in the top of the Mountains, and shall
be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations
shall flow to it;</hi> which very words we have
repeated <hi>Michah 4. 1.</hi> So in that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Ioel 2. 28.</hi> quoted <hi>Acts 2. 17. And it
shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,
I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,</hi> &amp;c.
it is clear the last days are to be understood.
The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> interpreting the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<hi>(verse 16.)</hi> of the <hi>gift of Tongues</hi> bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Disciples at that time. Hence
the <hi>last Days</hi> have among the <hi>Iews</hi> prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially
signified the days of the Messiah, as
Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Annotations upon
this place tells us; who also notes, that in
that place of <hi>Ioel the last days</hi> do literally
signifie the last days of the <hi>Iews,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
preceding their destruction, called
there the <hi>great and terrible day of the Lord.</hi>

of the Church and Christian
Writers have delivered concerning the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the World.</p>
               <p>That there should be a Dissolution of this
World, and that it shall be by Fire, is so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and clear among them, that it would
be superfluous to cite Particulars to prove it:
nay, so general and unanimous is the consent
of all Christians in this Point, that, as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
observes in his third <gap reason="foreign">

whereas there can hardly be named any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of our Faith, which some Hereticks
have not presumed to Impugne or call in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96662:150"/>
Question, yet not any to be met with who
question this; but herein all agree, being
compelled (saith <hi>Origen</hi>) by the Authority of
the Scriptures. As for the time of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
the ancient Christians held it to be
at hand, as might easily be proved by many
Testimonies, were it not granted on all
hands. And here it may be worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that the longer the World stood, the
further off generally have Christians set the
Day of Judgment, and end of it. Many of
the Ancients did conceive, that the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be at the end of six thousand
years. As for Example, <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in
<hi>Quaest. &amp; Resp. ad Orthodoxos,</hi> if he be the

<hi>(When the end of the World should be?)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

&amp;c. <hi>We may rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conjecture and conclude from many Scripture
Expression, that they are in the right who say
that the World will last six thousand years.
For in one place it saith,</hi> In these last days;
<hi>and in another,</hi> Upon whom the Ends of the
World are come; <hi>and in a third,</hi> When the

Man's Body. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon this place,
He saith, <hi>new Heavens</hi> and a <hi>new Earth,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>.
They shall not be destroyed or annihilated,

This he saith, not
denoting the Non-existence of the Creation,
but the Renewing. In this manner he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<hi>Psalm 102. 5, 6.</hi> and proceeding,
saith, We may here take notice, that the

From which words</hi> [as a Vesture shalt thou

might add abundance more Testimonies, but
these I think may suffice.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> They held that as
the World was at first composed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
concourse of Atomes, so it should at
last fall in pieces again by their fortuitous
Separation, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath it, <hi>lib. 5.</hi>

                     <l>But now to prove all this; first cast an Eye,</l>
                     <l>And look on all below, on all on high,</l>
                     <l>The solid Earth, the Seas, and arched Sky:</l>
                     <l>One fatal hour must ruine all,</l>
                     <l>This glorious Frame, that stood so long, must
fall.</l>
                  </q>
This Opinion of theirs is consonant enough
to their wild Principles, save only in that
point of its suddenness, <hi>Vna dies dabit exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
&amp;c. one day shall destroy or make an
end of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> were also of Opinion that the
World must be dissolved, as we may learn
from the Seventh Book of <hi>Laertius</hi> in the
Life of <hi>Zeno,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. They
hold that the World is corruptible for these
Reasons; 1. Because it was generated, and
had a beginning. 2. Because That is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
in the whole, whose parts are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible:
But the parts of the World are
corruptible, being daily transmuted one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another. 3. That which is capable of
Mutation from better to worse is corruptible.
But such is the World; sometimes being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with long Heats and Droughts, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with continued Showers and Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
To those we may add 4. according to
some of their Opinions, Because the Sun and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96662:154"/>
Stars being fed with Vapours exhaled from
the Earth, all the moisture will at length be
drawn out, and the World fly on fire. They

all their parts together.

once by the violence of Fire, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by the force and abundance of Water;
in consequence whereof he erected two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
one of Brick, which might endure the
Fire, and another of Stone, which would
resist the Water; and upon them engraved
his Astronomical Observations, that so they
might remain to Posterity: And one of these
Pillars, he saith, continued in <hi>Syria</hi> until his
days. Whether this Relation be true or not,
it may be thence collected, that this was an
Universal Opinion, received by Tradition,
both among <hi>Iews</hi> and Gentiles. That the
World should one day be consumed by Fire.
It may be proved by good Authority, that
the ancient <hi>Gaules, Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> had
this Tradition among them: which they
could not receive from the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers
or Poets, with whom they had no entercourse;

that is, from the first Restorers of Mankind,
<hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to the Third Particular
proposed in the beginning; that is, to give
answer to the several Questions concerning
the Dissolution of the World.</p>

                  <p>THE First Question is, Whether there
be any thing in Nature, which may
prove and demonstrate, or probably argue
and infer a future Dissolution? To which I
answer, That I think there is nothing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which doth necessarily demonstrate a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Dissolution: but that Position of the
<hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools may, for ought I know,
be true Philosophy, <hi>Posito ordinario Dei con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursu

But though a future Dissolution by
Natural Causes, be not demonstrable; yet
some possible, if not probable, Accidents
there are, which, if they should happen,
might infer such a dissolution. Those are
Four: The possibility of
<list>
                        <item>1. The Waters again overflowing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Earth.</item>
                        <item>2. The Extinction of the Sun.</item>
                        <item>3. The Eruption of the <hi>Central Fire</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed

                        <item>4. The Driness and Inflammability of the

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I treat of these, it will not be
amiss, a little to consider the old Argument
for the Worlds Dissolution, and that is, its
daily Consenescence and Decay: which, if it
can be proved, will in process of time, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
infer a Dissolution. For as the Apostle
saith in another case, <hi>That which decayeth and
waxeth old is ready to vanish away,</hi> Hebr. 8. 13.
That which continually wastes, will at last be
quite consumed: that which daily grows
weaker and weaker, will in time lose all its
force. So the Age, and Stature and Strength
of Man, and all other Animals, every Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
decreasing, they will in the end come
to nothing. And that all these, and all other
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96662:160"/>
things do successively diminish and decay in
all Natural Perfections and Qualities, as well
as Moral, hath been the received Opinion,
not only of the Vulgar, but even of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
themselves from Antiquity down to our
times. <hi>Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 7. c. 16. In plenum
autem cuncto mortalium generi minorem indies
mensuram staturae propemodum observatur:
rarosque patribus proceriores consumente uber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
seminum exustione; in cujus vices nunc
vergat aevum. In sum; It is observed that
the measure of the stature of all Mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
and grows less daily: and that there
are few taller then their Parents; the burning
(to which the Age inclines) consuming the
Luxury of the Seeds.</hi>

                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:96662:161"/>
But this Opinion, how general soever it
was formerly, was inconsiderately and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sufficient ground, taken up at first; and
afterwards without due examination embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and followed; as appears by Dr. <hi>Hake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil</hi>'s
<hi>Apology,</hi> wherein it is so fundamentally
confuted; that it hath since been rejected by
all considerate Persons. For that Author hath
at large demonstrated, that neither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
decay of the Heavenly Bodies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Motion, Light, Heat or Influence;
or of any of the Elements: neither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
decay of Animals, and particularly
and especially of Mankind, in regard of Age
and Duration, of Strength and Stature, of
Arts and Wits, of Manners and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do necessarily infer any decay in the
World, or any tendency to a Dissolution.
For though there be at times great Changes of
Weather, as long continuing Droughts, and
no less lasting Rains; excessive Floods and
Inundations of the Sea; prodigious Tempests
and Storms of Thunder, Lightning and Hail;
which seem to threaten the ruin of the World;
violent and raging Winds, Spouts and Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,
which turn up the Sea to the very
bottom, and spread it over the Land; formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and destructive Earthquakes, and furious
Eruptions of <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s or burning Mountains,
which waste the Country far and wide, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96662:161"/>
or subverting great Cities, and
burying the Inhabitants in their ruins, or as
the Scripture speaks, <hi>Making of a City a heap,
of a defenced City a ruin.</hi> Though these and
many other Changes do frequently happen,
at uncertain Seasons as to us, yet are they so
ordered by the wise Providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creatour and Governour of the
World, as nearly to balance one another,
and to keep all things in an <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> so
that as it is said of the Sea, that <hi>what it
gains in one place, it loses in another,</hi> it may
be said proportionably of the other Elements
and Meteors; That, for Example, a long
Drought in one Place is compensated proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at the same time by as long a Rain in
another; and at another time, the Scene
being changed, by as durable a Drought in
this, as lasting a Rain in that. The same
may be said of violent and continuing Heats
and Colds in several Places, that they have
the like Vicissitudes and Changes, whereby in
the whole they so balance and counterpoise
one another, that neither prevails over other,
but continue and carry on the World as surely
and steddily, as if there were no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties
and Fights, no such Tumults and
Commotions among them. The only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against this Opinion, is the Longaevity
of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs, and of some
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96662:162"/>
also (I mean the first) of the <hi>Postdiluvian.</hi>
For immediately after the Flood the Age of
Man did gradually decrease every Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in great proportions? so that had it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
so to do at that rate, the Life of Man
had soon came to nothing. Why it should
at last settle at Threescore and ten Years, as
a mean Term; and there continue so many
Ages, without any further Change and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
is, I confess, a Mystery too hard
for me to reveal: However, there must be
a great and extraordinary Change at the
time of the Flood, either in the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Air, or Quality of the Food, or
in the Temper and Constitution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Man, which induced this decrement
of Age. That the Temper and Constitution
of the Bodies of the <hi>Antediluvians</hi> was more
firm and durable than that of their Posterity
after the Flood: and that this Change of
Term of Life was not wholly to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to Miracle, may both be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the gradual decrease of the Age of
the <hi>Postdiluvians.</hi> For had it been miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
why should not the Age of the very
first Generation after the Flood have been
reduced to that Term? And what account
can we give of their holding out for some
Generations against the Inconveniencies of
the Air, or deteriority of Diet, but the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96662:162"/>
strength and firmness of their Constitutions?
which yet was originally owing to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the Air, or Quality of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
or both; seeing a Change in these (for
there was no other visible Cause) did
by degrees prevail against, and impair
it. What influence the lying so long of the
Water upon the Earth might have upon the
Air and Earth, in ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nging them for the
worse, and rendring them more unfit for the
maintenance and continuance of Humane
Life, I will not now dispute. But whatever
might be the Cause of the Longaevity of the
<hi>Antediluvians,</hi> and the contracting of the
Age of the <hi>Postdiluvians,</hi> it is manifest, that
the Age of these did at the last settle, as I
said, at or about the Term of Threescore
and ten, and hath there continued for
Three thousand years without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the Accidents which
might possibly, in process of Time, infer a
Dissolution of the World.</p>
                  <p>1. The possibility of the Water in process
of Time again overflowing and covering of
the Earth.</p>
                  <p>For, first of all, the Rains continually
washing down and carrying away Earth from
the Mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is necessary, that as well
the height as the bulk of them that are not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96662:163"/>
wholly rocky, should answerably decrease;
and that they do so, is evident in Experience.
For, as I have elsewhere noted, I have been
informed by a Gentleman of good Credit,
that whereas the Steeple of <hi>Craich</hi> in the
<hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> in the memory of some
old Men then living [1672.] could not have
been seen from a certain Hill lying between
<hi>Hopton</hi> and <hi>Wirksworth,</hi> now not only the
Steeple, but a great part of the Body of the
Church may from thence be seen; which
comes to pass by the sinking of a Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Church and the place of view:
a parallel example whereto the learned Dr.
<hi>Plot</hi> gives us, in a Hill between <hi>Sibbertoft</hi>
and <hi>Hasleby</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire, Hist, Nat.
Stafford p. 113.</hi> And thus will they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to do so long as there falls any Rains,
and as they retain any declivity, that is, till
they be levelled with the Plains.</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of this Particular, I have
received from my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Lloyd,</hi> some notable Observations of
his own making concerning the Mountains
of <hi>Wales;</hi> which do demonstrate that not
only the looser and the lighter parts of the
Mountains, as Earth, Sand, Gravel, and
small Stones, may be washed down by the
Rains: but the most solid and bulky Rocks
themselves, by the violent descent of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96662:163"/>
Waters down their Chinks and Precipices,
be in time undermined and subverted. Take
them in his own words:</p>
                  <p>Vpon the reading of your Discourse of the
Rains continually washing away, and carrying
down Earth from the Mountains, I was put in
mind of something pertinent thereto, which I
have observed in the Mountains of <hi>Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi>
viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. First, That generally the higher the
Hills are the more steep are their Precipices
and Declivities (I except the Sea-rocks) thus
<hi>Moel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y Wydhrha, y G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>îb gôtch,</hi> and twenty
others that might be named, reputed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Hills in <hi>Wales,</hi> have the steepest Rocks
of any Mountains I have seen; and that not
only in their highest Cliffs, but also in most
of their other Crags, till you descend to the
lower Valleys: This I can ascribe to nothing
else but the Rains and Snow which fall on those
high Mountains, I think, in ten times the
quantity they do on the lower Hills and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</p>
                  <p>2. I have observed a considerable quantity
of the chips or parings (if I may so call them)
of these Cliffs to lye in vast heaps at the roots
of them; and these are of several sorts and
materials: being in some places covered with
Grass, and in others as bare as the Sea-shore:
and those bare places do consist sometimes of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96662:164"/>
Gravel, and an innumerable number of Rock-fragments
from a pound weight to twenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and are sometimes composed of huge Stones
from an hundred pound weight to several
Tuns.</p>
                  <p>3. In the Valleys of <hi>Lhanberys</hi> and <hi>Nant-Phrankon,</hi>
the People find it necessary to rid
their Grounds often of the Stones which the
Mountain floods bring down; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this care, they often lose considerable
parcels of Land.</p>
                  <p>4. I affirm, That by this means not only such
Mountains as consist of much Earth and small
Stones, or of softer Rocks, and such as are more
easily dissoluble, are thus wasted, but also the
hardest Rocks in <hi>Wales;</hi> and they seem to be
as weighty, and of as firm and close a texture
as Marble it self. It happen'd in the Valley
of <hi>Nant-Phrancon, Anno 1685.</hi> that part of
a Rock of one of the impendent Cliffs, call'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, became so undermined (doubtless
by the continual Rains and subterraneous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eins
of Water occasioned by them) that losing its
hold it fell down in several pieces, and in its
passage down a sleep and craggy Cliff, dislodged
thousands of other Stones, whereof many were
intercepted e're they came down to the Valley,
but as much came down as ruin'd a small piece
of Ground; and several Stones were scatter'd
at least 200 yards asunder. In this Accident
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96662:164"/>
one great Stone, the biggest remaining piece of
the broken Rock, made such a Trench in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
as the small Mountain rills commonly
run in; and when it came down to the plain
Ground, it continued its passage through a small
Meadow, and a considerable Brook, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self on the other side it. From hence I
gather that all the other vast Stones that lye
in our mountainous Valleys, have by such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
as this fallen down. Vnless perhaps
we may do better to refer the greatest part of
them to the Vniversal Deluge. For consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are some thousands of them in these
two Valleys [of <hi>Lhanberys</hi> and <hi>Nant-Phran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereof (for what I can learn) there
are but two or three that have fallen in the
memory of any Man now living; in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
course of Nature we shall be compelled to
allow the rest many thousands of years more
then the Age of the World. <hi>So far Mr.</hi>
Lloyd.</p>
                  <p>To this last Particular, and for a further
account of it, may be added, That sometimes
there happen strange and violent Storms and
Hurricanes, wherein the Rain is driven with
that sorce upon the tops and sides of the
Mountains by furious and tempestuous
Winds, as to do more execution upon them
by breaking in pieces, tearing and throwing
down Rocks and Stones, in a few days, then
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96662:165"/>
in the ordinary course of Nature, by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Weather is effected in many hundred
years.</p>
                  <p>2. By reason of the abundance of Earth
thus washed off the Mountains by shots of
Rain, and carried down with the Floods to
the Sea; about the out-lets of the Rivers,
where the violent Motion of the Water cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
setling to the bottom, and raising it up
by degrees above the Surface of the Water,
the Land continually gains upon, and drives
back the Sea: The <hi>Egyptian Pharos</hi> or Light-house
of old time stood in an Island a good
distance from Land, which is now joyned to
the Continent, the interjacent <hi>Fretum</hi> having
been filled up by the Silt brought down by
the River <hi>Nilus</hi> in the time of the Flood
subsiding there. Indeed the ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
do truly make the whole Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Gift of
the River, and by this means gained from
the Sea. <hi>Seneca</hi> in the sixth Book of his
<hi>Nat. Quest. chap. 26.</hi> gives this account,
<hi>Aegyptus ex limo tota concrevit. Tantum enim
(si Homero fides) aberat à continenti Pharos,
quantum navis diurno cursu metiri plenis lata
velis potest. Sed continenti admota est.
Turbidus enim defluens Nilus, multumque se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
limum trahens, &amp; eum subinde apponens
prioribus terris, Aegyptum annuo incremento
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96662:165"/>
semper ultra tulit. Inde pinguis &amp; limosi soli
est, nec ulla intervalla in se habet; sed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit
in solidum arescente limo, quo pressa erat
&amp; cedens structura, &amp;c.</hi> that is, all <hi>Egypt</hi> is
but a Concretion of Mud. <hi>For (if</hi> Homer
<hi>may be believed) the</hi> Pharos <hi>was as far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Continent, as a Ship with full
sail could run in a days time; but now it is
joyned to it. For</hi> Nilus <hi>flowing with troubled
Waters brings down a great deal of Mud and
Silt, and adding it to the old Land, carries
on</hi> Egypt <hi>further and further still by an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
increase. Hence it is of a fat and muddy
Soil, and hath no pores or cavities in it. And
this Reason he gives why it is not troubled with
Earthquakes.</hi> Which also may be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why it hath no fresh Springs and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
For though indeed Dr. <hi>Robinson</hi> doth
very probably impute its want of Rain and
Springs to the want of Mountains; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as we shall afterwards prove) Springs
may be derived from Mountains at a good
distance, I know not whether all Mountains
are so far remote from <hi>Egypt,</hi> as that there
may be no subterraneous Channels of that
length as to derive the Water even thither
from them; and therefore probably one
Reason of their wanting of Springs may be
the density and thickness of the Soil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it becomes impenetrable to the Water;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96662:166"/>
and it may be, should they use the same
Artifices there, which the Inhabitants of the
lower <hi>Austria,</hi> and of the Territory of
<hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> do, that is, dig
and bore quite through this Coat of Mud
till they come to a Sand or looser Earth,
they might in like manner procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Fountains of springing Water. Thus
by reason of the great Rivers, <hi>Po, Athesis,
Brenta,</hi> and others, which empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the <hi>Lagune,</hi> or Shallows about
<hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in times of Floods bring
down thither great store of Earth, those
<hi>Lagune</hi> are in danger to be in time atterrated,
and with the City situate in the midst of
of them, added to the firm Land, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already bare at every Ebb, only Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
maintain'd from all the neighbouring
Places to the City, not without considerable
Charge to the State in Engines and Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in some places to clear them of the Mud,
wherewith otherwise they would indanger
to be obstructed and choaked up; which
Engines they call <hi>Cava-fango's.</hi> Thus in the
<hi>Camarg,</hi> or Isle that the River <hi>Rhosne</hi> makes
near <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> there hath been so
much lately gained from the Sea, that the
Watch-tower had, in the memory of some
Men living 1665. been removed forward
three times, as we were there informed.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96662:166"/>
And it seems to me probable, that the whole
<hi>Low-Countreys</hi> were thus gained from the
Sea: For <hi>Varenius</hi> in his Geography tells
us, That sinking a Well at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> at
near an hundred foot depth, they met with
a bed or floor of Sand and Cockle-shells;
whence it is evident, one would think, that of
old time the bottom of the Sea lay so deep,
and that that hundred foot thickness of
Earth above the Sand, arose from the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Waters of those great Rivers,
the <hi>Rhine, Scheld, Maes, &amp;c.</hi> which there abouts
emptied themselves into the Sea, and
in times of Floods brought down with them
abundance of Earth from the upper Grounds:
The same Original doubtless had that great
Level of the Fens, running through the Isle
of <hi>Ely, Holland</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and <hi>Marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> That there hath been no
small quantity of Earth thus brought down,
appears also in that along the Channels of
most great Rivers, as for Example, the
<hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> especially near
their Mouths or Out-lets, between the
Mountains and higher Grounds on each side,
there are large Levels and Plains, which seem
to have been originally part of the Sea,
raised up, and atterrated by Earth and Silt
brought down by those Rivers in great
Floods.</p>

is the River <hi>Pyramus,</hi> which hath added a

which there is an Oracle come abroad,
importing, That there will a time come in

carry on the Shore and Land up the Sea
as far as <hi>Cyprus—</hi> So it might in time
happen that the whole Sea should gradually
be landed up, beginning from the Shores, if
the Effusions of the Rivers, that is, the Earth
and Mud they bring down did spread so wide
as to be continuous. Thus far <hi>Strabo.</hi> But
the Oracle he mentions, predicting the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on and continuation of <hi>Cilicia</hi> as far as
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the joyning that Island to the
Continent, proves false; there having not
been as yet, that we hear or read of, any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
advance made towards it, in almost
2000 years.</p>
                  <p>Now the Rain thus continually washing
away, and carrying down Earth from the
Mountains and higher Grounds, and raising
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96662:168"/>
up the Valleys near the Sea, as long as there
is any descent for the Rivers, so long will
they continue to run, carry forward the low
Ground, and streighten the Sea; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by its working, by reason of the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
easily carries down the Earth towards
the lower and middle part of its Channel
<hi>[alveus]</hi> and by degrees may sill it up.
Monsieur <hi>Loubere</hi> in his late Voyage to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
takes notice of the increase of the Banks
and Sands in and near the Mouths of the
great Rivers of the Oriental Kingdoms,
occasion'd by the Sediments brought down
from the Countries by the several Streams;
so that, says he, the Navigation into and up
those Rivers grows more and more difficult,
and may in process of time be quite inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
The same Observation, I believe,
may be made in most of our great Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean
Rivers, wherein new Beds are rais'd,
and old ones enlarged. Moreover, the Clouds
still pouring down Rain upon the Earth, it will
descend as far as there is any declivity; and
where that fails it will stagnate, and joyning
with Sea, cover first the skirts of the Earth, and
so by degrees higher and higher, till the
whole be covered.</p>
                  <p>To this we may add, that some assistance
toward the levelling of the Mountains, may
be contributed by the Courses and Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96662:168"/>
of subterraneous Rivers washing away
the Earth continually, and weakning their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oundations, so by degrees causing them to
founder, subside, and fall in. That the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
do daily diminish, and many of them
sink; that the Valleys are raised; that the
skirts of the Sea are atterrated, no man can
deny. That these things must needs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time have a very considerable and
great effect, is as evident; which what else
can it be, then that we have mentioned?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, towards this levelling of the
Mountains, and filling up of the Sea, the fire
also contributes its Mite. For the burning
Mountains or <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> as for example <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> vomit at times out of their
Bowels such prodigious quantities of Sand
and Ashes, and with that force, that they
are by the Winds carried and dispersed all
over the Country, nay transported over
Seas into foreign and remote Regions; but
let fall so copiously in the circumjacent places,
as to cover the Earth to a considerable thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and not only so, but they also pour
forth Floods of melted Stones, Minerals and
other Materials, that run down as low as the
Sea, and fill up the Havens, as of old one
near <hi>Catana;</hi> and make Moles and Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
or Points, as in the last Eruptions both
of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius;</hi> the Tops of these
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96662:169"/>
Mountains falling in and subsiding propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the quantity of the ejected mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as <hi>Borellus</hi> proves. Meeting with a
quotation in Dr. <hi>Hakewil</hi>'s Apology out of
<hi>Iosephus Blancanus</hi> his Book <hi>De Mundi Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brica,</hi>
I earnestly desired to get a fight of
that Book, but could not procure it till the
Copy of this Discourse was out of my hands
and sent up to <hi>London</hi> in order to its printing,
But then obtaining it, I found it so exactly
consonant to my own thoughts, and to what
I have here written concerning that Subject;
and some Particulars occurring therein by
me omitted, that I could not forbear translating
the whole Discourse into <hi>English,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing
it to this Chapter, especially because
the Book is not commonly to be met with.

it might be very acceptable to the Reader,
if I should discover to him a thing most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be known; which I have long ago,
and for a long time observed, and am daily
more confirmed in; especially seeing no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Writer that I know of hath published
any thing concerning it. It is this, That the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96662:169"/>
                     <hi>Superficies</hi> of the whole Earth, which is now
rough and uneven by reason of Mountains
and Valleys, and so only rudely Sphaerical,
is daily from the very beginning of the
World reducing to a per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t roundness, in
so much that it will necessarily come to
pass in a natural way, that it be one day o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflown
by the Sea, and rendred unhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>First then, that we may clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Causes of this thing, we must lay
down as a Foundation from Holy Writ,
That the Terraqueous Globe was in the
beginning endued with a more perfect Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Figure, that is, without any inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Mountains and Valleys: and that
it was wholly covered with the Sea, and so
altogether unfit for Terrestrial Animals to
inhabit: but it was then rendred habitable,
when by the beck or command of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
the greatest part of the Land was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from one place to another, whereupon
here appeared the hollows of the Seas, there
the heights of the Mountains: And all the
Waters which before covered the face of
the whole Earth receded, and flowing down
filled those depressed and hollow places; and
this Congregation of Waters was called the
<hi>Sea.</hi> Hence some grave Authors doubt not
to assert, That the Mountains were made
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96662:170"/>
up of that very Earth which before filled
the Cavities of the Sea. Whence it follows,
that the Earth as now it is, mountainous
and elevated above the Waters, hath not
its Natural Figure, but is in a violent state:
but <hi>Nullum violentum est perpetuum.</hi> Besides
the Earth being heavier then the Water,
none of its parts ought to be extant and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
above its Superficies; and yet we see
that the Earth is really higher than the Sea,
especially the mountainous parts of it: in
which respect also both Land and Water
are in a violent state. Wherefore it is very
convenient to the Nature of both, that they
should daily return towards their ancient
and primigenial state and figure, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we affirm that they do so.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we say that the Waters, both
of Rains and Rivers, are the Cause of this
Restitution, as will appear by the following
Observations.</p>
                  <p>First we see that Rivers do daily fret and
undermine the Roots of the Mountains, so
that here and there from most Mountains
they cause great Ruins and Precipices,
whence the Mountains appear broken: and
the Earth so fallen from the Mountains the
Rivers carry down to the lower places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:96662:170"/>
From these Corrosions of the Rivers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>low, but great Ruines, called, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binae
à labendo;</hi> in which some Streets, and
whole Villages are precipitated into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>2. We daily see, that the Rain-waters
wash away the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Mountains,
and carry them down to the lower places.
Hence it comes to pass, that the higher
Mountains are also harder and more stony
than the rest, by means whereof they better
resist the Water. Hence also it comes to pass,
that ancient Buildings in Mountains, their
Foundations being by degrees discovered,
prove not very durable. For which reason
the Foundations of the <hi>Roman Capitol</hi> are now
wholly extant above ground; which of old,
at its first erection, were sunk very deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. This same thing all the Inhabitants of
the Mountains do confirm; all saying, that
this lowering of Mountains was long since
known to them; for that formerly some
intermediate Mountains intercepted the sight
of a Castle, or Tower, situate in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Mountain; which after many Years
the intervenient Mountain being depressed,
came clearly into view. And <hi>George Agricola</hi>
is of Opinion (which I very much approve
of) that the Rivers produced the Mountains
and Hills in this manner. In the beginning
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96662:171"/>
of the World there were not so many particular
divided Mountains, but only perpetual emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Ridges of Land, not dissected into so
many Valleys as we now see. So, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
our <hi>Appennine</hi> was at first one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
even eminent Ridge of Land, not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into any particular Mountains and Hills
by intervening Valleys, as now it is: but that
after the Rivers began to flow down from
the top of it, by little and little fretting and
corroding the Ground, they made Valleys,
and daily more and more; and by this
means the whole <hi>Apennine</hi> came to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into many Hills and Mountains.</p>
                  <p>3. In Plains we see the directly contrary
happens: for the Plains are daily more and
more elevated, because the Waters do let fall
in the plain and hollow places the Earth they
brought down with them from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Hence we see that ancient Buildings
in such places are almost wholly buried in
the ground. So in <hi>Rome,</hi> at the foot of the
<hi>Capitoline</hi> Mountain, we see the <hi>Triumphal
Arch of Septimius</hi> almost wholly overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Earth: and every-where in ancient
Cities many Gates and Doors of Houses al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
landed up, little thereof being extant
above ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:96662:171"/>
From which it appears, that this sinking
and demersion of Buildings into the Earth is
a manifest sign of their Antiquity, which is
so much the greater, by how much the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they are sunk. So, for example, at <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> many of the ancient Gates of the
City, which the <hi>Bolognese</hi> call <hi>Torresotti,</hi>
are very deeply sunk, which is a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of their Antiquity, and thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be true that Histories relate, that
they were built in the time of <hi>S. Petronius,</hi>
about 1200 Years ago. But here it is to be
noted, that other things agreeing, those are
deeper depressed that are built in lower pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
than those in higher, for the reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-said.
So at <hi>Bononia,</hi> that old Port cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Il Torresotto di S. Georgio,</hi> is deeplier
buried, or landed up, than that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Il Torresotto di Stra Castilione,</hi> because
that is situated in a lower place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Earth is more easily raised up about
it.</p>
                  <p>4. The same is affirmed by Architects,
who when they dig their Foundations, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where
in plain places first of all remove
the Earth which they call <hi>Commota</hi> [loose or
shaken] which is mixt with Fragments of
Wood, Iron, Rubbish, Coyns, ancient Urns,
and other things; which when it is thrown
out, they come to another sort of Earth that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96662:172"/>
hath never been stirred, but is solid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
and not mixt with any heterogeneous
things, especially artificial. That moved
[Commota] and impure Earth, is it which
the Waters have by little and little brought
down from the higher to the more depressed
places, which is not every-where of equal
depth. But now because in the Mountains
there is no where found such moved or new
Earth, as is plain from the Experience of
Architects, it is manifest that the Mountains
do by no means grow or encrease, as some
dream.</p>
                  <p>5. Our Observation is proved from that
Art which is now much practised of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and landing up depressed places by the
Waters of Rivers, and depressing the higher
by running the Water over them.</p>
                  <p>The same things happen about the Sea,
for whereas the bottom of the Sea is more
depressed than the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth;
and all the great Rivers empty themselves
into the Sea, and bring in with them a great
quantity of Earth and Sand, there must needs
be great Banks or Floors of Earth raised up
about the Sea-shores, near the mouths of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whereby the Shores must necessarily

This may be proved first by the Authority
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Meteor.</hi> cap. <hi>De permuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
terrae ac maris;</hi> and that of the ancient
Geographers and Historians. To omit that
Proof from <hi>Egypt; Aristotle</hi>'s second exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this landing up of the Sea, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Ammonia,</hi> whose Lower and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
place (saith he) it's clear, were by
this landing up first made Pools and Fens,
and in process of time these Pools were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, and raised to be firm Land, by Earth
brought down. A third example is that of
the <hi>Maeotis palus,</hi> whose skirts are so grown
up by what the Rivers bring down, that the
Waters will not carry any thing so great
Ships, as they would have done sixty Years
ago. A fourth is the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus,</hi>
which for brevity's sake may be seen in him.
Add hereto in the fifth place, the Testimony
of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who tells us, that much new Land
hath been added to the Earth, not only
brought in by the Rivers, but deserted by
the Sea.</p>
                  <p>So the Sea hath receded ten Miles
from the Port of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> and five from
that of <hi>Athens,</hi> and in several other places
more or less. What he adds out of <hi>Strabo,</hi>
concerning the River <hi>Pyramus</hi> is already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>

Thus far <hi>Blancanus,</hi> whose Sentiments
and Observations concerning this matter
thus punctually concurring and according
with mine, to my great wonder and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I could not but think that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
hath a high degree of probability.
Only he takes no notice, that in compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what the Rivers gain from the Sea
about their Outlets, the Sea may gain from
the Land by undermining and washing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Shores that are not rocky, (as we
see it doth in our own Country) perhaps as
much as it loses, according to the Vulgar
Proverb before remembred. However, all
contributes towards the filling up of the Sea,
and bringing on an Inundation, as I shall
afterwards shew.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, That if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
will thus naturally and necessarily in
process of time again overflow and cover the
Earth, how can God's Promise and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
be made good, <hi>Gen. 9. 11.</hi> That <hi>there
should not any more be a Flood to destroy the
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I answer, 1. That though this
would follow in a natural way, yet the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God may interpose to prevent it, and
so make good his Promise. 2. Though it
might come to pass in the Course of Nature,
yet would it be after so many Ages, that it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96662:174"/>
is not at all likely the World should last so
long: but the Conflagration or Destruction
of it by Fire, predicted by the Scriptures,
will certainly prevent it. 3. Possibly there
may be something in Nature which may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
this Event, though to us at present
unknown, which I am the more inclinable
to believe, because the Earth doth not hasten
so fast towards it as some of the Ancients
imagined, and as the activity of such Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
might seem to require, as I have already
intimated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Varenius</hi> in his Geography putting the
Question, Whether the Ocean may again
come to cover all the Earth, and make an
Universal Deluge; answers, That we may
conceive a way how this may naturally come
to pass. The manner thus; Supposing that
the Sea by its continual working doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
and wash away the Shores and
Cliffs that are not rocky, and carry the
Earth thereof down towards the middle, or
deepest parts of its Channel, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
fill it up. By doing this perpetually,
it may, in a long succession of Time, carry
all away, and it self cover the whole Earth.
That it doth thus subvert and wash away
the Shores in many places is in experience
true. About <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Dullart</hi>
in <hi>Friesland,</hi> and in <hi>Zealand</hi> many Villages,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96662:175"/>
some say Three hundred, have been drown'd
by the encroachments of the Sea, as some of
their Towers and Steeples still extant above
the Waters do testifie. On the <hi>Tuscan</hi> shore,
<hi>Kircher</hi> tells us, That not far from <hi>Ligorn</hi>
he himself had observed a whole City under
Water, that had been in former times
drown'd by the Inundation of the Sea. And
over against <hi>Puteoli</hi> in the <hi>Sinus</hi> of <hi>Baia,</hi> he
tells us, That in the bottom of the Sea, there
are not only Houses, but the Traces and
Footsteps of the Streets of some City ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
discernable. And in the County of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> almost the whole Town of <hi>Done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
with the adjacent Lands, hath been
undermined and devoured by the Sea.</p>
                  <p>This washing away of the Shores is,
I conceive, in great measure to be attributed
to the forementioned streightning and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
short of the Sea, by the Earth and Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t
that in the times of Floods are brought
down into it by the Rivers. For the Vulgar
have a Proverbial Tradition, <hi>That what the
Sea loses in one place, it gains in another.</hi>
And both t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gether do very handsomly make

                     </gap>in, how the Earth in a natural
way, may be reduced to its primitive state
in the Creation, when the Waters covered
the Land. But this according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
proceedings of Nature, would not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96662:175"/>
come to pass in many Ages, I might say, in
Ages of Ages: Nay, some think, that those
vast Ridges and Chains of Mountains, which
run through the middle of the Continents,
are by reason of their great height, weight
and solidity, too great a Morsel ever to be
devoured by the Jaws of the Sea. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be or not, I need not dispute,
though I incline to the Negative, because
this is not the dissolution the Apostle here
speaks of, which must be by Fire.</p>
                  <p>But I must not here dissemble an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I see may be made, and that is, That the
<hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth is so far from being
depressed, that it is continually elevated.
For in ancient Buildings, we see the Earth
raised high above the foot of them. So the
<hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was at first ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up to by many [eight] Steps, is now
descended down to by as many. The Basis
and whole Pedestal of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar there
was buried in the Earth.</p>

observ'd in some places, the Walls of old</hi> Rome,
<hi>to lye Thirty and Forty Foot under Ground;
so that he thinks the greater part of the
Remains of that famous Ancient City is still
buried, and undiscovered; the prodigious

the Vineyards and Gardens being not half
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96662:176"/>
dig'd up or search't, as they might be, the

Mr. <hi>Edward Loyd,</hi> not long since inform'd
of one, that himself had seen buried deep

Nay, the Earth in time will grow

that such great numbers (even wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, Woods)
of Subterraneous Trees are frequently met

Ruins and Rubbish of the Cities wherein
they stood, might be conceived to bury
them as deep as they now lye under ground.
And by this means it's likely the <hi>Roman</hi>
Pavements we find, might come to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

Buildings do in time overcome the resistance
of the Foundation, unless it be a solid Rock;
and sink into the ground.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the very soft Water, lying long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bottoms of the Sea or Pools, doth so
compress and sadden them by its weight,
that the very Roads that are continually
beaten with Horses and Carriages, are not
so firm and sad: And in the Sea, the nearer
you dig to the Low Water-Mark; still the
sadder and firmer it is: and it's probable still,
the further the sadder; which seems to be
confirmed by the strong fixing of Anchors.
[This firmness of the Sand, by the weight
of the incumbent Water, the People inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
near the Sea are so sensible of, that I
have seen them boldly ride through the
Water cross a Channel three Miles broad,
before the Tide was out, when in some
places it reacht to the Horses Belly.] A
semblance whereof, we have in Ponds,
which being newly digg'd, the Water that
runs into them, sinks soon into the Earth,
and they become dry again, till after some
time, by often filling, the Earth becomes
so solid, through the weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96662:177"/>
that they leak no more, but hold Water
up to the brink. <hi>Wittie Scarborough Spaw,

                  <p>What force a gentle, if continual pressure

of Trees, which we see will sometimes
pierce through the Chinks of Stone Walls,
and in time make great Cracks and Rifts in

The tender Roots of Herbs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

their way through Clay or Gravel. By the

comminution of the Earth, renders it more

and other Herbs can, with more facility,
creep abroad, and multiply their Fibres in
the light and loose Earth.</p>
                  <p>That the rotting of Grass, and other Herbs

the <hi>Superficies</hi> of it, I will not deny; that

the raising of the Superficies of the
Faith is very little and inconsiderable; and
none at all, unless in level Grounds, which
have but little declivity: For otherwise the
Soyl would by this time have come to be of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96662:177"/>
a very great depth, which we find to be but
shallow. Nor do I think, that so much as
the Trunks of fall'n Trees, are by this means
covered; but rather, that they sink by their
own weight, in time overcoming the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Earth, which without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
yields, being soaked and softned by
the Rains insinuating into it, and keeping it
continually most in Winter-time. But if
these Buildings be situate in Valleys, it is
clear, that the Earth brought down from the
Mountains by Rain, may serve to land them
up. Again, the Superficies of the Earth
may be raised near the Sea Coast, by the
continual blowing up of Sand by the Winds.
This happens often in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
where I observed a fair Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that
of the Parish called <hi>Lalant,</hi> which is the
Mother Church to St. <hi>Ives,</hi> and above two
Miles distant from the Sea, almost covered
with the Sand; little being extant above it,
but the Steeple and Ridge of the Roof. Nay,
a great part of St. <hi>Ives</hi> itself lies bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Night there had been a whole Street of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
so covered with Sand, that in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were fain to dig their way out of

also upon the Coast of <hi>Flanders</hi> and

are not many places liable to this Accident,

not; where it is indifferent, it must in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

yet if the matter be throughly examined,

it may at last fall out, there having been
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96662:178"/>
at certain times such near Offers in Nature
towards this sad Accident already.</q> 
                     <hi>Pliny</hi>
speaks of it as a thing not unfrequent, that
there should be, <hi>Prodigiosi &amp; longiores Solis
defectus, qualis occiso Dictatore Caesare &amp;</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniano
<hi>bello, totius anni pollore continuo, Hist.

defects of the Sun, such as happened when
Caesar the Dictator was slain; and in the
War with</hi> Anthony, <hi>when it was continually
pale and gloomy for a whole Year.</hi> The like
happened in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi>
writes; when for a whole Year together the
Sun was of a very dim and duskish Hue, as
if he had been in a perpetual Eclipse: And
in the time of <hi>Irene</hi> the Empress, it was so
dark for seventeen days together, that the
Ships lost their way in the Sea, and were
ready to run one against another, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>

of the Spots of the Sun by <hi>Scheiner,</hi>
and the appearing and disappearing of Fixt
Stars and Comets, and the excursions of these

some vast Periods of Time, the Sun may be
so inextricably inveloped by the <hi>Maculae,</hi> that
he may quite lose his Light; and then you
may easily guess what would become of the

The Eruption of the Central

                  <p>III. THE Possibility of the Eruption of
the Central Fire, if any such there
be, inclosed in the Earth. It is the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
of Monsieur <hi>des Cartes,</hi> that the Earth
was originally a Star, or great Globe of Fire,
like the Sun, or one of the Fixt Stars, situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in the Center of a <hi>Vortex</hi> continually
whirling round with it. That by degrees it
was covered over, or incrustated with <hi>Maculae,</hi>
arising on its Surface, like the Scum on a
boyling Pot, which still increasing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thicker and thicker, the Star losing its
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96662:179"/>
light and activity, and consequently the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Celestial Vortex about it growing
more weak, languid, and unable to resist the
vigorous incroaehments of the neighbouring
<hi>Vortex</hi> of the Sun; it was at last drawn in,
and wholly absorpt by it, and forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with its motion, and make one in the
Quire of the Sun's <hi>Satellites.</hi> This whole
Hypothesis I do utterly disallow and reject.
Neither did the Author himself (if we may
believe him) think it ture, that the Earth
was thus generated. For he saith, <hi>Quinimo
ad res naturales meliùs explicandas, earum
causas altiùs hic repetam quàm ipsas unquam
extitisse existimem. Non enim dubium est,
quin mundus ab initio fuerit creatus cum
omni sua perfectione, ità ut in eo &amp; Sol, &amp;
Terra, &amp; Luna, &amp; Stellae extiterint—
Hoc fides Christiana nos docet; hócque etiam
ratio naturalis planè persuadet. Attendendo
enim ad immensam Dei potentiam, non possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
existimare illum unquam quidquam fecisse,
quod non omnibus suis numeris fuerit absolutum.</hi>
That is, <hi>Moreover, for the better explicating
of Natural Things, I shall bring them from
higher or more remote Causes than I think they
ever had. For there is no doubt, but the
World was originally created in its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
so that in it were contained both Sun
and Moon, and Earth and Stars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96662:180"/>
the Christian Faith teacheth us, and this also
Natural Reason doth plainly persuade; for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the immense Power of God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think that he ever made any thing that
was not complete in all points.</hi> But thô he
did not believe that the Earth was generated,
or formed according to his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> yet
surely he was of Opinion, that it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
such a Body as he represented it after its
perfect Formation, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Fire in the
middle, and so many several Crusts or Coats
inclosing it: else would he have given us a
mere Figment or Romance instead of a Body
of Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>But tho' I do reject the <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> yet
the being of a Central Fire in the Earth is not,
so far as I understand, any way repugnant
to Reason or Scripture. For first of all, the
<hi>Scripture</hi> represents Hell as a Lake of Fire,
<hi>Mark 9. 43, 44, &amp;c. Revel. 20. 10, 14, 15.</hi>
and likewise as a low place beneath the Earth.
So <hi>Pslam 86. 13.</hi> and <hi>Deut. 32. 22.</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>nethermost hell.</hi> Prov. 15. 24. <hi>The way
of life is above to the wise, that he may depart
from hell beneath.</hi> 2. Many of the Ancients
understand that Article of the Creed; <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into Hell,</hi> of our Saviour's Descent
into that local Hell beneath the Earth, where
he trimphed over the Devil, and all the
Powers of Darkness. And particularly <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:96662:180"/>
interprets that saying of our Saviour,
That <hi>the Son of man should be three days in
the heart of the earth,</hi> of his being three
days in the middle of the Earth, which
could not be meant (saith he) of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
because that was hewen out of a
Rock in its <hi>Superficies.</hi> 3. It is a received
Opinion among the Divines of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that Hell is about the Center of the
Earth: insomuch as some of them have been
solicitous to demonstrate that there is room
enough to receive all the Damned, by giving
us the Dimensions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it repugnant to the History of
the Creation in <hi>Genesis.</hi> For tho' indeed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
doth mention only Water and Earth, as
the component parts of this Body; yet doth
he not assert that the Earth is a simple, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
homogeneous Body; as neither do
we, when we say, <hi>Vpon the face of the earth,</hi>
or the like. For the Earth, we see, is a Mass
made up of a multitude of different <hi>Species of</hi>
Bodies, <hi>Metals, Minerals, Stones,</hi> and other
Fossils, <hi>Sand, Clay, Marle, Chalk,</hi> &amp;c. which
do all agree in that they are consistent and
solid more or less, and are in that respect
contradistinguished to Water; and together
compound one Mass, which we call Earth.
Whether the interior parts of the Earth be
made up of so great a variety of different
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96662:181"/>
Bodies, is to us altogether unknown. For
tho' it be observed by Colliers, that the Beds
of Coals lie one way, and do always dip
towards the East, let them go never so deep;
so that, would it quit cost, and were it not
for the Water, they say, they might pursue
the Bed of Coals to the very Center of
the Earth, the Coals never failing or coming
to an end that way; yet that is but a rash
and ungrounded Conjecture. For what is
the depth of the profoundest Mines, were
they a Mile deep, to the Semidiameter of the
Earth? not as one to four thousand. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this Observation of Dipping with my
Notes about other Mines, I find that the
Veins or Beds of all generally run East and
West, and dip towards the East. Of which
what Account or Reason can we give, but
the motion of the Earth from West to East?
I know some say, that the Veins, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of Tin and Silver, dip to the North,
tho' they confess they run East and West,
which is a thing I cannot understand, the
Veins of those Metals being narrow things.
Sir <hi>Tho. Willoughby,</hi> in his fore-mentioned
Letter writes thus,—"I have talked
with some of my Colliers about the lying of
the Coal, and find, that generally the Basset
end (as they call it) lies West, and runs
deeper toward the East, allowing about
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96662:181"/>
twenty Yards in length to gain one in depth;
but sometimes they decline a little from this
posture; for mine lie almost South-West, and
North-East. They always sink to the East
more or less. There may therefore, for
ought we know, be Fire about the Center of
the Earth, as well as any other Body, if it
can find a <hi>Pabulum,</hi> or Fuel there to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. And why may it not? since the
Fires in those subterraneous Caverns of <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Vesuvius, Stromboli, Hecla,</hi> and other
burning Mountains or <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> have found
wherewith to feed them for Thousands of
Years. And as there are at some, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Periods of Time, violent Eruptions of
Fire from the <hi>Craters</hi> of those Mountains,
and mighty Streams of melted Materials
poured forth from thence: so why may not
this Central Fire in the Earth, (if any such
there be) receiving accidentally extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
supplies of convenient Fuel, either
from some inflammable Matter within, or
from without, rend the thick exterior <hi>Cortex</hi>
which imprisons it, or finding some Vents
and Issues break forth and overflow the
whole <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth, and burn up
all things. This is not impossible, and we
have seen some <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature which
bid fair towards a Probability of it. For
what should be the reason of new Stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96662:182"/>
and disappearing again; as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one in <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> which at first shone with
as great a lustre as <hi>Venus,</hi> and then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
diminishing, after some two Years va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
quite away? but that by great supplies
of combustible Matter, the internal Fire sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
increasing in quantity and force, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
found, or made its way through the
Cracks or Vents of the <hi>Maculae</hi> which inclosed
it, and in an instant, as it were, overflowed
the whole surface of the Star, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
that illustrious Light; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
again gradually decayed, its supply
failing. Whereas other newly appearing
Stars, which either have a constant supply
of Matter, or where the Fire hath quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
the <hi>Maculae,</hi> and made them comply
with its motion, have endured for a long time,
as that which now shines in the Neck of
<hi>Cygnus,</hi> which appears and disappears at
certain Intervals.</p>
                  <p>But because it is not demonstrable that
there is any such Central Fire in the Earth,
I propose the eruption thereof rather as a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
than probable means of a Conflagration:
and proceed to the last means whereby it
may naturally be effected; and that is:</p>

the Earth under the Torrid Zone,
with the eruption of the <hi>Vulcano's</hi> to set it on
fire. Those that hold the Inclination of the
<hi>Equator</hi> to the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> daily to diminish, so
that after the Revolutions of some Ages they
will jump and consent, tell us, that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
lying perpendicularly and constantly
on the parts under the <hi>Equator,</hi> the Ground
thereabout must needs be extremely parch'd
and rendred apt for Inflammation. But for my
part I own no such Decrement of Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the best Mathematicians of our
Age deny that there hath been any since the
eldest Observations that are come down to
us. For tho' indeed <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus</hi>
do make it more than we find it by above
twenty Minutes, yet that Difference is not
so considerable, but that it may well be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the Difference of Instruments, or
Observations in point of Exactness. So that
not having decreased for Eighteen hundred
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96662:183"/>
Years past, there is not the least ground for
Conjecture, that it will alter in Eighteen
hundred Years to come, should the World
last so long. And yet if there were such a
Diminution, it would not conduce much (so
far as I can see) to the bringing on of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.
For tho' the Earth would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
dried, and perchance thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more inflammable; yet the Air being
by the same Heat as much rarified, would
contain but few nitrous Particles, and so be
inept to maintain the Fire, which, we see,
cannot live without them: It being much
deaded by the Sun shining upon it; and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very remisly in Summer time, and hot
Weather: For this reason in Southern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
in extraordinary hot Seasons, the Air
scarce sufficeth for Respiration. To the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of this, let us a little consider what
Fire is. It seems to consist of three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sorts of parts. 1. An extremely thin
and subtil Body, whose Particles are in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vehement and rapid motion. 2. (A sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed)
Nitrous <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fewel, which it
receives from the Air. 3. A Sulphureous or
unctuous <hi>Pabulum,</hi> which it acts and preys
upon, passing generally by the Name of
Fewel. This 'fore-mentioned subtil Body
agitating the (supposed) Nitrous Particles
it receives from the Air, doth by their help,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96662:183"/>
as by Wedges, to use that rude similitude,
penetrate the unctuous Bodies, upon which
it acts, and divide them into their immediate
component Particles, and at length perchance
into their first Principles: which Operation
is called the Chymical Anatomy of mix'd
Bodies. So we see Wood, for Example, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by Fire into Spirit, Oyl, Water, Salt,
and Earth.</p>
                  <p>That Fire cannot live without those Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
it receives from the Air is manifest, in
that if you preclude the access of all Air, it
is extinguished immediately: and in that,
where and when the Air is more charged
with them. as in cold Countries, and cold
Weather, the Fire rages most: That likewise
it cannot be continued without an unctuous
<hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fewel, I appeal to the Experience
of all Men.</p>
                  <p>Now then in the rarified Air in the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Zone, the nitrous Particles being propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
scattered and thin set, the Fire that
might be kindled there would burn but very
languidly and remisly, as we said just now:
And so the Eruptions of <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s, if any such
happened, would not be like to do half the
Execution there that they would do in cold
Countries. And yet I never read of any
spreading Conflagration caused by the Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of any <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> either in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96662:184"/>
or in cold. They usually cast out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of thick Smoak like Clouds dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Air: and likewise Ashes and Stones,
sometimes of a vast bigness; and some of
them, as <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> Floods of Water; others,
(as <hi>Aetna</hi>) Rivers of melted Materials, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down many Miles: as for the Flames
that issue out of their Mouths at such times,
they are but transient, and mounting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
seldom set any thing on fire.</p>
                  <p>But not to insist upon this, I do affirm,
that there hath not as yet been, nor for the
future can be any such drying or parching of
the Earth under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> as some
may imagine. That there hath not yet been
I appeal to Experience, the Countries lying
under the Course of the Sun, being at this
day as fertile as ever they were, and wanting
no more Moisture now than of old they did;
having as constant and plentiful Rains in their
Seasons as they then had. That they shall
for the future suffer any more Drought than
they have heretofore done, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe or imagine, the Face of the
Earth being not altered, nor naturally alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as to the main, more at present than it
was heretofore. I shall now add the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

true indeed, were there nothing to hinder
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96662:184"/>
them, the Vapours exhaled by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
in those hot Regions, would be
cast off to the North, and to the South, a
great way, and not fall down in Rain there,
but toward the Poles; But the long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Ridges or Chains of exceeding high
Mountains are so disposed by the great and
wise Creator of the World, as, at least in our
Continent, to run East and West, as <hi>Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
in the Life of <hi>Peireskius</hi> well observes,
such are <hi>Atlas, Taurus,</hi> and the <hi>Alps,</hi> to
name no more: They are, I say, thus disposed
as if it were on purpose to obviate and stop
the Evagation of the Vapours Northward,
and reflect them back again, so that they must
needs be condensed, and fall upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
out of which they were elevated. And
on the South-side, being near the Sea, it is
likely that the Wind, blowing for the most
part from thence, hinders their excursion
that way. This I speak by presumption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in our Country for at least three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Year the Wind blows from the
great <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean: which was taken
notice of by <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in the Fifth of his
Commentaries, <hi>De Bello Gallico. Corus ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,

                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:96662:185"/>
As for any Desiccation of the Sea, I hold
that by mere natural Causes to be impossible,
unless we could suppose a Transmutation of
Principles or simple Bodies, which for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
alledged in a former Discourse I cannot
allow. I was then, and am still of Opinion,
that God Almighty did at first create a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and determinate number of Principles,
or variously figured Corpuscles, intransmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
by the force of any natural Agent,
even Fire itself, (which can only separate
the Parts of heterogeneous Bodies) yet not
an equal number of each kind of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples,
but of some abundantly more, as of
<hi>Water, Earth, Air, Aether;</hi> and of others
fewer, as of <hi>Oyl, Salt, Metals, Minerals,</hi>
&amp;c. Now that there may be some Bodies
indivisible by Fire, is, I think, demonstrable.
For how doth, or can Fire be conceived to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
one can hardly imagine any other way
than by its small parts, by reason of their
violent Agitation insinuating themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
compound Bodies, and separating their
parts; which allowing, yet still there is a
term of Magnitude, below which it cannot
divide, <hi>viz.</hi> it cannot divide a Body into
smaller parts than those whereof itself is
compounded. For taking, suppose, one least
Part of Fire, 'tis clear that it cannot insinuate
itself into a Body as little or less than itself:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96662:185"/>
and what is true of one is true of all: I say,
we can imagine no other way than this, unless
perchance by a violent stroke or shock, the
parts of the Body to be divided may be put
into so impetuous a motion as to fall in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of themselves into lesser Particles than
those of the impellent Body are, which I will
not suppose at present. Now it is possible,
that the Principles of some other simple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may be as small as the Particles of Fire.
But however that be, it is enough, if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of simple Bodies be by reason of their
perfect solidity naturally indivisible. Such a
simple Body, I suppose, Water separated from
all Heterogeneous Mixtures to be: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the same quantity thereof that was
at first created, doth still remain, and will
continue always in despight of all natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
unless it pleases the Omnipotent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to dissolve it. And therefore there can
be no Desiccation of the Seas, unless by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all its Water into Vapour, and suspending
it in the Air, which to do, what an immense
and long-continuing Fire would be requisite?
to the maintenance whereof all the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Materials near the Superficies of the Earth
would not afford Fuel enough. The Sun,
we see, is so far from doing it, that it hath
not made one step towards it these four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years, there being in all likelihood as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96662:186"/>
great a quantity of Water in the Ocean now
as was immediately after the Flood: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
there would probably remain as
much in it, should the World last four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years longer.</p>
                  <p>This Fixedness and Intransmutability of
Principles secures the Universe from Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the prevailing of one Element over
another, and turning it into its own Nature;
which otherwise it would be in continual
danger of. It secures likewise the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all the <hi>Species</hi> in the World, many of
which, if their Principles were transmutable,
might by such a change be quite lost: And
lastly bars the Production or Creation of any

be effected by natural or by

shall be?</head>
               <p>2. AS to the Second Question, Whether
shall this Dissolution be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and effected by natural or by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Means and Instruments, and what
those Means and Instruments shall be? I
answer in brief, that the Instrumental Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
of this Dissolution shall be natural.
For it is clear both by Scripture and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and agreed on all hands, that it shall
be that Catholick Dissolvent, <hi>Fire.</hi> Now to
the being and maintenance of Fire, there are
four things requisite. I. The active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or <hi>Aether. 2. Air,</hi> or a Nitrous <hi>Pabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
received from it: These two being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
together, are every-where at hand.
3. <hi>Fuel,</hi> which considering the abundance
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96662:187"/>
of combustible Materials, which are to be
found in all places upon or under the Surface
of the Earth, can no where be wanting.
4. The Accension and the sudden and equal
Diffusion of this Fire all the World over.
And this must be the Work of God, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and miraculous.</p>
               <p>Such a Dissolution of the World might
indeed be effected by that natural Accident
mentioned in the Answer to the Precedent
Question, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eruption of the Central
Fire. But because it is doubtful, whether
there be any such Fire in the middle of the
Earth or no: and if there ever were, it is
hard to give an account, how it could be
maintained in that infernal Dungeon for want
of Air and Fuel. And because, if it should
break forth in the Consistency of a thin
Flame, it would in all likelihood speedily
like Lightning mount up to Heaven, and
quite vanish away; unless we could suppose
Floods, nay Seas of melted Materials, or
liquid Fire, enough to overflow the whole
Earth, to be poured forth of those Caverns.
For these Reasons I reject that Opinion, and
do rather think that the Conflagration shall
be effected by a superficial Fire. Tho' I must
confess we read in <hi>Tacitus, Annal. 13.</hi> at the
end, of a sort of Fire that was not so apt to
disperse and vanish. "—The City of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96662:187"/>
the <hi>Inhonians</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> (saith he) confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
with us was afflicted with a sudden
Disaster: for Fires issuing out of the Earth,
burned Towns, Fields, Villages every-where,
and spread even to the Walls of a Colony
newly built, and could not be extinguished
neither by Rain, nor River-water, nor any
other Liquor that could be employed, until
for want of Remedy, or Anger of such a
Distraction, certain Peasants cast Stones afar
off into it; then the Flame somewhat slacking,
drawing near, they put it out with Blows of
Clubs, and other like, as if it had been a wild
Beast; last of all, they threw in Cloaths from
their Backs, which the more worn and fouler
they were, the better they quenched the Fire.

                  <hi>3. THE Third Question is,</hi> Whether
shall this Dissolution be gradual and
successive, or momentaneous and sudden?</p>
               <p>I answer, The Scripture resolves for the
latter, <hi>The day of the Lord shall come as a thief
in the night:</hi> a similitude we have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in Scripture, as in the tenth Verse of
this Chapter, in <hi>1 Thess. 15. 2. Rev. 3. 3.</hi> and
16. 15. And the Resurrection and Change of
Things, it is said shall be <hi>in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, 1</hi> Cor. 15. 52. Consonant
whereto both the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> held
their Dissolutions of the World should be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and brief, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> in the
place 'fore-mentioned tell us. And it is
suitable to the nature of Fire to make a quick
dispatch of things, suddenly to consume and
destroy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:96662:188"/>
And as it shall be sudden, so also shall it
be unexpected, being compared to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Flood in the Days of <hi>Noah, Mat.
24. 37, 38, 39. But as the days of Noah were,
so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
For as in the days that were before the flood,
they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that Noah
entred into the ark: And knew not until the
flood came and took them all away; so shall also
the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> And the
raining of Fire and Brimstone upon <hi>Sodom.</hi>
Luke 17. Thessal. 5. 3. <hi>For when they shall
say peace and safety, then sudden destruction
cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with
child.</hi> Now if it shall be thus sudden and
unexpected, it is not likely there should be
in Nature any manifest Tendency to it, or
remarkable Signs and Forerunners of it: for
such must needs startle and awaken the
World into an expectation and dread of it.
That there is at present no such Tendency
to Corruption, but that the World conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
still in as good state and condition as
it was two thousand Years ago, without the
least impairment or decay, hath been, as we

of these Expressions to this sudden

were most convenient to accept them in

               <p>5. THE Fifth Question is, At what
Period of Time shall the World
be dissolved? I answer, This is absolutely
uncertain and indeterminable. For since
this Dissolution shall be effected by the
extraordinary Interposition of Providence;
it cannot be to any Man known, unless
extraordinarily revealed. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tells us, That of that Day and Hour
knows no Man, no not the Angels of
Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Matth. 24. 36.</hi> And again,
<hi>Acts 1. 17.</hi> It is not for us to know the
Times and the Seasons, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath placed in his own power. And
this Dr. <hi>Hakewill</hi> brings as an Argument
that the World decays not, neither tends
to Corruption; because if it did, the time
of its actual Dissolution might be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:96662:190"/>
and foretold; which, saith he, the
Scripture denies. We may invert this
Argumentation, and infer; Because the
World doth not decay, therefore the time
of its Dissolution cannot be known.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithstanding this, many have
ventured to foretel the Time of the End
of the World, of whom some are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
confuted, the Term prefixt being past,
and the World still standing. <hi>Lactantius</hi>
in his time said, <hi>Institut. lib. 7. cap. 15.

most famous Opinion, and which hath
found most Patrons and Followers even
amongst the Learned and Pious, is that
of the Worlds duration for Six thousand

Conceit they tell us, That as the World

days of One thousand years long,
as in <hi>Verse 8.</hi> of this Chapter, and in <hi>Psal.
90. 4.</hi> This is likewise a received Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi> registred in the

<hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Tishbite</hi> to the Son of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> whom he raised from
the Dead, and by him handed down to
Posterity. I rather think with <hi>Reuterus,</hi>
that the Author of it was some <hi>Rabbi</hi> of
that Name. The Tradition is, <hi>Sex millia
annorum erit mundus: &amp; uno millenario
vastatio,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sabbathum Dei: Duo millia
inane: Duo millia Lex: Duo millia dies
Messioe. Two thousand years vacuity: Two
thousand years of the Law: Two thousand
years the days of the Messiah.</hi> But they
shoot far wide: For according to the least
account, there passed a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of years before the Law was given,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96662:192"/>
2513. saith <hi>Reuterus,</hi> and on the contrary
less time from the Law to the Exhibition
of the Messiah. All these Proofs laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
do scarce suffice to make up a
probability. Neither do those Rabbinical
Collections from the six Letters in <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
the first word of <hi>Genesis,</hi> or from the six
<hi>Alephs</hi> in the first Verse of that Book,
each signifying a thousand years; or from
the six first Patriarchs in the order of
the Genealogy to <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was caught
up to Heaven, and found no more, add
much weight to this Opinion. S. <hi>Austin</hi>
very modestly concludes, after a Discussion
of this Point concerning the Worlds dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Ego tempora dinumerare non audeo:
nec aliquem Prophetam de hac re numerum
annorum existimo praefinivisse. Nos ergo
quod scire nos Dominus noluit libentèr nesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus.
I dare not calculate &amp; determine
times: neither do I think that concerning
this matter, any Prophet hath predicted and
defined the number of years. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord would not have us to know, let
us willingly be ignorant of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though none but presumptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have undertaken peremptorily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
that time, yet was it the common
and received Opinion and Perswasion of
the Ancient Christians, that that day was
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96662:192"/>
not far off? and had they been to limit it,
they would hardly have been induced to
set the term so forward, and remote from
their own Age, as by experience we find it
proves to be, but in their own times, or
shortly after; and many places of Scripture
seem to favour that Opinion, so that some
have presumed to say, that the Apostles
themselves were at first mistaken in this
particular, till after further illumination
they were better informed. But though
this be too bold a Conceit, yet that the
Churches, at least some of them, did at
first mistake the Apostles meaning in their
Sermons and Epistles concerning this Point,
and so understand them, as to think that
the End of the World and final Judgment
was at hand, appears from 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 2.
I beseech you, Brethren, that ye be not soon
shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter, as
from us, as that the day of Christ is at
hand.</hi> We see the Apostle labours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
and for the future to prevent this
Mistake: so likewise the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in
the 8th and 9th Verses of this Chapter.
And yet this Opinion had taken such deep
root in them, that it was not easie to be
extirpated; but continued for some Ages in
the Church. Indeed there are so many
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96662:193"/>
places in the New Testament which speak
of the Coming of Christ as very near, that
if we should have lived in their time, and
understood them all as they did, of his
Coming to Judge the World, we could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have avoided being of the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But if we apply them (as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
doth) to his Coming to take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on his Enemies, then they do not
hinder, but that the Day of Judgment, I
mean the General Judgment, may be far
enough off. So I leave this Question un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved,
concluding that when that Day
will come God only knows.</p>

               <head type="sub">How far this Conflagration shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</head>
               <p>6. A Sixth Question is, How far shall
this Conflagration extend? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Ethereal Heavens, and all the
Host of them, Sun, Moon and Stars, or to
the Aereal only?</p>
               <p>I Answer, If we follow Ancient Tradition
not only the Earth, but also the Heavens
and heavenly Bodies will be involved in one
common Fate, as appears by those Verses
quoted out of <hi>Lucretius, Ovid, Lucan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Christians some exempt the Ethereal
Region from this Destruction: for the two
following Reasons, which I shall set down in</hi>
Reuterus<hi>'s words. 1. Because in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conflagration is compared to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
in the time of</hi> Noah. <hi>But the Deluge
extended not to the upper Regions of the
Air, much less to the Heavens, the Waters
arising only fifteen Cubits above the tops of
the Mountains, if so much. Therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96662:194"/>
shall the Conflagration transcend that
term. So</hi> Beza <hi>upon</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 6. Tantum
ascendet ille ignis quantum aqua altior supra
omnes montes. That fire shall ascend as high
as the Waters stood above the Mountains.
<hi>This passage I do not find in the last Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Notes. The ordinary Gloss also
upon these words, 2 Thess. 1. 2.</hi> In flaming
fire rendring vengeance, <hi>saith</hi> Christum ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
praecedet ignis in mundo, qui tantum as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendet
quantum aqua in diluvio. There shall
a fire go before Christ when he comes, which
shall reach as high as did the Water in the
Deluge. <hi>And S.</hi> Augustine De Civit. Dei lib.
20. cap. 18. Petrus etiam commemorans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
ante diluvium, videtur admonuisse quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammodo,
quatenus in fine hujus seculi istum
mundum periturum esse credamus. <hi>Peter</hi> also
mentioning the Ancient Deluge, seems in a
manner to have advised us how far at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of time, we are to believe this World
shall perish.</p>
               <p>But this Argument is of no force, because
it is not the Apostle's design in that place to
describe the limits of the Conflagration, but
only against Scoffers, to shew, that the
World should one day perish by fire, as it
had of old been destroyed by Water.</p>
               <p>2. The second Reason is, Because the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies are not subject to Passion, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96662:194"/>
or corruption. They can contract
no filth, and so need no expurgation by fire.</p>
               <p>To this we answer, not in the words of
<hi>Reuter,</hi> but our own, That it is an idle and
ill grounded conceit of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi>
That the Heavenly Bodies are of their own
nature incorruptible and unalterable: for on
the contrary it is demonstrable, that many
of them are of the same nature with the
Earth we live upon, and the most pure, as
the Sun, and probably too the fixt Stars,
suffer Alterations; <hi>maculoe</hi> or opaque Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
being commonly generated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in them. And <hi>Comets</hi> frequently,
and sometimes <hi>New Stars</hi> appear in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial
Regions. So that these Arguments
are insufficient to exempt the Heavens from
Dissolution; and on the other side many
places there are in Scripture which seem to
subject them thereto: As <hi>Psal. 102. 25, 26.</hi>
recited <hi>Hebr. 1. 10.</hi> which hath already
often been quoted, <hi>The Heavens are the
Works of thy Hands; They shall perish.</hi> Matth.
24. 35. <hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away.</hi>
Isa. 65. 17. &amp; 51. 6. <hi>The Heavens shall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
away like smoke.</hi> Yet am I not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the last Fire shall reach the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
They are too far distant from us to
suffer by it: nor indeed doth the Scripture
affirm it; but where it mentions the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96662:195"/>
of the Heavens, it expresseth it by such
Phrases as seem rather to intimate, that it shall
come to pass by a consenescency and decay,
than be effected by any sudden and violent
means. <hi>Psal. 102. 25, 26. They all shall
wax old as doth a Garment,</hi> &amp;c. Though I
confess nothing of Certainty can be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from such Expressions; for we find the
same used concerning the Earth; <hi>Isa. 51. 6.
The Heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and
the Earth shall wax old as doth a garment.</hi>
The heavenly Bodies are none of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
and eternal; but may in like
manner as the Earth be consumed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
at what times and by what means,
whether Fire or some other Element, the
Almighty hath decreed, and ordered.</p>

               <p>THere remains now only the Seventh
Question to be resolved, Whether shall
the World be wholly consumed, burnt up
and destroyed, or annihilated; or only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,

That the latter part seems to me more
probable, <hi>viz.</hi> That it shall not be destroyed

I know what potent Adversaries I have
in this case. I need name no more than

                  </gap>lation. But yet upon the whole
matter, the Renovation or Restitution seems
to me most probable, as being most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity.</hi> The
Scripture speaks of an <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or Regeneration of the World, the
very word the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> use
in this case, Mat. 19. 28, 29. <hi>Verily, I say
unto you, That ye which have followed me,
in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall
sit on the Throne of his glory, ye also shall sit
upon twelve Thrones,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 102. 26. <hi>As
a vesture shalt thou change them, and they
shall be changed.</hi> Which words are again
taken up and repeated, <hi>Heb. 1. 12.</hi> Now it
is one thing to be changed, another to be
annihilated and destroyed. <hi>1 Cor. 7. 31. <gap reason="foreign">

The fashion
of this world passeth away.</hi> As if he had
said, It shall be transfigured, or its outward
form changed, not its matter or substance
destroyed. Isa. 65. 17. <hi>Behold I create new
Heavens and a new Earth, and the former
shall not be remembred, nor come into mind.</hi>
Isa. 66. 22. As <hi>the new Heavens and new
Earth, which I shall make, shall remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me.</hi> To which places the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
seems to refer in those words, 2 Pet. 3. 13.
<hi>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look
for new Heavens, and a new Earth,</hi> wherein
dwelleth righteousness. This new Heaven
and new Earth we have also mentioned, <hi>Rev.
12. 1. And I saw a new Heaven and a new
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96662:196"/>
Earth: for the first Heaven and the first
Earth were passed away, and there was no more
Sea.</hi> These places, I confess, may admit of
an Answer or Solution by those who are of
a contrary Opinion, and are answered by
Doctor <hi>Hakewil:</hi> yet all together, especially
being back'd by ancient Tradition, amount
to a high degree of probability. I omit that
place, <hi>Rom. 8. 21, 22. The creature itself
also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons
of God:</hi> tho' it be accounted the strongest
proof of our Opinion, because of the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and ambiguity thereof.</p>
               <p>2. For Antiquity, I have already given
many Testimonies of the ancient Fathers
and Doctors of the Church, and could, if
need were, produce many more, the whole
stream of them running this way. And tho'
Dr. <hi>Hakewill</hi> saith, That if we look back to

to the Resurrection which
makes the Great Year, wherein there is again
a restitution made from it self alone to it
self. For returning according to the order
wherein it began first to frame and dispose
things, (as reason would) it again observes
the same Oeconomy or Administration; the

He that desires more Authorities of the
Heathen Philosophers and Poets in consir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the World's Restitution after the
Conflagration, may consult the same Mr.
<hi>Burnet</hi> in the place forequoted; where he
also shews, that this Doctrine of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
Periods was received by the <hi>Grecians</hi>
from the Nations they call barbarous. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
saith <hi>Porphyry,</hi> brought it first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Greece:</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> witnesseth of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Wise Men that it was delivered by
them. <hi>Laertius</hi> out of <hi>Theopompus</hi> relates,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96662:198"/>
That the <hi>Persian Magi</hi> had the same Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
and <hi>Berosus</hi> saith, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
also. In fine, among all the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who had among them any Person or
Sect, and Order of Men, noted for Wisdom
or Philosophy, this Tradition was current.
The Reader may consult the Book we refer
to, where is a notable passage taken out of
<hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Tractate, <hi>Di Iside &amp; Osiride,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a War between <hi>Oromazes,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manius,</hi>
somewhat parallel to that mentioned
in the Revelation between <hi>Michael</hi> and the
<hi>Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Restitution of the World seems
more consonant to Reason than its Abolition.
For if the World were to be annihilated, what
needed a Conflagration? Fire doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
or bring things to nothing, but only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
their parts. The World cannot be
abolished by it, and therefore had better been
annihilated without it. Wherefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
mentioning no other Dissolution than
is to be effected by the Instrumentality of
Fire, its clear, we are not to understand any
utter Abolition or Annihilation of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but only a Mutation and Renovation, by those
phrases of <hi>perishing, passing away, dissolving,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing no more,</hi> &amp;c. They are to be no more
in that state and condition they are now in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:96662:198"/>2. There must be a material Heaven, and
a material Hell left. A place for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Bodies of the Blessed to inhabit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
in; and a place for the Bodies of the
Damned, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Prison for them to
be shut up in. Now if the place of the Blessed
be an Empyreal Heaven far above these
visible Heavens, as Divines generally hold;
and the place of the Damned be beneath,
about the middle of the Earth; as is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the School-men, and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as the name <hi>Inferi</hi> imports,
and as the ancient Heathen described their

Then when all the intermediate Bodies shall
be annihilated, what a strange Universe shall
we have? Consisting of an immense Ring of
Matter, having in the middle a vast vacuity,
or space void of all Body, save only one
small point for an infernal Dungeon. Those
that are of this Opinion have too narrow
and mean thoughts of the Greatness, I had
almost said Immensity of the Universe, the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96662:199"/>
glorious and magnisick Products of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
Almighty Power: and are too partial to
themselves, to think the whole World was
created for no other end but to be serviceable
to Mankind: But of this I have said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in a former Discourse, and therefore
shall not at present enlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>But let us hear what they have to say for
the <hi>Abolition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their first and most weighty Argument is
taken from the <hi>End of the World's Creation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hakewil's Apol. l. 4. c. 13. sect. 5.</note>
which was partly and chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly the Glory of
the <hi>Creater,</hi> and partly the use of Man, the
Lord Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, as it were, or <hi>Viceroy</hi> thereof.
Now for the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> it being by
the admirable Frame of the World manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto Man, Man being removed out of the
World, and no Creature being capable of
such a Manifestation besides him, we cannot
imagine to what purpose the Frame itself
should be left, and restored to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Estate. The other <hi>End,</hi> being for <hi>Man's
Vse,</hi> either to supply his Necessity in matter
of Diet, of Physick, of Building, of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel;
or for his Instruction, Direction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
Comfort and Delight; or lastly,
that therein, as in a Looking-glass he might
contemplate the Wisdom, the Goodness and
Power of God: when he shall attain that
blessed Estate, as he shall have no further
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96662:199"/>
use of any of these, enjoying perfect Happiness
and seeing God as he is, face to face, the second
or subordinate End of the World's Being must
needs be likewise frustrate. And what other
End can be given or conceived for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
or restoring thereof? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer, there may be an end of
the restoring of the World, tho' we are not
able to find out or determine what. We
are too short-sighted to penetrate the Ends
of God. There may be a new Race of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Animals brought forth to act their parts
upon this Stage, which may give the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
as much Glory as Man ever did or could.
And yet if there should be no material and
visible rational Creature made to inhabit the
Earth, there are spiritual and intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which may be as busie, and as much
delighted in searching out, and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Works of God in this new Earth,
and rendring him the Praise of his Wisdom
and Power as Man could be. These things
we may conjecture; but we must leave it
to the only wise God to determine what use
shall be made of it. It seems to me to be too
great presumption, and over-valuing our
selves to think that all this World was so
made for us, as to have no other end of its
Creation; or that God could not be glorified
but by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:96662:200"/>This first and principal Argument being
answered, the second admits of an easie So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
They enquire whether the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and Creatures endued with Sense shall
all be restored, or some only? namely such
as shall be found in being at the Day of
Judgment. If all, where shall we find
Stowage for them? Surely we may in this
case properly apply that which the Evangelist
in another useth figuratively, if they should
all be restored, even the World itself could
not contain the things which should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.
If some only, then would I gladly
know, why those some should be vouchsafed
this great Honour, and not all, or how those
Creatures without a Miracle shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
from propagating and multiplying,
and that infinitely in their kinds by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Generation. Or lastly, How the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Individuals of these kinds, shall contrary
to their primitive Natures, live and dure
immortally?</p>
               <p>To all this I answer, That not only all
Animals, but all Vegetables too, yea, and
their Seeds also, will doubtless be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and destroyed by the violence of the
Conflagration; but that the same should
be restored, and endued with eternal life, I
know no reason we have to believe; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that there should be new ones produced,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96662:200"/>
either of the same with the former, or of
different kinds, at the will, and by the power
of the Almighty Creator, and for those Ends
and Uses for which he shall design them.
This Question being answered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
all that follows concerning the Earth
remaining without any Furniture or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> falls to the Ground. So I have
dispatch'd these Seven Questions concerning
the Dissolution of the World, there remains
now only the Inference or Use of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Doctrine.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Apostle's Inference from the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Doctrine.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the <hi>Inference</hi> the Apostle
makes from the precedent Doctrine, <hi>What
manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
conversation and godliness?</hi> One word here
needs a little explication, and that is <hi>holy;</hi>
What is meant by a <hi>holy</hi> conversation.</p>
               <p>Holiness is an Equivocal Term. It is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
either to God, or to the Creature.
When it is attributed to God, it signifies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. The unspotted Purity of his Nature,
and the constant and immutable rectitude
of his Will. So it is taken,</hi> 1 Iohn 3. 3. And
every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
himself as he is pure: <hi>and 1 Pet. 1. 15.</hi> As
he which called you is holy, so be ye holy in
all manner of conversation: Because it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
be ye holy for I am holy. <hi>Psal. 145. 17.</hi>
The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy
in all his works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:96662:201"/>
2. His Sovereign Majesty and Greatness,
appearing in his transcendent Wisdom and
Power, in his Supreme and Absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over all things: in respect whereof, he
is called the <hi>Holy One of Israel,</hi> and his <hi>Name</hi>
is said to be <hi>Holy:</hi> that is, to be invoked
with the greatest reverence. <hi>Holy and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
is his Name.</hi> Because of this his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Excellency he is to be worshipped
and adored with the most submissive humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and veneration, with a transcendent and
incommunicable Worship and Devotion.</p>
               <p>When Holiness is attributed to Creatures,
it signifies either an Inherent and Inward, or
a Relative or Outward, Holiness.</p>
               <p>1. Inherent or Inward Holiness is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Heart and Life to the Will of
God: or as<note n="*" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s Vnivers. Charact.</note> others define it, An habitual
Frame of Mind: whereby we are fitted
for Vertuous Actions, but more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the Duties of Religion: Indeed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
doth always include a reference to
God.</p>
               <p>2. Relative or Outward Holiness results
from a Separation and setting a-part any
thing from a prophane and common, and
applying it to a Sacred or Religious Use. For
the Majesty of God, who at first created, and
continually sustains and governs all things,
being so great and inviolable, all Persons,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96662:202"/>
Things, and Times, and Places, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
separated and appropriated to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Worship, are by all Nations esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sacred, and to have a Character of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imprinted on them.</p>
               <p>By Holiness in this place, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
an <hi>inherent</hi> Holiness, which is well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by Dr. <hi>Outram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Sacris. l. 1. <hi>c. 1.</hi>
                  </note> a Conformity of Heart
and Life to the Will of God. I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
at large concerning a holy Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor instance particulars wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.
That would be to write a Body of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Divinity: I shall therefore at present
suppose the Reader sufficiently instructed in
that. My business shall be to shew the
strength of the Apostle's Inference.</p>
               <p>It may be said, How doth this Dissolution
concern us, who may perchance be dead and
rotten a thousand Years before it comes?
What have we to do with it?</p>
               <p>I answer, It concerns us, 1. Because it's
possible it may happen in our times; it may
surprize us before we are aware. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
time thereof is uncertain. And it shall
be sudden and unexpected, coming as a
Thief in the Night, as we have before
shewn; therefore we ought always to be
upon our guard, <hi>to have our loyns girt about
and our lights burning.</hi> This use the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in many places makes of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96662:202"/>
of the time of Christ's coming, <hi>Luke
12. 40. Be ye therefore ready: for the Son of
Man cometh at an hour when ye think not,</hi>
Luke 21. 34, 35. <hi>And take heed to your selves,
lest at any time your hearts be over-charged
with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of
this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
For as a snare shall it come on all them that
dwell on the whole earth.</hi> Parallel whereto
are <hi>Matth. 24. 42.</hi> and <hi>Mark 13. 33, 35.</hi>
That it shall come is certain, when it shall
come is uncertain, and it every day draws
nearer and nearer, therefore it is not wisdom
to remove the evil day far from us: and as
in reference to the day of Death, it is an
usual and prudent advice, so to live every
day, as if it were our last day; or at least,
as we would not be afraid to do should it be
so: because we are sure, that one day will
be our last, and for ought we know, the
present may be it: so likewise it is rational
Counsel in respect of the End of the World,
so to prepare our selves for it by a holy
Conversation, that we may get above the
terror and dread which will otherwise attend
the apprehension of the approach of it: and
that we may be provided against the worst
that may follow; and be secure come what
can come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:96662:203"/>
Secondly, <hi>It concerns us, should it be a
thousand Years to come. Because then is the
general Resurrection both of the just and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,</hi>
Acts 24. 15. <hi>and the general Judgment,</hi>
When we must all appear before the dreadful
tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive
the things done in his body, according to that
he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
2. Cor. 5. 10. <hi>which,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. <hi>is called</hi> the
revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
Who will render to every man according to his
deeds, <hi>&amp;c. Upon this account, I say, it
concerns us much how we have our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As we hope to be acquitted at that
day, and to enter into those new Heavens,
in which dwells righteousness. Holiness is a
necessary condition and antecedent to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Necessary I say,</p>
               <p>1. By God's appointment, <hi>Heb. 12. 14.
Follow peace with all men, and holiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> Rom.
6. 22. <hi>Have your fruit unto holiness, and the
end eternal life.</hi> Psal. 50. ult. <hi>To him that
ordereth his conversation aright, will I shew
the salvation of God.</hi> Eternal Life is the Gift
of God. He is not obliged to bestow it
upon any Man. He may make what Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he pleases for the obtaining of it. No
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96662:203"/>
Man hath any Right to it: No Man can lay
any claim to it, but from this Donation, and
from the performance of these Conditions.
Rev. 22. 14. <hi>Blessed are they that do his
commandments, that they may have right to
the tree of life, and may enter in through the
gates into the city. For without are dogs and
whoremongers, and sorcerers,</hi> &amp;c. All the
Right they have depends upon God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
which is conditionate, and accrues to
them by the performance of the Condition,
which is the doing of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>2 Necessary, not only by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but in the very nature of the thing.
Holiness is the very quality and complexion
of Heaven. No Man without it is qualified
to be a subject of that Kingdom: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
nothing that is impure or unclean can
enter. Revel. 21. 27. <hi>And there shall in no
wise enter into it</hi> [the New Jerusalem] <hi>any
thing that defileth, neither whatsoever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
abomination.</hi> In this <hi>new Heaven dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
righteousness.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 15. Therefore
1 John 3. 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope
in him, purifieth himself as he is pure.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would naturally spue out and eject a
wicked Person, as one heterogeneous to it.
Heaven and Hell are not more distant in
Place, than they are in Nature. There is
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96662:204"/>
not more antipathy between fire and water,
between light and darkness, between streight
and crooked, neither are they more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible,
or do more naturally resist and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
one another, than holiness which is the
quality of Heaven, and wickedness which is
the disposition and temper of Hell. Some
do think Heaven to be rather a state, than a
place; and that he that is partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature hath Heaven within him. This
is true, but this is not all. The whole Notion
of Heaven comprehends both a state and a
place. A Man must be in a heavenly state,
before the local Heaven can receive him, or
he brook it. Heaven without him would
be no Heaven to the Man who hath not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
within him. A wicked Person could
find no business or employment in Heaven;
nothing to satisfie his corrupt and depraved
affections, inclinations, and appetites. He
would there meet with no suitable company;
no persons whose conversation he could take
any delight and complacency in, but rather
hate and abhor. <hi>For what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? or what
communion hath light with darkness?</hi> 2 Cor.
6. 14. Like naturally loves like, and unites
with it, and doth refuse, resist, and hate
that which is unlike it. For every thing is
made to love itself; and consequently what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96662:204"/>
resembles and comes near it, and is
as it were a replication of it; and to hate
the contrary. As therefore we would be
glad to be Partakers of the blessedness of the
local Heaven, so let us endeavour to get into
our Minds and Spirits the qualities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Heaven; that so we may be fit
Subjects for that Kingdom, sit Companions
for that Society. <hi>This is the time allotted
us to purifie our selves from all filthiness both
of flesh and spirit, and to perfect holiness in
the fear of God.</hi> There is no invention in
the Grave whither we are going, <hi>Eccles. 9. 10.
Vpon this moment depends eternity. As the
tree falls so it it lies,</hi> Eccles. And as Death
leaves, so will Judgment find us. <hi>Quando
isthinc excessum fuerit, nullus jam locus poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae
est. Hîc vita aut amittitur, aut tenetur:
Hîc saluti aeternae cultu Dei &amp; fructu fidei
providetur.</hi> Cyprian Serm. de Immortal. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we shall depart hence there remains no more
place for repentance. Eternal life is here,
either lost or won. Here provision is made
for everlasting salvation by the worship of
God, and fruit of faith. We must work while
it is day, the night</hi> [of death] <hi>cometh wherein
no man can work,</hi> John 9. 4. And therefore
the time our Bodies shall rest in the Grave,
should it be a thousand Years, will little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
us: for if the Soul be mean while awake,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96662:205"/>
the certain and dreadful expectation of the
Sentence of Condemnation to an eternal
Hell at the Day of Judgment, will be little
less afflictive than the Torments thereof
themselves. I might add by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
that Sin and Wickedness is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
productive of Hell in the Soul. A
wicked Man carries Hell in his Breast. Sin
necessarily infers Misery: It is contrary
to the nature of the Soul, and whatsoever is
so must needs be grievous. Diversion and
Non-Attention to his Condition, is the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Man's only Security: I have heard it
often from a<note n="*" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Witchcot.</hi>
                  </note> great Divine in his Sermons,
<hi>That there is but a Thought's distance between
a wicked Man and Hell.</hi> For do but fix and
bind his Thoughts to the Consideration of his
Life and Actions, and he will anticipate Hell
himself, he shall need no infernal Furies to lash
him, he will be his own Tormentor: Such
a Man's Pressures will be heavy enough,
should the Divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> superadd no more.
The Reason of this I have given in a former
Discourse, and therefore shall now omit
what else might have been added on this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, It much concerns us, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the future Judgment which shall be
at the Dissolution of the World, to have our
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96662:205"/>
Conversation in all Holiness, as we desire to
avoid that Shame and Misery which will
then otherwise certainly befal us.</p>
               <p>1. As we desire to avoid that Shame
which will cover our Faces at that day. If
here Shame and Disgrace be more grievous
and insupportable than Death itself, what
will it be then, when the Soul shall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more quick and apprehensive and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of such Impressions? There is nothing
shameful but sin, nothing else hath any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Turpitude in it. Shame follows Sin as
the Shadow doth the Body: He that will
commit the one cannot avoid the other.
Therefore such wicked Persons as have not
quite renounced Modesty, and lost all Sence
of Shame, especially if guilty of secret Crimes,
the Consideration of a future Judgment
would be a powerful Curb to restrain them
from Sin for the future: because then <hi>God
will</hi> produce and <hi>bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and disclose and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the counsels of all hearts.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5.
Then <hi>he will judge the secrets of men by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. <hi>Then will he bring
every work into judgment, with every secret
thing,</hi> Eccles. 12. 14. For would they but
consider and ponder what Confusion will
overwhelm them when this shall be done in
the face of the whole World, and before all
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96662:206"/>
that knew them, and they not able to make
any denial, or excuse. This, I say, if any
thing, would be a powerful Curb to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them from those Enormities to which
this shame is appendant. It may be thou
madest a great Figure in the World for Piety
and Religion, wouldst seem to be Some-body
in the Eyes of Men, when thou wert false
and unsound, didst harbour and nourish some
Viper in thy Bosom,
<q>Introrsum turpis, speciosa pelle decorus:</q>
When thy secret Faults shall be exposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Neighbours, and Friends, and
Children, <hi>And the shame of thy nakedness
shall be made to appear,</hi> Revel. 3. 18. How
wilt thou then be confounded and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and unable to list up thy Head? What
horrour will then seize thee, <hi>When thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
shall be continually before thee, and the
shame of thy face shall cover thee?</hi> Psalm
44. 15. It concerns thee therefore to look
about thee in time, and search thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Bottom to remove whatever
grates, to cast out whatever offends, though
never so customary, never so pleasing to
Flesh and Blood: to apply thy self to the
Merits and Satisfaction of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> for
the Expiation of what is past; and for the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96662:206"/>
future to resolve and endeavour the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whatsoever hath heretofore been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
in thee; and to beg the assistance of the
Divine Grace to strengthen in thee every
good purpose and resolution of heart, and
to enable thee to bring it to issue and effect.
And for thy security, I think it good Advice,
to resolve so to behave thy self in thy Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
so to live in the secret of thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Closet, as though the Doors were
thrown open upon thee, and all the Eyes of
the World beheld thee; as though thou
were't in the <hi>Arena</hi> of a Publick Theatre,
exposed to the view of Men and Angels. I
remember the ingenious Writer of Politick
Discourses, <hi>Boccalini,</hi> doth often divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his Reader, with facetious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the contrivance of a Window into
the Breast; which, if I mistake not, be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon <hi>Lipsius.</hi> However he may deride
it, I think it would be prudent Counsel to
give and take, for every Christian. So to
live and carry it in the secret of his Heart, as
if there were a Window into his Breast, that
every one that passed by, might look in
thereat, and see all the thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that passed there, that found any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
or acceptance with him. For
though indeed <hi>God searches the hearts and
reins, and understandeth our thoughts afar off,</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:96662:207"/>
Psal. 139. 2. Yet such is the hypocrisie of
Mankind, that they do for the most part
more reverence the Eyes of Men, than of
God: and will venture to do that in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which they would be ashamed the Eyes
of Man should see them doing. You will
say, Is it not better to be modest, than to be
impudent? Is it not better to conceal, than
to publish ones shame? Is it not better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
Man, than neither God nor Man?
Doth not the Scripture condemn a Whore's
Fore-head? Is it not a true Proverb, <hi>Past
Shame, Past Grace?</hi> Was it not good Advice
of a Cardinal (as I remember) <hi>Si nou castè,
tamen cautè?</hi> He that hath devoured shame,
what Bridle is there left to restrain him from
the worst of evils? I answer, That it seems
indeed to me, that publick sins of the same
nature, are more heinous than s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cret; and
that impudence in sinning, is an aggravation
of sin. For open sins dare God, and bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to Heaven, and leave the Sinner unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable,
and are of more pernicious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I do not now speak of the hypocrisie
of seigning holiness to serve our own ends,
which is rightly esteemed <hi>duplex iniquitas,</hi>
but that of concealing and hiding vicious
actions, to avoid the shame of Men. And
yet there is a great obliquity in this too. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
even this is a slighting and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96662:207"/>
of God, a preferring of Man before him,
setting a greater price and esteem upon the
praise and commendation of Men, than the
praise and approbation of God, <hi>Iohn 12. 43.</hi>
God sees the secretest Actions, yea, the most
retired thoughts. They that believe this,
and yet make bold to do in his presence,
what the fear of Man's Eye would restrain
them from, it is clear that they reverence
Man more than God, a poor frail, impotent
Creature like themselves, more than the
most pure and ever blessed Creator. Nay,
let the Temptation to any sin be never so
strong, and the natural inclination never so
vehement, if the knowledge and conscience
of Men be a motive and consideration pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
enough to enable us to resist and repel
them, had we but as firm a belief of the
presence and inspection of God, and as great
a reverence and dread of him, Why should
not these have the same influence and effect
upon us? Let us then avoid the hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>risie
of desiring to be thought better than we are,
by endeavouring to our utmost to be as good
as we would be thought to be, and if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
better. So shall we satisfie our selves that
we seek the praise of God, more than the
praise of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:96662:208"/>
Here before I proceed, I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Wisdom and Goodness of Almighty
God, in implanting such a Passion in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man as Shame, to no other use or
purpose, that I can imagine, than to restrain
him from vicious and shameful Actions. A
Passion I call it, because the Body, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Passions, suffers from it, and that in a
peculiar manner; it causing a sudden moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood to the outward parts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Face, which is called blushing;
and a dejection of the Eyes. If you ask me
what Shame is, I answer, It is an ungrateful
and afflictive sence of Soul proceeding from
Dishonour. Now Dishonour is nothing else
but Mens ill Opinion of me, or dislike and
condemnation of my Actions, some way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and manifested to me; which why I
should have such an abhorrence of, and why
it should be so grievous and tormenting to
me, there seems not to be a sufficient ground
and foundation in the nature of the thing,
supposing such as have this Opinion, have
neither power nor will to hurt my Body:
but only in the Ordination of God, who hath
so made our Natures, to secure our Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and with hold us from the commission of
what is disgraceful and ignominious, as all
sinful Actions, and none else are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:96662:208"/>
And as for secret sins, I think shame may
take place there too. It was a precept of the
<hi>Pythagoreans, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
Of all Men reverence your self most:</hi> be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to do that before your self, which before
others you would abhor or blush to do; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
you must suffer dishonour from your
self, and condemn your own Actions, which
will in all reason be more grievous and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
than the ill Opinion and Word of other
Men. Hence Conscience of sin is esteemed a
most painful and tormenting thing, by the
generality of all Mankind, tho no other Man
be privy to it.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence we digressed,
though<note n="*" place="margin">Daniel 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>shame and everlasting contempt</hi> shall
at the general Resurrection be the portion of
them who persist and die in their sins, yet
a serious and unfeigned Repentance, attested
by a holy Conversation for the future, is an
effectual means to deliver us from this shame,
whatever our forepast sins have been. For
they shall not be produced against us, they
shall not be objected to us at that day; they
shall be buried in eternal silence and oblivion,
and be as tho' they had not been. And this
Opinion I hold, 1. More agreeable to the
Scripture, which in this matter makes use
of the Terms of hiding, and covering, and
blotting out, and forgetting, <hi>Psalm 32. 1.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96662:209"/>
Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and whose sin is covered,</hi> Esay 43. 25.
<hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and will not remember thy sins.</hi> So
Psalm 51. 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my sins, and
blot out all mine iniquities.</hi> Jerem. 48. 34.
<hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember
their sin no more.</hi> Ezek. 28. 22. <hi>All his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
that he hath committed, they shall not
he mentioned unto him,</hi> Mich. 7. 19. <hi>Thou
wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the
Sea.</hi> And as it is more consonant to the
Scripture, so is it, 2. More grateful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory
to the Penitents. For the mere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
and reciting of their sins before such
an Assembly, must needs refresh their shame
and sorrow, and so diminish their happiness
and joy. To which I might add, that it is
written, our Saviour at the last Judgment, in
pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uncing the Sentence, shall enumerate
the Good Works of the Godly to their praise;
but not a word said of producing their sins.
I say, I hold this Opinion more probable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these accounts, than theirs who affirm they
shall then be published, for the magnifying
and advancing, the declaring and illustrating
the Mercy and Grace of God, in pardoning
so great and heinous Offences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:96662:209"/>
And truly, I do not know, but that the
sins of the Blessed may be blotted out, even
of their own Memories. Some Philosophers
who were of Opinion, that Souls prae-exist
before their Bodies, thought they were dipt
in <hi>Lethe,</hi> which is a Fountain causing Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
by means whereof they forgat what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they had done before. This I look upon
as a dream, or Fancy: but truly I am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sometimes to imagine, that the Soul of
Man can hardly be entirely happy, unless it
be as it were thus dipt in <hi>Lethe:</hi> for every
sinful Action having a natural Turpitude in
it, and being dishonourable, how can the
Memory and thought of it, but beget such
an ungrateful Passion as Shame, even to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?
And what do Divines mean by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the action [of sinning] suddenly
passes away, but the stain and blot of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;
but that a vicious action, even by
them to whom it is pardoned, can never be
thought of without grief and disturbance, it
leaves an indelible scar in the Soul, which
can never be perfectly healed and oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>2. It concerns us much to live in all holy
Conversation in this World, as we desire to
avoid that Pain and Misery, which we shall
otherwise most certainly be adjudged to at
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:96662:210"/>
that day: that <hi>indignation and wrath, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and anguish,</hi> which God shall render to
them <hi>that do not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,</hi>
Rom. 2. 8. That <hi>worm that
dieth not,</hi> and that <hi>fire that is not quenched,</hi>
Mark 9. 44. and 46, and 48. That <hi>outer
darkness, where is weeping and wailing, and
gnashing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 8. 12. and 22. 13.
and 25, 30, That <hi>furnace of fire,</hi> Matth. 13.
42. 50. That <hi>lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.
20. 10. or of <hi>fire burning with brimstone,</hi>
Revel. 19. 20. Which places, tho' they be
not literally to be expounded, yet do they
import at least a very sad and deplorable
Estate, a high degree of torment and anguish:
and all this eternal and without intermission
night and day. <hi>These shall go into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
punishment,</hi> Mat. 25. 46. The state of the
Damned is supposed to be a state of absolute
and complete Misery, made up of the loss of
the greatest Good, and a constant, fresh, and
lively apprehension of it: which Divines call
<hi>Poena Damni.</hi> And, 2. Excess of bodily pain
and sufferings, and sad distress and Trouble of
Mind, occasioned by all manner of frightful
Apprehensious, and vexatious Perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Reflections, which they call <hi>Poena
Sensus;</hi> and this without any intermission
or hope of deliverance eternally. <hi>Iude 7.</hi>
it is called the <hi>vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:96662:210"/>
14. 11. <hi>The smoke of their torment</hi> is said
<hi>to ascend up for ever and ever.</hi> And <hi>Revel.
20. 10.</hi> it is said of the Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that <hi>they shall be tormented night and
day for ever and ever.</hi> If this be so, is't
not our greatest Wisdom to use our utmost
diligence and endeavour to avoid so deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Condition, and to secure to our selves
an interest in a future estate of everlasting
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Happiness when this Life shall be
ended?</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and sensual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
will be ready to object and argue, Here
are Pleasures and Delights in this World,
which are very inviting and taking, and do
highly gratifie my Senses and Appetites. I
hear likewise of future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for those that deny or fulfil their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Lusts and Desires. These sensual Pleasures
I see and taste, and feel, and am sure of, the
other I do but only hear of, and therefore
they do not, they cannot so strongly affect
me: Were Heaven and the Happiness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
set before my eyes, and did I see it as plainly
and clearly as I do these things below, then
indeed I should not need many motives to
provoke me to endeavour the obtaining of it.
But alas, that is far above, out of our sight,
the Joys of Heaven are by the Apostle termed
things not seen. Again, these outward, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96662:211"/>
temporal enjoyments are present and easily
obtainable; the other at a great distance,
future, and besides, very hard to come by;
and I love my ease, <hi>Vt est ingenium hominum
à labore proclive ad libidinem.</hi> Should I deny
my self Good in this Life, and then perchance
cease to be, and so have no Reward for my
pains; nay, on the contrary expose my self
to the hazard of many afflictions and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which are the portion of the Godly in
this Life, how unnecessarily shall I make
my self miserable? Miserable I say, because
by the Apostle's own confession Christians, <hi>If
in this life only they had hope, would be of all
men the most miserable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 19 Had
I not better make sure of what is before me?
Why have I these Appetites within me, and
such Objects about me, the one being so suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the other, is it not more natural and
reasonable to fulfil, than deny them? Surely
it cannot be Wisdom to lose a certain Good,
for an uncertain Hope; and for an unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fear of Hell hereafter, to undergo a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
here.</p>
               <p>To this Argumentation upon the false
Foundation of the uncertainty of a Future
Estate of endless Happiness or Misery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
as we have behaved our selves in this
Life, I answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:96662:211"/>
That for the futurity of such an estate,
we have the best Authority in the World, to
wit, the holy Scriptures, and universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>1. The Holy Scriptures, whose Authority
to be more than humane, hath been by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
so clearly and convincingly demonstrated,
that I shall take it for granted, and not waste
time to prove it. The Testimonies herein
contained concerning eternal Happiness and
Misery are so clear and full, that it seems to
me impossible without manifest distortion to
elude or evade the force of them. Some we
have already recited, and might produce
many more, Isa. 33. 14. <hi>Who among us shall
dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us
shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</hi> Dan.
12. 2. <hi>And many of them that sleep in the
dust of the earth shall awake, some to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life, and some to shame and everlasting
contempt.</hi> 2. Thess. 1. 9 <hi>Who shall be punished
with everlasting destruction from the presence
of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. speaking of them who
know not God, and obey not the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Isa. 66. 24. <hi>For their
worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
quenched.</hi>

                  </gap>ine of the
Eternity of the Punishments of the Damned,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96662:212"/>
make the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from which the Latin

time, as might (say they) easily
be proved by many examples, and so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we translate <hi>for ever,
signifies when applied to this matter,</hi> a long

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which we render <hi>for ever
and ever,</hi> may likewise signifie not an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
duration, but a time to which some term
may be set by God, though to us unknown.
In the same sense they accept the Adjective
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a long, but finite time. But I
am of S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Opinion, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
doth in the New Testament signifie the same
with <hi>aeternus</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> and is appropriated
to things that have no end: and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>for ever and ever,</hi> doth in
like manner always denote eternal or endless
duration. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the state of the Damned, doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<hi>eternal.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> well demonstrates
from the <hi>Antithesis</hi> in that place of <hi>Matth.
25. 46. And these shall go away into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
punishment, but the righteous into life
eternal.</hi> Where it is in the same sense attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to that Life which is the Reward of
the Righteous, and that Fire which is the
Punishment of the Damned; there being no
reason to believe that the same word in the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:96662:212"/>
same Verse, when applied to opposites,
should be taken in a different sense. But by
the confent of all Christians it is granted,
that the Life of the Blessed shall be eternal,
therefore so must the Punishment of the
Damned be too.</p>
               <p>This acception of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for
<hi>eternal</hi> or <hi>endless,</hi> when it refers to the state
of those miserable Persons, receives a further
and strong confirmation from the</p>
               <p>Second Particular we proposed, that is,
<hi>Vniversal Tradition:</hi> It being a received O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
among the Heathen, which must needs
descend down to them by Tradition from
the Ancients, that Eternal Punishments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited
the Wicked after Death.</p>
               <p>What more common Notion among the
<hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> than of an <hi>Elysium,</hi>
and <hi>Tartarus?</hi> the former to reward good
Men, the latter to punish wicked. And
those too esteemed to be Eternal States. Of
this the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and unexceptionable Witness: For
he makes the fear of these Punishments to
be the cause of all the Miseries of Humane
Life, and the Foundation of all Religion,</p>
               <q>Aeternas quoniam poenas in morte timen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:96662:213"/>
Now, that he could derive this from no
other source but Tradition, is clear; because
he lived a good while before our Saviour's
time, and the divulgation of the Scripture
among the Heathen. And because it may
be objected, that <hi>Aeternas</hi> may signifie
only of long continuance, to put the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of all doubt, in another place he
saith,
<q>
                     <l>—Nam si nullum finem esse putarent,</l>
                     <l>Aerumnarum homines, nulla ratione vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</l>
                     <l>Relligionibus atque minis obsistere vatum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>—But if it once appear</l>
                     <l>That after Death there's neither Hope nor
Fear.</l>
                     <l>Then Men might freely triumph, then
disdain</l>
                     <l>The Poet's Tales, and scorn their fancy'd
Pain.</l>
                     <l>But now we must submit, since Pains we
fear</l>
                     <l>Eternal after Death, we know not where.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:96662:213"/>
And that this Opinion and Belief generally
prevailed among the People before <hi>Epicurus</hi>
his time, the same <hi>Lucretius</hi> testifies in the
beginning of his first Book,
<q>
                     <l>Humana ante oculos foedè cum vita jaceret</l>
                     <l>In terris oppressa gravi sub Relligione, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <l>Long time Men lay opprest with slavish

                     <l>Religion's Tyranny did domineer,</l>
                     <l>Which being plac'd in Heaven, look'd
proudly down,</l>
                     <l>And frighted abject Spirits at her frown</l>
                     <l>At last a Mighty One of <hi>Greece</hi> began</l>
                     <l>T'assert the Natural Liberty of Man,</l>
                     <l>By senceless Terrours, and vain Fancy

                  </q>
for he makes (as we saw before) the Fear of
Eternal Pain and Misery, to be the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:96662:214"/>
1. Now because these Objectors do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Religion to themselves and others as a
melancholick and disconsolate thing: and
think and say, that those that enter into this
state, must bid adieu to all the Pleasures of
Sence, and tast no sweetness in any worldly
Object. I shall endeavour to remove this
prejudice. I say therefore, That our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God doth not envy us any real Good
that the Creatures can afford us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath not denied us a moderate use and
fruition of any of them. And seeing he hath
annexed Pleasure to those Actions that are
necessary for the support of life, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of kind, as a bait to invite us to the
performance of them, it seems to me highly
absurd and contradictious to affirm, that he
hath forbidden us to partake or taste those
Enjoyments which himself has appointed as
effectual means for the security of those great
Ends; and which are so necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of those Actions, that we cannot but
partake them. Where the Appetite is eager,
God hath indulged, I might say, commanded
a moderate and regular satisfaction. And we
know, nay, the blindness of Atheism cannot
deny, that the greatest pleasure results from
a moderate and well circumstantiated use of
Pleasures. <hi>Voluptates commendat rarior usus.</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:96662:214"/>
Now a Religious Man enjoys all the Pleasures
of these worldly and sensible Goods, without
any of the pain, which is annexed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
and irregular use, or indeed abuse of
them: and besides, his Pleasure is enhansed,
in that he beholds and receives them as Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God, and Tokens of his Favour and
Affection; and is without all fear of a future
sad Reckoning for his participation of them.
Howbeit a denial of our selves for God's sake
and cause in any thing which we might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
lawfully enjoy, though it be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
yet is accepted, and shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by him.</p>
               <p>Others there are who grant, That these
words grammatically signifie as we contend,
and that Eternal Punishments are indeed
threatned to the wicked; but say they, these
Threatnings are intended only, as <hi>Terricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,</hi>
or Bug-bears to Children, to terrifie
and keep People in awe, and to preserve
the World in some tolerable condition of
quietness. And <hi>Origen</hi> himself, tho' he be of
opinion, that these Threatnings signifie only
temporary Pains; yet he saith, that such
Mysteries are to be sealed up and concealed
from the Vulgar, left wicked Men should
rush into sin with all fury and licentiousness,
if this Bridle were taken off, who by the
opinion and fear of eternal and endless Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96662:215"/>
can scarce be deterred and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, 1. That it seems to me
indecorous and unsuitable to the Person and
Majesty of God, to make use of such sorry
and weak means to bring about his ends, as
grave Men can hardly condescend to. 2. I
do not see how it can consist with his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in plain terms, absolutely to threaten and
affirm what he never intends to do.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is questionable, Whether it be
allowable in Man: it being a best but an
officious Lye: for it is a speaking what we
do not think, and that with an intention to
deceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed now to a second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the Eternity of the Pains and
Sufferings of the Damned, and that is, its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
with the Justice of God. What
proportion can there be between a transient
and temporary act, and an eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
The most rigid Justice can exact no
more than a <hi>Talio,</hi> to suffer as I have done.
<q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:96662:215"/>
If I have hurt, or grieved, or injured any
Man, to be punished with the same, or an
equivalent suffering: if I have taken any
unreasonable Pleasure, to compensate it with
an answerable Pain. Indeed the enormities
of my Life cannot well deserve so much, if
it be considered, that I have been strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated
and inclined, and as it were fatally
driven upon all the Evils which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
by those Affections and Appetites,
which I made not for my self, but found in
my self; and have been exposed to strong
and almost inexpugnable Temptations from
without; beset with Snares, encompassed
about with innumerable Evils.</p>
               <p>To this I answer First, That every sin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
or offence is aggravated and enhansed
by the dignity or merit of the Person against
whom it is committed. So Parricide is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
a greater Crime than ordinary Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by the Laws of all Nations avenged
with a sorer Punishment. The like may be
said of <hi>Laesa Majestas,</hi> or Treason. Now God
is an infinite Person, and Sin being an injury
and affront to him, as being a violation of
his Law, an infinite Punishment must be due
to it.</p>
               <p>This answer Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Practical
Catechism,</hi> lib. 5. sect. 4. accounts a Nicety,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96662:216"/>
and unsatisfactory, as also that other common
answer, That if we should live infinitely,
we would sin infinitely; and therefore gives
us another, which in his Discourse of the
Reasonableness of Christian Religion, he thus
briefly summs up.</p>
               <p>2. That the choice being referred to us to
take of the two which we best like, eternal
Death set before us on the one hand, to make
eternal Life the more infinitely reasonable for
us to chuse on the other hand, and the eternal
Hell (whensoever we fall into it) being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
our own Act, neither forced on us by any
absolute Decree of God, nor irresistible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of the Devil, or our own Flesh; but as
truly our wish and choice, and mad purchase;
nay, much more truly and properly, than <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Heaven</hi> is (when our Obedience is first
wrought by God's Grace, and yet after that so
abundantly rewarded by the <hi>Doner</hi>) it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
if there be any thing irrational, it is in
us unkind and perverse Creatures (so obstinate
to chuse what God so passionately warns us to
take heed of; so wilfully to die, when God
swears he wills not our death) and not in him,
who hath done all that is imaginable to be
done to reasonable Creatures (here in their
way or course) to the rescuing or saving of
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:96662:216"/>
But to this may be replied, If the thing
itself be unjust, how can our chusing of it
make it just? How can it be just to annex
such a Penalty as eternal Hell to a short and
transient offence? Suppose a Prince should
make a Law, that whosoever did not rise
up and bow himself before an Old Man,
should be put to Death with Torments; and
one of his Subjects knowingly should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
this Law upon some great temptation;
would it not be accounted Cruelty in the
Prince to execute this Law upon him? Laws
may be unjust upon account of disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Penalties. Neither doth our Choice
much help the Matter, for that is but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of our Error or Folly, or, if you will,
Madness, which doth as little deserve eternal
Death as the Sin committed doth.</p>
               <p>If any Man be dissatisfied with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Answers, all that I have to add further,
is, that before this Sentence adjudging to
eternal Death be pronounced against him, and
executed upon him, there shall be such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
made, as shall convince and satisfie
him of the Righteousness thereof. And this
the Apostle seems to intimate, <hi>Rom. 2. 5.</hi>
when he calls the Great Day of Doom, the
Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. Then shall be made appear
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:96662:217"/>
what now to our dim-sighted Reason is not
penetrable; how the Justice of God can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the Eternal Damnation of the
wicked.</p>
               <p>As for Man's being as it were fatally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to Evil by the strength of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the violence of unruly and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
Passions and Appetites: I answer, That
there are motives and considerations sufficient
to enable a Man to resist and repel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
and overcome the most alluring and
fascinating Temptations, the most urging and
importunate Appetites or Affections; such
are certain Shame and Disgrace, and that not
long to come, eternal Infamy and Dishonour;
present Death, strong fear and dread of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Death, or sad and intolerable Pains
or Calamities. Now the Divine Threatnings
are of the greatest and most formidable Evils
and Miseries that Humane Nature is capable
of suffering; and therefore were they but
firmly beheved and apprehended, they would
be of force sufficient to stir up in us such
strong Passions of Fear and Terror, as would
easily chase away all Temptations, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
all the Baits of Sensual Pleasure.</p>
               <p>3. There remains yet a third Objection
against an eternal Hell, and that is, that it is
inconsistent with the Divine Goodness. For
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:96662:217"/>
the Unbeliever will say, It's contrary to all the
Notions and <hi>Ideas</hi> I have of God, to conceive
him to be so angry and furious a Being. How
can it stand with Infinite Goodness to make
a Creature that he fore knew would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
miserable? We Men account it a piece
of goodness to pardon offences: And all Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
are intended either for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and amendment of the Offender, or
if it be unreclaimable to prevent the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
which he might otherwise do, or for
an Example to others to deter them from the
like Enormities: but I do not see for what
such end any Man can be eternally torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So that of such inflictions one may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
demand, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> What Good
comes of them? How then can they come
from God, who by all Mens confession is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Good?</p>
               <p>To which I answer: First, That God is
just as well as good. You will say, what is
Justice? It is an equal weighing of Actions,
and rendring to every one his Right or Due.
A setting streight again what was perverted
by the sins and extravagancies of Men.
Now that the breaking of order and equality
in the World, this usurping and encroaching
upon others Rights is a great Evil, and ought
to be rectified, some may take an Argument
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96662:218"/>
from the strong inclination and desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
Injuries, that is implanted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, and of all Creatures. You'll say,
all desire of Revenge is absolutely sinful and
unlawful. I answer, I am no Patron of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
I know the very Heathen by the Light
of Nature condemned it.
<q>
                     <l>—Infirmi est animi exigu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <l>Vltio—</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Revenge is the pleasure of a poor and weak
Spirit.</hi> Yet let us hear what they have to
say. 1. It is hard to affirm, that any innate
Appetite or Desire is in itself simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
and in all Circumstances whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unlawful, for this seems to reflect upon
the Author of Nature.</p>
               <p>To which may be answered, that a well
circumstantiated Desire of Revenge may not
be in itself unlawful, yet for the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of it, it may be, and is prohibited
by a positive Law. 2. Divine Persons have
prayed to God to avenge them, as <hi>David</hi> and
the Prophets. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, <hi>2. Tim.
4. 14.</hi> prays God, to <hi>reward Alexander the
Coppersmith according to his works.</hi> To which
may be answered, that those Expressions are
rather Predictions of what should befal their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:96662:218"/>
Enemies, than desires that they might. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
whereas it is said, <hi>Revel. 6. 9, 10.
That the souls of them under the altar that
were slain for the word of God, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which they held, cried with a loud voice,
saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost
thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them
that dwell on the earth:</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi>
saith, It signifies no more, than that their
Blood cries to God for Vengeance, as <hi>Abel</hi>'s
is said to do. 3. The Nature of Forgiveness
seems to imply the Lawfulness of some desire
of Revenge. For what is Forgiveness but
a parting with, and as renouncing the Right
I have to be avenged, and therefore before I
forgive I do retain at least some will to be
revenged. And I am not obliged by our
Saviour to forgive absolutely, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Repentance. <hi>Luke 17. 3, 4. If thy
brother sin against thee rebuke him, and if
he repent forgive him,</hi> &amp;c. And in the
Lord's Prayer one Petition is, <hi>Forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass
against us.</hi> But God forgives not without
Repentance. To which may be answered.
That before Repentance, I may retain a will
of punishing an Offender for his own Good
and Reformation, but with no respect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
what is past. And if his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96662:219"/>
prevents his Punishment, then I am to
forgive him, that is, cease to desire his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
But all allow Vengeance to be
just in God, whose Actions are not to be
scanned by our Measures.</p>
               <p>2. If it be just with God to propose to us
such a choice as Heaven upon condition of
our Obedience to his Law, or Hell in case of
Disobedience; as we see some wise Men
make no scruple to grant; then it cannot be
injustice in him to inflict the Punishments of
Hell upon them that make it their choice.
Nay, I cannot see how it can consist with
his Veracity not to do it; why then should
any Argument from his Goodness move us
to distrust his Veracity? To which I shall
add, That the very being of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
in the World is as great an Argument
against the Goodness of God, as the eternal
Punishment of it; Sith we must needs grant,
that God Almighty, Blessed for ever, could,
if he had pleased, have prevented it. If any
Man shall say, This was not possible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
changing the very Nature of Man,
and taking away the Liberty of his Will.
To him I reply, How then can he confirm
the Blessed, reserving their Liberty? Or
must we say with <hi>Oriegn,</hi> That they are in
a mutable state too, and that Heaven will
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96662:219"/>
have an end as well as Hell? If any Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
still unsatisfied with what hath been said,
I must refer him for full satisfaction to the
Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God
at that Great Day, of which mention hath
been already made.</p>
               <p>I am as unwilling as any Man to limit the
Mereies of God: but yet I must refer it to
him, whether he will be more favourable
than he hath threatned or no, whether he
will remit something of the Severity of his
Comminations. I am also willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
and consine the sense of these words
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as far as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
will permit. But let our Opinions and
Hopes of the Mercies of God, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Hell be what they will: a temporary
Hell, I say, or rather a <hi>Purgatory</hi> instead of
Hell: For the word Hell, according to the
usual acception of it, includes Eternity. I
shall propose two things to be considered.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Origen</hi> the first Broacher of this
Opinion of the Determination of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of the Damned, doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the contrary Doctrine is very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to restrain the common People from Sin:
and that this is to be held as a great Secret,
and studiously concealed from them. Now
if it be of such eminent use to them, why
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96662:220"/>
may it not also be to the Learned and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
who, I fear me, may want such a Bridle
as well as they?</p>
               <p>2. Since God hath threatned eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
whether he intends to execute
them upon us or no, it is clear, I think, he
would have them be believed by us, else they
cannot have that end and effect he designed
them to; and therefore it must be unbelief
and presumption in us to deny or distrust
them, tho' upon supposition, that they are
irreconcilable with his Goodness; with
which yet perhaps they may accord well
enough, tho' we cannot at present discern it.
All Divine Revelations are to be believed
and accepted by us, as well Threatnings as
Promises; and if we may distrust the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of God in them, I know not but we
may as well do it in these: if we deny the
Eternity of the Torments of Hell, I do not
see but that we may upon as good grounds,
with <hi>Origen,</hi> deny the Eternity of the Joys of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let not then the presumption of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Hell encourage thee to go on in sin:
for, I fear, such a Persuasion may have an
ill influence on the Manners of Men. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is the very sting of Hell: take that out,
and the Sinner will think it tractable enough.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:96662:220"/>
The very thought of an eternal Hell inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
(and it will often intrude itself)
strikes a cold damp to his very Heart in the
midst of his Jollities, and will much qualifie
and allay all his Pleasures and Enjoyments.
Rid him of this fear, and he will be apt to
despise Hell and all its Torments, be they
never so grievous or lasting. Take off
this Bridle, and, as we hinted before, he
will rush into Sin, <hi>as a Horse rusheth into
the battel.</hi> He will be ready thereupon thus
to argue with himself, What need I take so
much pains to strive against Sin? What need
I swim against the Stream, and resist the
Tide and Eddy of my Passions, my natural
Appetites and Inclinations, and the Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Company? What need I maintain
such a constant Watch and Ward against my
Spiritual Enemies, the Devil, the World,
and the Flesh? If I fall into Hell at last,
that is no eternal State, it lasteth but for a
time, and will come to an end. I'll venture
it: I hope I shall make a shift to ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> through
well enough. Let me ask thee, But how
if thou shouldest find thy self mistaken? If
the Event frustrate thy Hopes, and fall out
contrary to thy Expectation? What a sad
case wilt thou be in then? How will the
unexpectedness thereof double thy Misery?
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:96662:221"/>
                  <hi>Improvisa graviùs seriunt.</hi> How wilt thou be
strucken as it were with a Thunderbolt,
when the Almighty Judge shall sulminate
against thee a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eadful indeed, but by thee
formerly undreaded Sentence, adjudging
thee to endless Punishments? How walt thou
damn thine own Credulity, who by a
groundless Belief of a temporary Hell, hast
precipitated thy self into an eternal, which
otherwise thou mightest possibly have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided?</p>
               <p>Well, but suppose there be some shadow
of hope of the determination of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Damned: It is by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be a great piece of folly to leave
Matters of the highest moment, and which
most nearly concern us, at uncertainties:
and a point of Wisdom, to secure the Main
Chance, and to be provided against the worst
that can come. An eternal Heaven or State
of compleat Happiness is the Main Chance,
and is not to come into any competition, or
so much as to be put into the ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a few short, transient, fordid, loathed,
and for the most part upon their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
repented Pleasures: To secure to our
selves an Interest in such a State is our
greatest Wisdom. And as for being provided
against the worst that may or can come.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:96662:221"/>
What can be worse than an eternal Hell?
which, there is I do not say a possibility,
but the greatest probability imaginable, that
it will be our portion; if we persist in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
and dye in our sins. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the best should happen that we can
hope or conceive, that Hell should last only
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for Ages of Ages, and at
last determine: do we think this a small
matter? If we do, it is for want of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and experience of acute Pains. Should
any of us be under the sense and suffering
of a raging Paroxysm of the Stone, or Gout,
or Colick, I doubt not but rather than endure
it for ten thousand Years, he would willingly
part with all his expectation of a blessed
Estate after that Term were expired, yea, and
his Being to boot. But what are any of these
Pains to the Torments and Perpessions of
Hell? or the duration of ten thousand Years
to those Ages of Ages? If thou makest light
of all this, and nothing can restrain thee
from Sin, but the Eternity of Punishment,
thou art bound to thank God, who hath
used this only effectual means, threatning an
eternal Hell. And it ill becomes thee to
complain of his rigour and severity, who
wouldest have made so pernicious an use of
his lenity and goodness. But thou who hast
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96662:222"/>
entertained such an Opinion, and abusest it
to encourage thy self to go on in thy sins,
though others should escape with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Punishment, surely thou hast no reason
to expect any milder Doom, than to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to an eternal.</p>
