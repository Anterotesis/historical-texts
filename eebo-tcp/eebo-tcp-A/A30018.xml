         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Hen. Mountague
KNIGHT,
Lord Chief Justice of the KINGS Majesties
BENCH.</head>
            <p>IT is a true Saying of the Philosopher (Right
Honourable, and my very good Lord)
That there is nothing wherein there is <hi>Life,</hi> but
it hath either <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Action;</hi> and such is
the condition of Man, that a greater measure
of both is imposed upon him, to humble him,
than upon many other Creatures: The whole
course of his Life being compared unto a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi>
in which state a man can presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no certain Continuance. For, as a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
that intendeth to finish his Journey, stays
<pb facs="tcp:105162:3"/>
not in his Inn, but desires more to be upon
his Way than in his Bed; so it is with Man,
who cannot possess himself in rest, from the
time of his Birth until his Death, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is troubled with needless and unprofitable
Labours, to attain unto his Ends; which got,
both they and he perish. Let <hi>Alexander,</hi> that
great Emperour, be a president of this; who
with much Labour, having got a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
enjoyed it but a short time: and you
may read in this Treatise, with what intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pains <hi>Antigonus Epiphanes</hi> endeavoured to
establish his Kingdom to him; and yet in
the end purchased little but a lamentable
Death. There is none of the Patriarchs,
Princes, Judges, Kings, Prophets, Apostles,
or others mentioned in the Scriptures, that
could make evident in the whole course of
their Life, any better than a laborious and
tedious Pilgrimage. With what pains did
<hi>Abraham</hi> wander from <hi>Chaldea</hi> into the
Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> How was <hi>Moses</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in the Wilderness, almost to the
<pb facs="tcp:105162:3"/>
loss of his Soul? but absolutely never to
come into the promised Land. And for
<hi>David,</hi> how miserably lived he, when he
could not trust his own Friends? This is
the state of man; and to say truth, he
differs in little (beside Reason) from other
Creatures; and that either lock'd up in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or not express'd in some memorable
Action, makes him so much the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Misery; being only able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of Joy and Fear.</p>
            <p>Now that these things may be the more
apparent, I have endeavoured to collect, out
of the Works of others, this Treatise; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is briefly described the Travels of all the
<hi>Patriarchs, Iudges, Kings, Prophets, Princes,</hi> &amp;c.
together with the condition of Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
Islands, and other memorable places,
as they are mentioned in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Testaments.</hi> All which, that I might express
that Duty which hath a long time lain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
I have wholly dedicated to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Service; humbly intreating your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb facs="tcp:105162:4"/>
Acceptance of my Pains; that so
being shrouded under your Honour's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they may the better withstand the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Opinions of such as please to censure
them.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT hath always been held a matter worth note (gentle Reader)
even to the best Divines, to have the Typographical descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Towns and Places, as they are mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and so much the rather, because by comparing the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men with the beginnings and endings of Cities, they might the
better understand the Prophets, and perceive the wonderful Providence
of God; who by his Omnipotency so disposeth of Estates, that such
Cities and Nations which have been mighty, and ruled upon the Earth
with great Power, notwithstanding on a sudden, and by unexpected
Events, have been utterly subverted and overthrown. Now, that these
things might be more apparent, I have, in as good and brief a method
as I can, gathered out of sundry Authors, the particular Description of
the Cities, Towns, and places, as they are mentioned in the Scriptures,
where they stood, under whose command, at what time they grew mighty,
and how lost and decayed.</p>
            <p>To this also I have added a particular Narration of the Travels of
all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Princes, Iudges, Kings, Emperours,
our blessed Saviour and his Apostles: to what Towns they travelled,
what memorable Actions they did in those places; with a short Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of the times: that so by comparing this discourse with any Text of
Scripture, you may perceive the time when those Accidents happened.
All which things (I am perswaded) will prove no less pleasant than
profitable, and will give a great light to the understanding of the <hi>Bible.</hi>
But if you question with me, How it is possible that I should come to the
knowledge of those things, considering that <hi>Babylon, Niniveh, Jerusalem,</hi>
and most of the Cities of the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> are long since wasted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed?
To this I answer; therein consists the greatness of the Travel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have been constrained to use the help of many Authors, who,
amongst other long and learned discourses, have here and there glanced
at the Actions that were done in the Land of <hi>Judaea:</hi> amongst which are
<hi>Strabo, Jerom, de Locis Hebraicis, Plinie, Livie, Plutarch,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:105162:5"/>
others, who have described in the Actions of the <hi>Persians, Chaldeans,
Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> as it stood in those times,
with the Description of the Cities and Towns. And Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi>
who lived in that Country, took a great deal of pains to rectifie these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
discourses, which more obscure Authors have laboured in, and left
to future ages; that so those which would, might by their diligence and
care, make them useful to inform their understanding, both concerning
the State of the. <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the obscure meaning of some of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</p>
            <p>Also the scituation and Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a thing pleasant
and profitable to know, and no whit unworthy your consideration. How
all or the most part of the Towns, Cities, Countries, Nations, Islands,
Seas, Desarts, Mountaines, and most memorable places, are scituated
from it; how many miles <hi>English</hi> they stand distant, what memorable
actions have been done in them, and for the most part where they stood,
and how they are at this day.</p>
            <p>Besides (to make this a perfect work) you will find after the end of
the Old Testament, and before the beginning of the New; the Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Weights, Measures, and Monies which are mentioned in the
Scriptures, reduced unto our Valuation, how they were Current among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> how with other People, Nations, and Countries: by which
means that necessity of commutative Iustice, for which Monies were
principally invented, will be apparent; and by this meanes you shall
perceive what equality there is and hath been used amongst Nations, for
the ordaining of Measures and Monies; by which you may perceive,
that this Vniverse being compared together, seemeth but one large and
spacious Empire, howsoever under divers Governments.</p>
            <p>Again, the Peregrination of our Saviour, the manner of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nativity, his long and Tedious Iourneys, the condition of his estate
whiles he was upon the Earth, and (as near as can be guest) at what
time he did most of his Miracles; how he behaved himself when he was
betrayed, with a description of the manner of his death: and the Travels
of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and many other of his Apostles after his death. All
which things I have with much labour compiled together for your profit,
and expect nothing in recompence for my pains, but your Love. And
so I commit you to God.</p>

               <p>One Minute equalleth eight Furlongs, which make an <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Walloon</hi>
mile, the fourth part of a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile. Two Minutes of the Heavens, or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Furlongs, make a Dutch mile. Four, half of a Dutch mile. Three minutes
equal 24 Stades or Furlongs, which make three quarters of a Dutch mile.
Four minutes equal 32 Furlongs, that is to say, a German or Dutch mile.</p>
               <p>The Holy Evangelists, <hi>S. Luke,</hi> cap. 24 ver. 13. and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> c. 11. ver. 8.
reckon the way by Furlongs. <hi>S. Luke</hi> saith, the Town <hi>Emaus</hi> was distant from

                  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> sixty Furlongs: and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Bethania</hi> was fifteen Furlongs
distant from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Whence it appeareth, that <hi>Emaus</hi> was distant from
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> almost two Dutch miles, seven Walloon miles and a half; and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania</hi>
almost half a Dutch mile, which is a mile, a half, and half a quarter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, That Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> was distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> five Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,
that is a little more than half a quarter of a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile, which is
half an Italian mile and half a quarter. The same <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, That
the circuit of the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was thirty three Furlongs, a <hi>Dutch</hi>
mile and half a quarter. Others say it was four miles in Compass, which
being understood of Italian or Walloon miles, make little or no difference,

that is half a Dutch and half a quarter, which is two Italian miles and a half.</p>

               <head>How the Romans measured their Miles.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> measured their miles by Paces, which they call <hi>Passus,</hi> and
that kind of measuring is done after this manner; Four Barley-corns laid
long-ways, one by the other, make the breadth of a Finger, four Fingers
broad make the breadth of an Hand, four Hands broad make the length
of a Foot, which measure is now extant; five feet make a Geometrical or
great Pace; one hundred twenty five such Paces are a Furlong; eight Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
are one thousand Paces or Walloon mile; two thousand Paces are a
<hi>French</hi> mile.</p>
               <l>Ex granis quatuor formabitur unus.</l>
               <l>Est quater in palmo digitus, quater in pede palmus.</l>
               <l>Quinque pedes passum faciunt, passus quoque centum</l>
               <l>Viginti quinque stadium dant: Sed milliare</l>
               <l>Octo dabunt stadia; duplicatum sit tibi Leuca.</l>
               <p>Four thousand Paces are a Dutch mile, I mean a common Dutch mile,
whereof fifteen are reckoned to a Degree of the Heavens; for the <hi>Switzer</hi>
miles are commonly a quarter of a Dutch mile longer than common Dutch
miles. But through this Book, by miles we understand common Dutch
miles, whereof four thousand Paces make a mile.</p>
               <p>Whosoever will understand St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> well, <hi>de locis Hebraicis,</hi> must mark
whether he reckons by Miles or by Stones: The miles specified by him are
Walloon miles, whereof four make a Dutch mile as aforesaid: the Stone
whereof he writeth (whereby also they did measure and divide the way) are
reckoned six to a Dutch mile.</p>
               <p>To the end that all men that have any little Understanding in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Cosmography may make the Tables, and cast them, and at their
Pleasure inlarge or diminish them; I have here for their direction set down
the Longitude and Latitude of the most principal Towns: the former Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
shew the degrees and minutes of the Longitude, the later Numbers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

<hi>Ioshua,</hi> when they returned from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> re-edified and

               <p>THE most holy and beautiful City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (if any would consider
the three principal parts of the World, <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>) stood
in the midst of the World, upon most high Mountains and Rocks, like an
earthly Paradise, a lively Figure of the everlasting City of God. This City
being the Metropolitan or principallest City of the Jews, stood in the Tribe
of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> at the first it was called <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, <hi>Peaceable:</hi> when <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech,</hi>
the Priest of God, reigned therein, which he also built after the
Deluge (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Egisippus</hi> write.) But at that time it was not very
great; for it stood only upon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi>
would have offered his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> stood without the City, and after that
they took it into the City, as when time serveth it shall be declared.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> unto whom <hi>Abraham</hi> paid the Tythes
of all his Goods, the <hi>Iebusites</hi> dwelt in the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and had the

               <p>MOunt <hi>Sion</hi> stood Northwards in the City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and was much
higher than all the other Hills that were therein; therefore it was called
<hi>Sion,</hi> that is, a watch Tower; because from thence one might see the Holy
Land, and all the Countries thereabout: upon this Hill, the upper City was
built, which in the Scripture is called the City of <hi>David,</hi> because <hi>David</hi> won it
from the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> and beautified it with many goodly Houses and fair and
costly buildings: but especially with his house of Cedar-wood, which he
termed the Castle of <hi>Sion,</hi> which stood Westwards at the corner of the Hill,
looking into <hi>Bethlehem</hi> Southwards. In that house <hi>David</hi> dwelt, and therein
committed Adultery with <hi>Berseba</hi> the Wife of <hi>Vriah</hi> the Hittite; whose
House also with the place of divers Privy Councellors and Officers, stood
upon the Hill, not far from the King's Palace, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth.</p>
               <p>Beneath King <hi>David's</hi> House, upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> within a Rock, there
was to be seen the Sepulchre or Vault, wherein King <hi>David, Solomon</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi>
and other succeeding Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> were entombed and buried.</p>
               <p>Upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> also (towards the East) King <hi>Herod</hi> had a Garden of
Pleasure, not far from the Fountain called <hi>Silo, Nehemiah</hi> 3. and there also
stood the Tower of <hi>Silo,</hi> whereof <hi>Luke</hi> in the 13 chapter maketh mention.</p>

                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> (in the Wars of the Jews, his first Book, and sixteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
saith, That King <hi>Herod,</hi> under whom Christ Jesus was born, had
two fair and strong Houses or Towers, which he set and made in the
upper part of the City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which were in
a manner comparable with the Temple for Beautifulness, which he called
after the Name of his Friends; the one Caesarea, for <hi>Caesar</hi> the Emperor's sake,
and the other Agrippa, acording to the name of the noble Roman <hi>Marcus
Agrippa,</hi> that marryed the Daughter of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may suffice to declare the Scituation of the upper City, which stood

about half a mile. This uppermost City, in the sacred Scripture is called
the City of <hi>David;</hi> it was also called <hi>Millo,</hi> that is, Fullness or Plenty, for in

called the Gate of <hi>Sion;</hi> and they which went up to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> must pass

               <head>The Description of the Temple of Jerusalem.</head>
               <p>THE Temple stood upon Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> was fairly built, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
contrived, of white Marble Stones, which were so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
or closed together, that a man could not see or perceive the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
or Crests of them: and the inner Walls of it were made all of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
wood, carved with the similitude of Angels, Cherubims, roots of Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
and with flowers of divers kinds, gilt all over with pure Gold, and
set with precious Stones; insomuch, that all parts of the upper Roof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Temple, did shine with the lustre of it. The pavement thereof
also was plated all over with fine Gold; so that all the Temple within,
both above, under foot, and on every side and corner thereof, was gilt
clean over: but without, it was of smooth polish'd white Marble Stone, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
beautiful and fair to the Eye, much resembling<note place="margin">That is, an 100 Cubits, which make 50 yards <hi>English;</hi> so that the Temple was 50 yards long, 50 broad, and 60 high.</note>
the colour of any Pearl, Unit, or Margaret. It was in
length an hundred Ells, in breadth an hundred Ells, and
in height an hundred and twenty Ells, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
in the old Acts and Wars of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in his fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Book and fourteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Roof thereof was made of thin planks of Olive-wood, all cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over with Plates of Gold: it was adorned with sharp and plain spikes of
Gold, left Birds should defile it with their Dung. When any man travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the white marble Stones and the golden Roof thereof, did cast such
a Light and reflexing Brightness from them, that it did make the Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Eyes dark and blind with looking upon it.</p>
               <p>Within the Temple there was the most sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Quire, which stood at
the West end thereof, the which Quire, was formed four square, that is,
twenty Ells broad, long, and high. This Quire was called the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
wherein it was lawful for no man to enter but the High Priest, and
he also but once in a year, which was on the Feast day of the Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sacrifice, to appease God's wrath. In the middle part of the Quire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105162:10"/>
there stood two Cherubims, made of Olive-wood, covered all over with
fine Gold, whose Faces and Forms were like unto young Children; the
height of them was ten Ells; each of them had two Wings, which were
five Ells broad; they stood one right against the other, so that with the
innermost Wings they touched together, and the uttermost sides of the
Wings touched the sides of the Quire: their Faces looked towards the East:
in the middle, under the Wings of the Cherubims, was placed the Ark of the
Covenant; but after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, the Ark of the Covenant
stood no more there; for then the Holy of Holies was empty, and nothing
seen in the second Temple but the two Cherubims, as is aforesaid. The
Wall of this Quire was of pure Gold, excellent fair and curiously graven:
In this Wall of the most holy Quire there was a Gate made all of Gold,
which had two Leaves or little dores that opened and shut, very curiously
embossed; through which dores men went into the most holy Quire, where
the Lord did answer by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> there the Cherubims stood,
and before that Gate there did hang a rich Vail or Curtain, which was
made of fine Silk, woven very artificially, wherein there was wrought the
picture of the Cherubims, with Needle-work of diverse colours. This was
the same Vail which at the Passion of Christ did rent in sunder from the
top to the bottom, to shew that then <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Levitical Sacrifices were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
and now every man may freely approach (thorough the mercy of
his dearly beloved Son) unto the Presence of God's heavenly Throne.</p>
               <p>Before the most sacred Quire there was builded towards the East, a place
within the Temple containing forty Ells in length, twenty in breadth,
and thirty in height, closed up on both sides with golden Walls, which
was called the holy place or Sanctuary of the Temple, wherein no man
might enter but only the Priest, when he offered Incense, and prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. In the middle of that holy place there stood an Altar, covered
with plates of Gold; near unto which, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared unto
<hi>Zacharias,</hi> and brought him the glad Tidings, That <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife
should bear him a Son whose Name should be <hi>Iohn,</hi> who should prepare
the way of Christ. At the South end of this Altar, upon the one side stood
the holy Candle-sticks, and at the other end on the other side, stood a
golden Table, whereupon the Shew-bread was set. And in this holy
place there stood ten Tables more for the meat Offerings, and ten golden
Candle-sticks more, which were beautified with Lamps, Lillies, and other
fair Flowers. The opening doors whereby men went into the holy place,
were also very rich and costly, made of Gold, with carved Cherubims,
Palm-trees, and broad Flowers thereupon. And before those doors also
there were hanging Vails or Curtains, very curiously wrought. On both
sides of the Temple there were certain Walks or Galleries, which were
three Stories high one above another, and on the right side there stood a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105162:10"/>
pair of turning Stairs, by the which, men went up to the Chamber of the
Temple, and there all the small Vessels, and other things belonging to the
Temple, were kept. The Roofs of these Galleries were all plated over
with Gold, but that part was somewhat lower than the principal part of the
Temple. The Windows of the Temple were wide within and narrow
without. The Gates of the Temple were made of pure Gold, five and
twenty Ells high, and sixteen Ells broad; but especially the Gate that
stood Eastward in the Temple, was exceeding high, which in the second
Book of <hi>Kings, chap.</hi> 25. is called the high Gate: and as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, the
said Gate was ninety Ells high, the Doors whereof, were forty Ells long and
twenty Ells broad, gilt all over, and richly embossed, beautified with Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
and precious Stones. The Wall before this Gate, towards the East,
was pure Gold, embossed and curiously engraven in manner of Vines, with
great golden Leaves as big as the stature of a Man, whereon there did hang
the picture and form of Grapes, which were made of fine Chrystal. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that high Gate also there did hang a Vail or Curtain as long and broad
as the Gate within: This Vail was made of a piece of <hi>Babylonian</hi> Tapistry,
wonderfully wrought, and made of Silk, beautified with divers Colours,
of Scarlet, Purple, and Velvet; and as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, the Sphere of the
Heavens was wrought therein, but the twelve Signs were not; and when
the Wind blew, the Vail did move like a Vane.</p>

               <head>Of the Porches or open Courts of the Temple.</head>
               <p>BEfore the high Gate of the Temple, towards the East, there were three
Porches or Courts open, without Roofs, which were made all of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
Stone, with fair marble Pillars, beautified with all kind of Colours,
in which Porches, men praised and served God.</p>
               <p>The first was called the upper Porch, where none but the Priest might
enter when he offered and served God; which Porch stood next unto the
high Quire. The second was called <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Hall or Porch; there the
People used to pray, and in that Court our Saviour Christ preached, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.
The third Porch King <hi>Herod</hi> built, adding that thereto for the Heathen
People, which also came unto Ierusalem to pray.</p>
               <p>These three Porches went four square round about the Temple, as the
Temple it self was, and between these Porches there were also spaces left, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with pillars of Marble, and close above the head, for men to walk
under when it rained, which were all made of Cedar and Cypress-wood,
and of marble stone, beautified with Gold. But towards the East, right

               <p>IN the upper Porch, which stood right over against the high Quire in the
Temple, there was an Altar of Brass proportioned four square, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 20 Cubits in length, and 20 Cubits in breadth, extending to ten Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
in height, beautified with golden horns, whereon they used to offer
burnt Sacrifices of Oxen, Sheep, Turtle Doves, Calves, and other things.
Also, in times past, there stood the great molten Sea, made by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
the two brazen Pillars which were made with Knobs, Pomegranates, and
Lillies, very costly, and most artificially done; and ten Kettles upon Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but those Kettles and Pillars with Knobs and Pomgranates, and the great
molten Sea made by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> were carried away by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and broken in pieces: after which Captivity, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen more in the Temple, for there were no more made. But the Altar of

made again and stood there, as I said before, by which there stood divers Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
whereon they killed their Offerings. In this Court also there was a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fountain, with the Water whereof, they used to wash the Blood of the
Beasts out of the Temple. For there were certain holes and gutters between
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105162:11"/>
the marble Stones, whereby the Water ran under the Earth, and through
the Earth was conveyed in a Pipe into the Lake <hi>Kidron.</hi> In this Court, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi>
the Son of <hi>Barachias</hi> was killed, between the Temple and the Altar,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. And <hi>Zacharias</hi> the High Priest, the Son of <hi>Ioiadah,</hi> was stoned to
death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. It was compassed about with a great Wall, made of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
stone of divers colours, wherein there were divers doors to go out and in,
decked with lofty Towers and pleasant Walks made of Cedar-wood, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
our ancient Cloisters. But principally toward the East it had a great
Gate of 70 Ells or Cubits high, and 25 broad, all covered over with gold,
(as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth) standing always open, without any dores to shut, that
every man might look into it when the Priest served God. If any man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
any thing, he brought it to the Priest before the Gate, but might not
go in himself. <hi>Iere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Riches, because thou canst give more than the Poor, for God respects not
how much, but with what Devotion thou givest thy Reward, <hi>Amb. li. de

was accused to him, being sorry for her offence; saying, <hi>I came not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
but to save Sinners that repent.</hi> Upon which, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou art a Publican, yet thou mayst be made an Evangelist; though
a Persecuter of the Church, yet an Apostle; though a Thief, yet of the
City of Paradise; though a Magician, yet thou may'st worship God; for
there is no Sin so dangerous, but Repentance may obtain Pardon. Not far
from this Treasury there stood certain Galleries, curiously adorned with
marble Pillars, the root whereof was plated with Silver and Gold, and
was close above the Head, that when it rained, men might walk under them
dry, and indeed, did much resemble our ancient Monasteries. The dores
of these Walks were covered over with Gold and Silver; so also was that
high Gate whereby men went Eastward into <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch, and was fifty
Cubits high, and the dores forty, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the third Court or Porch, wherein the Heathens used to pray, commonly
called the Hall of the Gentiles, or outward Court.</head>
               <p>THis Court was not built by the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> but by <hi>Herod,</hi> when the
rest of the Temple was re-edified, some sixteen years before the Birth
of Christ, and about six and forty before he began to preach, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. It was
so spatious, and sumptuously built, that it amazed the Beholders, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an hundred Cubits in breath, and seven hundred and twenty Cubits
in length, lying Eastward towards the Brook <hi>Kidron:</hi> the Pavement was
of Marble of divers colours, like the other Courts; the Walls, with the
marble Pillars, were five and twenty Cubits high; and the Walks about it
very curiously made, were thirty Cubits broad. This was called <hi>Vestabulum
Gentium,</hi> where the Heathens as well as the Jews, might enter and pray.
Out of this place Christ drave the Buyers and Sellers, overthrew the Tables
of the Money-Changers, and the seats of those that sold Doves, <hi>Io. 2. Mat.</hi> 21. And it stood something lower than <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch.</p>
               <p>All these three Courts were inclosed within high Walls and Walks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
our Cloisters, where round about the Temple, at every corner of
which, stood very high Towers, whereon, when the Sabbath day came,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105162:12"/>
one of the Priests over night went and sounded a Trumpet, to signifie that
the next day was the Sabbath (for then there were no Bells.) The Wall
of this uttermost Court (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth) was in height (reckoning
from the bottom to the Valley of <hi>Kidron</hi>) four hundred Cubits, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with goodly Towers, upon the Pinnacles of which, were built Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
houses and fair Walks, from whence we might see into the Temple,
and clean over the Town. These were called the Pinnacles of the Temple,
and were so high, that when one looked down from them into the Valley,
their eyes dazled in such manner, that they could not see; as <hi>Iosephus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>li. Antiq. 15. ca</hi> 14. Upon one of these Pinnacles the Devil carried our
Saviour Christ saying, <hi>If thou be the Son of God cast thy self down, &amp;c.
Mat.</hi> 14. And <hi>Iames</hi> the son of <hi>Alphaeus,</hi> by the Commandment of <hi>Annas</hi>
the High Priest, was from thence thrown into the Valley of <hi>Cedron,</hi> and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a <hi>Fullers</hi> instrument died, <hi>Ios. Ant. 20. ca.</hi> 8. &amp;c. The Gate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East was thirty cubits high, and had dores opening two wayes
15 cubits broad (as <hi>Ios.</hi> writeth) made of pure brass that shone like pure gold
and silver, artificially made and cunningly embossed, insomuch as it was called
the beautiful Gate of the Temple: as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> was going into the
Temple by this Gate, they healed a man that had been born lame
from his Mothers Womb, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>When a man went Eastward, the Gates were one higher than another.
The first Gate, or the Gate of the Heathens Court, was thirty Cubits high.
The second that entred into <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch, was fifty cubits: the third which
went into the highest and last Court was seventy cubits, and the great high
Gate of the Temple was ninety Cubits high, so that every Gate of
the Temple was twenty Cubits one higher than another: And in
in these Gates there were benches made for men to sit on. There were many
other Gates and dores on both sides, some 60 some 20 Cubits broad, all almost
made of pure Gold, and of such weightiness, that (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth in his
second book to <hi>Appius</hi>) two hundred men could scarce open and shut them.

it, commanded his Souldiers to burn one of the golden Gates (which then
was shut) that so he might overcome the same, and with a strong hand car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away a most glorious Victory: for it was wonderfully fortified both
by Nature and Art; it had deep Ditches, lofty Towers like unto Castles
of defence; and moreover, compassed about with Bulwarks and strong Walls,
insomuch that it was not possible to be won but with extream difficulty and
great labour. When the Gate was fired, the gold that ran from it was in great
abundance: and by this means the Conquest was made easie. This shall
suffice to have spoken of the Buildings of the Temple.</p>

Religion, built her an house in this City, that she might pray in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Here stood the houses of her Sons, <hi>Monebasius</hi> and <hi>Grapta:</hi> here stood
the houses of the High Priests <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> not far from the Valley
<hi>Tyropae:</hi> King <hi>Herod</hi> also, that wicked Man who caused the innocent
Children to be put to Death, built him an house here, near about the place
where the <hi>Machabees</hi> in times past had a Castle; (for they built two, one in
Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> another in this Mount.) That in Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> was after
called the Castle of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and stood right against the Temple, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
And this being very sumptuously built, and a Royal Seat, was after
the death of this <hi>Herod</hi> a Palace for his Successors, <hi>Archilaus</hi> and <hi>Herod
Agrippa.</hi> Not far off he caused two fair Theatres to be also built; the one
in honour of the Emperour <hi>Augustus;</hi> and this on the one side joyned to a
Tower called <hi>Acropolis,</hi> (which was built by <hi>Antigonus Epiphanes,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to place a Garrison in, to keep the Jews in bondage; which <hi>Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus</hi>
afterwards made level with the ground) and on the other side, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own Palace. It resembled a Semi-circle, made all of white Marble,
fairly polished, the Building somewhat low; within, full of high Banks, one
rising above another like Scaffolds, so that the whole multitude might easily
hear or see whatsoever was said or done. It was curiously beautified with
Gold, Silver, and many goodly Pictures; but amongst the rest, the
Battels which the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> had won against his People,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105162:16"/>
were lively pourtrayed. To this place, as well Jews as Gentiles resorted to see
Interludes and Plays Acted. The other was an Amphitheatre, and stood upon
the South side of the House: it was built round in a whole Circle, compassed
bout with high Walls, large and spatious. Here they used to Fence and to
Fight both on Horse-back and in Waggons. And in the fifth year, in honour
of <hi>Augustus,</hi> the <hi>Circensian</hi> Games, according to the Rites of the Gentiles,
were very sumptuously performed. On the south side of this Amphitheatre,
stood Queen <hi>Bernice</hi>'s house, Sister to <hi>Agrippa junior:</hi> it was a very fair and
sumptuous Building, little inferior to King <hi>Herods.</hi> This stood in the
Market place, and so all along were very sumptuous and stately Pillars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Here <hi>Agrippa</hi> himself had also an House, and over against that, upon the
North, stood the Judgment-hall, where the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or the Councel of the
seventy Elders used to meet, to hear and determine of mens causes. To this
place Christ was brought when they asked him if he was Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
Here were the Apostles whipt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. And close by this stood the house of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
the Pretor, fairly glistering with Gold; in which house all the <hi>Roman</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Presidents for the most part had their Residence: and here our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ was whipt, crowned with Thorns, and spit upon. Not far off from
this Pretor's house, stood the Chancery, or rather, as we term it, the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a stately and magnificent house, curiously built, and appointed onely to
lay Records and common Chronologies in. Here also the Officers of the
Town gave in their Accounts, and Creditors entred their Debts. This
was utterly destroyed by <hi>Vesp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mount.</p>
               <p>Next, the Market place was a thing very memorable, and was so large
and spatious, that in the time of the Wars many great Battels were fought
there, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith. In this Market place, close by <hi>Pilates</hi> house, stood a
high Seat or Tribunal, made of fair stone curiously wrought, and for the
Eminence of it, called in the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> tongue <hi>Gabatha;</hi> and because it was
built of Stone, the Grecians called it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the Latins, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidanium;</hi>
and with us it might be termed an heap of Stones;<note n="*" place="margin">Or a well wrought stone.</note>
(for so the word signifieth. Here <hi>Pilate</hi> taking water, washed
his hands before the People, and said, <hi>I am innocent of this mans
blood:</hi> At which they cried, <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children.</hi> And after,
by Gods appointment, according to their own wish, fell upon them; for in the
same place, and close by this same Seat, it hapned, that <hi>Herod</hi> wanting money,
demanded of the Jews so much out of their Treasury (which they called <hi>Corban</hi>)
as would pay for the making of a Water-course (for he assayed to bring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the City from a Fountain some two hundred furlongs off it) but the
Jews supposing it a needless work, not only denied him, but gave him many
outragious and spiteful speeches, tumultuously flocked about him, and
with great clamors prest upon him, even as he was in his Seat: wherefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105162:16"/>
the danger, and to prevent mischief, he sent to his Souldiers to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
themselves like Citizens, and under their Gowns to bring with them a
Dagger or Ponyard, and mingle themselves among the multitude, which
they did, observing who they were that made the greatest uproar; and when
<hi>Herod</hi> gave the sign, fell upon them with their Ponyards, killing a great
multitude. The rest, seeing this Massacre, suspecting Treason amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
fell one upon another; and many for fear of loss, or to avoid future
danger, killed themselves. In this very place also, <hi>Florus,</hi> General of the
common Souldiers, within few years after, upon a small occasion, made
another cruel Massacre, and much more barbarous than the former; for
he spared none, the best of them he caused to be whip'd to death, or else
crucified and put to the Sword; and for the Vulgar, spared neither Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nor Child. So that within the compass of one day there died of
this obstinate and wicked Nation, above seven hundred and thirty.
This outrage was so cruel, that all Strangers which inhabited within the
Town pitied their misery; but especially Queen <hi>Bernice,</hi> who, being partly
frighted with their shreeks, partly moved to commiseration through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of their Affliction, indangered her life to present her self before <hi>Florus,</hi>
and upon her knees besought him to take some mercy and pity of them, and
withdraw his hand of vengeance from the blood of the guiltless. But the
fury of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers was so fierce, and the Resolution of <hi>Florus</hi> so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeable,
that neither her Tears, not the present Calamities could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him. But, as in such uproars it commonly happeneth, she with the rest
was in danger of her Safety, and was constrained the next night, for the
preservation of her Estate, to keep a strong Watch, lest the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers
should have done her some violence. Thus we may see a just revenge of a
perjured and stiff-necked People, and that in the place where the Offence was
committed, though at least eight and thirty years after.</p>
               <p>In this Market-place <hi>Agrippa</hi> had built a Gallery all of Marble, from his
own house to the Judgment-hall; it was covered above, and made with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and sundry Rooms for men to walk in, all burnished with Gold, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the name of <hi>Xiston,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath it. Here <hi>Agrippa</hi> after this cruel
Massacre made an Oration to the People (Queen <hi>Bernice</hi> standing by him)
to this effect; That they should forbear to raise any more commotions against
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to banish the Seditious out of the City, for that they saw their
cruelty; <hi>Ioseph. lib. de Bell. 2. Egesip. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. cap.</hi> 8. To this Gallery there joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Bridge, which pass'd over the Valley of <hi>Cedron</hi> to the Temple. And
amongst many other sair and sumptuous Buildings that were upon this place,
there were the Colledges of the Pharisees, Sadduces, and the Synagogues and
Schools for the Instruction of Youth, which were dispersed here and there
among other stately Buildings; and this was called the lower Town.</p>

room thereof there might stand an hundred Tables: the Hall also was very
great, and richly gilded with refined gold intermixt with Silver: about it were
many pleasant and delectable Walls, goodly Gardens and Fountains for
pleasure: it was compass'd with a wall of polisht Marble 30 Cubits high. And
(as <hi>Valerius</hi> writeth) in that house <hi>Herod</hi> caused Christ to be mocked, put
a long white garment upon him in contempt, and so sent him to <hi>Pilate.</hi>
Here also was a Prison, in which <hi>Peter</hi> was kept when the Angel of the Lord
delivered him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.</p>

               <head>Of the Town Neapolis, or the New City.</head>
               <p>THis lay without the Walls of the City, and became inhabited by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the great concourse of People that flocked thither, (for in times
past there were no inhabitants) and stood upon the North side of the Hill.
Here dwelt the Christians, and other Laborers and Strangers: and by all
likelihood, it seems that the house of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iohn,</hi> sirnamed
<hi>Mark,</hi> stood here, which, because of the continual resort of the Apostles
thither, was called the house of the Church. Hither <hi>Peter</hi> resorted when he
was delivered from the hands of <hi>Herod</hi> by the Angel: for thus saith the Text,
<hi>Acts 12. 9. That when Peter had past the first and second Watch, he came to the
Iron Gate which led into the City, and loe it opened of it self. And from
thence he went to the house of</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi> John, <hi>sirnamed</hi> Mark.
Here also (in my opinion) Christ celebrated the last Paschal Lamb,
because after Supper he went into the Mount of Olives, for this lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled,
lay open for them to go and come at their pleasure. But afterward
in <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi>'s time, it was begun to be compassed in with a Wall, and
before it could be fully finished, the Angel of the Lord struck him, and he died
miserably: Here also stood the Monument of <hi>Iohn Hircanus</hi> the High Priest,
and of <hi>Alexander</hi> King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it appeareth in <hi>Iosephus, lib. de Bello,</hi> 6.
<hi>cap.</hi> 6. The tops of the Houses in the City <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were flat, and covered with
fair and plain Roofs, compassed about with Battlements; upon which they
used to Leap, Dance, and Banquet, and such Recreations as they observed
upon their Festival days, were there celebrated. And thus much shall serve
to have spoken of the Mountains or Hills whereon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> stood.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Walls that compassed the City.</head>
               <p>THis City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was so strongly fortified by Nature on every side,
except the North, (for it stood upon high Rocks and Cliffs) that it
seemed to be invincible. And, that that side might be the better strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they compassed it in with three Walls, and those so strong, that when
<hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperor and his Army invaded the City, they had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
to conquer them. The first of these Walls was that which <hi>Agrippa</hi>
built, and it compassed in <hi>Neapolis,</hi> otherwise called the New Town. At
the North-west end of which Wall, was built an exceeding high Tower
of very fair Marble stone; so high, that standing on the top thereof, a man
might see from thence to the Sea, and into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the uttermost bounds
of <hi>Iudaea.</hi> This Tower was called <hi>
                     <unclear>Psephina</unclear>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Wall was that which divided the two Suburbs; wherein there
stood 14 Towers and Gates. This King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> built, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 32. in a
corner of which, between the West-gate and the Valley-gate, there stood a
high Tower, wherein all the night great fire was made, which cast a light
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105162:18"/>
a great way off round about; so that Travellers passing towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
were guided by it in their way. Of this light we read in <hi>Nehem. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The third Wall compassed in the Temple, and all the lower City; in it
was sixty Towers, but the chief of them stood in the East Angle, between the
Dung-gate and the Gate of the Valley, which was called <hi>Hananiel,</hi> and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<hi>the Grace and Gift of God.</hi> This is much spoken of in the Scripture: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Wall King <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Ascalonite</hi> built three fair Towers; one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Garden-gate and the Old-gate, which he called <hi>Hippicum,</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Father <hi>Hippicus;</hi> the other <hi>Phaselum,</hi> in honour of his Brother <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silus;</hi>
and the third <hi>Mariamne,</hi> after his Wives name, who notwithstanding he
caused innocently to be put to death. These three Gates were built of polish't
Marble. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> say, that this was the fairest and most spacious
City of the East; and for the munition and fortification almost invincible.
The Walls of it were all of white polish't Marble, some 25 or 30 Cubits high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the stones were 20 Cubits long, 20 broad, and 5 thick, so closely joyned, that
the junctures could scarcely be perceived. Many of the Towers also
were made of such stones, but those of the Temple exceeded the rest; for
they were 25 Cubits long, 12 broad, and 8 thick, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> witnesseth, <hi>lib.
Ant. 15. ca. 14. &amp; de Bel. Iud. li. 6. ca.</hi> 6. which things being rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
we may easily perceive that these Walls were very difficult to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:
Neither were the Ditches of less strength that went about the Town;
for they were cut out of hard stones, at least forty Cubits deep, and two
hundred and fifty Cubits broad, which were impossible to have been won, if
God had not help'd and assisted the <hi>Romans,</hi> filling up those Ditches with
the Bodies of those that died of the Plague and Famin within the Town.</p>

passing through the Cliffs of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> it ran directly East till it came to
the Dead Sea; which Brook in the Summer time was most commonly dry.
The Water of it was something Black, which colour the Valley <hi>Jehosaphat</hi>

a blackish stream. This is mystically spoken of, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> and

Children to the Idol <hi>Moloch:</hi> and when they did it, they made a great noise

offered, should not hear them cry, by reason of the great noise of the Drums.
This Valley was called the Valley of <hi>Tophet;</hi> for <hi>Tophet</hi> signifies a Drum.

of God, that even on the same day, and in the very same place, where but
eight and thirty years before, our Saviour Christ suffered, the Authors of
such cruelty suffered a most just and severe revenge. Now as the Army of
the <hi>Romans</hi> lay upon the North of the City, <hi>Titus</hi> drew out a Band of six

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105162:21"/>
thee about and hem thee in on every side. Iosephus</hi> was now in the City,
and walking upon the Walls, earnestly intreated the <hi>Jewes</hi> to desist, and no
longer to oppose the <hi>Romans,</hi> but this was so hateful a speech to many, that
they began to fling Darts at him. And although at this time the extremity
of the Famin was so sore, that many died for want of sustenance, yet all
perswasions were in vain; and such was the Calamity, that as well those as
went out, as those that continued in the City, were in like danger of their lives; for they were either slain by the Enemy, or else by the Pestilence and
Famin; common Injuries, and unmerciful Outrages still attending upon
War.</p>
            <p>Their Misery did rather increase than at all lesson it self; for the jealousie
of Treason, the hope of Riches and the madness of the Seditious, distracted
the minds of the Citizens with continual fears, and filled the Streets full of
Murther and daily spectacles of lamentable Tragedies: The Markets were
unfrequented with Corn, the Victuals with Viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce consumed and taken
from the true owners. And if it chanced that some one had more than
would serve his turn, though he dwelt in a fair and stately Building, yet
the remotest Room and most unfrequented he made his Tabernacle, and
that little which was left, with great parcimony he consumed, together with his
life, till both were ended. Those that were Fathers and Senators of the People
(though before served and attended with reverence and great state) in
this confusion were glad of a small morsel, though with much contention.
The Wife was not ashamed to take away the Meat from her Husband, nor
the Children from their Parents, nor the Mothers from their Infants: and if
it hapned that in any house the Seditious seemed to smell food, with violence
they took it, ransack'd the rooms round about, whilest the Master thereof
was made a laughing-stock and mournful Spectator of those mischiefs. But
according to the condition of Souldiers, whose natural disposition is to be
violent, without any regard either of Sex or Kindred, committed daily out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. So that here you might have seen the Mothers weeping over their
dying Infants, whilst their husbands were massacred in the streets by the
Seditious.</p>
            <p>The increase of days were the increase of Torments, and the daily wants
of such as were in Power, being unaccustomed to such evils, caused them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new means to satisfie their desire, and practice unusual Torments, for
no other purpose but to find out Sustenance: yea, such was their insatiable
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>irst of blood, that they spared not him whom but now gave them all he had,
and lest he should live to cumber the City, either hang him up by the heels
till he died, or else pulled out his Entrails with a sharp Iron. Those that went
out in the Night-time when the <hi>Romans</hi> were asleep, to gather herbs, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
would meet, and with violence take what they had got from them:
And though with tears and lamentations, and prayers upon their knees, they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105162:21"/>
intreated but for one part, a small moiety of that which a little before they
had got with danger of their Lives, yet they would not give it them, and
scap't fairly if they went away with Life. These Insolencies were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the common Souldiers, upon such as were the meaner sort of
People. But for the rest that were either Honourable or Rich, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Prey to the Captains and Commanders, some accused as Traitors,
and that they would have betrayed the City to the <hi>Romans;</hi> others as Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
that they would forsake the City; most under pretence of one crime or
other, despoiled of that they had. And they whom <hi>Iohn</hi> had thus oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
were entertained of <hi>Simon,</hi> and whom <hi>Simon</hi> had injured, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
by <hi>Iohn;</hi> both drunk the blood of the miserable Citizens like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so that the desire of Rule was the cause of their dissention, the concord
of their evil and cruel actions.</p>
            <p>There was an infinite number that perished in this City by Famin, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as houses were filled with the bodies of Infants and Children. The
Angle-gate was thrust full of dead corps. The young Men that remained
walked up and down the City like Images of Death. The old Men were
destroyed by the Pestilence, the contagion of which disease taking away their
Senses they became Mad. And of such as died among the Seditious, their
Wives or kindred had not room nor time to bury them, but as they were
putting them into the Grave, they also dyed. Yet for all this, amongst
this Miserable Society, there was no Weeping, no complaining, no deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their necessities; for the violence of the Famin having dryed up
their radical moisture, the fear of grief was taken from them: and such as
had most cause to lament, and were most pricked with the sting of sorrow,
before they could utter their grief died, the beholders not shedding a Tear:
so that through the whole City there was a still silence, and a thick mist
of Death and Destruction didfully possess the same.</p>
            <p>But the Seditious were much more cruel than these were oppressed with
Calamity and Sorrow; for some opened the graves of the Dead, and taking
out their Bodies thrust them thorow with their Swords; others to try the
sharpness of the Edge of their Weapons, would fall upon those that were yet
alive, and when they had slain them, go away laughing at their pleasure.
So that, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, there was scarce any mischief under the Sun, but
was both practised and tollerated in this City. To conclude, by Sedition
the <hi>Romans</hi> conquered the City, and Sedition conquered the Romans,</p>
            <p>All love and modesty, through this extream and intolerable Famin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
utterly extinct, and the dearest Friends would kill one another for a
crust of bread; the fairest Lady commit open Adultery for a little sustenance.
Their food was extraordinary, and such as men did loath and hate; some
would feed upon Snails and Worms, others of old hay chop'd small; many eat
Corn either unground or made into Bread: some pluckt the Meat from the spit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105162:22"/>
raw, others with their teeth gnaw'd off the leather off their Shields; and that
very mouth which cried, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him, let his Blood be upon us
and our Children,</hi> was constrained to feed upon three sorts of Dung, that is
to say, Doves dung, Oxe dung, and Mans dung. Moreover, many were
constrained, for meer necessity, to feed upon the dead Bodies of such, as a
little before Died, partly by Famin, partly by the Pestilence. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
for very madness eat up their Gold: for some of them being taken
as they were flying for their safety, by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their Excrement was
found Gold, of which the Souldiers hearing, and supposing that all the
<hi>Iews</hi> had been full of Gold, thorow covetousness of that gain, in one night
killed 2000 of them, and ript up their Bellies; and had not <hi>Titus Caesar,</hi>
by a severe Edict, forbidden these cruel and unheard of slaughters, there had
been many more slain.</p>
            <p>To make an end of this unheard of Famin, I will repeat one memorable
Example out of <hi>Josephus,</hi> of an Outrage which a Mother committed even upon
her own Son. There was a Woman of the Inhabitants beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi>
whose name was <hi>Mary,</hi> of the stock of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and of the Town <hi>Bethezor,</hi>
which signifies, the House of Hysop; she was of a Noble and rich Family, and
amongst others, went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in hopes of Safety, where she was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
oppressed with the misery of this Siege; for as soon as she had brought
all her Riches and Substance into the City, which she had before beyond
<hi>Jordan,</hi> this Famin growing greater and greater upon the Inhabitants, the
Seditious perceiving that this Woman was well furnished both with Riches
and Sustenance, on a suddain set upon her house, despoiled her of her Substance,
took away her Sustenance, and utterly deprived her of all means to live.
She being pricked with the misery and calamity of the Times, saw it little
prevailed to strive, wherefore with Tears, upon her knees, she intreated that
she might have but some small part of that they had taken from her, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her self and her Son with life; but the Seditious gave little ear to her
intreaties: wherefore, being moved to extream anger, she daily cursed, with
contumelious words, those barbarous Villains, that had thus rob'd her of all
her means: but when she saw that neither Anger nor Intreaty could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Mercy, and through the Town not one morsel of food was to be found,
partly prest with an extream necessity, partly with a furious rage, beyond
all nature and compassion, laid violent hands upon her own Son, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an untimely Death more honorable, than that he should live to be
a Prey to the Seditious, or a Slave to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Body of this Infant she Rosted and Eat: the Soldiers of the Town
being prest with hunger, smelling the Meat, supposing, that as in former times,
they should have found plenty, with violence broke in upon her, and look
what she had provided, greedily consumed, and compelled her to fetch the
rest; which she did, and when they were well satisfied, she shewed them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105162:22"/>
the Head and Feet of her Son: which they perceiving, loathing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
of the fact, with dejected countenance departed. This Famin was so
extream, that one measure of grain was worth a Talent, that is 600 Crowns.
But the <hi>Romans</hi> all this while did abound with plenty of all things, and to
vex the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they shewed them the great abundance of their store, for the
neighbouring Provinces sent them supplies.</p>
            <p>After this Famin, there followed an extreme Plague, procured partly
through the stench of the Bodies that lay unburied, partly by the multitude of
Massacres which daily happned, that (as <hi>Egis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> writeth) within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of eleven Weeks, there were carried out by one Gate of the City,
111000 dead Bodies; yet could they not empty the City, but that they
were constrained either to bury them at the Publick charge, or else cast
them over the Walls into the Ditches of the City: which when <hi>Titus</hi> saw,
and that the putrefaction of the Bodies swam upon the brim of the Ditch,
(for it was full with dead carcasses) fetching a deep sigh, and lifting up his
hands to Heaven, he said, God is my witness, this is not my fault, but the
punishment of God upon them.</p>
            <p>The City being thus pestered with Sedition, Famin, Pestilence, and War,
was made now a ready prey to the Enemy: and that they might make a
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nal end of their miseries, <hi>Titus</hi> caused the Engins of Battery to be brought
against the Walls; and upon the first day of the fourth Month (which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to our <hi>Iune</hi>) he took the third Wall, which lay upon the North.
Upon the fourth of <hi>Iune</hi> after, though with great labour, he took the Tower
of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and in it placed a Garison. Upon the seventeenth day of the fourth
Month, which was a Fast to the <hi>Iewes, Iosephus</hi> going up to the top of that
Tower, made an Oration to <hi>Giscalinus</hi> and the rest, to disswade them from their
Rebellion, and cease to oppose the <hi>Romans,</hi> but this little prevailed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the twentieth day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> burnt a part of the Porch of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
towards the North, not far from the Tower of <hi>Antonia,</hi> lest that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
having got that Hold, should with the greater facility have conquered
the Temple also. Two days after, the <hi>Romans</hi> destroyed the whole Porch
with Fire, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> helpt to pull it down with their hands: this was none
of the three Porches, but a Bulwark of the Temple. Upon the 25 of <hi>July,</hi>
the <hi>Jews</hi> filled the Porch towards the West with Pitch and Bittume, and then
made as though they meant to fly and leave the City, which some of the
<hi>Romans</hi> perceiving, without any command of their Captains, put Scaling
Ladders to the Tower, and began to Assault it, but when they were most
busie, the <hi>Jewes</hi> on a suddain put fire to the Pitch, and burnt them most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably;
insomuch as <hi>Titus</hi> pittied them to see their Extremity, although
they were such as did contrary to his command. Upon the last day of
this Month they took the North Gate, which lay towards the rising of the
Sun, and close by the brook <hi>Cedron;</hi> this they burnt down with fire.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105162:23"/>
Upon the third of <hi>August, Titus</hi> commanded to fire the Gate of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that was all covered over with Gold and Silver; by this Gate the <hi>Romans</hi>
made a breach into the Temple, which e're this had been prophaned by
the <hi>Iews:</hi> while this gate was a burning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Iews</hi> stood astonished, and not
one of them resisted the <hi>Romans. Caesar</hi> and all his Army laboured three
days to quench this Fire, after which he called a Council to determine wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he should do with the Temple, it was so rich and sumptuous, that he would
fain have left it as an Ornament for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But the <hi>Iewes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got a little breathing, made new incursions upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which
means they could not determine thereof. The 6th of <hi>August,</hi> the Souldiers of
<hi>Titus,</hi> without command of their Captains, fired the Temple, just upon that
day which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> before time had destroyed it, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
<hi>li. de. Bell. 6. c. 26. 27. Caesar</hi> would fain have saved this Temple
for the sumptuousness of it, and beckoned to his Souldiers to have quencht
the fire, but they, partly prest on with desire of wealth, partly being
prickt on with fury and madness, gave no ear to his speeches, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
most cruel Massacres, without either regard of age or sex: So that the
cries of the Slaughtered, the sound of the <hi>Roman</hi> Trumpets, the fierce resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Seditious, and the Fire furiously burning, represented a most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spectacle: The ground below was covered with dead bodies, many in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
threw themselves into the fire, 6000 were burnt in the same Gate,
whither they fled for refuge, and the Priests most cruelly massacred as they
were in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the mirror of the World being consumed
and spoiled with Fire and Sword.</p>
            <p>After these things, upon the Bridge that passeth from the Temple over the
Valley into the lower Town, <hi>Titus</hi> made a Speech by an Interpreter, to
the two Seditious Captains, gently intreating them to leave off their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and he would spare the City, and commit no more outrages, and
such further requests as they desired should according to reason be granted
them; but if they would not embrace mercy, and cease their violent resistance,
they must expect no manner of compassion, but the very Law of Arms,
This they contemned, and made but a mock of <hi>Caesar</hi> for all his offers;
whereupon, in a great rage, he gave the signal to his Souldiers, and they
went through all the City and set it one fire. The next day they won the
lower City, and with fire and sword consumed the place where the Records
lay, the Court and all the Princely buildings until they came to that state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
house of <hi>Helena,</hi> which stood in the midst of <hi>Acra,</hi> all the houses near
being filled with the Bodies of the Dead, and the streets horribly defiled
with the blood of those that were Slain. Within a short while after <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Giscalinus</hi> was taken alive and committed to prison.</p>
            <p>The inferior City being thus taken and destroyed, about the 16 day of
<hi>August, Caesar</hi> began to build his Engines, and to batter the Walls of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105162:23"/>
City, which within the space of 18 days after, with extream labour and
skill, he laid flat with the Ground, (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith.) And upon the 7th
of <hi>September,</hi> with great facility he conquered the City, the <hi>Iewes</hi> of their
own accord descending from the Towers: and the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi> set upon the Walls
their Ensigns, with a great Acclamation, and wasted all the City with Fire
and Sword, sparing neither Men, Women, nor Children.</p>
            <p>The eighth day of the Month of <hi>September,</hi> the whole City was destroyed,
and not a stone left upon a stone, but laid level with the Ground, only the
three Towers that were built by <hi>Herod,</hi> which were of shining Marble (viz.
<hi>Hippicus, Phaselus,</hi> and <hi>Mariamne</hi>) that future Ages, seeing the excellency
of those Buildings, they might judge of the stateliness of the rest. But these
also were after destroyed by <hi>Adrianus Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There died by the Famin and Pestilence an innumerable number, by
Fire and Sword ten hundred thousand: 2000 were found that either killed
themselves, or one killed another; 7900 were taken Captives; of these, all
the seditious Thieves that accused one another, were slain by <hi>Frontonius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.
Titus</hi> freed many, 7000 were sent into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with extreme labour to
consume and dye; the Properest and most able were reserved for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
many were distributed through the Provinces, some were slain by
the Sword, and by Beasts, for publick Spectacles; and those that were six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of Age and under, together with many other, <hi>Caesar</hi> sold, under
the Crown, at thirty for a silver Penny; that as Christ was sold for thirty
Pence, so thirty of them should be sold for a Penny. With the Riches of
this Town <hi>Caesar</hi> triumphed, rode into <hi>Rome</hi> with two golden Chariots, built
the Temple of Peace, and there put all the Plate which he found in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> After all this, for a full determination of those Evils, the
two seditious Captians, <hi>Iohannes Giscalinus</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> the Son of <hi>Giora,</hi> were
put to most cruel deaths. Thus may we see the grievous punishment of the
obstinate and ambitious, which God permitted to fall upon them for their
Unthankfulness and cruel Tyranny.</p>

            <head>How the City of Jerusalem, after this Destruction by Titus Vespasian, was
utterly beaten down, and defaced by Aelius Adr. Caesar, which
he re-edifying, called it after his own Name, Aelia.</head>
            <p>THE City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being thus laid level with the ground, for the
space of sixty Years lay desolate, a receptacle for Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
a fit place for Wolves and wild Beasts, which resorted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to feed upon the dead Bodies. And now Time consuming their Flesh,
left their Bones and Skulls to lye upon the Earth, as in a Charnel-house.
Thus it continued until one <hi>Benchochab</hi> (which signifies the Son of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105162:24"/>
Stars) born in the Town of <hi>Bethcoron,</hi> not far from <hi>Emaus,</hi> professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the Messiah, or Christ. The <hi>Jewes</hi> supposing this to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of that saying of <hi>Numb. 24. There shall a Star rise up out of Jacob,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
themselves, to the number of many thousands, and followed him,
with great Tyranny and Cruelty spoiling the Holy Land, and through all
the Countrey of <hi>Judaea,</hi> committing many Outrages and Massacres. Thus
they continued for the space of eighteen years, at the end of which time,
<hi>Adrianus Aelianus</hi> the Emperour, hearing of those Insolencies, levied an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and sent them into <hi>Judaea,</hi> under the Government of <hi>Julius Severus,</hi>
who, in a pitch'd field near to <hi>Bethcoron,</hi> and not far from <hi>Emaus,</hi> conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this <hi>Benchochab</hi> or <hi>Pseudo-Messiah,</hi> and with him slew five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Jews, that were deceived by his persuasion. Now when they went to
seek for the Body of this Deceiver amongst the Dead (as saith <hi>Talmudista</hi>)
he was found lying with an horrible Serpent about his neck; intimating
how God rejected him that would seem to imitate his Son; for even as the
Serpent deceived our first Parents, so this <hi>Benchochab</hi> deceived the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
for this cause they called him <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Jews</hi> which in the time of this War were slain, amounted to
500000 men, besides many others that perished by Pestilence and Famin.
This War happened 64 years after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this second Desolation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the command of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
(that there might be a final extirpation of the Antient City of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and that the words of our Saviour might be fulfilled, <hi>Loe, there shall
not be a stone left upon a stone, Mat.</hi> 24.) the Ruins and Foundations thereof
were digged up, the Stones broken in pieces, the Ground left desolate, and
the Mountains are now become barren, and overgrown with Brambles:
And, that the Name thereof might utterly be forgotten, and as it were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Earth, he set up a new Town, not far from the Hill <hi>Gihon,</hi>
and <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where Christ was crucified; which, after he had adorned with
many goodly Buildings, he called it by his own Name, <hi>Aelia.</hi> In the place
of the Temple, he set up a Church, in the honour of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi>
Just in the place where the Holy Altar stood, he erected his own Image, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Marble Pillar, which continued until St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time. At <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
he erected the Image of <hi>Adonis,</hi> and to that he consecrated a Church. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Gates of the City he cut Hogs in Marble, in contempt of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
Then did he abjure them, That they should not come within the Walls of
the City, not set Foot upon the ground near <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This being done,
(as <hi>Dion</hi> saith) he dedicated it to the honour of <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus;</hi> and
only made it free for Christians and such like to be in it. This Town at
this day we call <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> although it be scituated in another place, and
called by another name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:105162:24"/>Future Ages calling the Actions of precedent Times into question, pull'd
a great Contempt upon this Town, and so much the rather, because Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and other Heathenish profaneness was cherish'd within this City. So
that that which a little before was set up in honour of the Emperour. <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
is now grown into Contempt. Wherefore <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great, having command of that Empire, to give some satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Universality, caused those prophane Temples and Idols to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
and in their places erected others. Upon Mount <hi>Golgotha,</hi> the
Church called <hi>Golgothanus:</hi> upon the Mount of Olives one, in the place of
the Ascension of Christ: and <hi>Constantine</hi> her Son richly adorned the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
and over it built a stately Temple, all of Polish't Marble, richly gilt
with Gold, so that to this day it remains as the chief Ornament of the Town.
In this mans time, the <hi>Jews</hi> with great boldness endeavoured to rebuild the
Temple, just in the place where it stood before; at the commandment of the
Emperour they were repelled, and in recompence of their presumption, had
their Eares cut off and their Noses slit, because they had Ears and would
not hear, neither obey the Commandment of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But as the Emperour was Religious, and endeavoured to support Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
so his Successor <hi>Iulianus</hi> was as full of Impiety and Prophaneness;
who, that he might frustrate the Prophecy of our Saviour, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
should never be built again, in contempt caused the <hi>Iews</hi> to assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and with all expedition restore it to its former glory, giving the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of his help to their endeavours. But as they were seriously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
in this Work, of a sudden there came a great Earthquake, and look
what they had built was by that quite overturned; then Fire came out of
the Earth and from Heaven, which destroyed both the Matter and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And that the <hi>Iews</hi> nor any Philosphers might impute it to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Cause, there was seen in the Heavens a Bloody Cross, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pon their
clothes Crosses shining like Stars, which the <hi>Iews</hi> could by no means wipe
off, yet this little prevailed: A second time they attempted, and as before,
a second Earthquake hapned, with a storm of Wind, which came with
such extream violence, that all the stuff which they had heaped together
for this purpose was utterly blown away and destroyed. So that of force
they were constrained to leave off, and acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christ, whom
their Forefathers had Crucified, was the true Messiah. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi>
and <hi>Hierom</hi> report, That nevertheless the <hi>Iews,</hi> even to this day, although
it cost them much money, come yearly to the place where <hi>Ierusale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> stood,
and upon the day of the Destruction thereof, weep over it. Such was their
affection unto this City.</p>
            <p>But these evils were purged with a sudden Invasion (for no crying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
nor prophane Insolencies against God pass unpunished, but that then
or soon after, a just revenge falls upon them) for <hi>Cosro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Persians,</hi> whose Impudency and Impiety was so great, that he would be
worshipped as a God, about the year of our Lord 615, besieged this Town,
took it, and put to death 90000 Christians, carried the Patriarch thereof,
together with many others, away Captive. But <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperor,
to punish him for his Pride and Cruelty, set upon <hi>Persia,</hi> and with Fire
and Sword destroyed the Country not far from <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and went away
with an honourable Victory. <hi>Seroes</hi> also, the only begotten Son of <hi>Cosroes,</hi>
but a little before Invading the Kingdom, kill'd his own Father in Prison,
restored the Patriarch, and the rest of the Captives which his Father had
taken, to <hi>Heraclius:</hi> and about the seventh year after he had Warred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Persia,</hi> he returned to <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with great Pomp.</p>
            <p>Not long after, in the year 637, <hi>Haumar</hi> the Chief Prince of the <hi>Saracens,</hi>
which was the third from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with a great Army afflicted <hi>Syria</hi> and
<hi>Iudaea,</hi> conquered their Countries, and in his Victories used great Tyranny
and cruelty. Within two years after he won <hi>Aelia,</hi> which had maintained a long
and sharp Siege; neither would <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Patriarch give it up, till he
was compelled thereto by extream Famin, and soon after died with Grief.</p>
            <p>Thus the Town continued for the space of 450 years in the hands of the
<hi>Saracens.</hi> Then in the year 1012, <hi>Caliphas</hi> Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> won it, beat
down the Walls, destroyed the Temple which the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> had
built, and made havock of all things. Presently upon this, the <hi>Turks,</hi> which
came out of <hi>Sythia</hi> by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Mountains, won the City, and drave
thence the <hi>Saracens.</hi> Thus we may see that the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> though
they were both of one Religion, yet for the Country of the <hi>Iews</hi> fought one
against another, and compelled the Christians to pay them Tribute for the
fourth part of the City, wherein the Sepulchre of our Lord stood, being
again restored by the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> after the Destruction of <hi>Caliphas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Christians being weary of this Tribute, and of the oppression of these
Infidels, became sutors to Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> the second of that name, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery;
who in the year 1094 assembled a councel at <hi>Clearemont</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
and by the instigation of one <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit, stirred up the hearts of divers
Christian Princes and Lords to make a Croysado; so that 10000 brave and
well mounted Souldiers went into the Holy Land, and for a token of their
War, bore red Crosses upon their Arms.</p>
            <p>In the same year there was a great blazing Star seen in the West, and after
that followed a great Plague for the space of two years through the World:
this nevertheless hindred them not in their Design, but that they went their
intended Journey, won the City of <hi>Aelia</hi> from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> delivered the
Christians from their Bondage and Tax, and chose <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Earl
of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> King thereof, whom they anointed in the Temple of the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre;
but he refused to be Crowned with a Crown of Gold, saying,
That it ill beseemed him to be called King of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (the true King where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105162:25"/>
was Christ) or to sit crowned with Gold, in the place where he was
crowned with Thorns that was the Son of the ever-living God: and then
chose <hi>Arnolphus</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> Patriarch.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>October,</hi> the same year, a blazing Star of a marvellous
bigness appeared towards the South: it seemed to be like a waving Sword,
foreshewing, no doubt, the Destruction of all those that went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
this Earthly <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Immediatly after the Feast of the Nativity
of Christ, all the Christians of the East Countries, upon <hi>Candlemas</hi>-day, came
out of <hi>Syria,</hi> but especially out of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the Temple
of the holy Sepulchre consecrated their Bishops and Choristers, and with one
consent sung <hi>Illuminare Ierusalem.</hi> They took also all the Cities, Castles, and
Villages, and over them set Bishops; created four Principalities, one at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
another at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> a third at <hi>Edissa,</hi> a fourth at <hi>Tripoly.</hi> Also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

and <hi>Ascalon.</hi> All these were appointed to pay Tribute to the King of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
All this was done in the year of our Lord, 1099.</p>
            <p>No sooner were these News published to the World, but there was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Croysado through all <hi>Christendom,</hi> for the conquering and winning
of the rest of the Holy Land, but before they could get thither, they were
either slain by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and other Nations, or else died through Famin
and Thirst: so that in them was fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Zacharias, cap.</hi> 12. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where it is said, <hi>It shall happen that I will make</hi> Jerusalem <hi>an heavy stone
for all People: all they that lift it up shall be torn, though all the People of the
Earth be gathered together against it.</hi> And verse 9. <hi>And in that day will I
seek to destroy all Nations that come against</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>This year 1100 died <hi>Godfrey</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of a Fever, upon the
Eighteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> when he had reigned scarce a year, and was buried
in the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him succeeded his Brother <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the first of that name, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
King of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This Man reigned Eighteen years in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and being overcom by <hi>Caliphas</hi> Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after the loss of thirteen
thousand Christians, he had much ado to escape with life. Within a short
time after he died without Issue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baldwin</hi> the second succeded his Uncle, and was the third King of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
He began his reign <hi>Anno</hi> 1118. This man overcame the <hi>Turks:</hi> and the
King of <hi>Damascus</hi> had Issue only one daughter named <hi>Milesent,</hi> whom he
married to the Earl of <hi>Angiers,</hi> and gave with her the Kingdom of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and died without heir Male, in the year 1131.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fulco,</hi> in right of his Wife, succeeded his Father in Law, and was the fourth
King of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This <hi>Fulco</hi> was Brother to the King of <hi>England,</hi> he
Reigned thirteen years, fought many worthy Battels against the <hi>Turks,</hi> put
3000 of their men to the Sword, took many of them Prisoners, and carried
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105162:26"/>
them to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> After that, as he was hunting the Hare in <hi>Acon,</hi> riding
speedily, he fell from his Horse, and was sorely bruised, whereof he died,
and left two Sons called <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Almerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baldwin</hi> the third was the fifth King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and succeeded his Father,
he won the City of <hi>Ascalon,</hi> he rebuilt the Town of <hi>Boza,</hi> (which had been
destroyed) placed there certain Knights Templers; he lost the City of
<hi>Edissa</hi> to the <hi>Saracens,</hi> where many Christians were cruely slain. And
having reigned nineteen years, he died without Issue.</p>
            <p>After him succeeded his Brother <hi>Almerick,</hi> who was the sixth King of
<hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In the time of this King, the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> gave a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
to the Knights Templers; which he seeking to revenge, invaded
<hi>Egypt</hi> with a great Army, besieged the great City of <hi>Alcair,</hi> but to small
purpose; wherefore returning back to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he shortly after died, when
he had reigned twelve years: he left behind him three children, a Son called
<hi>Baldwin,</hi> and two daughters, <hi>Sibella</hi> and <hi>Isabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth succeeded his Father, and was the seventh King of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
who abusing his government, was struck with a Leprosie, with the
contagion of which disease he died miserably in the twenty fifth year of his
Age, having reigned thirteen years. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the fifth of that name, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son of his Sister <hi>Sibil,</hi> by his consent was chosen his Successor,
a youth of nine years old, his Fathers name was <hi>William Mountferrat,</hi> Earl
of <hi>March,</hi> who dying, his Mother married one <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lusignan,</hi> to whom
<hi>Baldwin</hi> committed the protection of the Kingdom, and of his young Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
till he came to mans estate. But this young man, within seven years
after the Death of his Uncle, died sitting at his Table, not without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of Poyson. <hi>Guy</hi> his Protector, by the perswasion of his Wife, and at
the Instigation of the <hi>Jerosolimits,</hi> took upon him the Government; But
<hi>Raimond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tripoly</hi> was his great adversary, for that <hi>Baldwin</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> for
his exceeding pride, at the Instigation of that <hi>Guy,</hi> had displaced him of all
his Offices and Titles in the Commonwealth. These two striving for the
Kingdom, it hapned that <hi>Guy</hi> was charged with his Kinsmans death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which pretence <hi>Raymond</hi> made War against him. During these troubles,
<hi>Saladine</hi> Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> taking advantage of this opportunity, made War
upon them both, and with great facility conquered the Kingdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this year 1187, there hapned so great an Eclipse of the Sun, that at
Noon day the Stars were plainly to be seen. Soon after this, <hi>Raimond</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi>
were both taken Prisoners, and thirty thousand Christians cruelly put to
the Sword. After this, the <hi>Saracens</hi> sacked the Town, threw the Bells out
of the Steeples, made Stables of the Churches; only the Temple on Mount
<hi>Golgotha</hi> stood untouch'd: for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> honour Christ as a
great Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:105162:26"/>And thus the new Kingdom of the Christians in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> ended, which
was upon the second day of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1187, after it had continued
in their possession 88 years. During the continuance of this Kingdom, there
were many horrible Visions, and strange Signs and Wonders seen both in
Heaven, on Earth, and in the Air; foreshewing (no doubt) that God was
not well pleased with their actions, which sought to restore that Kingdom
of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For, <hi>My Kingdom</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is not of this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although after that, there were many Kings that by all possible
means endeavoured to recover and restore the same, and for that purpose
have leavied many great Armies, and undertaken many tedious Journies;
yet all their councels and determinations came to nothing, so that God, so
often as they undertook any such Expedition, either stayed their Armies,
oppressed them with War, or else plagued them with Famin, in such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
measure, that with very hunger they have been constrained to
eat their Horses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick Barbarossus</hi> may be an Example of these Calamities; who
with a great Army making an Expedition to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as he was travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
through <hi>Asia minor,</hi> his Horse started, and flung him into the River,
where he died miserably e're he could be saved. Many other Princes besides,
in the like enterprise came to the like ends; for they were either destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with the loss of thousands of their men cruely slain,
or utterly destroyed with unnatural Diseases or untimely Deaths.</p>
            <p>Now when the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> the second of that name, had besieged
and brought to great misery the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Knights Templers
had done the like to <hi>Damieta; Corderio</hi> the Sultans Son beat down the Walls
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and had it not been for the great lamentations and earnest
Entreaties of the Christians, he would have destroyed the City; but for
their sakes he left standing <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, and the Temple of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sepulchre; for at this time Christians inhabit in them.</p>
            <p>Within a while after, about the Year 1228. <hi>Frederick,</hi> the second of that
Name, Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> went to the Holy Land with a great Army,
and came to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Acon,</hi> where staying a while, he
made a League with the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for ten years, regained <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
without drawing Sword, and was there crowned in the Year 1229. keeping
at that time in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Royal <hi>Easter.</hi> This man fortified the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with a Garrison, rebuilt <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Ioppa,</hi> and so returned into
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1246, <hi>Cassanus</hi> King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> being persuaded by the
Sultan, with a great Army invaded <hi>Iudaea,</hi> won <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> caused the
Christians to be cruelly slain, beat down the Holy Sepulchre even to small
pieces, and left but little standing. It was after this destroyed by <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi>
King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the second of that Name, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105162:27"/>
of the <hi>Turks.</hi> But the <hi>Monks</hi> had leave to build up the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
again, for the which, they payed to the Sultan or his Deputy a yearly
Tribute.</p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 1516, <hi>Selymus</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> about the
twenty fourth day of <hi>August,</hi> near to <hi>Damascus,</hi> overcame <hi>Campson Gaurus</hi>
Sultan of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in a cruel War, and put to death many thousands of his
Men; and the Sultan himself seeking to save his Life by Flight, was mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
slain. This <hi>Selymus</hi> conquered the Holy Land, <hi>Syria, Damascus,</hi> and
all the Countries thereabouts; and as he went through <hi>Iudaea,</hi> leaving his
Army at <hi>Gaza,</hi> with a few of his Souldiers he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that he
might see with his Eyes that place which was made so famous by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Writers, and was so often mentioned in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But when he came, he found nothing but a ruinate and waste place,
barren and rude to look upon, inhabited by a few poor Christians, and
they also held in great Contempt and Bondage, paying a great Tribute
to the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for their Liberty and holy Sepulchre, as <hi>P. Iovius</hi>
writeth. But after that <hi>Selymus</hi> in that place had done his Offerings
and Sacrifices to his God <hi>Mahomet,</hi> seeing the Priests and Christians
press'd with extream Poverty, out of his singular Mercy and Compassion,
gave them a large and sumptuous Gift, when he had stayed but one day
and one night in the Town. The next morning before day he went
with all expedition to his Army at <hi>Gaza,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
where he besieged the great and famous City <hi>Alcaire,</hi> and in the year 1517.
took it, conquered all the Country, utterly extirpated the Sultan, and went
away with an honourable Victory and rich Booty. From this year even
till now, the Town of <hi>Aelia</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is under the Jurisdiction of the
<hi>Turks.</hi> Thus may we see how often, and with what miserable Calamities
this City hath been afflicted, even since the first Destruction by <hi>Vespasian;</hi>
which makes evident the great Judgment of God not only upon the <hi>Iews,</hi>
but also upon the Earth where they inhabited, for their Infidelity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
Cruelty.</p>

            <p>THE former Incursions and common Desolations leaving this Town
ruined and spoiled for want of Inhabitants, it became a Desart and
forsaken place; only some few Christians, either out of the zeal of
Religion, or for vulgar Ostentation, to shew that there had been
a Town, dwelt there: and thus it continued until the year 1542. at which
time, <hi>Solyman</hi> the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> either in respect of the strength of the place,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105162:27"/>
or in hope of profit, or else to get himself a Name, with great Cost
and Labour re-edified it, set up many stately Buildings and sumptuous
Houses, beautified it with two costly Temples, the one the Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and the other the holy Sepulchre; enlarged the extent thereof, and
seated it upon high Hills. After all this, compass'd it about with a spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and thick Wall, and upon that placed many strong and stately Towers,
wherein there stands eight Gates, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fish Gate, the old Gate, S. <hi>Stephens</hi>
Gate, (so called, because they say S. <hi>Stephen</hi> went out by that Gate when he
was stoned) the Angle Gate, the Dung Gate, the Sheep Gate, the Golden and
Fountain Gates. Thus the ancient City, and that which the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi>
built, being both destroyed, in another place is set up again. So that between
both, this new City standeth, and the first City begins to be again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre.</head>
               <p>THIS Temple lieth upon the West within this new Town, at first fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built by the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> but destroyed by <hi>Caliphas</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
of <hi>Egypt:</hi> then by the Emperours of <hi>Constantinople</hi> rebuilt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
to this day. It is round in the proportion, adorned with seventy
nine Pillars thirty foot long; the Wideness, by the Diameter (besides the
Pillars) is seventy three Feet, leaded above, and upon the top of the Roof
standeth a Lanthorn, by which the Light cometh in: This Lanthorn is
very curiously glazed. In the middle standeth the holy Sepulchre. To this
joyneth the Church in Mount <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and serveth instead of a Quire. It
standeth something lower, but all under one Roof. The place where the
holy Sepulchre standeth is four square, eight foot long, and eight broad,
hewn out of a Rock, and covered with Marble; there is a little door in the
East part of it very low, by which men go into it, and within that the
Sepulchre it self standeth upon the North side, made of gray Marble, 3 hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
high, and 8 foot long. There are no Windows for light to come to it,
but over there hangeth continually nine Lamps burning, whereby it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Light. The Vault of this Sepulchre is divided with a Wall; the
outward is both of the same Proportion and Length as the inward, but that
which is without seemeth to be an Entry to the inner Cave where Christ
was buried: and there (as some say) even to this day is found a piece of
the Stone which the Angel rolled from the Grave before the Resurrection;
the other part of the Stone (howsoever it came there) lyes upon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
But some think that the <hi>Armenians</hi> carried it thither, because upon it they
have built an Altar. In this inner Cave there hangs nine Lamps to give light
unto them that enter in by the East; so that in the inner and outer Vault
there standeth eighteen Lamps. The Mount whereon Christ was crucified
seemeth to stand upon a Rock of Stone, whitish and something blushing.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105162:28"/>
It is distant from the Holy Sepulchre a hundred and thirty foot. The
place where the Cross stood was an hard Rock, eighteen steps in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and answereth to nine and twenty feet. The hole where the Cross
stood is about the roundness of a mans head in Latitude; and if a man
might believe the Monks thereabouts, they say also, that in that place is
to be seen the colour of our Saviours Blood even to this day. Upon the
left hand of this there stands an Altar made of Marble, and over that a
sumptuous Chappel, paved, and covered with polish'd Marble, gilt and
adorned with refulgent Gold, the Walls whereof are very curiously
wrought and gilded. In the Church, upon Mount <hi>Golgotha,</hi> they also shew
part of a Pillar naturally black, speck'd with red Spots, where they say
Christ was whip'd, and make the Vulgar believe that these Specks are the
drops of Blood that fell from him. The other part of this Column was
carried to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as it was thought. In this Church, <hi>Godfrey,</hi> first
Christian King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the rest of his Successors lie buried.</p>

               <head>Of the Temple of Solomon, as it is at this day.</head>
               <p>THIS Temple lieth towards the East, and was built by the Christians
just in the same place where the former Temple stood, at the time
when the City was rebuilt and enlarged. The body thereof is very high
and spatious, and built of polish'd Marble, adorned with most exquisite
and curious Workmanship, very artificial and glorious both within and
without, insomuch that the polished Stones cast a singular beautiful and
resplendent Lustre. Above it is covered with Lead, and was built up at
the cost and labour of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> in the Roof whereof, the <hi>Turks</hi> place
an half Moon, as they usually do in all such Churches wherein they come
and have Authority. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> have this Temple in great
Reverence and Devotion, they adorn it (according to their Custom) with
divers artificial Pictures and Emblems. They will suffer no Christians
to enter into it, nor any Jews, upon pain of Death. And if it happens
that at any time they go into it, they first wash themselves with Water
very clean, then put off their Hose and Shoos, and so go bare-foot. This
Temple they call the holy Rock, and in the body thereof there hangeth
seven hundred Lamps, which burn Night and Day. In the midst hereof
there standeth a certain little Rock, every where indented with Iron, near
to which, not any of the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> dare to approach or touch,
although there come many very far to visit it: for they believe that there
were many memorable and worthy things done in that Rock: they think
that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> the first Priest of the great God, offered Bread and Wine
upon it, <hi>Genes.</hi> 14. and that here the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> saw the Ladder which
reached from Heaven to Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. which indeed hapned not in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
but in <hi>Bethel,</hi> as the Scriptures witness. Further they believe, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105162:28"/>
upon this Stone <hi>David</hi> saw the Angel of the Lord standing with a shaken
Sword when he struck the City with the Pestilence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and that
the Priests of the old Testament offered upon this stone their Sacrifices to
the Lord, which were devoured with Fire from Heaven. All which things
do utterly differ from holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Jews also are of Opinion, That the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> about the time
of the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in this Stone hid the Ark of the Covenant,
until such time as the Lord brought the People back again from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:
which is contrary also to the Books of the holy Scripture; for,
2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 2. it is said, it was hid in the Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> stood
when he saw the whole Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Also the <hi>Turks</hi> say, that Christ
sate upon this stone when <hi>Simeon</hi> took him in his arms and blessed him.
Here also he sate in the midst of the Doctors when he was but twelve
years of Age, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. which also differeth from the Scripture; for this was
not the Body of the Temple, but in the middle Court, or <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch,
which sometimes was taken for the Temple, because it joyned to it. And
divers Circumstances of the Scripture do seem to make this evident, because
here Christ taught, and here the People usually met together, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.</p>
               <p>About the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> there is a fair Plain, much resembling our
Church-yards, all paved with marble stone. To this there is adjoyning a
fair Church covered with Lead, and was somtimes called <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch;
but after the Christians had won <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they gave it the Name of
St. <hi>Maries.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> keeps burning in this daily eight hundred Lamps,
and it is much greater than that of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. The Sultan of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
also about an hundred years before, built a little Church or Moscho close
by <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, wherein are continually burning eighty eight Lamps.
There is a Vault under the Temple of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of such
an extraordinary Greatness, that six hundred Horse may easily be placed
in it. And thus we may see the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> and City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
not only to be in the power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> but also prophaned with the
blasphemous Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And also we may here behold the
Abomination of Desolation standing in the holy place, where sometime
was the Ark of the Covenant, <hi>Dan. 9. Mat.</hi> 24. and the Prophecy of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>

of <hi>Sion,</hi> with the Sepulchre of <hi>David,</hi> fell down, and were utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.
Further, all true Historians do write, That <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour did
so much deface the City, that he left not a stone standing upon a stone; nay,
not a whole stone, but all were broken into small pieces; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Pilgrims are so mad and blind, that they go thither with great
pains to seek those holy Places, where, when they come, with the expence

there shall not be a stone left upon a stone, which shall not be broken to pieces.</hi>
And <hi>Borchardus</hi> the Monk saith, That the <hi>Romans</hi> caused the Temple and
other Princely Buildings, together with the Mountains, to be thrown down,
and cast into the Vallies, with which being filled, there remaineth not so
much as an Emblem of the old City. From whence may evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
That those Places which are now shewn to Pilgrims by the Monks of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> are merely suborned and feigned, on purpose to deceive them,
and get their money. They are very simple therefore that go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
to seek their Salvation in such places. And as for the Sepulchre (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
the <hi>Tartars</hi> beat it all in pieces; so that this Monument of our Lord
is not to be found upon the Earth. Wherefore our Saviour Christ is no

               <p>IN and about the Church which is built over the holy Sepulchre, upon
Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> there are at this day many of divers Nations and
Countreys which inhabit, of divers Opinions and Religions. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they differ in material Points of their Faith, yet would they be all
Christians: of which number, there are some <hi>Latines, Greeks, Abissines, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,
Gregorians, Nestorians, Surians,</hi> and <hi>Iacobins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Latines</hi> for the most part are such as we call <hi>Franciscan</hi> Monks, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants,
or Friars. These have the keeping of the holy Sepulchre, and look
to it very diligently; where sometimes they make a certain number of
Knights of the Noble Order of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Templers, with many Ceremonies
and great Solemnities. These Knights are girt with a Sword all gilt, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a red Velvet girdle; a Chain of gold is put upon them worth about
an hundred <hi>Hungarian</hi> Duckats, at the end whereof hangs a <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105162:29"/>
Cross of gold. This kind of Cross also they are permitted to wear upon
their Arms and Cloaths; then have they a pair of gilt Spurs with Velvet
tyings. But before they are admitted into this Order, they must swear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the holy Sepulchre to maintain and defend the Doctrine of the Pope.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Graecians</hi> that are there be also Monks, and do inhabit within the
Temple of the holy Sepulchre; but they have the keeping of the place
where our Saviour Christ was crucified, and differ from the <hi>Romanists.</hi> For
they believe first, That the holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and
not the Son. Secondly, they give the Sacraments in both kinds. Thirdly,
they hold not the Pope to be Head of the Church. Fourthly, they deny
Purgatory and Prayer for the dead. Fifthly, they sing Mass in their own
Language, that every man may understand it, but they observe seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
as the <hi>Romanists</hi> do. They teach men to pray to, and call upon
Saints; they yearly observe two strict fasting days, and eat no Flesh upon
Saturdays.</p>
               <p>The rest of the <hi>Graecians</hi> that are through the East parts, leave Marriage
free, as well for the Clergy as Laity, and condemn the Latin Priests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they marry not. They allow no graven Images in their Churches,
but in some places of the Churches they have fair painted Pictures hanging.
They approve not the Pope, but have a Patriarch for their high Bishop,

on the East side of the Church door: They also approve not the Pope, but
allow Priests to marry, and give the Sacrament in both kinds; yet there
are many Sects and Opinions among them, forbearing those Meats forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

of the Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> although they have lost their Genealogies,

of these; for almost all the <hi>Iews</hi> do very superstitiously celebrate the

which signifies to divide.</p>
               <p>There are also others in these our times that are Jews too, but they are
called Samaritans, which only approve of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, and reject the
rest of the Scriptures and Prophets. These are so called from Keeping; for
this word <hi>Schamar</hi> properly signifies to preserve or keep a Speech in heart,
and hath therefore a certain Congruity and Consonance with the Latin
word <hi>Sermo:</hi> so that <hi>Schamar</hi> in Hebrew, and <hi>Sermo</hi> in Latin, are much
what of one signification.</p>
               <p>But all the Jews, except the Sadducees, have one Faith; they think they may
fulfill the Commandments, and by their own works be justified and purchase
eternal Life. They deny the Trinity and Christ, and do believe that their
<hi>Messias</hi> is yet to come, and shall bring them back again into the Land of
Promise.</p>

from a tumultuous Confusion: for <hi>Hamah</hi> signifies <hi>tumultuatus est;</hi> he hath been
tumultuous; and <hi>Hamam, tumultuando disturbavit,</hi> he divided by Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
From hence <hi>Maimo</hi> signifies <hi>tumultuor,</hi> a Contender, and <hi>Maiomai,

ambitious (for he was naturally proud, wrathful, a Thief, a Whore-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
a most impudent Adulterer; and wheresoever he came made havock of

               <p>That he might the better persuade men to embrace and believe these his
Lies and blasphemous Doctrines, he very cunningly seemed to confirm
them with many false and feigned Miracles: and amongst the rest this was
one: Having taught a white Dove to put Corn in his Ear, whilst he was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105162:32"/>
preaching to the People, it chanced she came and sat upon his Shoulder,
and putting her Bill into his Ear, according to her accustomed manner, he
persuaded the People that it was the Spirit of God, which delivered him
the words of the Law. A Bull also, taught after the same manner, at his
Voice came before him, and kneeling down did him reverence, with the
<hi>Alcoran</hi> tied upon his horns; which he affirmed was come from Heaven
and brought that new Law. Then did he make divers horns of gold and
silver, and filling them full of Milk hid them in the Earth; after which, in
a great assembly he caused the same places to be opened, and told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that these signified plenty and abundance to all such as kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that Law; but the Violaters thereof should be punished with Death:
together with many other such like idle and foolish Miracles, (which would
be too tedious to recite) that he might make the People believe that it came
from God. And being afflicted with the Falling Sickness, gave it out, that
then the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> told him the Law, making this likewise a means to
further his designs; but after, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the eighth of <hi>Iune, Anno Dom.</hi> 632.

Wherefore it may be concluded, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was only a part of Paradise,
not Paradise it self; and that this River was one of the Rivers, not all,
the Streams of which River, at some times of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Solstice, when the Sun is near the Dog-star, begins to swell and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
the Banks, by reason of the melting of the Snow which lies upon the
Mountains of the Moon, and so drown all the places near unto it, through
the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> leaving behind it certain Slime and Mud, by which it
comes to pass that the Country is very fruitful, and serves them instead of
Rain, at which time of the Year (for this happens once every year) the
People and Inhabitants of the Country retire themselves to their Towns,

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105162:34"/>
from one place to another, because all their Passages and Foot-paths are then
drowned with Waters. There are many pretty Observations which the
People of <hi>Egypt</hi> were wont to take notice of in the rising of this Water, for
they had certain Staves whereby they measured the depth of it; if it rose
but to twelve Cubits (which is six yards in height, they then stood in fear
of great Famine, so also if it was but thirteen, for then the Water was not
deep enough to make the ground fertile; but if it rose to fourteen or fifteen,
then they were in great hope, and did not doubt of a fruitful Year; and
if to sixteen, they then greatly rejoyced at their Prosperity, and kept Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
and Feasts, and were assured that the succeeding year would be very
plentiful; but if it rose above, they laid aside all signs of Joy, and lived
very sparingly, and with great Sorrow; this great Inundation of Waters
fore-shewing Scarcity, and Want, and Famine, and Pestilence, and Death.
And thus <hi>Nilus</hi> yearly, every year is to them instead of Rain, for <hi>Egypt</hi>
is without Rain.</p>
               <p>In Autumn, at such time as the Sun going out of the last face of <hi>Libra,</hi>
entreth into <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the Waters of <hi>Nilus,</hi> by little and little, retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into their Banks, and the Earth becomes quite uncovered of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
about which time, the Country being exceeding hot, the Earth is
presently made dry in all those places, so that in the Month of <hi>October</hi> they
may both till and sow their Land. In this River the Crocodile and the
Ichneumo breed, of the nature of which two, you may sufficiently read in
<hi>Gesner.</hi> There also breeds the Pelican, of which St. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, there are
two kinds, one that lives upon the Water, another that lives upon the
Land: these Birds, as some affirm, kill their young ones upon their Beak,
and then leave them lying in their Nest for three days; at the end of
which time, the Female grievously wounds her self upon the Breast, and
pouring her Blood upon her young ones, revives them again. This Bird
may very well be a type and figure of our Blessed Saviour, who shedding
his precious Blood upon the Cross for our Sins, after the third day rose
again, and that he might restore us to Life that be dead in Sin, poureth out
his Blood upon us, whereby we are made capable of Eternal Life.</p>

               <head>The Description of the Towns and Places where he travelled:
and first of Sodom.</head>
               <p>THE Cities that were destroyed with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven,
were four in number, that is, <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah, Adama,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi>
lying 24 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> South-eastward, where now the Dead Sea runs.
The fifth was the City <hi>Bela,</hi> called also <hi>Zoar,</hi> which was spared for <hi>Lot</hi>'s
sake, and distant from <hi>Sodom</hi> two miles. This, <hi>Lot</hi> accounted but a little
City; but there are that say it was a very spacious and Princely place, near
to which his Wife for her Disobedience was turned into a Pillar of Salt, and
not far off he committed Incest with his two Daughters, And although <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
be of opinion, that that also within a while after was burnt, yet this
cannot be certainly proved, especially because it remaineth even to this day,
scituated both in the ancient place, and called by the ancient Name; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
some new City hath been lately built in the same place, and is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
after that name, which I cannot think to be true. <hi>Sodamah</hi> signifieth a
Mystery; <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> a Faggot of Thorns; <hi>Adamah,</hi> Red Earth; <hi>Zeboim,</hi>
Fertile and Pleasant; <hi>Zoar,</hi> the burning of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was called <hi>Baela.</hi> It is the received Opinion, that the Country wherein these
five rich and opulent Cities stood was called <hi>Pentapolis.</hi>

               <p>IN the very same place where these Cities were burnt and destroyed, there
is at this day to be seen a Lake about 36 Miles long, and in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

six, in others eight, and twelve miles over. It boileth with Pitch and
Brimstone, and in some places passeth by the name of the Salt Sea, and in
others, the dead Sea, because of the noisome and venomous Air that riseth
out of it, insomuch as the very Birds that fly over it fall down dead; and
if a Beast do but drink of it mix'd with Water, it makes him incurably sick.
It is of a wonderful nature, for whatsoever heavy thing you fling into it will
not sink, but swim upon the top, be it either Iron, Lead, Copper, or any
other weighty matter: of which <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour having notice, to
make experience of what he had heard, made a Journey of purpose to see
it, and with him took certain condemned men, who for their Offences had
deserved Death; these he manacled, and where he thought it to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
caused them to be thrown in; but they rose up again with such violence
as if some Storm or Tempest had sent them up. The Water thereof chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
three times a day, and shineth against the Sun with divers colours, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Fire and great Cakes of Pitch much resembling Bulls without heads,
and of that quantity. This Pitch is good for divers things, as to calk Ships,
to lay upon Cables, and to use in Medicines; wherefore such as come to
this Sea and know the nature of it, have certain Skifs and Instruments
wherewith they draw these Cakes of Pitch to their Ships, to which it clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
so fast, it being naturally tough, that being brought to Land they
cannot get it off again but by the help of Urine. Upon the Banks thereof
grow Trees that bear fruit of divers kinds, as Apples, and such like; which
are fair and pleasant to the Eye, but if you either touch or open them you
shall find nothing but Dust.</p>

                  <hi>Brittenbacchus</hi> saith, In this place the Serpent <hi>Tyrus</hi> (whereof they use to
make Treacle) is found. It is a little Serpent about half a Cubit long, and
a Finger thick, being of divers colours, and is so venomous, that where it
biteth there is no remedy, unless by cutting off the Member: the Head of
it is rough and hairy, and there seemeth to lye upon the Tongue of it, if it
be angry, a fiery flame. The same Author saith, that a little from <hi>Zoar,</hi>
between this Lake and the Mountains of <hi>Engedi,</hi> the Pillar whereinto <hi>Lot</hi>'s
Wife was turned, is yet to be seen shining like Salt. The furthest part of

after his name were called <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> some eighty miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the South. These People were excellent Souldiers, and of noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
their principal delight was shooting, and therein they exceeded others,
living for the most part by Hunting and Pillage, and so they continue to
this day. The <hi>Saracens,</hi> who likewise had their abiding in those Parts, were

               <p>
                  <hi>ISaac</hi> being young, went with his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Berzeba</hi> to Mount
<hi>Moriah,</hi> where his Father would have offered him unto God, as the
Lord commanded him, which is forty miles, <hi>Genes.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>2. From thence with his Father he returned again to <hi>Berzeba,</hi> which
is forty miles.</p>
               <p>3. From <hi>Berzeba</hi> he travelled with his Father to <hi>Hebron,</hi> by the Plain of
<hi>Mamre,</hi> which is 16 miles.</p>
               <p>4. From the Plain of <hi>Mamre, Isaac</hi> travelled Southward, to the Fountain
of Life, which is 16 miles, and there he dwelt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>5. From thence he returned back again to his Fathers Burial, who was
laid in that double Cave in <hi>Mamre,</hi> which is 16 miles.</p>
               <p>6. From thence he returned back again to the Well of Life, where he
dwelt; 16 miles.</p>
               <p>7. From the Fountain of Life, he went to <hi>Gerar,</hi> which is eight miles;
where <hi>Abimelech</hi> seeing the Beauty of his Wife <hi>Rebecca,</hi> would have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
her, and for fear, she told him that she was his Sister, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>8. From <hi>Gerar, Isaac</hi> went Westward to the Valley of <hi>Gerar,</hi> which is
eight miles, and there he caused the Well to be digged up again, which
the Inhabitants had stopped up, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>9. From thence he went to <hi>Beersaba,</hi> which is four miles; where the same
Night the Lord appeared unto him, and said, <hi>I am the God of thy Father
Abraham, fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless and multiply thy seed for

               <p>10. From <hi>Beersaba</hi> he returned again to <hi>Hebron</hi> by the Plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi>

               <head>The typical signification of Isaac.</head>
               <p>THE Name of <hi>Isaac</hi> is derived from Laughter; for <hi>Zakah</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is
as much as <hi>quod risit</hi> is in <hi>Latin,</hi> which signifieth that he laughed; and
from hence <hi>Zechock</hi> signifies a <hi>Laughter,</hi> and <hi>Isaac, Mirth,</hi> or <hi>one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
with Mirth.</hi> This Name was given to him by God before his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. There were seven that were named by God before their
Nativity, <hi>viz. Ishmael, Gen. 16. Isaac, Gen. 17. Cores</hi> or <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the
<hi>Persians, Esa. 44. Sampson, Iudg. 13. Iosia</hi> King of <hi>Iuda, 1 King. 13. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the Son of God, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. of whom <hi>Isaac</hi> was a notable
Type. For Christ is our true rejoycing, the Laughter, Mirth, and Delight
of the whole Church of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the day of the Nativity of
<hi>Isaac</hi> made a great Feast, to which, no doubt, he called many godly men,
and perhaps some of the Patriarchs: for there was then living <hi>Sarag, Arpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xad,
Salah, Heber, Thamar,</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> who also had a
certain knowledge of Gods promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that of the seed of <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi>
should come the Saviour of the World.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Abraham</hi> when he would have offered his Son unto the Lord,
carried the Fire and the Sword, but <hi>Isaac</hi> the Wood upon which he should
be slain and burned, (O miserable sight, especially to a Father, to see his
only Son and Heir, which was miraculously begotten, even then when he
was without hope of Issue, burnt to Ashes before his Face! This was on
Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> a little from <hi>Salem</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) even so our Saviour
Christ, for the sins that man commits and carries about him, bore upon his
Shoulders the wooden Cross, whereupon he was offered an acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to his Father, that so by his Mediation and Satisfaction we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Pardon for them: and this was likewise done upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi>
a little from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And as the Lord provided another Sacrifice for
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that so he might save his Son, which was a Ram tied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in Thorns; so God provided a Sacrifice for the Salvation of the
World, even Jesus Christ our Mediator, who is that immaculate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lamb of God; whose Head being crowned with Thorns, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Cross, by his precious Death opened unto us the door of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, and made us capable of everlasting Happiness, <hi>Iohn 19. 1 Peter</hi> 1.
Such was the love of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Father, unto God, such the love of God,
a Father, unto man, that they spared not their only Sons, the one typically
to represent the other. The other, that is, the only begotten Son of God,
to dye effectually for <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and all Mankind, <hi>Ioh. 3. Gen.</hi> 22.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cending upon it, and because there the
Lord renewed the Covenant with him concerning his Seed, and the coming
of Christ; he therefore called it <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterward, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> having unlawfully usurp'd the Kingdom of <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
caused a Calf to be set up there; for which cause, it was then called
<hi>Bethaven,</hi> which signifieth <hi>the house of Sin and abominable Offence. Vatablus</hi>
is of opinion, that there are two <hi>Bethels,</hi> one in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the
other in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> both not far from <hi>Hay:</hi> but if this should
be granted, then these two Towns should stand within two miles one of
the other, which seemeth very absurd; therefore I dare boldly affirm, that
there was but one <hi>Bethel,</hi> which stood upon the borders of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> both Tribes bordering upon the South-side of the Town of <hi>Luz,
Josh.</hi> 16. and 18.</p>
               <p>This Town of <hi>Bethel</hi> was at first in the Suburbs of <hi>Luz,</hi> until the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Tribes; for then both these Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that place, so much increased this Town, that they became both one
City, and so were called <hi>Bethel, Ie.</hi> 28. and 25. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. and 18.</p>
               <p>From hence there is a two-fold Mystery to be apprehended: the first, of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> whose sleeping in this place upon a Stone, caused this City or Town
to be built, and to retain the name of <hi>Bethel,</hi> that is, <hi>The house of God.</hi> So
whosoever seeks to have eternal Life, must rest upon that corner stone
Christ Jesus, the Son of the everliving God, and by faith be incorporated
into the Church, which is the House of God, of which Christ (the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord) is both King and Priest for ever. Secondly, as <hi>Jacob</hi> rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this corner Stone, saw the Angels ascending and descending from
Heaven unto Earth, so by this Incorporation into the body of the Church
(of which Christ is the Head) by Faith and Baptism, our Souls are made
capable to ascend into that heavenly Tabernacle, which he hath prepared
for all those that believe: according to that in <hi>John 14. I am the way, the
truth, and the life, no Man cometh unto the Father but by me only.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is assured of this Ladder (that reacheth from Heaven unto Earth)
may well say with <hi>Iacob,</hi> Surely the Lord Jesus Christ is in this place; here
is nothing but the House of God, and here is the Gate of Heaven; as
Christ himself testifieth in the tenth of <hi>Iohn, I am the door, and whosoever
entreth not by me, &amp;c.</hi> So that Christ is the Head of his Church, the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> and brought forth Priests, Levites, Kings, and Warlike
Princes, by which the People of the Jews became oppressed and wearied

civility and humility of <hi>Iacob</hi> towards him, is worthy observation.
For he first sent to meet him, then he did him obedience to the ground
seven several times, and so saluted him, saying, Lo, these are the Children

be gathered, That it becometh every man (if it be possible) to win his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

them when they went out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> taking opportunity of the place: for they
having on either side of them a high Mountain, before them the Red Sea, and
behind them a cruel and mighty Tyrant, to the judgment of man, had no
means to escape. But the Lord, to express the mightiness of his Power, and
that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> might know who it was that delivered them, made
them a Passage, and led them under the conduct of <hi>Moses</hi> through the Red

               <p>THE Red Sea is 160 miles from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Southward, betwixt, <hi>Arabia</hi>
and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and, as some are of opinion, it taketh the name of the red
Scales that grow therein, wherefore in Scripture it is also called the Scaly Sea.
Some say it taketh the name from red Sand that lies upon the shore, cast
up by the Sea. Others say, that the redness thereof hapneth because of the
shadow cast into the Water by the Mountains thereabout. The Vulgar
are of opinion, that it is naturally red by reason of the Water; but it is not so
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105162:49"/>
because it is like the water of of the Ocean, clear and salt. <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 16. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
that this Sea was so called from <hi>Erithraea,</hi> and thence <hi>Mare Arithraeum;</hi> because the word <hi>Erithraeum</hi> in Greek signifieth red or purple: the <hi>Latines</hi>
call it <hi>Mare rubrum,</hi> and we, the red Sea. This <hi>Erithrae</hi> was Son to <hi>Perseus</hi>
and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> who sometimes dwelt in the Island of that Sea. It is also
called the <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulf, running from the South to the West; and by the
<hi>Hebrews, I am suph,</hi> a Scaly Sea, all which names are at this day used: at the
utmost bounds hereof are seen the admirable works of <hi>Pharaoh Meco,</hi> who
would have brought this Sea to the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> that so he might have sailed
thence into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea: but this work he could not finish, being

signifies a Bush. Here the Law (which we call the Ten Commandments)
was given; and not unfitly, because like Thorns they prick and vex the

which signifies a place made dry. <hi>Bernard Britenbach,</hi> and many others, in
the Month of <hi>September</hi> 1483, went purposely to see this Mountain, and with
great Labour ascended to the top thereof; for (as he saith) it is a great
Mountain, and of an extraordinary height; in the lower part round, in the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105162:50"/>
upper part divided into two tops or mountains, one standing toward the
West, the other toward the East. That toward the West is called <hi>Horeb,</hi>
that to the East, <hi>Sinai.</hi> And from these two it is sometimes called <hi>Horeb,</hi>
sometimes <hi>Sinai,</hi> being both one Hill of the Base. Between these there lies
a fair and spacious Plain, in the middle whereof (and, as it may be thought,
in the midst of the Mountain) there stands a Monastery, near to which there
is adjoyning a very pleasant Garden and Orchard, plentifully furnished with
Date-trees, Fig-trees, and many others, very profitable and pleasant; where
in antient times there were many Monks that continued there. But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that a certain number of Pagans, in hope to find some Booty, came
from a Haven of the Red Sea, called <hi>Thor,</hi> and upon a sudden broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and put forty of them to the Sword; from whence it was ever after
called the Abbey of the forty Martyrs. Now it remains desolate, few or

are also grievously troubled with the incursions of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
also is destroyed with Locusts, and the ground become barren. In this
Orchard there stands a little Chappel, in which there is a Cave where <hi>S. Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi>

               <p>At the foot of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> upon the North, standeth the Monastery of
<hi>St. Katharine,</hi> of which the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> was the first Founder: it is
compassed about with a Wall; close by it standeth a goodly Orchard, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with divers Trees of Fruit, pleasant and delightful; in that there stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a goodly Fountain, which watereth all about it. In this place there are
a great number of poor Monks, which get their Living by their hands, in
the Desart thereabouts. They say that here stood the golden Calf, spoken
of <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. And they shew a round stone lying there, where they say
<hi>Moses</hi> broke the two Tables that were given him by God. To Pilgrims al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they shew the Tomb of <hi>St. Katharine,</hi> standing upon the right side of
the Quire, with certain other Relicks of hers. Upon the left side of the
Quire, there stands a little door by which you enter into a place called the
Chappel of <hi>St. Mary</hi> of the Bush, where they shew the place of the Bush in
which God appeared unto <hi>Moses:</hi> And, to give grace to their Superstitions,
there may none enter into that place but he must put off his hose and shoes.
There is another place, where, they say, God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to bring up
<hi>Aaron, Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> with him, and the seventy Elders; with many
other Superstitious Chappels, which would be too tedious and frivolous to
recite. Not far from this, there standeth also a <hi>Mosko</hi> of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> full
as fair and spacious as that of <hi>St. Katharines,</hi> to which there is adjoyned a

there standeth a Fountain of very clear Water, in the likeness of a Bow,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105162:51"/>
made of Stone, reaching from the one side of it to the other; and standeth
like unto an Arch or Gate. A little above that, at the foot of Mount
<hi>Horeb,</hi> is to be seen the Cave where <hi>Eliah</hi> rested when the Lord spake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

parts, <hi>Ex.</hi> 33. A little beyond that, is the top of Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> where is
built a little Chappel that hath an Iron Door, the Keys of which are in the
Monks Custody of the Abby of Saint <hi>Katherine.</hi> In this place they say
<hi>Moses</hi> received the two Tables of Stone; wherein the ten Commandments
were written by the Finger of God. Ex. 34. There is none that enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Chappel but with great Reverence, bare-foot and bare-legged, and
casting themselves upon the Earth, kiss it. About fifteen paces from this, they
shew the Cave wherein <hi>Moses</hi> fasted forty days and forty nights, Ex. 24. 34.
A little above that there is a Mosk, to which there daily resorts <hi>Arabians</hi>
and <hi>Saracens,</hi> in honour of <hi>Moses,</hi> whom they reverence as a Prophet. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these there lieth a Well of cold wholsom Water, which is called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
Well. Here seemeth in times past to have been some Monastery;
for there are divers Ruins of Walks and Buildings to be seen. This Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is round, and difficult to Ascend: it is 7000 steps to the top, and from
thence the Red Sea and the Arm thereof (where <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drowned when
he followed the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>) may easily be discerned.</p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Sina</hi> is much higher than this, and lyeth two days Journey from
the Red Sea: Upon the top whereof are many Rocks and great Stones.
From thence you may see sundry places, as, a Mountain lying in <hi>Thebai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes,</hi>
the great Haven of the Red Sea, the Desart of <hi>Elim</hi> and <hi>Sur,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>
                  <hi>CALEB</hi> signifieth An hearty man, or a man after Gods own heart, loving
his Neighbour with all his heart. For <hi>Col</hi> is as much as <hi>Omnius</hi> which
signifies all; and <hi>Cala,</hi> He forgiveth all; and <hi>Leb</hi> or <hi>Lebbah</hi> signifieth an
Heart the seat and fountain of all Life. So that <hi>Caleb</hi> seems to take his name
from a singular hearty affection, whereby he forgiveth his Neighbour.

a mighty Man; secondly, in his Profession, he was a <hi>Nazarite;</hi> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in his Calling, he was a Prince and Judge; fourthly, in his manner
of living, for he went from place to place, to revenge himself upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God's People, the Children of <hi>Israel;</hi> and in his Death: even so
our Saviour Christ is that strong man, who being mightier than the Devil,
hath dispossest him of his tyrannical Jurisdiction over the Souls of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
hath taken away those gates of Death, by his Mercy opening unto
us the door of Life, that so being set at Liberty from that hellish Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we may be made Partakers of everlasting Happiness: he was also a
<hi>Nazarite</hi> even from his Mothers Womb, born and bred there, tying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a Vow of Bondage, that we might be made free: he is a Prince for
ever, and a Priest after the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck:</hi> during the continuance
of his Life in this Vail of Misery, his chiefest Actions were to go from place
to place, to teach, to do good, and to rescue and relieve the poor distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Members of the Church, who lay miserably afflicted under the hands
of Satan; healing some, relieving others, and bringing a third sort into the
state of Grace: so that as <hi>Sampson</hi> delivered the <hi>Israelites</hi> from the Bondage
of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> Christ, our Prince and Judge, delivereth his from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of <hi>Satan;</hi> by his Death saving more Souls than in his Life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
pulling down the strong Buildings (the Temptations of Satan) hath
laid them level with the Ground, that they shall never be restored again.
And lastly, after this Life ended, he shall be our Prince and Judge, and
bring us to that place of Promise prepared for us in his everlasting Kingdom.</p>

while, the <hi>Scythians</hi> considering that the number of the <hi>Iews</hi> was great,
and fearing some sudden Insurrection or Innovation, gave them warning
to depart and leave the Town: they, though with great Grief, as being
prest with a two-fold necessity, (their own Wants and the hatred of their

about some two days after, in the night time, the Inhabitants of <hi>Scythopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>

these words, he turned him about with a fierce countenance, and falling
upon his Father, Mother, Wife, and Children, put them all to the Sword;

               <head>The Travels of Jonathan Saul's Son.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JONATHAN</hi> went from <hi>Gibeah</hi> to <hi>Kirjath-jearim,</hi> which was two miles,
where he drave the <hi>Philistines</hi> out of their Camp, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>From thence he went back again, two miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Michmas,</hi> which is eight miles, and there,
by the help of his Armor-bearer, he gave the <hi>Philistines</hi> a great overthrow,
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>From thence he followed the Enemy to <hi>Ajalon,</hi> which is twelve miles;
there his Father would have put him to death because he had tasted a little
Honey, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ajalon, Saul</hi> and his Son <hi>Ionathan</hi> returned to <hi>Gibeah,</hi> his own City,
which was two miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Gibeah</hi> he went with his Father to <hi>Socho</hi> and <hi>Asekah,</hi> which was
eight miles; where, after <hi>David</hi> had slain <hi>Goliah</hi> (for that singular Virtue
and Heroical Spirit which <hi>Ionathan</hi> saw in him) he loved him as he did his
own Soul, and preferred him before his own Life and Honour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>From thence he went with his Father to <hi>Gibeah,</hi> some eight miles, where
Women with great mirth and joy met him, saying, <hi>Saul hath slain his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and David his ten thousand:</hi> for which cause <hi>Saul,</hi> out of meer envy,
(for then he did not know that he had been anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi>) would
have slain him, and his Son <hi>Ionathan</hi> also for excusing him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Gibeah Ionathan</hi> went into the Desart of <hi>Ziph,</hi> some 22 miles, to
comfort <hi>David:</hi> there they swore a solemn Oath of mutual friendship, to
continue as long as they lived, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>Ionathan</hi> returned, which was 22 miles, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>At last he went to the Wars with his Father to Mount <hi>Gilboah,</hi> forty
miles: there he, his Father, his Brothers <hi>Abinadab</hi> and <hi>Melchisuah</hi> were slain.</p>
               <p>So all the Travels of <hi>Ionathan</hi> were 126 miles.</p>

               <head>The Travels of King David.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>DAVID</hi> was anointed King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he was twenty years
old, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2881, and before Christ, 1807. Within a while
after, he was sent by his Father <hi>Isay,</hi> or <hi>Iesse,</hi> to <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi>
which was eight miles; there he played to <hi>Saul</hi> upon the Harp,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> went out with his Army against the <hi>Philistines, David</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> his own Countrey, which was about eight miles. There
he fed his Father's sheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Socho</hi> and <hi>Asekah,</hi> and killed <hi>Goliah,</hi> which was
four miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he carried the Head of <hi>Goliah</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was eight
miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went with King <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Gibeah,</hi> which was four miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Gibeah</hi> he went twelve miles into the Land of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and to
perform the promise which he had made, put to the Sword 200 of them.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned, and brought their fore-skins unto <hi>Saul;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of which noble Exploit, he was married to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Daughter: which
was twelve miles.</p>
               <p>A while after, he made an incursion upon the Land of the <hi>Philistines,</hi>
and in a sharp and cruel War got a famous Victory, and returned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to <hi>Gibeah,</hi> which was at the lest twenty four miles.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>David</hi> perceived that <hi>Saul</hi> went about to take away his Life,
and that (he was so narrowly pursued) he had no way to escape, but to be
let down by a cord through a window; he made haste and went from <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
to <hi>Arimathea,</hi> where he complained unto <hi>Samuel</hi> of the Injuries of <hi>Saul,</hi> and
laid before him in what a miserable condition he was, and to what straights
brought. Wherefore <hi>Samuel,</hi> to comfort him, brought him to <hi>Naioth;</hi>
which seemeth to be so called, of the fair scituation and pleasantness of
the place: for <hi>Mabah</hi> signifies, a laudable and comely place: this was a
Colledge of such as were Professors of that sacred study of Divinity.
Now <hi>Saul</hi> hearing that <hi>David</hi> was in this place, came with some of his
Servants on purpose to make him captive. But at the sight of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105162:75"/>
he began to sing Psalmes and Hymns after the manner of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>David</hi> returned back unto <hi>Gibeah,</hi> some twelve miles, where,
at the Stone of <hi>Ezel</hi> (not far from <hi>Gibeah,</hi> toward the South) <hi>Ionathan</hi>
went to <hi>David,</hi> and counselled him to depart with all speed, for that his
Father meant evil towards him. So they took leave either of other with
Tears, 1 <hi>Sam. 20. Ezel</hi> signifies an Angle, as was a Stone full of Angles or
corners.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Nob,</hi> which was twelve miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Gath,</hi> a City of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eigned
himself mad, because of <hi>Achis</hi> whom he feared, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. being twenty
four miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to the Cave of <hi>Odullam,</hi> twenty four miles, and
thither resorted unto him many of his Kindred, and such as were indebted
and in danger, to the number of forty Persons. In this place he wrote the
57 and 142 <hi>Psalms,</hi> as may appear by their Titles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Mizpah</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> where, at this
time, the King kept his Court, and there he carefully commanded his Friends
and followers to his safe Protection, till such time as the fury of <hi>Saul</hi> was
asswaged, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>From thence, by the counsel of the Prophet <hi>Gad,</hi> he returned by the
Wilderness of <hi>Hareth</hi> to <hi>Kegila,</hi> and rescued it; forty miles. Here <hi>Abiathar</hi>
the Priest came to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>From thence, fearing the coming of <hi>Saul,</hi> he went into the Wilderness
of <hi>Ziph,</hi> whither <hi>Ionathan</hi> came to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. which was four
miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to the Town of <hi>Moan;</hi> four miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to the Hold of <hi>Engedi,</hi> thirty six miles.</p>
               <p>From thence he went six miles to <hi>Carmel</hi> in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> where he determined
to have destroyed <hi>Nabal</hi> for his churlishness, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Hackilah,</hi> two miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Hackilah</hi> he went to <hi>Gath,</hi> where <hi>Achis</hi> King of the <hi>Philistines</hi> kept
his Court, sixteen miles. This <hi>Achis</hi> was very courteous, and bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded;
he entertained <hi>David,</hi> and gave him freely the City of <hi>Zicklag</hi> to
inhabit in, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>David</hi> went thence to the Town of <hi>Ziclag,</hi> which was twelve
miles, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. and there inhabited one year and seven months.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>David</hi> went often towards the South, and made incursions
upon the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> wasting and destroying their Land which lay in the
Desart of <hi>Sur,</hi> about eighty miles distant from <hi>Ziclag,</hi> and a hundred and
twenty miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the South-west.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105162:75"/>From the Desart of <hi>Sur</hi> he returned back again unto <hi>Ziclag,</hi> which was
eighty miles, and sent part of the Prey which he had gotten to the King of
the <hi>Philistines;</hi> Of which you may read more, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ziclag David</hi> went with the Army of the <hi>Philistines</hi> to fight against
<hi>Saul,</hi> eighty eight miles, even to <hi>Sunem:</hi> for the <hi>Philistines</hi> pitched between
<hi>Iesreel</hi> and <hi>Sunem, 1 Sam.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p>But because the Princes of the <hi>Philistines</hi> durst not trust him, therefore,
by the consent of <hi>Achis</hi> their King, he returned back to <hi>Zicklag,</hi> eighty eight
miles, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>David</hi> was gone with the <hi>Philistines</hi> to fight against <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi>
invaded <hi>Ziclag,</hi> took it, and burnt it with fire, and carried away
<hi>Ahinoam</hi> and <hi>Abigal (David</hi>'s Wives) Captives. Wherefore, when <hi>David</hi>
came to <hi>Ziclag,</hi> and perceived what had happened, with all speed he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
the Enemy; and in the way as he went he found an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who, a
little before, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had left there, because he was unable to follow
them. This <hi>Egyptian</hi> guided <hi>David</hi> to the Tents of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who,
suspecting no such evil, were making merry with the Booty that they had
taken. But <hi>David</hi> with the rest of his Company so manfully behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they gave the <hi>Amalekites</hi> a sudden overthrow: and, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
to such as are negligent and careless, he took away from them their
former Booty, and put most of them to the Sword. This Battel was fought
some eight or twelve miles from <hi>Zicklag,</hi> as by the circumstance of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
may appear.</p>
               <p>From this slaughter he returned back to <hi>Ziclag,</hi> being twelve miles, and
repaired it; to every neighbouring City sending a part of the prey. Here
he had certain intelligence of the Success of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in their Wars
against the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and of the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> which he bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lamented, 1 <hi>Sam. 30. 2 Sam.</hi> 1. These things happened in the tenth
year after <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed <hi>David</hi> King.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ziclag</hi> he went to <hi>Hebron,</hi> a Metropolitan City of the Tribe
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> being a Town of Refuge belonging to the Levites, which was
sixteen miles.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>David</hi> was about the age of thirty years, and was anointed
King by the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in the year of the World 2891, and before
Christ 1077. Here he kept his Court seven years and six months. From
hence also he sent Messengers to <hi>Iabes</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> forty four miles, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his gracious acceptance of that favour which they shewed unto <hi>Saul,</hi> in
burying of his Body there, 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 1 Chr.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Hebron David</hi> went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> twenty two miles, which then
was called <hi>Iebus,</hi> being possessed of the <hi>Iebusites;</hi> but he won it with strong
hand, and thrust them out of it; and in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> set up the City <hi>Millo,</hi>
which was afterward called the City of <hi>David,</hi> and signifies a place of Plenty. He
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105162:76"/>
began his Reign in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the thirty eighth year of his Age, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of his Reign. In this place also he set up his House made of Cedar-wood,
of which, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Libanus,</hi> distant from thence, 104 miles, 2 <hi>Sam. 5. 1 Ch.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to the Valley of <hi>Rephaim,</hi> some three miles from
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the way that leadeth to the City of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where he fought
a memorable Fight against the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and overcame them; for which
cause, it was also called <hi>Baal-Perizim,</hi> because, by the Help and Assistance
of God, he had conquered the Army of the <hi>Philistines, 1 Sam.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>After he had dispersed the Enemies, he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our miles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philistines</hi> came the same Year into the Valley of <hi>Rephaim</hi> again,
and pitched their Tents within three miles and a half of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and the
Lord gave <hi>David</hi> a sign, that when he heard a noise in the Mulberry-trees
he should set upon the Enemy; so <hi>David</hi> went forth, and close by the Town
of <hi>Gaeba</hi> and <hi>Kirjath-jearim,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> West-ward, he
set upon the Enemy, and gave them the second Overthrow, 2 <hi>Samuel 5.
1 Chr.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>David</hi> followed the Enemy to <hi>Gaza,</hi> which was eighteen
miles, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. in the tenth Year of his Reign from his first beginning in
<hi>Hebron. David</hi> assembled all the Princes, Priests, and chief men of <hi>Israel,</hi>
to the number of 30000, which inhabited from <hi>Sechor</hi> till you come to
<hi>Chaemah,</hi> a City of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> even 163 miles
off. These men assembled themselves in the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and from
thence, they with <hi>David,</hi> went to <hi>Kirjath-jearim,</hi> which was about a mile,
to fetch the Ark of the Covenant from thence into the City of <hi>David,
1 Sam. 6. 1 Chr.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Kirjath-jearim, David</hi> and all his Train returned back again to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
which was about a mile; and they placed the Ark of the Lord
in a new Cart, and caused it to be drawn with Oxen, which turned out
of the way to the threshing-floor of <hi>Nachon,</hi> where <hi>Vzza</hi> rashly and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
touching the Ark of God, contrary to the Divine Law, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
slain by the Lord in the way, and that place was called <hi>Paeri-Vza,</hi>
that is, <hi>The Breach of</hi> Uza: for he was not of the Tribe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to whom
it was only lawful to touch the Ark, and therefore the Lord struck him
that he died miserably: wherefore <hi>David</hi> being terrified by this example of
God's Severity, would not that day bring the Ark of the Lord into <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
but carried it to the House of a certain Noble-man called <hi>Obed Aedom</hi>
a <hi>Gittite,</hi> who dwelt not far from <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but, when it was told <hi>David</hi>
that the Lord blessed the House of <hi>Obed Aedom,</hi> and all his Family, because
the Ark was there, <hi>David</hi> went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with a great multitude of
People, to the House of <hi>Obed Aedom,</hi> who (as is said before) dwelt not far
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105162:76"/>
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (yet there are some that say he was an excellent Musician
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and dwelt in Mount <hi>Acra,</hi> that is in the lower City) and
from thence <hi>David</hi> fetch'd the Ark of the Lord into the upper City, which
stood upon Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> but I hold the other Opinion to be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p>When the Ark was carried by the Priests, <hi>David</hi> girt himself with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Ephod, (which kind of Garment the Priests of the inferiour Order
used to wear) and danced before it, singing Psalms and Hymns to the
praise and glory of God, and with great State brought it to the City of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
with the sound of Trumpets and Instruments of Musick, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it in the middle of the Tabernacle, which they had curiously erected
in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> in the upper City, which was also called the City of <hi>David.</hi>
This hapned in the tenth year of his Reign; at which time, <hi>Michal, Saul</hi>'s
Daughter, despised him in her Heart, and laughed at him: but God gave
her a due Recompence, as you may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. and him a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for, he promised by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> That of his Posterity and
Blood the King of Kings and Saviour of the World should be born.</p>
               <p>In the Year following, <hi>David</hi> invaded the Land of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and
the City of <hi>Gath,</hi> which with strong hand he won: this was thirty four
miles from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence he returned back to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> 34 miles.</p>
               <p>In the twelfth Year of his Reign he afflicted the <hi>Moabites</hi> with cruel War,
and destroyed two of their Armies with the Sword, and the rest of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
he made Tributary; which was 24 miles, 2 <hi>Sam. 8. 1 Chr.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>He returned thence to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with great Triumph and Joy, twenty
four miles.</p>
               <p>In the thirteenth year of his Reign, <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 2903. and before Christ
1065, he made an Expedition unto <hi>Zoba,</hi> which <hi>Iosephus</hi> calleth <hi>Sophenam,</hi>
and is in <hi>Armenia,</hi> near to <hi>Masia</hi> or Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> 600 miles from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
toward the North; of which you may read before. <hi>David</hi> in this
place won a memorable Battel against <hi>Hadad Ezer</hi> the King thereof, near
to the River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> he took 700 Horse and 20000 Foot, burnt their
Chariots, took 100 Castles, conquered all the Towns and Country round
about, and went away with a great Booty, as well of Gold as Silver, Brass,
and other things; which Brass, for the Excellency thereof, was like unto
Gold, and (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith) afterwards <hi>Solomon</hi> made the Molten Sea of
it. When <hi>Gadarezer,</hi> King of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> (he that built that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Damascus</hi>) heard of the overthrow of <hi>Hadad-Ezer,</hi> he sent a great
Army to his Aid; which King <hi>David,</hi> near to the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> smote
with the Sword, so that 20000 of them were slain, and he carryed away a
glorious Victory, extending his Government from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> 600 miles
towards the North, that is, into <hi>Armenia,</hi> and beyond the River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

and made these two Nations tributary unto him, 2 <hi>Samuel 8.
1 Chr.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>After <hi>David</hi> had won these two memorable Victories near <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he
went thence with all his Army towards the South, and invaded the Land
of <hi>Syria;</hi> in which Journey, <hi>Ioram</hi> the Son of <hi>Tohi,</hi> King of <hi>Antiochia,</hi>
(which City at this time was called <hi>Hemath</hi>) met <hi>David</hi> with Gifts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
in the Name of his Father, returning him many Thanks because he
had destroyed the common Enemy <hi>Hadad-Ezer,</hi> and by strong hand sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and quelled the Fury of that mighty Tyrant, who was also a trouble
and vexation to the Kingdom of <hi>Antiochia. David</hi> entertained this Message
kindly, and thankfully received his Gifts, (which was of Gold, Silver, and
fine Brass) and so gave <hi>Ioram</hi> an acceptable Dispatch, and from thence
with his Army went to <hi>Damascus,</hi> the Metropolitan City of <hi>Syria,</hi> where,
in the Valley of Salt, he got a great Victory, in which 18000 <hi>Syrians</hi> were
slain, and soon after, the City of <hi>Damascus</hi> taken; in which, <hi>David</hi> placed
a Garrison, and compelled them to pay Tribute, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. This was distant
from the Kingdom of <hi>Soba</hi> 520 miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Damascus</hi> he went with his Army into the Land of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
100 miles, in the way that leadeth out of <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all which he
conquered, and all the Cities and Towns thereabouts, and compelled them
to pay Tribute, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was sixty miles, and all
the Booty that he had gotten in his Journey he dedicated unto the Lord,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>A while after, he, with his Army, made an Incursion into the Land of
<hi>Idumaea,</hi> and compelled the Inhabitants to pay Tribute. Moreover, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the City of <hi>Midian,</hi> the Metropolitan of that Country; of which,
you may read before: it was distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 160 miles towards the
South. So that the extent of <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom, from the North to the
South, was 800 miles, even from the Kingdom of <hi>Soba</hi> to the Red Sea; and
from the East to the West 120 miles; from <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> reaching to
<hi>Damascus.</hi> Thus by the singular Blessing of God he obtained a spacious
and powerful Empire, 1 <hi>Sam. 8. 1 Reg. 11. 1 Chr.</hi> 19. He made his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into <hi>Idumaea</hi> about the fourteenth year of his Reign.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Midian</hi> in <hi>Idumaea,</hi> he returned with great Glory and Praise to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
which was 160 miles.</p>
               <p>In the fourteenth year of his Reign, and in the year of the World 2904,
and before Christ 1064, <hi>Nahas,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> died, and <hi>Haron</hi>
his Son succeeded him: this Man contemptuously abused the Messengers of
<hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 10. and to justifie that Injury, he gathered an Army out of
<hi>Soba, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> even a mighty Host, to oppose <hi>David;</hi> who
in the fifteenth year of his Government met him with his Army at <hi>Helam,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:105162:77"/>
some twenty miles from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where he obtained a notable Victory,
and destroyed 700 Chariots, and 40000 Horse, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> after this, with great applause of the People, was entertained into <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
which was 20 miles distant; where, being puft up with Prosperity, he
forgat his former Piety and Sanctity, and by degrees fell into unlawful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and unjust desires: whence it happened, that soon after he committed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
with <hi>Bathseba:</hi> and after that, to hide his Fault, caused her Husband
to be slain. This was kept secret, till the Lord, by <hi>Nathan</hi> sharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
him, lays before him what he was, and what his present estate is, from
whence that came, and then concludes, that he is most unthankful, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and negligent towards God and Man, in committing those Insolencies;
neither left he there, but told him that God would severely punish him for
his Offence, which after happened as you may read, 1 <hi>Sa. 11, 12. 14, 17. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
being nipt in his Conscience with this sharp reprehension, fell into great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
the extremity of whose Passions may very well appear in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential
<hi>Psalms,</hi> which at this time and soon after he wrote, and left to
future Ages.</p>
               <p>After this, about the end of Summer, he gathered an Army, and went into
the Land of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> some sixty four miles, where he took the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
City, (which at that time was called <hi>Rabba,</hi> because of the Multitude
of Citizens that were in it; but after being restored by <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi>
King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he called it after his own name, <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) and there took
the Crown from the Head of the King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
which weighed a<note n="*" place="margin">How much this was, you may read hereafter in the quantity of weights</note> Talent of Gold, being (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith)
richly adorned with fair Sardonick Stones; of which you
may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned back to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is sixty four miles,
where he married <hi>Bathseba,</hi> and by her had four Sons, <hi>Simeon, Sobab,
Nathan</hi> and <hi>Solomon, 1 Chr.</hi> 3. Soon after this, <hi>Amnon</hi> defloured his Sister
<hi>Thamar:</hi> Not long after that, his Son <hi>Absalom</hi> killed his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi>
being then about eighteen years of age; which <hi>David</hi> took so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously,
that he would not suffer him to come into his sight for three
years, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. Then <hi>Ioab,</hi> by the subtilty of the Woman of <hi>Tekoa,</hi>
reconciled him to the King his Father: yet nevertheless, he came not
to his Court of two years after; This <hi>Absalom</hi> was a goodly man, affable, for
which cause, even at that time, the People began to affect him.</p>
               <p>Afterward, in the year of the World 2950, and before Christ 1408, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi>
being then about twenty five years of Age, moved Sedition against
his Father. A matter remarkable, that although he had slain his own Brother,
being disgraced and absent from the Court almost five years, yet within
short time after, he so strongly united the Affection of the People to him,
that he constrained <hi>David</hi> (standing in fear of his greatness) all his former
Acts and worthy Victories notwithstanding) to forsake his own City, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105162:78"/>
for safety to fly to the Mount of Olives, being three quarters of a mile from
the City.</p>
               <p>There he stayed a while to see the condition of the Tumult, but Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
constrained him to take his way to <hi>Bahuzim.</hi> And as he was going,
<hi>Zimri</hi> the Son of <hi>Gesa</hi> of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> cursed him, every mans Enemy
then making himself apparent when he is in Adversity, and his best friends
commonly forsake him.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Iordan,</hi> fourteen miles, where the Priests <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and <hi>Ahinaaz</hi> brought him certain Intelligence of that wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Counsel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> a man in those times famous for his Wisdom,
but perfidious in his Actions, as commonly such are that hope after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
or seek to benefit themselves by Innovation and Change.</p>
               <p>After he had Intelligence hereof, he went over <hi>Iordan</hi> with those few men
that he had, and with all possible speed went to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> some 16 miles
from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> toward the North-east. At this place <hi>Ioshuah</hi> led the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> through <hi>Iordan</hi> on dry ground, <hi>Ios.</hi> 3. 4. and here <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptist taught, and baptized Christ. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Makanaim,</hi> which is 28 miles, where he sent
forth his Army by bands against <hi>Absalom,</hi> who at this time had assembled
a great Host near the Wood <hi>Ephraim,</hi> not far from that place where <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
won a memorable Battel against the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and that the place
might be made more famous, <hi>David</hi>'s men, though few in number, gave
<hi>Absalom</hi> and his Host as great. Thus <hi>Absalom</hi> being left in danger, to save
himself, fled; but in his flight the Hair of his Head being long, and blown
with the Wind, took hold of the branch of a Tree, by which, he hanged
between Heaven and Earth, as unworthy of either: and <hi>Ioab,</hi> who but a
little before was his Friend, in that very place, with three Darts, put him to
death, a just end for so unjust a Man. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> notwithstanding, took the Death of <hi>Absalom</hi> marvellous heavily,
till by <hi>Ioab</hi> he was recalled from that Grief; and then in the Company of
<hi>Barzillai,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Chimea,</hi> of <hi>Mephiboseth</hi> the Son of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and
<hi>Zeba</hi> his Servant, <hi>Shimei</hi> also that before curst him, (who to leave a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Token of a base Sicophant) after this Victory, came first down
to crave Pardon for his Offence, with many others, went along with him
from <hi>Makanaim</hi> to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> which was 28 miles. To this place there
came a great Multitude of People to meet <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. This <hi>Barzillai</hi>
was one of the eighteen that held the Principality of the City of the <hi>Gilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites,</hi>
and had a Son called <hi>Chimea,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> took with him to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
that he might make evident his Thankfulness towards him for that
Courtesie which he had received of his Father.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bethabara David</hi> passed <hi>Iordan,</hi> and went back to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> which
was four miles, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105162:78"/>From thence he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being twelve miles, in the same year
that he was exiled by his Son, which was about the thirteenth year of his reign.
The next year, <hi>Saeba</hi> the Son of <hi>Bicri,</hi> taking example of <hi>Absalom,</hi> and
observing the mutability of the Peoples Affections, moved a Sedition against
<hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Ioab</hi> his Captain, overcame him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. After this there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three years of Famine. About the end of the third year of Famine, and
in the thirty fourth year of his Reign, <hi>David</hi> went to <hi>Iabes Gilead,</hi> which
was fifty two miles, to fetch the bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> to bury them
in the Sepulchre of his Fathers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iabes</hi> in <hi>Gilead, David</hi> brought the Bones and Relicks of King <hi>Saul,</hi>
and <hi>Ionathan</hi> his Son, to <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> which was 52 miles, and there he
honourably buried them in the Sepulchre of his Father <hi>Kish, 2 Sam.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>David</hi> returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was four miles.</p>
               <p>In the thirty fifth year of his Reign, he went forth to fight against the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi>
near to the Levitical Town of <hi>Nob,</hi> or <hi>Nobe,</hi> which is twelve miles
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> upon the Borders of the Countreys of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> in

               </p>
               <p>From thence he returned back again to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> twelve miles.</p>

the afflicted Spirit of <hi>Saul:</hi> so Christ, by the Musick and Harmony of his
Doctrine (the glad tidings of Salvation) comforteth the afflicted Members of
his Church. Fifthly, <hi>David</hi> got his Glory and preferment by the death of
<hi>Goliah:</hi> so Christ was glorified by conquering Death and the Devil. Sixthly,
<hi>David</hi> was persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and pursued from one place to another, so that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105162:79"/>
he had not where to hide his head with safety; so Christ was persecuted by his
own Country-men the <hi>Iews,</hi> shut out from the Society of Man; and, as he said,
<hi>Mat. 8. The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds have Nests; but the Son of Man
hath not where to hide his head.</hi> Seventhly, in the dangers that <hi>David</hi> sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by Gods providence he was mercifully delivered: so Christ was inclosed
and in danger of the <hi>Iews</hi> at <hi>Nazareth, Luke</hi> 4. in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> in the Temple

Eighthly, as <hi>Absalom</hi> rebelled against <hi>David,</hi> being his Father; so the <hi>Iews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against Christ, although he was their Creator: according to that of
<hi>Esa. 61. I have fed and brought up Children, but they have forsaken me.</hi> Ninthly,
as <hi>David</hi> fled to Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> for refuge, being brought to a streight; so
Christ upon Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> (his Heart being prest with an intolerable Agony)
fled to his Father by Prayer, for comfort in that extremity. Tenthly, as all
the Friends and Familiars of <hi>David</hi> forsook him at such time as <hi>Absalom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against him, and followed him with Persecutions, Mocks and Taunts;
so Christ, at such time as <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him into the hands of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
was forsaken of all his Followers, and many of those which a little before he had
done good unto, mocked and derided him as he was upon the Cross. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as <hi>David</hi> was restored, notwithstanding the former miseries and troubles,
to his ancient Glory and Eminency; so Christ, after he had suffered the due
punishment for Sin, Death, and (before that) extream Misery, yet at length
conquered both, and by his Divine Power restored himself to his former
estate, Eternal Glory.</p>

Mountains, and sometimes of Chariots and Horses drawing them. It is

by natural Stains and Colours, so artificially, as if they had been
done by some curious Work-man. Of this Stone you may read more in
<hi>Pliny, li. 37. ca.</hi> 1. 10. It was first found in <hi>Achates</hi> a River of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> whence
it took the Name. Afterward in <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was
called <hi>Schaeba</hi> or <hi>Saba.</hi> In this City that Queen dwelt who came to hear
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom, and gave him for a Present 120 Talents of pure Gold,
which at three pounds at ounce comes to 270000 pounds Sterling. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Cambyses</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> over-came it and all the Country round about

               <p>The Inhabitants of this Town go naked, all but their privy Parts, which

Heat. The Land also is marvellously scorched, and turned in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Sand and Dust: so that the Country is thereby wonderful barren.</p>

               <p>In times past there were mighty Princes that had the Government and
Command of it, and the Country round about it. But after (as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith,
<hi>lib. 6. cap. 29.)</hi> it was in the Jurisdiction and Government of Queens, who
for their noble Resolutions and Courage were called <hi>Candaces.</hi> One of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105162:84"/>
which name in <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperours time was famous, both for the extent
of her Dominions (in which she exceeded all the rest of her predecessors) as
also in regard of her manly presence and noble Spirit. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> which
<hi>Philip</hi> baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was Treasurer or Chamberlain to this Queen: and
it is to be thought, by him the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ was first made
known in <hi>Saba,</hi> and in the Country of <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> which afterwards was more
largely propagated and dispersed by the Evangelist St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who taught
there.</p>
               <p>This City lyeth to the longitude of 61 degrees and 30 scruples, and in the
elevation of the Pole Artick to the Latitude sixteen Degrees and twenty five
Scruples. So that it seems, the Inhabitants have two Winters and two Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
or rather a continual Summer, because their Winter is much hotter
than our Summer. But when the Sun attaineth to the fifteenth Degree of
<hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> and in the Dog-days, it then lyes perpendicular over that
Country, and neither their Bodies nor Houses give any shadows.</p>
               <p>In the sixty first of <hi>Esay</hi> it is said, <hi>They shall come from</hi> Saba, <hi>and bring
Gold and Frankincence to praise the Lord.</hi> From whence some have concluded,
that those Wise men which came unto the Child Jesus, and brought Gold,
Frankincence, and Myrrh, were <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and came thence. But this
agreeth not well with the words of <hi>Matthew, ca.</hi> 2. where it is written, that the
wise men came out of the East, that is, from the rising of the Sun, to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
For <hi>Saba,</hi> according to our Saviours words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. lieth towards the
South; for he saith, <hi>The Queen of the South</hi> (that is, of <hi>Saba) shall come forth
in the day of Iudgment against this Generation, and condemn it, for she came
from the end of the World to hear the Wisdom of</hi> Solomon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if <hi>Saba</hi>
lye upon the South, as here it plainly appeareth, then it must needs follow
they came not thence, but rather from <hi>Persia,</hi> which from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> lyes East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
For at <hi>Susa,</hi> the Metropolis of that Country, there was an Academy
for the whole Kingdom; in which were chiefly studied Divinity, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
and History. So that it is likely, by their Art they might attain
to the knowledge of this Divine Mystery, and from thence come to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
which was 520 miles Eastward. Therefore this place of the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> is rather to be referred to the propagation of the Church through the
whole World, where some of every Nation shall bring Presents unto the
Lord.</p>
               <p>There is also another <hi>Saba</hi> in <hi>Arabia-Foelix,</hi> so called from <hi>Zaeba</hi> the Son of
<hi>Chus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> and it is distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
1248 miles towards the South-East. In <hi>Hebrew</hi> it signifies the City of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,
or of Mirth; but with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> Antiquity. Some would have it
in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue to signifie a Mystery. But St. <hi>Ierom</hi> interprets it,
to sound their Conversion. It is the Metropolitan City of <hi>Arabia-Foelix,</hi>
and by <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 6. called <hi>Meriaba,</hi> being scituated in a high and pleasant
Mountain full of fruitful Trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:105162:85"/>There inhabiteth in it the King of that Country (a mighty Prince) his
Governours, and most of such as have Authority under him. The Land is
called the Kingdom of the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> but generally <hi>Arabia-Foelix,</hi> because of the
Fertility of the place; for it yieldeth twice every year great plenty of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incence,
Myrrh, Cinamon, Balsams, and other odoriferous Herbs. The Tree
out of which this Myrrh cometh, is five Cubits high, hairy, and full of
prickles, and when you cut the Bark, there cometh forth a bitter Gum,
wherewith if you anoint a dead Body, it will continue long without rotting.
The Frankincence also that is found there droppeth from the Cedar-trees,
like a glewy substance, and so congealeth into a Gum. This happeneth
twice every year, and according unto the season it changeth colour: in the
Spring it is red, in the Summer white. This is the best Frankincence in all
<hi>Arabia-Foelix.</hi> Through the whole Country there is a very delectable smell,
by reason of the Myrrh, Frankincence and Cinnamon, that is found in it;
insomuch, that if the Wind blows amongst the trees, it carrieth the smell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Red Sea, and they that sail can easily discern the sweetness of the Air.
There is Gold also found there, very fine and pure, insomuch as for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, it is called <hi>Arabian</hi> Gold. The <hi>Phoenix</hi> is found there, of which
there is but one in the World. <hi>Pliny, lib. 9. cap.</hi> 35. describes her to be as big
as an <hi>Eagle,</hi> with a list of Feathers like Gold about her Neck, the rest are of
a Purple colour; therefore from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and the purple colour of her
Wings she is called <hi>Phoenix.</hi> She hath a tuft of Feathers upon her head
like unto a Crown. She liveth 660 years; at the end of which time she build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her a Nest of Cassia, Cinnamon, Calamus, and other precious Gums and
Herbs, which the Sun, by the extremity of the heat, and the waving of her
wings, fires; and she taking delight in the sweetness of the savour, hovers
so long over it, that she burneth her self in her own Nest. Within a while
after, out of the Marrow of her Bones, and the Ashes of her Body, there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Worm, which by little and little increaseth to some bigness, and after
to a purple bird. Then her wings extend themselves to a full greatness, till
such time as she cometh to a perfect <hi>Phoenix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This bird doth lively represent our Saviour Christ, who only and alone
is the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> and through whom we must expect everlasting life,
who in the fulness of time offered himself a Sacrifice upon the Cross, sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the punishment of Sin at the time of his Passion, putting on a purple
Robe, being all be sprinkled with his own bloud, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. And as the <hi>Phoenix</hi>
is burnt in her own Nest, so likewise was he consumed in the fire of Gods
wrath, according to that in <hi>Psal. 22. My heart is become like melting wax
in the midst of my body.</hi> And as the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of it self begetteth another of the
same kind; so Christ by the power of his Deity raised up his Body from the
dust of the Earth, and ascended up into Heaven a glorious Body, to sit at
the right hand of his Father in that everlasting Kingdom of Glory.</p>

call it <hi>Noph,</hi> for the fertility and pleasantness of the Country, as you may

Noph (or of <hi>Memphis) are deceived.</hi> See also <hi>Ierom, 2. 44. 46. Ezech.</hi> 30.
in which places you may find it called after this name. <hi>Zoan</hi> is the City
<hi>Tanis,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> wrought all his Miracles: But <hi>Noph,</hi> or <hi>Moph,</hi> is this
<hi>Memphis;</hi> a beautiful Town, large and spacious, scituated in the strongest
and profitablest place in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> divided into two parts by the River <hi>Nilus,</hi>
so that any kind of commodities or merchandize might with ease be brought
thither by Water: for which cause the Kings of that Country (for the most

part) kept their abiding there. <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 17. that upon the East part
of this City, there standeth a Tower or Castle called <hi>Babylon,</hi> built by certain
<hi>Babylonians,</hi> who leaving their own Country, by the permission of the Kings
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> dwelt there: in after times there was placed a Garrison in it, one
of the three which were for the defence of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was called
<hi>Babylon,</hi> through both which, <hi>viz. Memphis</hi> and <hi>Babylon, Nilus</hi> passed; the
one standing upon the East side, the other upon the West. <hi>Zoan,</hi> or <hi>Tanis,</hi>
stood about some four miles from this Town, and was a fair and spacious
City also, scituated towards the South, upon the East side of <hi>Nilus,</hi> to which
the Kings of that Country often resorted; and <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> another fair City,
stood some six miles off that, towards the North-East. All these four Towns
were so wonderfully inhabited (by reason of their pleasant and profitable
scituation) that in process of time they became all one City; and in this Age
is called <hi>Alcaire,</hi> containing in Circuit sixty miles: so that it seemeth to Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
to be like a Country replenished with nothing but fair Houses, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Churches, and strong Towers; exceeding all the rest of the Cities of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
as well for the beautifulness of the place, as the extent and largeness of
it. It is reported, that in the year of our Lord 1476, there was such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Pestilence in it, that there dyed 20000 a day, from whence may be
gathered, how infinitely it is peopled. Near to this Town stood the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides,
which are held to be one of the Wonders of the World (as <hi>Strabo</hi>
saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 17.) the height of one of them was 625 foot, and square on each
side 883 foot; it was twenty years a building, a hundred thousand Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
employed about it: whence it may be easily gathered, how hard and
difficult it was in those times to get Stone (it being for the most part brought
from <hi>Arabia</hi>) and at what an excessive charge they were that set them up.</p>

<hi>Solomon</hi> had set a certain Tax on every man, because he was at extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

their request, told them, That his little finger should be heavier than the whole burthen of his Father: wherefore they, disliking his Speech, fell all

and sent his Angel into the Camp of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and lo, in one night there
were slain 185000 men as they lay in their Tents before <hi>Gibeah</hi> (which at
this time they besieged) being distant from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> some ten miles towards
the South-West. This great deliverance happen'd in the year of the World
3253, and before Christ, 733. About the end of the thirty eighth year of the
age of <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> he fell into a dangerous disease, which so far forth as could be
gathered by all likelihoods was the Plague; (for God doth oftentimes try the
Patience of his Saints with sundry afflictions) but yet at his servent Prayers he
was restored to Health, and his days were lengthened fifteen years: at which
time the Sun went back ten Degrees, according to the variation of the shadow
in the Dyal of <hi>Ierusalem, 2 Reg. 20. Isa 38. 2 Chr.</hi> 32. But at the end of the
fifteen years, which was about the fifty fourth year of his age, he dyed, and
was buried with his Fathers.</p>

also be taken for that, when a man endeavoured with all speed to execute a
thing; which seems to resemble the condition of <hi>Nimrod:</hi> for that in this
place he endeavoured to overcome and conquer all his Neighbours: from
whence this Land was called <hi>Casdius,</hi> that is, The Country of the Destroyer.
So changing S into L, it is called <hi>Chaldeus</hi> or <hi>Chaldaea.</hi> The Chief and
Metropolitan City of which Country was this <hi>Babylon,</hi> built some thirty years
after the Floud by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or the <hi>Babylonian Saturn,</hi> the first great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the World, according to <hi>Berosus, lib.</hi> 4. who writeth after this manner:
<hi>Nimrod,</hi> which was accounted the Son of <hi>Iupiter Belus,</hi> being angry with the
Holy Priests of that great God <hi>Iehovah,</hi> came with his Colony and People into
the Field of <hi>Sinear,</hi> where he built a City, and laid the Foundation of a great
Tower, 131 years after the Flood; and raised this Tower to such a height,
and withal of such a hugeness, that it seemed as if it had been some great
Mountain; because he would have the <hi>Babylonian</hi> People accounted the
chiefest and greatest in the World; also their Governour, the King of Kings.
A little after he saith, he built this Tower, but before he could finish it, dyed,
in the fifty sixth year after he began it: wherefore the City and Tower of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> according to the Opinion of <hi>Berosus,</hi> was begun in <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 1788,
which was 131 years after the Flood, and before Christ, 2180. There were
two causes wherefore the Children of Men built up this Tower; first, that they
might get them a name: secondly, that they might be safe in case there came
another Flood to drown the World. It was made of Brick and Bittum,
lest the Water should loosen it. But the Lord turned their Enterprises into
evil, and divided their Language, so that they could not understand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[whereby they were constrained to leave off their building:] from whence
it happened that their Minds, Manners, Understandings, Studies, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Actions were utterly changed, and is the Foundation of all discord and
sedition, where the fear of God, and the true knowledge of Christ doth
not prevent it. From this division of Tongues, it is called the City of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
this is the City of Division; being derived of the word <hi>Balal,</hi> he hath
confounded or mingled together. Of this City you may read in <hi>Ios. lib. I.
cap.</hi> 9. where he bringeth in a saying of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> which was, <hi>That when all
Nations were of one Language, they built an exceeding high Tower, as though they
would have ascended by it into Heaven; but the Lord with great tempest and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
their Tongues, subverted their enterprize, from whence it was called</hi>
Babylon. This City was the fairest in those times of all others, scituated in a
spacious Plain, upon every side whereof there stood pleasant Orchards and
Gardens: it was built four square, conpassed about with Walls of incredible
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105162:103"/>
strength and greatness, being fifty Cubits thick, and 200 high, beautified
within with goodly Buildings, fair Temples richly gilt with Gold, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to look upon. It was in compass 380 Furlongs, as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, which
make forty eight miles. Through it ran the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by which all
things necessary were conveyed to the City; without, it was compassed with
fair Ditches, fill'd with water like Rivers, and in the Wall there stood a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Gates. <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith, that it was 480 Furlongs about, which make
sixty miles <hi>English,</hi> but that is not so credible.</p>
               <p>The first Founder of this City was <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who in those times was the
chief Commander of the World. It is thought that he was the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> whose name signifies, a cruel Governour, or an unmerciful
Tyrant. And that his Actions might be according to the signification of
his name, he is branded with most perspicious notes of Cruelty, omitting no
violent action whereby he might inlarge his Dominions; incroaching upon
other mens Governments, through a thirsty and ambitious desire of Renown,
without respect of Equity or Humanity. And to add evil to evil, committed
many outrages upon such as were accounted good men, and the Priests of
the great God <hi>Iehovah,</hi> from whence there grew in him a more than humane
resolution, accounting himself in this World a God, and thorough this
opinion grew into contempt of all good things; compelling such as were his
Subjects and Vassals to do him Worship and Reverence as to a Divine Power;
which, being ingraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they countenanced it with Authority: from whence it came to pass, that he was

Sepulchre, and what soever he wanteth he shall find: but before, it will not be good
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105162:103"/>
for him to touch it.</hi> This notwithstanding, it continued till the Reign of

imported; but no Mony was there to be had, only within might plainly be

Woman beautified <hi>Babylon</hi> with many goodly Buildings, built up the Walls

in it, beautified it with many goodly Towers and Fortifications, added unto
it many Provinces and Governments: and after all, because of her own
lascivious Appetite (as <hi>Sallust</hi> saith) was murthered by her Son <hi>Ninus,</hi> who
succeeded her in the Government.</p>
               <p>There were many other memorable things within this City, that were
built before and after her time (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith) as that great and mighty
Tower before remembred, in which stood the Temple of <hi>Baelus,</hi> and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.

Chappel there stood an Altar of pure Gold, upon which they
yearly offered 100000 Talents of Frankincense. There was
another also somewhat less, upon which they used to offer their
Sacrifices; for it was not lawful for them to offer any thing that
had life upon the greater Altar: there stood also in that place another Statue
twelve cubits high, all of pure Gold.</p>

the Enemy had entered within the Walls at the farther end: which might
happen, because upon that day when it was taken the <hi>Babylonians</hi> celebrated
a Feast unto <hi>Venus,</hi> in which using extraordinary diligence, they were less
mindful of such things as hapned unto them.</p>
               <p>Thus this City, that with great Tyranny had triumphed over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the earth for the space of 1600 years (being so plentifully furnished

by where it stood, called <hi>Elugo,</hi> or <hi>Felugo,</hi> scituated upon the Bank of the

for Ships, where Merchants often times go a shore, and travel thence through
many Woods and desart places, unto <hi>Seleucia,</hi> which at this day is called
by the <hi>Turks, Bagdeth,</hi> distant thence some thirty six miles, and is the utmost
Town of the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Empires towards the East, being divided in
the midst by the River <hi>Tygris.</hi> Some Merchants have reported, That the
place where <hi>Babylon</hi> stood is become stony, unfruitful, and unpleasant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Ruins of the destroyed buildings which lye in the Earth. Also,
That there is found a Tower built of a black stone, which to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
seems to have been a very goodly house, high and eminent; so that
upon the top thereof a man might have seen through the whole City. This
Tower the Inhabitants of <hi>Felugo</hi> call the Tower of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in which was the
Chamber where he used to pray to the Lord three times a day, the Windows
whereof looked towards <hi>Ierusalem, Dan.</hi> 6. There is also to be seen divers
Arches of the Bridge which <hi>Semiramis</hi> built, standing upon the River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and the foundation of the great Tower whose top should have reached
to Heaven; being in compass two miles, but not very high. Within the
Ruins whereof are found certain Serpents very noisom and venemous, about
the bigness of a <hi>Lizard,</hi> having three heads, and spect with divers colours,
which the Inhabitants call <hi>Eglones.</hi> There are such a multitude of them,
that no man dares approach within half a mile of it any time but in the
Winter season, nor then neither but for the space of a Month; in which time
these Serpents for the extremity of the cold are constrained to keep their
holes. Thus, as this Tower was hateful to God in the beginning, so likewise
hath he made it hurtful unto man even to this day.</p>

<hi>Ieremy,</hi> but went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and compelled the Prophet to go along with
them: so they went from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Tachpanes,</hi> which was 172 miles.
Here the second time <hi>Ieremy</hi> prophesied unto them, saying, <hi>Behold,</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar

<hi>Nabuchadonozor,</hi> which was 680 miles, and there with his fellows
learned the Arts and Language of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> for three years.

near to the Flood <hi>Eulaeus,</hi> he had a Vision of a Ram and a Goat; which
set forth the state of the second Monarchy (which was that of the <hi>Graecians.</hi>)
In this Vision <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Arch-Angel, appeared to <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 8. This

               <p>From <hi>Tygris,</hi> he returned to his own house at <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was thirty

to <hi>Egbatan,</hi> the Metropolitan City of the <hi>Medes,</hi> which was accounted 464
miles from <hi>Babylon,</hi> towards the North-East: Here <hi>Daniel</hi> built a fair and

Season, there do breed Toads, Lyzards, and other Noysome Serpents in great
abundance: so that the Inhabitants are constrained (partly because of the
heat, partly because of the loathsome and dangerous Creatures) to build
their Houses all of Earth, long and narrow, the Walls and Roofs being at

breed in them, <hi>Strabo, lib. Geograph.</hi> 5. saith, that one <hi>Tython</hi> (the Brother of

was very curiously built, supported with Pillars of polished Marble, imbossed
with Silver and Gold, very rare to look upon: over it was a banquetting-house,
beautified with lively pictures, costly furniture, and Beds of Gold and

Exposition of the Prophecy of <hi>Ionas,</hi> doth utterly disallow of this as false; for
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text reads it not, to <hi>Tharsin,</hi> but in <hi>Tharsin,</hi> that is, into the
Sea. For the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue hath two words or Syllables which signifie the
Sea, which are <hi>Iam</hi> and <hi>Tharsis. Iam</hi> signifieth, not only a great Sea, but
the meeting together of Waters, or a Lake. So in <hi>Luke.</hi> 5. the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> in
which Christ and his Disciples sailed, is called a Lake; yet <hi>Ioh. cap.</hi> 5. and
the rest of the Evangelists call it a Sea. So also <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 1. calleth the
meeting together of the Waters, <hi>Iam;</hi> which may signifie, a Sea, and a Lake;
But <hi>Tharsis,</hi> or <hi>Tharschich,</hi> denoteth a great Sea, and no Lake; or an high
and troublesome Sea, as the <hi>Mediteranean</hi> Sea is. In this <hi>Paul</hi> travelled,
and there standeth many Islands, as <hi>Rhodes, Cyprus, Cicilia,</hi> and others; all
which are at this day subject to the <hi>Turks, Venetians,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it self from <hi>Ioppa</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to the <hi>Streights</hi> between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.</hi>
Into this Sea, <hi>Ionas</hi> was cast when the Whale devoured him. In like
manner, the Red Sea, and all others that are Ocean Seas, are called <hi>Tharsis,</hi>
as appeareth in the 72 <hi>Psalm,</hi> where it said, <hi>The Kings of Tharsis
and of the Isles shall bring Presents.</hi> Here, the Kings whose Empires extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
along the Sea Coast are understood. But the City <hi>Tharsis</hi> (the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) is not a Kingdom, neither ever had a King, much
less many Kings. So <hi>Solomon</hi> sent his Ships by <hi>Tharsin</hi>(that is, by Sea towards
the South-East, into the Red Sea and Eastern Ocean) that they might bring
Gold, precious Stones, and sweet Gums from <hi>Arabia.</hi> But the Ships could
not sail by the Red Sea unto the Town of <hi>Tharsis,</hi> unless they would have
sailed over the Land, which is impossible, because <hi>Tharsis</hi> lieth into the Land
from the Red Sea, as all Cosmographers agree. So also the Psalmist saith,
<hi>Thou breakest with thy strong Winds the Ships of</hi> Tharsis, that is, of the Sea; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
many such like speeches. From whence St. <hi>Ierom</hi> concludes, that <hi>Tharsis</hi>
may better signifie the Sea, than the City <hi>Tharsis.</hi>

those Strangers they got, or else cast their Bodies unto Dogs to be devoured,
making drinking-cups of their Skulls. But after, when the <hi>Ionians</hi> had built

               <p>
                  <hi>NINVS,</hi> or <hi>Nineveh,</hi> was a City of <hi>Assyria,</hi> where the Emperours of that
Country used to keep their Courts. It was first built by <hi>Ninus,</hi> that great
Emperour of the first Monarchy, 300 years after the flood, and 2000 before
Christ, about the time when the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> was born. It continued
in great glory for the space of almost 1500 years, and was distant from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
toward the North-east 684 miles: upon the East side joyning to the
River <hi>Tygris,</hi> on the North to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. It takes the name from the
Beauty of it, being derived of <hi>Navah,</hi> which signifieth, A comely place, spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and pleasant. There are many that are of opinion, that in many things
it exceeded <hi>Babylon;</hi> as, for the sumptuousness of the Buildings, the strength
of the Walls, and the extent. The Walls were so thick that three Chariots
might have met upon them without any danger; and beautified with an
hundred and fifty Towers. <hi>Ionas</hi> being sent of God to this City, was three
days going through it, that is (as <hi>Luther</hi> expounds it) through every Street
of it; in which time he converted a hundred and twenty thousand to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<hi>Arbaces</hi> (who was called <hi>Arphaxad)</hi> was then Emperour. This <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces,
Iustine lib.</hi> 2. calleth <hi>Arbactus:</hi> he was a Captain of the <hi>Medes,</hi> who
perceiving the effeminate disposition of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> the then Emperour,
taking advantage of the times, and this man's weakness, conspired with
some of his Companions to usurp upon his Government: and that he
might make them hate and loath his looseness, brought them into a Room
where they might see him sitting amongst his Harlots, tired in Womans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
and carding Wool. This sight greatly displeasing them, and before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105162:117"/>
encouraged by <hi>Arbactus,</hi> they seized upon the City, and besieged <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus</hi>
in his Palace. But to prevent the misery of a shameful death, after he
had gathered all his Riches together, he set fire on his Palace, where he,
his companions, and Treasure perished, this fire continued fifteen days, and
happened 823 years before Christ: about which time <hi>Arbactus</hi> succeeded <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi>
began to reign, and continued his Government twenty eight years.
But the <hi>Medes</hi> held not the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire long; for <hi>Phul Belochus,</hi> who at
this time reigned in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his Successor <hi>Tiglath Philasser,</hi> are called
Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi> between whom there happened many great Wars,
2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 15. 26. From whence may be gathered, that after the death of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bactus,</hi>
these Emperours dwelt in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and succeeded in the Empire.</p>
               <p>Thus was this City greatly defaced with continual evils, the Lord before-hand
giving them many admonitions and gentle Corrections (if it had been
in them to have conceived it) to win them to repentance; but they continued
still in their Sins, therefore, according to their former Prophecies, <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
King of the <hi>Medes</hi> besieging this Town, took it, and destroyed it even
unto the Ground, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith. This desolation happened thirteen
years before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the eleventh year of <hi>Sadyattis</hi>
King of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> who was Grandfather to <hi>Croesus, Anno Mundi,</hi>
3349, before Christ, 619.</p>
               <p>After this Destruction it lay a long time desolate, but at length some part
of it was restored, though with much trouble; and then, when it was at the
best estate, constrained to suffer many changes; and at length utterly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the Great the second time, <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 3390. After this,
the Inhabitants of that Country, upon the East side of the River <hi>Tygris,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the third time to build it. But whether this third restoring of this City
was at the command of some Prince that had the Government of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
thereabouts, or because of the scituation, or for private profit, it is not set
down: nevertheless it is again repaired, standing upon the Borders of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
beautified with goodly Buildings, with fair and spacious Streets, compassed
about (as other Cities of the East are) with Walls and Ditches sufficiently
strengthened to oppose the Enemy. But in respect of the former <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
it seems a small Village. It hath a Bridge built of Ships, lying upon the
East side of it over the River <hi>Tygris;</hi> and upon that side of the River there
stand many fair Gardens or Orchards; and the Land there also is very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and pleasant. But upon the West of <hi>Tygris</hi> the Soyl is nothing so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.
At this day it is called by the name of <hi>Mossel;</hi> so that although it stands
in the same place, yet doth it not retain the same name. To this Town there
is a great resort of Merchants, who bring up their Commodities from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Tygris</hi>

parts of the World. The Inhabitants thereof are for the most part <hi>Nestorians;</hi>

among the <hi>Turks,</hi> because it is imagined that one of this Sect helpt <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>

was constrained to steal from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to flie to <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
where God laid a grievous punishment upon him; for his Tongue began to

People with comfortable Doctrine, lest by the destruction of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
(which he prophecied should after happen by the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi>) they
should be driven to desperation. <hi>Paul</hi> took the foundation of his Epistle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> out of this Prophet, reciting a saying of his. <hi>viz. The

650 years before Christ, above 100 years before <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the
Lions den. From whence most of the Learned conclude, that this could
not be that <hi>Habacuck</hi> which brought meat to <hi>Daniel</hi> as he was among the
Lions; but they rather think it a fragment of a spiritual Comedy, and
therefore worthy to be called Apocrypha.</p>

These two Prophets prophecied in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the second year of <hi>Darius</hi>
the Son of <hi>Histaspis,</hi> 519 years before Christ, <hi>An. mun. 3449. Haggai</hi> began his
Prophecy upon the first day of the sixth month <hi>Elul,</hi> answering to the 28 of
<hi>August.</hi>
He sharply reprehended the People because they neglected the
house of the Lord, and built up their own houses.</p>
               <p>In the eighth month <hi>Marhusuan</hi> (which for the most part answereth to our

exhorted the People to repentance, adding the promise of our Saviour, and
that he would turn unto them that would turn unto him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.</p>

prepare his Way and make his Paths strait. <hi>S. Ierom</hi> in his Epistle to

            <div type="section">
               <head>An Instruction how the Prophets may rightly be understood.</head>
               <p>FIRST look into the <hi>Cosmographical</hi> Table at the beginning of this
Book, and diligently observe the Countries and Cities that are there
set down, and how they lie scituated from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Toward the South of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Idumeans, Ismaelites, Arabians</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians</hi> dwell.</p>
               <p>Toward the East, the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Chaldaeans, Babylonians,</hi> and
<hi>Persians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Toward the North, the <hi>Phoenicians, Syrians, Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Armenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Toward the West lieth the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cia, Italy, Spain,</hi> and
the Isles of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this rule is to be observed, that as often as the Prophets speak
of the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> they use these names <hi>viz. Israel, Samaria, Ephrain,
Ioseth, Iesreel, Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Bethaven;</hi> these are the names of the Kingdom
of <hi>Israel:</hi> but to the Kingdom of <hi>Iuda</hi> these names are attributed, <hi>viz. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
Ierusalem, Benjamin,</hi> the house of <hi>David.</hi> But when the Prophets
joyn these two Kingdoms together, they call them by the names of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when thou readest in the Prophets, the name of any Country or
City which is not sufficiently known unto thee, search this Alphabetical Table

               <hi>MORDOCHIVS</hi> was led Prisoner with <hi>Jechoniah</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
was 680 miles.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Babylon</hi> he went to <hi>Susan,</hi> which was 252 miles; there he
brought up <hi>Esther,</hi> his Brothers Daughter, and taught her honest
Discipline and the fear of God. This Maid was very beautiful and comely,
wherefore at such time as <hi>Darius Ahasuerus</hi> (the Son of <hi>Hystaspis)</hi> had caused
all the beautiful Virgins of his Empire to be brought before him, that from
amongst them he might chuse him a Wife; <hi>Mordochius</hi> adorned this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with goodly Apparel, and she also went with them: in whose Presence
(by his Instruction) she behaved her self so well, that the Emperour chose
her from among the rest, and made her his Queen, she being at that time
but a poor Maid, and of small Ability. They were married in <hi>Susan</hi> in the
second year of his Empire, <hi>An. Mun.</hi> 3454, and before Christ, 514. From
whence it is evident, That Preferment cometh neither from the East, nor
from the West, but from the Lord. So these two Journeys make nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

A fit resemblance of that true <hi>Mordochius,</hi> Christ Jesus, who for our Sins and

kept from the Bed of Man. Therefore she was a notable Image of the
Church, who keepeth her self chaste and undefiled, avoiding the Society of
evil Men; and although she seem to be desolate and forsaken in this World,
in respect of the wicked (who flourish like a Flower, and glory in Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Pleasure) yet hath she her <hi>Mordochius,</hi> her Spouse, her dearly
beloved, which provides for her, even Jesus Christ, that immaculate Lamb
which died for her Salvation, and will cloath her in white, put into her
hand a regal Scepter, crown her with Glory, and set her with him in the
Throne of eternal Happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> signifies, A noble Captain, and typically represents God the
Father: for as the Emperour had the Command of 127 Provinces, and in

them did principally Rule; so God our Heavenly Father is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and Governour of all Kingdoms, and all Creatures both in Heaven
and in Earth be obedient to his will; he sitteth in that everlasting Palace
of Heaven, that place of Joy, and that eternal Paradice, from whence he
looketh down to behold us miserable and distressed Creatures upon Earth;
of his merciful Goodness electing and chusing us to be Heirs of that eternal
Kingdom, and purifieth us with the Graces of his holy Spirit, so that we
might be made capable to sit with him in eternal Felicity.</p>
               <p>The disdainful Queen <hi>Vasthy</hi> may be a fit Type and Effigies of this World,
not only in respect of her Pride, but her excess in drinking; taking her
name from <hi>Schatha,</hi> which signifies, To Drink: so this World liveth in
all manner of Prodigality and Luxury; and contemneth the Lord and King
thereof, that Almighty God which sitteth in the Heavens; and therefore
is justly thrown down from that eternal Kingdom; whereas on the contrary,
humble <hi>Esther</hi> (that is, the Church) is taken up into Dignity, and crowned in
that everlasting Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haman</hi> signifies, a Rebellious and Proud Man: being derived of <hi>Haman,</hi>
He hath stirred up a Tumult: typically representing the Devil, whom God
in the beginning made a good Angel, exalted him in the Heavens, and
made him much more Glorious than others; yet notwithstanding, glorying
in himself, he contemned his Maker, and nothing would content him but
to become like unto him, yea he desired to be worshipped of our Lord Jesus
Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And as <hi>Haman</hi> endeavoured to overthrow not only all the

               <p>
                  <hi>JOB</hi> was a holy and good man: he dwelt in the Land of <hi>Vz,</hi> so called of

There were two Towns in this Country, where <hi>Job</hi> is said to have
dwelt; that is <hi>Astaroth Carnaim</hi> and <hi>Batzra: Astaroth Carnaim</hi> was distant
from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> fifty two miles towards the North-East, the Inhabitants of
which Town worshipped the Goddess <hi>Venus,</hi> and called her by the name of
<hi>Astaroth,</hi> of which you may read before. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> saith, That the Sepulchre

In this Town it was thought that <hi>Iob</hi> was born, it lay beyond

North-East. All this Country in those times was subject to the King of the

they having conquered the Kings of <hi>Edom:</hi> you may read more of it in the

Cities of Refuge, appointed by <hi>Ioshuah.</hi> Here <hi>Iob</hi> for the most part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and held this Town in great honour and reputation.</p>
               <p>He lived about the time of <hi>Baela,</hi> the first King of the <hi>Edomites:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of St. <hi>Ierom, Augustine, Ambrose, Philo,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi>
was for his excellent Vertue and singular Piety, chosen King of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which he greatly inlarged, making all the Countries and neighbouring
Princes near adjoyning tributary unto him: wherefore (as <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, in
<hi>locus Hebraicis</hi>) having obtained so large an Empire, he removed his Seat
from <hi>Batzra</hi> to <hi>Astaroth-Carnaim,</hi> which was a strong and well-defenced City,
where in those times (as <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.) there inhabited mighty
men, and noble Heroes; that so by their Vertue he might with the greater
facility suppress and conquer other Provinces.</p>
               <p>There are many think him to be of the Stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the
Family of <hi>Esau,</hi> because he is mentioned in the 36 of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where it is said,
<hi>That when Baela died, Iobab the Son of Zerah of Bozra, or Betzrah, reigned in his

               <p>In the sixth year of his reign <hi>Antiochus,</hi> went with a great Army both by sea
and land (wherein were many Elephants) to <hi>Pelusio,</hi> 400 miles. This City
he conquered, and overcame the Alexandrians in a Naval battel, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Pelusio</hi> (having built a bridge over <hi>Nilus</hi>) he went with his Army to
<hi>Memphis,</hi> conquered all the Countries and strong Cities as he went, about
140. miles, and brought thither a mighty and great prey: where, according
to the saying of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 11. he dealt subtilly with <hi>Ptolomais

               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Memphis</hi> he returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the Citizens would not
suffer him to enter the gates, wherefore he besieged it, but to small purpose;
which was 120 miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Alexandria</hi> he returned to <hi>Pelusio,</hi> which was 160. miles, there he
left a Garrison to retain what he had gotten in <hi>Egypt, 1 Mac.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Pelusio</hi> he returned to <hi>Antiochia</hi> with a great prey, being 400

                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> went the second time from <hi>Antiochia</hi> with
his Army into <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was 560. miles. So passing through
<hi>Coelosyria</hi> and <hi>Iudaea,</hi> he came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which he invaded with open
war, endeavouring to get that by force, which he could not get by entreaty.
But the <hi>Romans</hi> sent <hi>P. Popillius</hi> with other Embassadours, into <hi>Egypt,</hi> who
hearing that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was come to <hi>Leusia,</hi> which was within a mile of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> went thither to him. Where, when he had wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
them, and shewed all the courtesie he could to <hi>P. Popillius, P. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillius</hi>
delivered him certain Tables that he had about him written.
And first of all commanded him to read them, which he did. Then
he counselled with some of his friends, what was best to be done in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105162:130"/>
the business. While he was thus in a great Study, <hi>P. Popillius,</hi> with a wand
that he had in his hand, made a Circle about him in the Dust, saying <hi>E're
thoustir a foot out of this Circle return thy Answer, that I may tell the Senate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou hadst rather have War or Peace.</hi> This he uttered with such a firm
Countenance, that it amazed the King: wherefore, after he had paused a
while, quoth he, <hi>I will do what the Senate hath written, or shall think fit.</hi> So
doing little or nothing in <hi>Egypt</hi> he returned back again. <hi>Iustine, lib. 34.

               <p>From <hi>Leusia, Antiochus</hi> (fearing lest the <hi>Iews</hi> would forsake his Empire
and rebell) went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was 288 miles; but the Inhabitants of
the Town shut him out of the City, wherefore he besieged it, and by the
Treason of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> Chief Priest, (who for that purpose conspired with
the Guard that was in the Castle) quickly got it, and entred the Gates. In
every place where he came he put the Citizens to the Sword, and for three
days space did little else but cruelly massacre the People. He went also with
<hi>Menelaus</hi> into the Temple, where he polluted the sacred things of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and took thence the Vessels of Silver and Gold, or whatsoever he
found precious or worthy: so that the Prey he took amounted to 1800 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which make almost eleven Tun of pure Gold; all which, were partly
Gifts dedicated to the Temple, and partly Treasure that was left there as in
in a safe and sure place, to the use of poor distressed Widows and Orphans.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had robbed the Temple of all the Silver and Gold
that he could find, had banished <hi>Iason,</hi> had placed a strong Garrison in
the Tower of <hi>Acropolis,</hi> (the Captain of which was one <hi>Philip</hi> a very cruel
man) and made <hi>Menelaus</hi> High-Priest; with all this booty and some num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Captives, he returned to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which was 280 miles. In the
Year following, that is, before Christ 166, <hi>Lu. Aemilius Paulus,</hi> triumphed
for the Wars of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Not long after, <hi>Antiochus</hi> misdoubted the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> sent <hi>Apollonius</hi> with an Army of 22000 to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who
entred the City upon the Sabbath day, and committed many Out-rages.</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>Antiochus</hi> having spent a great part of the Gold and Silver which
he had got from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> about the eleventh Year of his Reign made his
Expedition from <hi>Antiochia</hi> to <hi>Persepolis,</hi> (it was also called <hi>Elymaides</hi>) in
<hi>Persia,</hi> which was 196 miles. Here he took the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> spoiled
all that Country round about, and with strong hand gathered together a

But a multitude of Citizens disliking his Sacriledge, banded themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and put <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his Souldiers to flight before he could take
the City of <hi>Persepolis. 1 Mach. 6. 2 Mach.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:105162:131"/>Wherefore being driven from thence, he fled with his Army to <hi>Egbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
a City in <hi>Media,</hi> which was 209 miles. Here, having certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by Letters, of the noble Exploits of <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> and that he
purged the Temple of such things as were prophane, he fell into an extream
Grief, and like one distracted, railed against the <hi>Iews,</hi> and swore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of them, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In this extream Anger he went from <hi>Egbatana</hi> to <hi>Babylon</hi> with his Army,
which was 464 miles. But as he went, his Chariot was overthrown, in the
fall whereof he was so extreamly wounded, that they were constrained to

all his Travels were 8153 miles.</p>
               <p>Thus may we see with what Difficulties and Dangers this wicked Prince
obtained his Victories, and past away his Life, sometimes in Travel, his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
long and troublesom, sometimes in Prosperity, sometimes in Adversity,
again sometimes afflicted with troublesom Cogitations, sometimes with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Anger, seldom in Peace, and then also his Actions savouring of
Violence and Filthiness. From whence it appeareth, That the Wicked, with
more Sorrows, Troubles and Vexations, gain eternal Damnation, that the Just,
tho they suffer many grievous Afflictions, obtain everlasting Salvation. For
amongst all the Patriarchs, good Kings, and Prophets, there is not found
any that had so many long and tedious Journies as this <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who
continually oppressed his Mind and Conscience with unprofitable Vanities
and wicked Thoughts, and at length had a miserable and terrible end.</p>

                  <hi>ANtiochia,</hi> where <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> kept his Court, was anciently
called <hi>Chaemath,</hi> or <hi>Riblah.</hi> It was scituated in <hi>Syria,</hi> 180 miles from
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the North, near to the Cities, <hi>Seleucia, Laodicea,</hi> and
<hi>Apamea,</hi> which four Cities (as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith in the sixteenth Book of his Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy)
were built by <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> first King of <hi>Syria.</hi> This man was a mighty
Prince, and obtained the Name of <hi>Nicanor</hi> (which signifieth Victory) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he prospered in his Wars, and conquered his Adversaries. For, when
(within 13 years after the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) he had got the
Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> he became so great in the 31 year of his Reign, that he
obtained the Empire of all the East; and beside (as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith) re-edified
and built up these four Cities, calling one of them <hi>Antiochia,</hi> after the name
of his Father, another <hi>Laodicea,</hi> after the name of his Mother, a third after
his own name <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and the last <hi>Apamea,</hi> after the name of his Wife.
These four Cities, because they were all built by one man, and at one
time, were called Sisters. But <hi>Antiochia</hi> was much fairer than the other,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105162:131"/>
and in those times was a greater City than any other called after that name;
yea, it was equal to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for glory and excellency of Building.
It was divided into four parts, and those parts separated with four Walls:
The first, which was anciently called <hi>Hemath</hi> (a violent Anger) of <hi>Chama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thai</hi>
the Son of <hi>Canaan;</hi> was after <hi>Riblath,</hi> from the multitude of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
and the third time by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> after his Father's name, called <hi>Antiochia.</hi>
In this part <hi>Seleucus</hi> to dignifie the City, kept his Court, it being compassed
about with Goodly Walls. In the second part the Citizens of <hi>Syria</hi> inhabited.
In the third, <hi>Seleuchus Callimichus</hi> (afterward King of the <hi>Syrians</hi>) kept his
Court, and greatly beautified it. But in the fourth (where afterward many
<hi>Christians</hi> inhabited) <hi>Antigonus Epiphanes</hi> continued, and did greatly adorn
it, and set it forth with goodly buildings and sumptuous Houses. Close by
the City there stood a pleasant Wood, watered with many clear Fountains
and delightful Springs, to which there resorted a great multitude of Fowls
of divers sorts, which sung very pleasantly among the Trees, to the great
content and delectation of the Citizens. In the midst of this Wood stood the
Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> goodly things, and very curiously built. It
was called the Wood of <hi>Daphne,</hi> because it was full of Laurel Trees. From
this Wood all the Country thereabout is called <hi>Epidaphne.</hi> Not far off
standeth the River <hi>Orontes,</hi> which beginneth in <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> and passeth under
the earth till it comes near to <hi>Apamea,</hi> where it riseth and watereth all <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</hi>
So passing thence, it runneth some sixteen miles, and so falls into the

                  <hi>PErsepolis</hi> was the Metropolitan City of <hi>Persia,</hi> distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 1240

who re-edified it and gave it that name; which is as much as to say, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which also of him were so called. The Astronomers,
because he was greatly affected to such as were skilful in that Art, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his name and his Wives name to two Constellations in the Heavens, of
which <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Fable is contributed of <hi>Pegasus</hi> and <hi>Andromache.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City of <hi>Persepolis</hi> was so fair, that it exceeded all the Cities of the East
both for Stateliness, and Beauty, and so continued from <hi>Perseus</hi> time, until <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
the Great had conquered <hi>Darius:</hi> at which time, this great Emperour
having got into his hand the whole Empire of the <hi>Persians,</hi> came to <hi>Persepolis</hi>
in the year before Christ, 329, and there celebrated a great feast in triumph
of his Victories; to which there resorted a great many Women, not such
as were of the better sort, but them that followed the Camp, and lived dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely:
amongst whom was that notable Curtesan <hi>Thais;</hi> who perceiving
the King inclined to Mirth, and full with Wine, began to flatter him in his Cups,
and among other things to commend and dignifie his Noble Exploits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
giving him to understand, how acceptable it would be to the <hi>Grecians</hi>
to see the Royal Palace of the <hi>Persians</hi> fired, which had so often afflicted <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>
No sooner had she uttered these words, but another seconded her, and
then a third. After, the whole assembly cried out, Shall we revenge the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and burn the City? With that they all rose in great fury,
the King himself (being crowned) beginning first to fire the Palace, wherein
was great abundance of Cedar, from whence it happened, that suddenly the
fire spread it self a great way; which when the Army that lay without the
Walls perceived, with all speed came to the City to stay the burning of it,
for which purpose many brought Water with them. But when they beheld
the King himself busie in this Tragedy, laying aside their Water, they also,
in hope of Booty, and to imitate the steps of their Prince, fell to firing the
City, and according to the custom of Souldiers in such Massacres, made a
Prey of what they could get; increasing the fire with dry stuff and other
Combustible matter, whereby it came to pass that the whole City was therew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fired and burnt to the ground. This was the end of that mighty City which
ruled over so many Nations, where so many mighty Princes governed, that
was the scourge of <hi>Grecia</hi> and the greatest part of the World, that sent forth
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105162:132"/>
a Navy of 10000 Ships and an Army of an infinite number: there being an
infinite number; there being at this day nothing to be seen, unless the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Araxes</hi> that ran close by it remaineth. Thus was that consumed in
a fury, which the King and all his Army before endeavoured to spare. But
after it turned to the great shame of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that their King should
fire so famous a City in the midst of his Cups: and <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, after
he had slept, repented what he had done.</p>
               <p>You shall find in 2 <hi>Mac. cap.</hi> 6. That <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> besieged a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
City in <hi>Persia</hi> called <hi>Persepolis,</hi> from whence, for his exceeding Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and Sacriledge, he was forced by the Inhabitants dwelling about
the Town, to raise his Siege and be gone. Therefore some may gather, that
this <hi>Persepolis</hi> before mentioned was rebuilded, because it also stood in <hi>Persia:</hi>
but if you read 1 <hi>Mac. cap.</hi> 6. you shall find, that this City, so besieged by
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> was also called <hi>Elymais,</hi> wherein stood the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi>
beautified with many goodly Ornaments, shining with the splendor of fine
Gold wherewith it was gilt. In which Temple, as saith <hi>Iosephus, lib. Ant.</hi> 12.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great left his Armour and other things. From whence may
be gathered, that this Town was not the <hi>Persepolis</hi> which he caused to be
burn'd, but rather some other Town built out of the Ruines of that City
(according to the opinion of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi>) or else some Village standing
near to it, which being built up and enlarged, might of some be called new
<hi>Persepolis,</hi> though indeed it was anciently called <hi>Elymais,</hi> and all the East part
of <hi>Persia</hi> beyond <hi>Susa,</hi> of that Town called <hi>Elematica,</hi> having some affinity
with <hi>Elam</hi> the ancient name of <hi>Persia,</hi> so called of <hi>Elam</hi> the Son of <hi>Sem
Gen.</hi> 10. Wherefore it may well be concluded, that that <hi>Persepolis,</hi> burnt
down by <hi>Alexander,</hi> was never restored, but lieth waste to this day.</p>
               <p>Thus the Empire of the <hi>Persians</hi> (after they had ruled over the Nations
of the Earth 260 years) was conquered by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who held it 129 years.
At the end of which time, <hi>Demetrius Nicanor,</hi> the last Emperour of the
<hi>Grecians</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> going with a great Army out of <hi>Syria</hi> toward
the East, <hi>Arsaces</hi> King of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> being aided by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Elymais,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> and <hi>Bactrians</hi> meeting him in those parts, gave
him many sharp and cruel Battels, and in the end (under the pretence of
Peace) took him Prisoner, in the year before Christ 137. and from that time
the <hi>Parthians</hi> governed <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Grecia,</hi> and opposed the <hi>Romans</hi> in many
cruel Battels.</p>
               <p>Afterward, in the year of our Lord, 226, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that mighty Lord of

of <hi>Simon,</hi> of whom all that Family was called the Posterity of <hi>Simon,</hi> of the
Stock of <hi>Ioarib,</hi> of whom you may read, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15. He dwelt in a Town
called <hi>Modin,</hi> fourteen miles from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> toward the North-West,
scituated in a Mountain, close by the way as you go to <hi>Ioppa,</hi> in the Tribe
of <hi>Dan. Modin</hi> signifieth a Measure, being derived of <hi>Madad,</hi> he hath
measured. In this place, seeing the cruelty of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and the
Insolence of his Souldiers, he killed one of his Captains, and afterward in
the Synagogue put to death an Idolatrous <hi>Iew,</hi> overthrew the Altar set
up by <hi>Antiochus;</hi> after called forth all the Inhabitants of <hi>Modin,</hi> and other
Towns near adjoyning, to withstand the fury of this King. So they brought
their Goods out of the City, into the Wilderness, where they incamped
themselves, and after, so manfully opposed <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that he delivered all
the Cities and Towns thereabouts out of his Bondage, and from Idolatry.
But being now grown old, (after he had admonished his Sons to Constancy
in the Service of God, and Courage in Defence of the Country) he died in
the year before Christ, 164, and was buried at <hi>Modin,</hi> where afterward his Sons
were buried. <hi>Simon,</hi> his third Son, high Priest of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did marvellously
beautifie this Sepulchre; for he made a Vault of white Marble, compassed
about with fair Pillars, which supported an admirable curious Arch, to
see to as if it had been one stone. Over this Vault, in convenient places,
he built seven Pyramids, in memory of his Father, Mother, his four Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and himself. In the Circumference of this Monument he set up fair
Marble Pillars, upon which he caused to be ingraven Ships, so artificially,
that they which sailed upon the Sea might see them; and upon these he
placed the Arms of his Father, and of his Brethren. You may read more

Christ 164, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3804. and ruled six years. Immediately after
his Father's death, who, as is said, was buried in <hi>Modin,</hi> he led his Army
against <hi>Apollonius,</hi> chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Samaria;</hi> which was thirty miles; here he overcame <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and killed
him with his own Sword, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Seron</hi> (who was also one of <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s chief Captains in <hi>Syria</hi> the
lower) heard that <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> had overcome <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and put him to
death, he was very angry, and said, <hi>I will go and conquer</hi> Judas Machabeus
<hi>and those that are with him, that so I may get my self a name, and be famous
through the whole Kingdom:</hi> so he came out of <hi>Syria,</hi> and pitched his Tents
near <hi>Bethoron</hi> the lower, in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> thirty two miles from <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
But <hi>Iudas</hi> went down to him to <hi>Bethoron,</hi> where he broke into his
Camp, overcame his whole Army, and put him to the Sword, with 8000
of his men, but the rest fled into the Land of the <hi>Philistines, 1 Mac.</hi> 3. These
two Victories he obtained in the first year of his Government, by which
he made the name of <hi>Macchabees</hi> famous through that Kingdom. This
Battel was fought eight miles from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> having certain Intelligence of that which had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the next year made an Expedition into <hi>Persia,</hi> that he might gather
Money in those East parts to make an offensive War against the <hi>Iews;</hi> and
gave Authority to <hi>Lysias</hi> (whom he made Governour in his absence)
to suppress this faction sprung up amongst them. Wherefore <hi>Lysias</hi> sent
40000 Foot and 7000 Horse into <hi>Iury;</hi> and appointed <hi>Ptolomais, Nicanor,</hi>
and <hi>Gorgias</hi> to be Generals of the whole Army. Who, so soon as they had
entered <hi>Iudaea</hi> after Hostile manner, they pitched their Tents near to a
Town called <hi>Emaus, Iosep. lib. Ant. 13. c.</hi> 10. This Town standeth six miles
and somwhat more from <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> assembled his
Army in <hi>Mizpah,</hi> scituated in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> not far from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
six miles from <hi>Bethoron, 1. Mac.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> had implored Gods assistance in his Wars, and
performed many Religious ceremonies, he went with his Army to <hi>Emaus,</hi> which
was four miles: where, coming upon the Enemy in the night and unexpected, he
overcame <hi>Nicanor,</hi> put him to flight, and kill'd 3000 of his men. This Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happened in the third year of <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> his Government,
1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Emaus</hi> he pursued the Enemy to <hi>Gexeron Azotus, Asserimoth</hi> and
<hi>Iamniah,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> which was eight miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:105162:134"/>After, he returned back from pursuing the Enemy with his Army to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
which was eight miles, that he might oppose the Army of <hi>Gorgias;</hi> but <hi>Gorgias</hi>
understanding of the overthrow of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and burning of his Tents, fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> obtained his fourth victory in the third year of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

of the <hi>Graecians</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> six miles from <hi>Emaus,</hi> near to the Castle
or Fortress of <hi>Bethsura,</hi> which signifies, <hi>the house of the Rock,</hi> being a very
strong place, scituated in the top of a high Rock, some half a mile from
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the way which leadeth to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Near to this Castle <hi>Iudas
Macchabeus</hi> overcame <hi>Lysias, Antiochus</hi> his chief General of <hi>Syria,</hi> who had
20000 foot, and 5000 horse in his Army, carrying away a great victory,
and put to the sword 5000 of his men. <hi>Lysias</hi> being thus overcome, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
a Peace with the <hi>Iews,</hi> which was concluded upon the fourth day of

on the fifth day of the month <hi>Caslew,</hi> which is our <hi>December,</hi> celebrated a

all this year made War upon the <hi>Iews:</hi> But after, <hi>Iudas</hi> gathered an army
and went 40 miles into <hi>Idumaea,</hi> and invaded those that were in <hi>Arabathnes,</hi>
and in the Land of the sons of <hi>Bean</hi> (which people troubled the <hi>Israelites</hi>

to take their Castle; where he fired them and it together, 1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 5.
2. <hi>Macch.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Idumaea</hi> he returned back again with his army to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which
was forty miles.</p>
               <p>Afterward he led his Army against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> which lay 60 miles from
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the Northeast, 1. <hi>Macch.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From thence, he went to <hi>Iaeser</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> which was 24 miles;
which he took, and all the Castles thereabouts. This Town <hi>Moses</hi> in times
past conquered, as you may read before 1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iaeser</hi> he returned to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which was 40 miles;</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Ioppa</hi> which was 20 miles; and there he burned
their Haven (for <hi>Ioppa</hi> was a Haven-Town) and those which scaped the fire
he kill'd with the sword, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ioppa</hi> he went to <hi>Iamnia,</hi> which was accounted four miles; where,
in the Night, he fired their Haven, burn'd their Ships, and spoiled their

Town; insomuch as the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which were sixteen miles
off, might easily see the Fire, 2 <hi>Macch.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iamnia, Iudas</hi> went with his army against <hi>Timotheus,</hi> chief Captain
of <hi>Antiochus Eupater,</hi> who continued at the City <hi>Caspin,</hi> which was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than a mile, where he overcame him and 5000 <hi>Arabians,</hi> which
were strengthned with 500 Horse, and took the City, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Afterward <hi>Iudas Macchab.</hi> with his Brother <hi>Ionathan,</hi> led an Army to
<hi>Characa</hi> unto the <hi>Iews</hi> that were called <hi>Tubieni,</hi> which was 96 miles, against
<hi>Timotheus</hi> Governour of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> but he was gone thence and had
done nothing, but left a Garrison in a strong hold. Wherefore <hi>Dositheus</hi>
and <hi>Sosipater</hi> (which were Captains with <hi>Macchab.</hi>) went forth and slew those
that <hi>Timotheus</hi> had left in the Fortress more than 10000 men: <hi>Timotheus</hi>
himself also fell into their hands; but by reason of his fair Speeches, they
suffered him to depart with Life, 2 <hi>Mac. 12. 1 Mac.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Bozor,</hi> a fair City, which was scituated beyond
<hi>Iordan</hi> near to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> it was also called <hi>Bazra,</hi>
which was 24 miles: this Town he took and burned with Fire, <hi>Isa. 64. 1 Mac.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bozor</hi> he went to <hi>Mizpa,</hi> where <hi>Iephtha</hi> some ime sacrificed his
Daughter, which was 32 miles. In that Journey <hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> rescued
the Castle of <hi>Datheman,</hi> drave thence <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and put to the Sword
8000 of his Army. After, he went thence to <hi>Mizpa,</hi> won the Town, burn'd
it with Fire, and put to the Sword all the male Children because the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
had vexed the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> with continual Robbery. After
that, he won many other Towns and Cities thereabouts, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mizpa, Iudas</hi> passed the River, and went to <hi>Astaroth-Carnaim,</hi> which
in the second of <hi>Macchabees</hi> is called <hi>Carnion,</hi> which was eight miles: here
he destroyed the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which the Inhabitants call <hi>Astaroth,</hi> and
put 25000 of the Inhabitants to the Sword. He went also to <hi>Atargation,</hi> a
Town not far off, and took it, and delivered all the <hi>Israelites,</hi> from the
greatest to the least, which were in Captivity amongst the <hi>Giliadites, 1. Mac.</hi> 5.
2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Astaroth-Carnaim</hi> he went to <hi>Ephron,</hi> being 16 miles; this City
<hi>Iudas Macchabeus</hi> destroyed because the Inhabitants thereof denied him
Passage, and went through it over the dead Bodies, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5. Here <hi>Gideon,</hi>
Judge of <hi>Israel,</hi> sometime dwelt; it took the Name from the rising up of the
Dust, being derived of <hi>Aphar,</hi> that is, he hath made a dust.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ephron, Iudas</hi> passed over <hi>Iordan</hi> into the great Field of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and
so went to <hi>Scythopolis,</hi> which in ancient time was called <hi>Bethsan,</hi> which was
four miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bethsan</hi> or <hi>Scythopolis</hi> he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was 44 miles,

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:105162:135"/>After the Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> he went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Maresa,</hi> which

Battel, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Maresa</hi> he went with his Army to <hi>Odullam,</hi> which was six miles

and Castles near adjoyning, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was fifty six miles, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Samaria</hi> he led his Army against <hi>Azotus,</hi> being 44 miles. This
was a City of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> which he destroyed, broke their Altars, and
burn'd their Idols in the Fire, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5. After that, he conquered two Castles
in <hi>Idumaea, 1 Mac.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>After that, he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was accounted 22 miles,

               <p>From <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he went to meet <hi>Timotheus,</hi> chief Captain of the <hi>Syrians,</hi>
who came with a great Army to invade <hi>Iudaea.</hi> But when the Battel wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
hot, there appeared to the Enemies from Heaven, five comely men
upon Horses, with Bridles of Gold, two of which led the <hi>Iews,</hi> and took
<hi>Macchabeus</hi> between them, and covered him on every side with their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
that none could hurt him; but against their Enemies they shot
Darts and Lightnings, so that they were confounded with Blindness, and
beaten down; whereby the <hi>Iews</hi> obtained a great Victory, and put to the
Sword 20500 Foot, and 600 Horse; the rest seeing this great Slaughter,
fled. So <hi>Iudas</hi> praised the Lord, and pursued the Enemies to <hi>Gazara,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sixteen miles. Here <hi>Timotheus</hi> hid himself in a Cave; but the <hi>Iews</hi>
took the City, found him out, and put him to death, together with his

               <p>From <hi>Gazara, Iudas Macchabeus</hi> returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being 16 miles.</p>

to yield by reason of Famine) he followed <hi>Iudas,</hi> with whom he joyned

<hi>Antiochus</hi> of that wicked Antichrist, as the Interpretation of their names

glorifying his Name for all his Benefits; so Christ the Son of God is the
Praise and Glory of his Father, for that in him, and by him, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is praised, as is evident in the Song of <hi>Simeon.</hi> In like manner our Lord
Jesus Christ is worthily called <hi>Macchabeus,</hi> for <hi>Macchabeus</hi> is a sir-name of

used as an Adage; and the Letters at the beginning of these Words
being joyned together into one Word, make the sir-name <hi>Macchabai.</hi>
Therefore as he had always this golden Sentence in his Mouth, so had he
it likewise in his Name, yea, in his Ensigns. Wherefore this name likewise
is worthy to be attributed to Christ; for he is that perfect Image and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

he and his Brother <hi>Simon</hi> went from <hi>Modin,</hi> and pitched their Tents in the
Wilderness of <hi>Tecoah,</hi> near to the Lake of <hi>Asphar,</hi> which was twenty miles.</p>
               <p>From thence they sent their Brother <hi>John</hi> with certain Riches to the <hi>Naba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
which dwelt in <hi>Medaba</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> (twenty eight miles) desiring them
in Friendship to receive their Goods into the Town, and to keep them for
their use: but the Sons of <hi>Iambri</hi> and the <hi>Nabathians</hi> issued out of <hi>Medaba</hi>
unawares, fell upon <hi>John,</hi> put him to death, took away all his Wealth, and
returned into their City with great joy.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> took this injury very heavily, and much bewailed
the death of their Brother: Wherefore, that they might be revenged of the
inhabitants of <hi>Medaba,</hi> they went thence twenty eight miles, and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
among the Mountains, just in the way that led from <hi>Medaba</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi>
for they had heard that the Sons of <hi>Iambri</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Medaba</hi>
were gone forth with great Jollity to fetch home a Bride, which was a Princes
Daughter of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> Now as they were merry upon the way,
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> his Brother, with their Army, went out from among the
Mountains, and put a great number of them to the Sword, taking away a
mighty Spoyl.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Medaba</hi> they went to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> which was three miles, where,
upon the East side of the River they pitched their Tents; here he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to fight a cruel Battel with <hi>Bacchides</hi> upon the Sabboth-day; but
as he was in the fight, he met <hi>Bacchides,</hi> and lift up his hand to strike at him;
but he seeing the danger, retired. Nevertheless he put to the Sword 1000
of his men, and after, he and his Followers leapt into the River and swam over:
so they all escaped without Danger.</p>

near adjoyning, from whence he gathered an Army of Chosen men, and
set upon <hi>Bacchides: Simon</hi> also broke out of the City, and set upon him,
so that they greatly oppressed him and burned his Tents, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               <p>From <hi>Bethbesan, Ionathan</hi> went to <hi>Michmas,</hi> being six miles: here he

be of noble Descent, and the Son of a King, Wherefore <hi>Alexander,</hi> or

Afterward <hi>Apolonius</hi> went into <hi>Iudaea</hi> with a great Army, and besieged <hi>Iamniah.
Ptolomeus Philometor</hi> also assisted the proceeding of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> seeing <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
his Son-in-law beginning to decline; and the better to strengthen their

put him out of his Kingdom, <hi>Ios Ant. li. 3. c.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Now after the death of <hi>Ptolomeus Philimetor, Demetrius Nicanor</hi> returned to
<hi>Antiochia,</hi> 120 miles, where he governed the Kingdom of <hi>Syria</hi> two years.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Antiochia</hi> he went to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> which was 200 miles; to which

many Presents and great Gifts to win his Favour, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ptolomais</hi> he returned to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> 200 miles. There his Souldiers
and the City of <hi>Antiochia</hi> rebelled against him. For which cause, <hi>Ionathan</hi>
the High-Priest sent him 3000 men, which delivered the King out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

Leopard. The Leopard is of the same colour, and of the nature of a Wolf,
being full, he hurteth nothing; but if empty, he preyeth upon every thing;
yea, even upon men: his Breath is very sweet, with which many other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being delighted, he often preys upon them; but being full, he sleepeth
sometimes three days together. The Tyger also is a very swift and cruel
Creature, from whence he is so called; his skin is yellow, and full of black
Spots, round and shining. If the chance to lose her young, she never leaves

               <p>Wherefore <hi>Alcimus</hi> returned thence back again to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> twenty

Monuments of the Priests, to be taken down and destroyed: but before his

               <p>From hence then may easily be gathered, that although the <hi>Iews</hi> had
several Weights and denominations of Silver and Gold, yet only one kind

with their Weights, the rest being only for the common sort,
or particular uses; for although there were divers Sicles, Mina's and Talents
among themselves, yet the common weight (whether it was of Sicle, Mina
or Talent) was usually that which they termed the Talent of the Temple,
and that had a just correspondency with the <hi>Grecian</hi> Talent both in weight

of Gold: and these two were properly belonging to the <hi>Iews.</hi> The
other that follow belonged not to them, but they received them from other
Nations; as the <hi>Stater, Drachmon,</hi> and <hi>Adarchon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Stater</hi> was an ancient piece of Gold, common amongst the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other great Governments, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by the Superscription of the Kings or Countreys where they
were made or coined; as the <hi>Stater Philippici, Stater Darici, Stater Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrei,
Stater Romani,</hi> &amp;c. They were pure fine Gold, some of which were
as much in value as a double Ducat, others as four <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ducats, and
some as <hi>Portugues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Drachmon,</hi> (of which you may read, <hi>Ezra 8. 27, &amp;c.</hi>) is a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Coin, as it seems, for the <hi>Grecian</hi> Interpreters call it <hi>Drachmen,</hi> which
is as much more as the <hi>Attick Drachma,</hi> and in our money is worth
7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adarchon</hi> also seems to be a <hi>Persian</hi> Coin, and doth imply the name
of a Prince, or <hi>Daricum</hi> signifies the Gold of the <hi>Persians:</hi> For <hi>Darius</hi> the
Son of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> then reigned, when these <hi>Nummus</hi> of Gold, thus called,
were dedicated to the Building of the Temple; and this man, for the
most part, coined singular good Gold, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Melpom.</hi> saith: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were either called <hi>Darici,</hi> because they wee coined by the <hi>Persian</hi>
Kings, or else, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Artax.</hi> observes, because the Image of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
stood upon one part of it. And was worth of our money seven shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and six pence.</p>
               <p>Thus you may perceive what diversities of Weights were used amongst
the <hi>Iews;</hi> being crept in amongst them, partly because of their Captivity,
and partly because of their Commerce and Trade with other Nations. It
is therefore worthy of observation, that if at any time you read of any
weight of Money, Brass, or the like, in the Holy Scripture, to consider
of what sort of Weight it is, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a Weight of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or some
Foreign and strange Weight. If of the <hi>Iews,</hi> whether it be the common
Sicle, the King's Sicle, or the Sicle of the Temple. But if these may be
discerned, you shall for the most part find the Addition, which may easily
distinguish them. But if there be no addition, that is the King's Sicle, or
the Sicle of the Temple, then you may presume that it is the common Sicle.
And so for other Weights and Monies.</p>

him in a year, that is 365 Chenixes; which in our Measure, at three Pints
the Chenix, comes to eight Bushels, two Pecks, and a Pint; and 365 Pints of
Wine, that is, forty five Gallons, a Pottle, and a Pint: so much did every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
eat and drink in a year. But God fed the <hi>Israelites</hi> forty years in the
Wilderness with a greater quantity; for he gave each man daily an Omer
(that is, three Chenixes) of Manna, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Gallon and something more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his eighth Oration for <hi>Verres,</hi> writes, that a Modius of Wheat
(which was a Peck wanting a Pint) was commonly sold in <hi>Sicilia</hi> for three
Sestertio's, about 6 d. sterling, and so much had every Servant in <hi>Grecia</hi> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and a Pint of Wine to drink.</p>
               <p>These Customs, howsoever in these Countries they might be tolerable, in
regard they lived in a hot Climate; yet to us, where it is much colder, our
Bodies require a greater quantity for Nourishment: nevertheless, a mean and
spare Diet is both more healthful and profitable for the body, than excess;
because the Stomach being surcharged, it cannot duely concoct that which
it receiveth, whereby the Body is filled with many Crudities and noisom Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</p>
               <p>And thus have I, as exactly as I can, reduced the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
Measures to ours: but if there be any who in casting up these quantities of
Measures mentioned in the Scripture, shall chance to find any errour, or
would reduce them to a more near Estimation (because I have in this Treatise
principally followed <hi>Budaeus</hi>) to our Measures, he is then to understand, that
there is another course to be taken, namely by Weight; four ordinary
Spoonfuls of Water weigh an Ounce, 12 Ounces of Troy weight make a
pound, 8 Pounds of Troy weight make a Gallon, and 32 Gallons make a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The same course may be taken in the account of Corn-measures
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105162:163"/>
there going eight Gallons after the same proportion to a Bushel. So that
what I have set down may be rectified by your own industry, and made
more capable to your understanding.</p>

            <head type="sub">Wherein is contained the Travels of the Virgin Mary,
and Joseph; also of the Wise men of the East, of
our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of his Apostles.</head>
            <p>BUT since I have briefly related the Travels of the antient Patriarchs,
Judges, Kings, and Prophets, (which things I know cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
unto such as are judicious) mentioned in the <hi>Old Testament;</hi>
that I might make a perfect end of what I have begun, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and shew unto you the Travels of all the holy Men and Women
mentioned in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> where, by due observation of this discourse,
you may well understand, that as all the Nations of the World were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from one man, that is, <hi>Adam;</hi> so all the Righteous, and such as are
to be saved, are derived from one man, that is, <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> For, as by
the first <hi>Adam</hi> Sin came into the World, and by Sin, Death and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so by the second <hi>Adam</hi> that Sin is pardoned, and Man made partaker
of Eternal happiness. And that these things might be the more apparent
unto thee, I have described the Towns, Cities, and Places mentioned in
their several Travels; both what they were in former times, and what
they are at this present: that so by the due consideration of both, thou
might'st observe the mutation and change of Estates; since, through the
revolution of Times, those things which seem most permanent, have
within the compass of a few years been subverted, and the ruines of those
Cities which have been greatest, left to make evident lamentable Examples
of vast and unheard of destructions; from whence, such as have any small
knowledge of the Spirit, may draw such comfortable resolutions, that
neither Poverty can subvert them, nor Riches and Honour exalt them; but,
according to S. <hi>Iames,</hi> ca. 1. <hi>they may possess themselves in peace;</hi> since
neither the Prosperity of the World is permanent, nor the adversity thereof
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105162:165"/>
intolerable. The knowledge of both which, howsoever to some it may
seem ridiculous, yet to such as are at all touched with the sense of Worldly
Affairs, it cannot chuse but take a deep impression, and draw them thence
to the knowledge of Christ Jesus, and of his Doctrine. To which end, and
for which purpose, I have principally endeavoured to publish this Treatise, that
so comparing the Estate of man in this present World, with the Estate of
Grace in the World to come, they might perceive the impotency of the one,
and the permanency of the other, and from both draw immoveable Axioms,
that there can be no Salvation where there is no Humility, nor no Prosperity
where there is not a knowledge of Christ Jesus in his Humanity: and thence
gather, that the afflictions of this World, to which he is most subject through
the whole course of his Life, is the ready means to honour and immortal
Glory. But that these things may the better appear unto thee, I will endeavour
to lay before thee the Beginning, and (so far as the holy Scripture leads me)
the ending of our Saviour. From whence thou may'st draw such comfortable
Resolutions, that in what Estate soever thou art, whether in Prosperity or
Adversity, thou may'st therewith rest content, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Nazareth.</head>
               <p>THIS was a Town almost of no estimation; scituated in a certain
Mountain in <hi>Galilee</hi> the lower, sixty four miles and something more
from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the North, in the Tribe of <hi>Zabulon.</hi> In this Town
our Saviour Jesus Christ was brought up, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 2. Some say that it was
nineteen or twenty miles from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but they mistake themselves;
yet I will not dispute thereof, but follow my Authors, <hi>Iacobus Ziglerus,</hi> and
<hi>Tilmanus Stella.</hi> There is not any mention made of it, that is extant in the
Old Testament. It hath a two-fold derivation, the one by <hi>Zain,</hi> and the
other by <hi>Zade.</hi> If it be written by <hi>Zain,</hi> it may have a two-fold significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
since the exposition of this name doth depend upon the Verb <hi>Nazar,</hi>
which signifies, to consecrate and keep; from hence <hi>Nezaer, a Garland of
Flowers, or a Crown set with pretious Stones, &amp;c.</hi> such as Kings and High-Priests
are accustomed to wear. Also from the same word <hi>Nazar,</hi> is derived <hi>Nazir,</hi>
and thence <hi>Nazaraeus,</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>He is separated from the
use of Wine; and suffering his Hair to be un-cut,</hi> as being dedicated to the
Lord. Therefore our Saviour Christ is justly called a <hi>Nazarite, Luke</hi> 2.

                     </gap>aezer</hi> first signifies a holy man, who hath made a holy Vow unto the
Lord: Secondly, it doth denote <hi>a Crown or wreath of Sincerity, Exod.</hi> 29. 39.
Thirdly, <hi>a holy Ointment, wherewith Kings and Priests were anointed, Levit.</hi> 27.
And fourthly, this word <hi>Nezaer</hi> signifies, <hi>a Princely Crown, 2 Sam. 1. 2. Kings</hi> 11.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 132. So that <hi>Nazareth,</hi> being derived of <hi>Nazar</hi> and <hi>Nazir,</hi> may
signifie both <hi>a Crown,</hi> and <hi>a holy City, Iudg.</hi> 13. but if <hi>Nazareth</hi> be written
by <hi>Zade,</hi> it signifies a <hi>flourishing plant or Graff,</hi> according to that of <hi>Isay,</hi>
c. 11. <hi>But there shall come a rod forth of the stock of</hi> Ishai, <hi>and a Graff shall grow
out of his root, and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.</hi> The Inhabitants of
this Town at this day shew certain Monuments and Reliques of what had
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105162:167"/>
happened in preceeding Ages: as, two Churches, one built there where
the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> saluted the Blessed Virgin, and she conceived by the Spirit;
in which there stands three Altars, hew'n out of a Rock: and the other
built (as they say) where the house of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> stood, because there
our Saviour Christ was brought up. Also they shew a Well, where the
Child Jesus drew Water, and ministred to his Mother; they also shew the
vast Ruins of the Synagogue where our Saviour Christ expounded the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
first Chapter of <hi>Isay,</hi> for which cause they would have thrown him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
down the Hill, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. and many other things, of which you may
read in <hi>Borchardus</hi> the Monk. In Saint <hi>Ierom</hi>'s time, some forty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

shew the place where our Saviour Christ was born, which stood upon the
East side of the City, close by the Wall thereof; where, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,
<hi>Hellen,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, caused to be built a fair and
stately Church, three hundred and twenty years afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Nativity of
Christ. This Church was dedicated to St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and remaineth to this
day, being had in great honour, both amongst the <hi>Christians,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi>
and <hi>Saracens.</hi> This Church is such a stately building, that it is thought to
exceed all the Churches of Christendom, for Beauty and curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship:
It is two hundred twenty eight Foot long, and eighty seven Foot
wide, being built all of Marble of divers colours, and covered with Lead:
there are in it four rowes of Marble Pillars, wonderful to look upon, not
only in regard of their number but of their greatness, for there is fifty Pillars
in every row. The Body of this Church, the Pillars from the bottom to the
top, the Walls, and every part of it, is beautified with lively Pictures, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105162:167"/>
with divers Colours, Silver, Gold, and curious Workmanship, so as it is
wonderful to behold. The Pavement of it is of Marble, polished, and
of divers colours, so cunningly set in Works, and with such variety, that
it is very delightful to such as look on it. There is painted on the Pillars
and Walls, almost all the Stories of the Old Testament, till the Birth of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with such excellent cunning, and so
lively, that it is to be admired. In the Quire of this Church there is found
two Altars, one close by the Chappel of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> at the East end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
not far distant from which, they shew the place where our Saviour was
circumcised: and in the middle of the Quire there standeth another Altar,
where they say the Wise men left their Dromedaries, and prepared their
Gifts to present unto our Saviour, when they worshipped him. Upon the
South side of this Quire, towards the East, they descend by ten stone steps
into the Chappel of the <hi>Nativity of Christ,</hi> richly beautified, and curiously
wrought, paved with polished Marble. This Chappel is not very great,
but wonderful fair and sumptuous. When the Holy Land was over-run
by the Gentiles, this (as many other places were in that Country) was all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with Filth and Dirt, that they had much ado to make it clean a great while
after. Upon the place where they said our Lady the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
brought forth our Saviour into the World, there is placed a Table of white
Marble, after the manner of an Altar: about some four Foot from this they
shew the place where the Manger stood, a part of it yet remaining, cut out of
a Rock, not of Marble, but of other stone, as many other Mangers are in that
Country. Close by that there is an Altar, where they say the Wise men
presented their Gifts to our Saviour Christ, and worshipped him. At the
entrance into the Church, there standeth a goodly Building, which in
times past seemed to have been some Arch-Bishops See, but now is called
St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church. Upon the North side, they descended by certain steps
into the Chappel of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who lay a long time buried there, till his Bones
were removed thence to St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About a mile from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> Southward, stood the Tower of <hi>Eder,</hi>
being a Watch-Tower of the <hi>Bethlehemites,</hi> and so called, because there
resorted thither many flocks of sheep: for <hi>Aeder</hi>

                  </gap>ignifieth a Herd. Round
about this Tower were fair and fruitful Pastures, to which many Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
resorted to feed their Flocks; to some of which Shepherds the Angels
told the glad tidings of the Birth of our Saviour, and that he was laid in a
Manger at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> For which cause, in after times there was a Church
built just in the place where the Tower stood; and in Saint <hi>Ierom</hi>'s time
called by the name of <hi>Angelos ad Pastores:</hi> the same <hi>Luther</hi> affirmeth, that
it is yet standing. <hi>Iacob</hi> sometime dwelt in that Place, and buried his wife
<hi>Rachel</hi> thereabouts. The Monument that he set upon her grave remaineth
to this day, which was twelve Stones pitch'd an end, standing about a quarter
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105162:168"/>
of a mile from this place, upon the right Hand as they go to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> of
which Grave, all the Country thereabouts is called by the name of <hi>Rachel.</hi>

               <p>BEtween <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> lieth <hi>Arabia Petraea:</hi> a Land for the most part
barren and unfruitful, full of Sands, Rocks, and Mountains, destitute
of Water, and subject to many dangers: being in the Summer Solstice scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with extremity of heat, the Sun being then perpendicular over them
(according to <hi>Munster</hi>) in the day time; and in the night, troubled with
extream Winds, which, blowing the Sand with great violence, it casteth
it upon great heaps and Mountains, by which dust, both Beasts and sometime
men are suffocated and slain.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there dwelt in this Desart, a rude and dangerous People, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Saracens;</hi> who take their beginning from <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and are therefore also
called <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> being given to cruelty and malitiousness. They get their
living, for the most part, by Theft and Violence: and as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was an
excellent Archer, so they also are very cunning in shooting and hunting,
using to this day their ancient evil custom of robbing and spoiling all that
pass that way; insomuch as Merchants are constrained to go in great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
lest they should be indangered by them, and by reason of the
Winds and Sands, are constrained to guide their Journey by the Compass,
as men do that sail upon the Sea. Through this Wilderness did <hi>Ioseph</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> pass, when they went with the Child Jesus out of <hi>Iudaea</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi>
where they were in danger of Thieves, subject to be smothered by the Sands,
constrained to travel over high Rocks and Mountains, and to rest in Fear,
because of Lyons, Bears, and other Beasts which greatly abound in that
Place. Besides, divers other discommodities were incident unto them, as
want of Meat, Drink, and other necessaries, there being little Water to be
found there, insomuch as had not the Lord by an express command charged
him in a dream to go down into <hi>Egypt, Ioseph</hi> durst hardly have ventured
upon so difficult and dangerous a Journey. But the Lord so mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for him, that he both went and returned safe. Thus may we see to
what dangers these good People were exposed, and what miseries they sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the beginning because of their Son Christ Jesus.</p>

many of the People and Philosophers of the <hi>East</hi> came to have a taste of the

account and estimation amongst the <hi>Magi:</hi> so that they diligently perusing
those Books, came not only to the knowledge of God, but also without doubt,
to the knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ, whom they called the <hi>Star</hi> of
<hi>Iacob;</hi> from whence may be concluded, that the Wise-Men that came to
see our Saviour Christ, were rather of <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> than of <hi>Zaba</hi> in <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia.</hi>
               </p>

<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was 920 miles; saying, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the
Iews? for we have seen his Star in the East, and are come to worship him.</hi>
This hapned in the month of <hi>January,</hi> in the second year after the birth of our
Saviour; for <hi>Herod</hi> in the seventieth year of his age caused all the male
Children of the <hi>Bethlemites</hi> of two years old and under (according to the
time that he was told of the Wise Men) to be put to the Sword.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they went to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which was six miles, where,
upon the sixth of <hi>January</hi> they offered their Presents which they brought
out of <hi>Persia,</hi> to our Saviour; <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, as to a King; Frankincense, as to
a Priest; and Myrth, as to a Mortal man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. So let us offer unto
Christ our Saviour, the Gold of Faith and heavenly Doctrine; the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense
of earnest Prayers, and the Myrrh of Patience in the midst of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>Afterward, the Wise-Men (as they had been warned in a dream) return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another way to <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> which was 920 miles. So their Travels

               <p>SInce this Star appeared in the lower Region of the Air, (as it is apparent it
did) from thence it may be concluded, that it neither was any of the
fixed Stars, Planet, or a Comet, because they commonly are seen in the
upper Region of the Air; but rather, according to the opinion of some, it
was an Angel of God, appearing in the form of a bright shining Star, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Wise Men in their way they went to the Town of <hi>Bethlem;</hi> and so by
little and little descending from the sublimity of the Air, pointed out unto
them the very house where they might find <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord,
and the Child Jesus; almost after the same manner as the Angel of the Lord

like a cloudy Pillar, and in the night like a flaming Fire, to direct them
their way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 14. 34. Wherefore this Star without doubt was no
natural Apparition, which happened in the inferiour Region of the Air, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
vanishing away; but, as I have said, an Angel of the Lord representing
the form of a Star. Or else, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, a certain miraculous new Star,
which, according to the opinion of <hi>Augustine,</hi> was governed by an Angel of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:105162:169"/>
the Lord; and for the greatness of the Body, and variety of the Aspects, was
not seen first in the Land of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> but in <hi>Persia,</hi> a Country in the East, where
the <hi>Magi</hi> dwelt, and accompanied thence into <hi>Iudaea.</hi> And although for a
short space it left them in their Journey, yet when they came in the way to
<hi>Bethlem,</hi> it appeared to them again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. As <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
observe, the Star appeared upon the day of the Conception of Christ, being
the twenty fifth day of <hi>March;</hi> about which time the Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
spoke with the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1. and was seen for a whole year and
forty one weeks, that is, till the sixth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the beginning of the

years; and therefore <hi>Herod</hi> caused all the Male-children of the <hi>Bethlehemites</hi>
of two years old and under, to be slain according to the time declared unto him
by the Wise-men. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. Wherefore this new Star did first fore-shew the Birth

four miles) and within a short time after, that is, upon the seventh day of

sent Messengers unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> he then remaining at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> to know
whether he was the Christ, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or some other Prophet, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. Upon
the eighteenth day of <hi>September,</hi> the same Year, <hi>Iohn</hi> entred upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year of his Ministry; about which time, <hi>Caiphas</hi> began to enter upon
the Office of the High Priest, and the Sadducees and Pharisees to persecute
<hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. Wherefore he departed from <hi>Bethabara,</hi> and went to <hi>Aenon,</hi>
a City in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which was twenty four miles.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Iohn</hi> had preached publickly and freely, by the space of a whole

he was taken and led Prisoner from <hi>Aenon</hi> to the Tower of <hi>Macheruntes,</hi> which
was twenty eight miles; where he remained untill his Death. So all his

crucified him; but they which were besieged in the Town, seeing the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lamentations this young man made, promised <hi>Bassus,</hi> if he would spare
his Life, to yield up the Town, which he did; so the Castle being taken,
the Gates of the City were set open. But the <hi>Romans</hi> fell to the Slaughter
without Mercy, and put to the Sword 1700 Persons, besides, there were a

               <p>CHrist, in the thirtieth year of his age, went from <hi>Nazareth</hi> and came
to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> which stood upon the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi>

of the last Week spoken of by <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 9. was there baptized,
at whose baptism the testimony of the Spirit descended down upon him in the
likeness of a Dove; which was fifty two miles.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iordan,</hi> Jesus was led by the Spirit into the Wilderness to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Devil, and there fasted forty dayes and forty nights: at the end
of which time, the Devil came and tempted him. How this Wilderness was
called, the Evangelist doth not specifie; but it is to be thought that it was the
Desart of <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> and that our Saviour Christ fasted upon the mountain
of <hi>Sinai,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> fasted forty dayes and forty nights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.

Country of <hi>Trachonites,</hi> to the mountain of <hi>Libanus.</hi> Therefore our Saviour
Christ might that present seventh day of <hi>October</hi> whereon he was baptized
come into this Wilderness; and by little and little go thence to Mount

to tempt our Saviour in, than where the Law was delivered, which is
the power of Sin: for although the Son of God was without Sin, yet he
took upon him the Sins of all the World, <hi>Levit. 16. Joh. 1. Isa.</hi> 53. So then
our Saviour Christ (according to this supputation) continued in the Desart
from the seventh day of <hi>October</hi> to the sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> which was
forty dayes and forty nights. <hi>Epiphanius, lib. 2. Tom. 1. Haeres.</hi> 51. saith, that
our Saviour Christ was baptized upon the eighth day of <hi>November,</hi> which
was the twelfth day of the month <hi>Athyr</hi> amongst the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> but this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is false, and altogether repugnant to the certain Mathematical cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, upon the seventeenth day of <hi>November,</hi> our Saviour Christ hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
<hi>Mat. 4. Mark 1. Luke</hi> 4. and then the Devil, with an extraordinary bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
came unto him, and carried him from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with great violence
through the Air, and set him upon the top of a Pinacle of the Temple in
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was 120 miles: this Pinacle was so exceeding high, (as you
may read in the description of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) that whosoever lookt down
from it into the Valley of <hi>Cedron,</hi> their eyes dazled, and it seemed as though
there had been Clouds in the bottom of the Valley; for it was 600 foot
from the bottom to the top, From this place the Devil bid our Saviour
Christ throw himself down <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>From the Pinacle of the Temple, the Devil took our Saviour Christ and
set him upon a high Mountain; but what Hill it was, or how called, the
holy Evangelist doth not set down. The Inhabitants of the holy Land
think it was the Hill that stood betwixt <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Ai,</hi> upon which Hill in
times past <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. But that Hill is not very high, and
there are many higher Hills in the holy Land: wherefore it is to be thought
that he was carried upon the top of that high Mountain <hi>Nebo,</hi> which
was also called <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and stood 24 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Eastward, where
God shewed unto <hi>Moses</hi> all the holy Land beyond <hi>Iordan, Deut.</hi> 34. And
in this place, as God had shewed <hi>Moses,</hi> so the Devil shewed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

                  <hi>All

the Feast of the Passover, which was 56 miles, and there cast out of the Temple

               <p>When he had travelled from <hi>Sichar</hi> to <hi>Cana</hi> (a City in <hi>Galilee</hi> the lower,
which was 32 miles, where he had changed water into wine) there was a
certain Ruler came unto him, whose Son lay sick at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> 20 miles
distant, and besought him to heal his Son; our Saviour told him that his
Son was made whole: so he believed, and his Son was made whole the same
hour. This was the second miracle that our Saviour Christ did, <hi>Io.</hi> 4. It
is thought that this Rulers name was <hi>Chuza,</hi> of whom there is mention
<hi>Luk.</hi> 8. and was <hi>Herod</hi>'s Procurator; whose Wives name was <hi>Iohanna,</hi> which
signified Gracious. This Woman ministred of all her substance unto Christ,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. So these Travels were 192 miles.</p>

               <p>THis was a City of the lower <hi>Galilee,</hi> where our blessed Saviour Christ
turned Water into Wine, being distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 68 miles
Northward. The place where our Saviour wrought this Miracle is to be
seen at this day; but it is within the Ground, and you must descend by certain
steps before you can come at it, because (as it, seems) there have been
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:105162:173"/>
many Churches and Buildings set upon it, which being sundry times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
the ruins thereof have raised the Earth in such sort, that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Place is as it were hidden and laid under the earth, as is also the place
of the Anuntiation of the Nativity of our Saviour Christ, and many other
where he wrought Miracles; to which they do descend down under the earth
by steps. Upon the North side of this Town stood a round Hill, and
upon the South a goodly Plain; being called <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> to put di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between it and another Town called after the same name, which
stood upon the borders of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Asser;</hi> in which
the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman, or <hi>Syrophoenicean</hi> dwelt, which besought Christ to
heal her Daughter, who was possessed of a Devil, <hi>Mat. 15. Mark</hi> 7. Which
was called <hi>Canah</hi> the greater, as this was called <hi>Canah</hi> the less, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
each from the other 44 miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canah</hi> was so called, because round about it grew Reeds, and there were
many moorish and waterish grounds, whereof the Town took the name. For
<hi>Canah</hi> signifies a Reed: which is a fit type of the Church; for, as our Saviour
Christ at this Town (which stood in a moorish and Reedy place) graced the
marriage with an extraordinary Miracle; so likewise will he grace the
marriage of his Church (though troubled with miseries and afflictions in
this World, tossed to and fro like a wavering Reed) with the glorious
presence of his gracious countenance, and in the World to come crown
it with Eternal Glory.</p>

it was a goodly Market Town, and had as well relation to <hi>Tyrus</hi>

and Consolation; since our Saviour Christ dwelt there, who with his
Doctrine and preaching refreshed and comforted all such as were afflicted
with the Burthen of their Sins. But the great men that were Inhabitants of
this City, had more respect to their private profit, than to the Doctrine and
Miracles that Christ wrought among them; from whence it came to pass,
that they did as it were neglect and contemn that Good which God had
offered to them: which made our Saviour say, <hi>And thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which
seemest to be exalted up unto Heaven, shall be cast down into Hell: for if the
Miracles had been done in</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>which have been done in thee,
they had continued until this day. Verily, verily, I say unto you, it shall be easier
for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Iudgment, than for thee, Mat.</hi> 11. For
there was no such benefit offered to any City, neither such Honours and
Dignities, as were to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> our Saviour himself dwelling there. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for their Ingratitude and Impiety, the City hath divers times been
wasted and destroyed, as well by the <hi>Romans</hi> as other Nations; so that at
this day, this Glorious City is become so Desolate, that there is scarce eight
Houses standing, and they also like small Sheds.</p>

               <head>Of Sichar.</head>
               <p>IN antient time this Town was called <hi>Sichem,</hi> of which you may read
more both in the Travels of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Abimelech.</hi> After it came to be
called <hi>Sichar,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> because the
Inhabitants of that Country were given to Pleasure and Voluptuousness, the
greatest part of their Delight being in drinking and quaffing: so <hi>Sichar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
derived of <hi>Schachar,</hi> signifieth, to be Drunk, or inordinately to swallow
sweet and pleasant Wine, of which there was plenty in that Town, made of
the Juice of Apples, the Fruit of Palm-Trees, and Honey, which may very
well resemble Hipocras or Metheglin, as some Authors have it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by the Incursions of the <hi>Romans</hi> it was utterly wasted and left De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
yet in succeeding times it was re-built, and called <hi>Nicapolis,</hi> that is,
a New Town. It is scituated very pleasantly, and aboundeth with all
manner of Delights; but it is unfortified, neither can it by any means be
fortified; neither have the Inhabitants any help, if they be oppressed by the
Enemy, but to fly: for it is scituated in the middle of a Valley, between
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105162:174"/>
two high Mountains, so that a man may fling a stone from the top of one of
them into the City. About two Bows shot without the South Gate of this
Town, is to be seen the Fountain or Well of <hi>Iacob,</hi> upon the Brim of which
our Saviour Christ sate when he was weary, as we may read in the fourth of
<hi>Iohn.</hi> This Well standeth just in the way as Pilgrims travel to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
Upon the right hand above this Well, there standeth a Mountain of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
height, divided into two tops, the one of them being called <hi>Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
the other <hi>Hebal.</hi> In Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> the Patriarch <hi>Ioshuah</hi> built an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and the People standing upon Mount <hi>Hebal,</hi> he caused the whole Book
of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to be read over, with the Blessings and Cursings, so that all
the People might hear them; for thus we read in <hi>Ios. 8. The one half of the
People stood close by Mount</hi> Gerizim, <hi>and the other by Mount</hi> Hebal, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi>
chap. 27. These two great Mountains began upon the right side of the City
<hi>Sichar,</hi> and extended themselves in length to the City of <hi>Iericho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the left side of this Well is to be seen the Ruins of a great Town,
which is thought to be the old <hi>Sichem,</hi> and by the Reliques that remain there,
it may be judged to have been a very goodly City. For there are yet to be
seen certain broken Pillars of Marble, as also large and spacious Buildings,
which in times past, without Question, have been very goodly things, and
standeth wonderful pleasantly; the Soil round about it being very pleasant
and fruitful, only there is want of Water. This Town lieth some two Bows shot
from <hi>Sichar,</hi> and the Inhabitants of that place judge this <hi>Sichar</hi> to be <hi>Thebez,</hi>
where <hi>Abimelech</hi> died, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. Not far from <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Well, is to be seen
that piece of Ground which <hi>Iacob</hi> gave to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> more than the rest of his
Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. It is a long Valley, very fruitful and pleasant, where
there lies butied, in a certain fair Garden, the Bones of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
which were brought out of <hi>Aegypt, Iosh.</hi> 24. the Reliques of which Sepulchre
are yet to be seen. Mount <hi>Garizim</hi> or <hi>Gerizim,</hi> is so called from the cutting
down of Trees: for <hi>Garaz</hi> signifies, to cut down. Upon this Mountain is
to be seen (even to this day) the place where the Temple stood, that was
built by <hi>Sanballath,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> in contempt of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Priest of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of whom you may read, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. But some 200

               <head>The Travels of our Saviour Christ in the second year of his Ministry;
which was the two and thirtieth year of his age.</head>
               <p>IN the Month of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> Christ went from <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
which was eight miles. Here, upon the Sabbath-day, he went into
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105162:175"/>
the Synagogue, and began to teach, insomuch as the Inhabitants were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at his Doctrine: but the Citizens being ingrateful, he went to <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi>
a City which I have chosen to dwell in before all others, <hi>Luke 4. Mat.</hi> 4.
being twelve miles, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> he compassed about all <hi>Galilee,</hi> preaching the
Gospel of the Kingdom of God, healing the Sick, and those that were diseased
amongst the People, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. In this Visitation our Saviour went to <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
Philippi,</hi> which was distant from <hi>Capernaum</hi> forty eight miles toward
the North. Here <hi>Matthew</hi> was called, as he was at the receipt of Custome;
and the Woman was healed of her Bloody Issue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. But that <hi>Matthew</hi>
was called about this time, the circumstances of times make evident; for, a
little after the second Passover of our Saviour Christ, the same <hi>Matthew</hi> was
chosen to be an Apostle, <hi>Luke 5. 6. Mat. 9. Mark</hi> 2. In the Month of <hi>March,</hi>
the Inhabitants of the Towns which Christ visited in <hi>Galilee,</hi> brought unto
him many that were possessed of Devils, and afflicted with other Diseases,
all which he healed: insomuch that there followed him a great company
out of <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Decapolis,</hi> and from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and of all the
Countries beyond <hi>Iordan, Mat.</hi> 3. Thus having finished this Visitation, as
it may be thought, he returned back to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he dwelt, as I have
told you before, which was forty eight miles; for <hi>Caesarea Philippi</hi> stood so
far from <hi>Capernaum.</hi>

               <head>The second Passover of the Ministry of Christ.</head>
               <p>A little after these things were finished, was the Feast of the <hi>Iews, Iohn</hi> 4.
and Jesus went up to <hi>Ierusalem, Iohn</hi> 5. to celebrate the Feast of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
which this year happened a little before Harvest, which was 56 miles.
This second Passeover of the Ministry of Christ fell upon the six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day of <hi>March,</hi> at which time Christ celebrated the Passover with his
Disciples, according to the Law of God. Here, upon the Sabbath day,
being the last day of <hi>March,</hi> he healed a certain man that lay by the Pool
of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> which had been diseased eight and thirty years, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. And at the
end of the Passover he went with his Disciples from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> through the
Corn Fields: but his Disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears of Corn,
and to eat them; wherefore the Pharisees being offended at them, began
to reprehend our Saviour Christ and his Disciples: upon which followed
the disputation concerning the Sabbath, <hi>Luke 6. Matth</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Upon the seventh day of <hi>April</hi> he went on the Sabbath day to <hi>Peraea,</hi>
which Country was in the Command of <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> and there he healed
a man with a dried hand, <hi>Luke 6. Mark</hi> 3. The Country of <hi>Peraea</hi> beyond
<hi>Iordan,</hi> is distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> twenty miles.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Herodian</hi> Council heard that he had healed a man on the
Sabbath day, they sought occasion how they might do to put him to death,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105162:175"/>
wherefore our Saviour Christ went thence to the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which was
40 miles. Here he went up into a mountain not far from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and
chose the twelve Apostles, <hi>Luke 6. Mark</hi> 3. And then upon this Mountain
he preached unto the People which resorted thither unto him out of the
Country round about, whom they heard with great diligence and attendance.
This Sermon being ended, he came down from the Mountain and healed
the man that was sick of the Leprosie. He also went into <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and
healed the Centurion's Servant, <hi>Mat 8. Luke</hi> 7. Afterward Christ, in the same
Month of <hi>April,</hi> when the man whom he healed of his Leprosie had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
the Miracle, he went from <hi>Capernaum</hi> into the Desart which lay
near unto <hi>Bethsaida;</hi> for there was a certain Desart, <hi>Mark 1. Luke</hi> 7. In the
month of <hi>May,</hi> our Saviour went out of <hi>Galilee</hi> towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to keep
the Feast of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> so he came to the gates of the City <hi>Naim,</hi> which stood
on the border of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and was distant from <hi>Capernaum</hi> 16 miles. Here
he recalled the Widows Son to life, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and after he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
which was 48 miles, that he might celebrate the Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> according
to the Law of God, <hi>Exo. 23. Thrice every year shall every male Child appear
before the Lord thy God.</hi> This Feast fell this year upon the fifteenth day of <hi>May,</hi>
for it behoved our Saviour, according to the Law, to go every year to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> to these three principal Feasts, that is, of the Passover, <hi>Pentecost,</hi>
and of the Tabernacles. A little after the Feast of <hi>Pentecost, Iohn Baptist</hi>
(being then in Prison) having certain intelligence of the Miracle that our
Saviour wrought upon the Widdows Son at the gate of <hi>Naim;</hi> and of other
wonderful Miracles that he did in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in other places in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
sent two of his Disciples from the Castle of <hi>Macharuntes,</hi> to ask him the
question, whether he was the <hi>Messia</hi> or no? So when they came unto him, and
delivered him their Message, at that time he cured many of their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Plagues, and evil Spirits, and to many blind men he gave sight
freely. And Jesus said unto them, <hi>Go your ways, and tell</hi> John <hi>what things
you have seen and heard, that the blind see, the halt go, the lepers are cleansed,
the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor receive the Gospel: And blessed
is he that shall not be offended on me, Mathew 11. Luke</hi> 7. At this Sermon it
was thought he converted the sinner that washed his feet, and poured a box
of pretious Oyl upon his head, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>Iune</hi> our Saviour Jesus Christ went with the Twelve
about six and fifty miles out of <hi>Iudea</hi> into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there, in divers Cities
and Towns he began to preach and teach the Kingdom of God. At this
time there were divers Women followed him, whom he had healed of evil
Spirits and of their Infirmities; but principally <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom
he had cast seven Devils; and <hi>Ioan</hi> the wife of <hi>Chuza, Herod's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator,
and <hi>Susanna:</hi> all which ministred unto him of their Substance,
<hi>Luke</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:105162:176"/>Now when he had travelled from place to place some certain time,
and visited many Cities and Towns thereabout, he returned back again to
the City of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where it is said that our Saviour Christ dwelt; and
there dispossest the man of a Devil, that was both blind, lame, and dumb,
<hi>Mat. 12. Mar. 3. Luke</hi> 11. And going thence to the Sea, he recited eight
Parables, <hi>Mat. 13. Mark. 4. Luke</hi> 8. In the evening of the same day, he
went six miles, into the Country of the <hi>Gadarens, Mar. 4. Luke</hi> 8. The next
day, betimes in the morning, he went out of the Ship into the Country of
the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> and healed two that were possessed of Devils, <hi>Mat. 2. Mar.</hi> 5.
<hi>Luke</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Out of these two he cast a Legion of Devils, and suffered them to enter
into the Herd of Swine, which they carried headlong into the Sea. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
our Saviour Christ went thence six miles, into the Land of <hi>Genesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
where there was a great multitude upon the Sea shore, not far from the
City of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> that expected his coming, <hi>Mar. 5. Luke</hi> 8. Within a
few daies after, about the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> he entred into <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
and there he healed the man that lay sick upon his Bed of a dead Palsie,
<hi>Mat. 9. Mar. 2. Luke</hi> 5. After, he went to Sea, and taught the multitude
that came to him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Capernaum</hi> he went to <hi>Caesarea Philippi,</hi> forty eight miles, where,
being invited to a Banquet by <hi>Matthew,</hi> he eat among Publicans and Sinners,
and confuted the Pharisees and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Disciples. In the same City he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
the Daughter of <hi>Iairus</hi> to life, <hi>Mat. 9. Mark 2. Luke</hi> 5. and as he went
thence, he restored two men to their sight, and cast out a Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>About the end of the Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> our Saviour Christ went from <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
Philippi</hi> to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> thirty six miles; where, because of the ingratitude
and contempt of the Citizens, he did no great Miracles, <hi>Mark 6. Mat.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>August,</hi> our Saviour Christ went from <hi>Nazareth</hi> toward
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the Feast of Tabernacles, and as he went, he visited the Towns
and Cities near adjoyning. Now when he saw that they wanted Teachers,
it being at this time the second Harvest, he said unto his Disciples, <hi>Lo, the
Harvest is great, but the Labourers are few,</hi> &amp;c. and he sent his Disciples out
into the Harvest, <hi>Mat. 9. Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Of this second Harvest you may read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. where God commanded
the People that they should observe the Feast of the Tabernacles, when in
the end of the year they had gathered in all the Fruits of the Fields. Also
in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. it is thus written, <hi>From the fifteenth day of the seventeenth Month,
when you have gathered all the Fruits of your Land, you shall celebrate unto the
Lord your God seven days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Galilee,</hi> our Saviour Christ came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> sixty four miles; where,
from the twentieth to the twenty seventh day of <hi>September,</hi> he celebrated the

               <p>THIS City is scituated not far from the foot of the Mountain <hi>Antilibanus,</hi>
104 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> toward the North, close by the two Wells

Tiberias</hi> at this time being Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> In times past it was
called <hi>Laisch,</hi> or <hi>Lais,</hi> which signifies a ravening or roaring Lion. But the
Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> having conquered it and rebuilt it again, they called it <hi>Dan,</hi>

notwithstanding these names, is often called <hi>Belenas.</hi> Here (as <hi>Eusebius, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomenes,</hi>
and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> say in their Ecclesiastical Histories) the Woman
that was diseased with the bloudy Issue, was healed by touching the Hem
of our Saviour's Garment; which Woman, in token of thankfulness for so
great a benefit, and in memory of so notable a Miracle, erected in this City,
a little without the Gates of her House, a stone Pillar, on which she caused
to be set the Image of Christ made of Brass; and behind that stood the Image
of this Woman, who had been diseased twelve years with the bloudy Issue,
bowing her self at the feet of our Lord, and touching the Hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They also say there grew certain Herbs about this Pillar, whereby
Miracles were wrought thirty years after it was set up. But <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate
having intelligence of these things, caused those Images to be broken down,
and erected his own in the same place. But soon after, there happened such
an exceeding Thunder, that fire falling from Heaven, strook this Image,
thus set up by this cruel Tyrant, upon the Breast, and cast the Head and
the Neck thereof with great violence upon the Earth. These things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in <hi>Caesarea Philippi.</hi> Upon the Borders of <hi>Caesarea Philippi</hi> our

it drew into a streight Angle, and was called the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> because it
bordered upon <hi>Galilee.</hi> It was also called the Lake of <hi>Genesareth,</hi> because
of the pleasantness and fruitfulness of the Soil lying upon the North side of
it. It is called (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.) the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> from the City <hi>Tiberias</hi> that stood
upon the shore of it. It was but four miles and a little more broad, but
in length, from the North to the South, twelve miles. Upon the East side
it had the Town <hi>Chorazin,</hi> and upon the West <hi>Capernaum;</hi> and (as <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

               <p>About thirty Paces from the foot of this Hill there ariseth a Fountain,

there are many that think this Lake became thus venomous, because of the

This Land was very pleasant and fruitful, as if it had been a Princes Garden,

               <head>The Travels of our Saviour Christ in the third year of his Ministry,
which was the three and thirtieth year of his age.</head>
               <p>FROM <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> our Saviour Christ returned, some six and fifty
miles, into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and in the beginning of this year wintered in that
place: so that (as it may be gathered out of the Evangelists) he
continued there the most part of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and now the
Spring approching, a little after the death of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, (who as
it is thought, was put to death between the midst of Winter and the Spring,
not long before the Feast of the Passover; so that he lived two years and a
half in his Ministry) he wrought many notable Miracles, not far from the
City of <hi>Bethsaida.</hi> The same time, the Feast of the Passover drawing near,
(which was the third Passover of his ministry) he went thence over
<hi>Iordan,</hi> and so beyond the Sea of <hi>Tiberias, Matth. 14. Mark 6. Luke</hi> 9.
At this time, the Apostles of Christ being dispersed through all <hi>Galilee</hi> and
<hi>Iudaea,</hi> teaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of Heaven, hearing of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
death of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, about the beginning of the month of <hi>April,</hi>
returned with all possible speed out of every Part to our Saviour Christ, that
so they might be secure against the tyranny of <hi>Herod, Matth. 14. Mark</hi> 6.
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. Also the Disciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> came unto him, and told him of his
Death and Burial, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:105162:178"/>Our Saviour Christ therefore having by this means certain intelligence,
as he was between <hi>Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Tiberias,</hi> of the death of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Baptist, in
the month of <hi>April</hi> he went into a Ship, and passed about four miles to the
further side of the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where, in a certain Desart, he sed five
thousand men with five Barley loaves and two fishes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned back again to the Sea, and so to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which
was four miles: here he made that long Sermon of the Spiritual eating of
his flesh, <hi>Mat. 14. Luke 9. Iohn</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was 56 miles, to the Feast of the

               <head>The third Passover of the Ministry of Christ.</head>
               <p>Upon the thirteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> being Sunday, according to the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
computation, Christ (as God commanded) celebrated the third Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
of his ministry for the space of eight days in the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that
is, till the twentieth day of the same month.</p>
               <p>After the Feast of the Passeover, the <hi>Iews</hi> took counsel how they might
put him to death, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. wherefore, about the end of <hi>April,</hi> he departed
thence, and went 56 miles into the Land of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>May,</hi> after the controversie that happened concerning the
Tradition of the Elders (because of the fallacies and contentions of the Scribes
and Pharisees) he departed thence into the borders of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> which
was 56 miles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and there entred into a house, and would fain have
been private; but there was a certain Woman that was a <hi>Grecian</hi> of <hi>Syro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoenissa,</hi>
came unto him, and intreated his aid, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But our Saviour, having a determination to depart from this place, this
Woman was very importunate that he would dispossess her Daughter of a
Devil; which (because of her importunity) he did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. And after he
went thence into the Country of <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> going through
the borders of <hi>Decapolis,</hi> and coming to the <hi>Galilean</hi> Sea, and in the way he
healed one that was both blind and dumb, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. and there, ascending up
into a Mountain, he cured many that were blind and lame, and the third
day after fed four thousand with seven loaves and a few fishes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. So
this Journey was 64 miles.</p>
               <p>Afterward, in the same month of <hi>May,</hi> he went into a Ship, and passed thence
into the parts of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and upon the borders of <hi>Magdala,</hi> which was four
miles, he propounded the sign of the Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> to the Pharisees and
Sadducees, <hi>Mat. 15. &amp;</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>From thence he sailed to <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> which was four miles, and by the way
he admonished his Disciples to take heed of the leaven of the Sadducees and
Pharisees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and as he was entring into a Town, he cured a blind man
of his sight, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:105162:179"/>About the end of the month of <hi>May,</hi> Christ went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was
56 miles, where, upon the second day of <hi>Iune,</hi> he kept the Feast of Pentecost,
according as God had commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The Feast of Pentecost being ended, he returned from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> into the
Country of <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he dwelt, which was 56 miles.</p>
               <p>In the same month of <hi>Iune,</hi> he went the second time unto the borders of
the Gentiles, where <hi>Peter,</hi> in the name of all the Disciples, upon the confines of
<hi>Caesarea Philippi,</hi> made that notable confession, saying, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son
of the living God, Luk. 9. Capernaum</hi> is distant from <hi>Caesarea Philippi,</hi> 48
miles.</p>
               <p>Six, or (as <hi>Luke</hi> saith) eight days after, our Saviour in the month of <hi>Iune</hi>
went to the mountain <hi>Thabor,</hi> which stood 48 miles from <hi>Caesarea Philippi</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Southwest, where he was transfigured; and the next day after he
cured the Lunatick, and cast out a Devil, <hi>Mat. 7. Mark</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> Christ walked into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there confirmed his
Doctrine with many wonderful miracles, which did greatly amaze his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
where he put them in mind of the Cross and of his Death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.
<hi>Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which was ten miles from mount
<hi>Thabor:</hi> at this time <hi>Peter</hi> went to the Lake of <hi>Genesareth,</hi> and there caught
a fish, in whose mouth he found a Stater, which was worth 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> in our
money, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. Here also our Saviour Christ made a long Sermon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he reprehended the pride and arrogancy of his Disciples, and withal taught
the doctrine of the Remission of sins, <hi>Mat. 12. Mark Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>August,</hi> he had a full determination to make a Journey
through <hi>Samaria</hi> into <hi>Iudea,</hi> and so by little and little (visiting the Churches
as he went) to go to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the feast of the Tabernacles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. but
when he came to <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was ten miles from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
would not receive him, because he made as though he would go to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi>
wherefore he turned aside into <hi>Galilee, Luke</hi> 9. And as he was there
visiting the Churches, there came a certain man unto him, saying, <hi>I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thee whither soever thou goest.</hi> But Christ answered him, saying, <hi>The Foxes
have holes, and the Fowls of the heavens have nests, but the Son of man hath
not where to hide his head, Matth.</hi> 8. And to another Jesus said, <hi>Follow thou
me.</hi> But he answered, <hi>Let me first go and bury my father.</hi> There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also that would have followed Christ, but he would first go take his leave
of his friends, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>September,</hi> about the time of the second harvest, which
was next before the feast of the Tabernacles, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. Christ began his last
visitation throughout all the Land of <hi>Iudea;</hi> at which time he sent forth seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his disciples into <hi>Galilee,</hi> to prepare the way, and so dispersed Labourers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his harvest; saying, <hi>The harvest is great, but the labourers are few, Luk.</hi> 10.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105162:179"/>
This Speech seems to be taken from the present condition of the time: for
it was now harvest time, it being a little before the Vernal Aequinoctial.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> when the feast of the Tabernacles drew
near, the Disciples and those that were of the kindred of our Saviour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the flesh, went up to the Feast, but he remained in <hi>Galilee,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a little after he went privily up: now between <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
were accounted 56 miles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. Upon the ninth day of <hi>October</hi> was this Feast
celebrated in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and being now half past, our Saviour Christ taught
publickly in the Temple, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. Upon the fifteenth day of <hi>October</hi> (it being
the last day of the Feast of the Tabernacles, and the Sabbath day) he taught
the second time publickly in the Temple, and so continued preaching and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miracles in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> until the Feast of the Dedication, which was kept
about the middle of Winter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>November,</hi> he preached daily in the Temple, and at night
went to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where he rested, which was about half a mile
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and every morning returned back to the Temple. At this
time there came unto him certain Scribes and Pharisees, who brought a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which had been lately taken in Adultery, and said unto him, <hi>Master,
what shall we do with this Woman, &amp;c.</hi> And he answered, <hi>He among you that
is without sin throw the first stone at her, Iohn</hi> 8. About this time also were
the Sermons concerning the Power of the Son of God, and a great disputation
between our Saviour and the Jews, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. for which cause they would have
stoned him. In the month of <hi>December,</hi> Christ wintered in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the Parable of the Sheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. Also upon the Sabbath day, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Feast of the Dedication, he healed a man that was born blind, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In this feast the Jews (being angry because he had healed the blind man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath day) compassed our Saviour about as he was in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch;
and when they heard our Saviour confess openly, that he was the Son of God,
they began to grow into a fury, and for very anger would have stoned him to
death. Wherefore our Saviour Christ went thence beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
there the rest of the Winter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. But before he went to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
there were returned unto him certain of the seventy Disciples, which a
little before (in the month of <hi>September</hi>) he had sent abroad, and there at that
time he recited the similitude of the man, who descending from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to
<hi>Iericho,</hi> fell amongst Thieves. This similitude seemeth to be taken from the
present occasion, because our Saviour Christ going from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> beyond
<hi>Iordan,</hi> was to pass through great wildernesses just in the way as they go thence
to <hi>Iericho,</hi> Joh. 10.</p>
               <p>At the same time he went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Bethania,</hi> which was almost
two miles, and there visited <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> where <hi>Martha</hi> ministred
unto him, but <hi>Mary</hi> sitting at his feet gave diligent heed to his Doctrine,
<hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:105162:180"/>At this time he took his leave of these two Sisters, and went thence to <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi>
beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, which was sixteen miles, it being
now about the midst of Winter, Christ at this time being about thirty three
years of age.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that there were many which refer that long Journey of
our Saviour Christ, when he went to visit all <hi>Iudaea,</hi> the sending forth of
his Disciples, and divers other Miracles mentioned from the ninth Chapter
of <hi>Luke</hi> to the sixteenth, to the beginning of the following year. But I
am of opinion that all those things could not have been done within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of four Months, and before the Feast of the Dedication: so that it must
needs be that the seventy Disciples were sent forth before the Feast of the
Dedication; for after the Feast of the Dedication (which was celebrated in
the midst of Winter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.) there were but two Months between it
and the raising up of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in which short time all those things which are
described by <hi>Luke,</hi> could not possibly be accomplished; especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our Saviour Christ wintered some time in <hi>Bethabara,</hi> and there
taught the multitude that came unto him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. So these Travels of our
Saviour were five hundred ninety six miles, or thereabouts, besides the
divers Visitations and Journeys he went hither and thither: which, because
of the great multitude of them, it was not possible for the Evangelist to set
them down.</p>

the Fishers and Hunters, which fished and hunted thorough the World,
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 16. In this Town dwelt three Apostles, <hi>Peter, Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Philip,
Iohn</hi> 1. It was scituated upon the West side of the <hi>Galilean</hi> Sea; in the Tribe
of <hi>Issachar,</hi> fifty six miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> toward the North. And because of
the abundance of Fishes that were in the Sea of <hi>Galilee, Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi>
became Fishers, and in that Vocation got their living, till our Lord and
Saviour Christ made them Fishers of Men, <hi>Mat. 4. Luke</hi> 5. Before the Birth
of Christ this was but a small Town, and without doubt was so called from
hunting; because close by it stood a Wilderness that did greatly abound
with wild Beasts. <hi>Philip,</hi> the Terrarch of <hi>Traconitis</hi> and <hi>Itura,</hi> made this a
fair City, which, in honour of <hi>Iulia,</hi> he called <hi>Iuliades.</hi> This <hi>Iulia</hi> was the
Daughter of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and Wife of <hi>Tiberias. Philip</hi> also brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inhabitants thither, who dwelt in that City. But when <hi>Herod</hi> (the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch

                  <hi>Galilee</hi>) and called it by the name of <hi>Iuliades,</hi> in honour of this <hi>Iulia.</hi> This
Town, re-edified and inlarged by <hi>Philip,</hi> was called again in the time of our
blessed Lord and Saviour Christ, after the ancient name <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
to this day. From hence it is manifest, that the Sea of <hi>Galilee</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

on both sides they had Cities standing.</p>

upon the West side of the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> those that have been at the Holy
Land can testifie.</p>
               <p>This City of <hi>Bethsaida</hi> hath an ancient Water-course coming from a River
not far from it, which <hi>Iosephus</hi> calleth little <hi>Iordan,</hi> which falleth into the
Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> just in the mid-way between this Town and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> the
Channel whereof appeareth to this day. Beside the many Sermons which our
Saviour Christ preached here, he did many notable miracles, <hi>Mark 8. &amp;c.</hi> But
for the ingratitude and impiety of the Citizens, the curse of our Saviour fell
upon them, <hi>Wo be to thee Chorazin, wo be to thee Bethsaida: for if the miracles
had been done in Tyrus and Sidon, which have been done in thee, they had long
e're this repented in sackcloth and ashes: Verily, verily, I say unto you, it shall be
easier for Tyrus and Sidon in the day of Iudgment, than for you, Mat. 11. Luk.</hi> 10.
The prophecie of our Saviour Christ fell upon them accordingly; for, after
divers and sundry overthrows and devastations, this Town became utterly
unpeopled, and as <hi>Britenbacchus</hi> saith, there are scarce six houses standing in
it at this day.</p>

beautifie this City with many fair Buildings, and compassed it about with
strong Walls, and after <hi>Tiberias Caesar</hi>'s name, called it <hi>Tiberias.</hi> He also
gathered thither many Inhabitants, and endowed it with many large Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
for although this place before the restoring of the City was very
filthy and impure, by reason of the dead Bodies both of Men and Beasts,
which lay in that place, (from whence it happened that the <hi>Iewes</hi> shunned
this place as utterly unlawful, and durst not dwell there) yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Herod,</hi> with singular Industry and Diligence, removed all that filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and in that very place built up this City both fair and spacious; partly
with Gifts, partly with fair Speeches, alluring many <hi>Iews</hi> to inhabit therein.
Many poor People also built themselves houses at their own charge, and
those that had no Children, gave way unto the liberty of the City;
besides, many rich and noble men were constrained to remove their whole
Families, and to dwell in this City, so that in short time it became very well
peopled, according to <hi>Ios. lib. Antiq. 18. cap. 4. &amp; Egisip. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Not above two miles from <hi>Tiberias,</hi> towards the South, upon the shore
of the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> stood <hi>Tarachaea,</hi> a Town wherein <hi>Iosephus</hi> dwelt. Now
it happened that the Citizens of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> upon some discontent, and as it
was thought, at the instigation of one <hi>Clitus,</hi> fell into Rebellion; of which
<hi>Iosephus</hi> having certain intelligence, he caused all the Gates of <hi>Terachaea</hi> to
be shut, lest any man going thence should disclose his intentions, or any
coming from <hi>Tiberias,</hi> should move that City also to Rebellion; and then
privily sent out a command to assemble all the Ships and other Vessels
that were upon the Sea or Lake, even to the number of 230 Ships; all which
he caused to be manned only with four men apiece, and of a sudden sailed
towards <hi>Tiberias.</hi> But when he came within view of the City, so that the
Citizens from the Wall might discern the Ships, he lest the Body of the
Navy a good way remote from <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and took only one Ship, manned
with seven men, and went close to the City of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> as it seemed, to have
had a parly with the Citizens: but they seeing such a multitude of Ships, and
the bold resolution of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> supposing that they had been sufficiently
manned, and contained a great Army, were greatly afraid, insomuch that
they cast away their Arms, and came out of the City with humble Petitions
to <hi>Iosephus,</hi> intreating him to spare the City, and to take pity on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
Notwithstanding he utterly refused to shew them any mercy,
unless they would deliver unto him the Ruler of the City, which they did,
so he settled the Affairs of that Town, and took the Ruler thereof with
him to <hi>Terachaea,</hi> where he committed him to Prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:105162:181"/>But after, it being certainly found out that one <hi>Clitus</hi> was the principal
Author of this Rebellion, he sent <hi>Leuyn</hi> one of his Guard, with command to
apprehend him, and cut off both his Hands: of which punishment <hi>Clytus</hi>
being certainly informed, with tears and prayers humbly besought this
<hi>Leuyn</hi> that he would spare one of his hands, and he would willingly lose
the other; which with much ado was granted him, upon condition that
he would cut off his own Hand: so he took his Sword and cut off his left
Hand; which being done, <hi>Iosephus</hi> returned the Captives to <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and
received the Inhabitants again into favour, and ever after retained it in
obedience.</p>

him with great humility, giving him and his whole Army entertainment
into the City, receiving him with Musick and Songs, and with great Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and shouts; calling him their Saviour and Protector: which kind of
Courtesies the Emperour took very lovingly, and in token of thankfulness
for this kindness, he commanded his Souldiers (after they had broken
down a great part of the Wall upon the South side) that they should
abstain from all manner of Rapin and Violence; so that he continued there
peaceably, and went away peaceably.</p>
               <p>This City to this day (as <hi>Borchardus</hi> the Monk saith) is a fair Town,

               <p>THIS was the chief City of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 100 miles
towards the North. It was first built by the Citizens of <hi>Zidon,</hi> (because
of a Sedition that happened in that City) 240 years before the Temple of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, just in the place where at this day the ruins of

about such time as <hi>Troy</hi> was destroyed) King <hi>Angenor</hi> removed it to a Rock
which stood in the heart of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, compassed about therewith
like an Island, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. and bestowed great cost in fortifying and building
it. It stood round, compassed with strong Walls, beautified with goodly
Buildings, and fairly scituated for the entertainment of Ships; for which
purpose, on every side there were many sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Havens and Harbours made.
It was but a small Town, almost three miles about, and two miles wide:
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:105162:182"/>
yet the great Mart Town in those Parts, for Merchants resorted thither from
all the three Parts of the World (<hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>) as well for the
uttering as buying commodities; and was made so much the more famous,
because of the scituation and strength: It stood distant from the Land of
<hi>Phoenicia</hi> almost two miles; upon which Continent they had obtained a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Land for the maintenance of the City, containing 19000 paces in
compass. The Citizens also being greatly inriched, because of their traffick,
built up many fair Cities and Towns in more remote parts, which was added
to their jurisdiction, as <hi>Leptis, Vtica,</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> scituated in <hi>Africa.</hi> They
also built <hi>Cades,</hi> which at this day is called <hi>Caliz,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 5. cap.</hi>
19. being scituated in a very fair Island in the Mediterranean Sea, not far
from <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars; insomuch as the Citizens of this Town having thus
inlarged their command, and increased their substance; in every place they
called themselves Princes, and took upon them to wear Scarlet and Purple,
which colours in that place above all other colours, were most artificially died:
And because of the rarity of them, transported thence into many Countries
more remote. But because of their extreme arrogance and pride, it was
twice conquered and ruinated: First by <hi>Nabuchadonozer</hi> Emperour of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi>
and then by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as it appeareth in <hi>Quint. Curtius, lib.</hi> in
the Life of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the occasion that <hi>Alexander</hi> made war upon this City, was, because the
Citizens upon a time sending unto him certain Ambassadors with a Crown
of Gold, in token of friendship, and to congratulate his Prosperity (which
he accepted very kindly, and gave them Royal entertainment, as to his
Friends) amongst other things, he told them, that he would come unto
their City, and do sacrifice to their god <hi>Hercules</hi> (for the Kings of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
are perswaded that they proceed from the off-spring of that god,
and beside he was commanded by an Oracle so to do.) But the Ambassadors
of <hi>Tyre</hi> answered, that the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> stood without the City in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aetzton,</hi>
where ancient <hi>Tyre</hi> stood; so that the King might easily come thither
to do sacrifice; but <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing these words, could not contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but in a great anger answered, And do ye proud Citizens put such trust
in the strength and scituation of your City, that you think I am not able to
come to it with my Army by Land? You shall well perceive within this short
space, that you are scituated upon the Continent, and that I will enter it and
sack it. With these terrible words the Ambassadors departed, and shortly after
<hi>Alexander</hi> followed them with a great and mighty Army.</p>
               <p>But when it was known that <hi>Alexander</hi> had undertaken the sacking of this
City, there were many that thought it almost impossible for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
his designs; first, because of the inconstancy of the Winds, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency
of the Water, whereby all such matter as they cast into the Sea to
joyn it to the Continent, would be driven away by the violence of the Water;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:105162:182"/>
again, the City was compassed about with such exceeding high Walls, and
fortified with such strong Towers, that it was not possible for him to bring
any Engines to batter them, or fasten any scaling Ladders to ascend them,
unless it were by Ships. Twice <hi>Alexander</hi> attempted, by flinging into the
Sea mighty Trees of <hi>Libanus,</hi> and heaps of the ruins of ancient <hi>Tyre,</hi> to have
made a Bridge to it, or else joyn it to the Continent, insomuch as the
<hi>Tyrians</hi> mocked the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> saying, <hi>What can your King</hi> Alexander <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>
Neptune <hi>the God of the Sea?</hi> For the violence of the Sea was so extream,
that it carried away all things with it, and oftentimes broke the Ships that
were joyned together to make a Bridge, and drowned the Souldiers that
besieged and fought against the City. During this Siege, a Citizen of
<hi>Myrus</hi> dreamt that their Idol <hi>Apollo</hi> would depart from them; whereupon
they bound the Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> with a Chain of Gold, unto the Pillar
whereon he stood, that he might not leave them. There happened also a
horrible ostent amongst the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> for a certain Souldier breaking
Bread, there fell from it some few drops of Bloud; at the hearing of which
accident, <hi>Alexander</hi> was greatly amazed, until he was resolved by one <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stander,</hi>
a very skilful Prophet, that if it issued from off the outside of the Bread,
it had betokened a heavy event to the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> but in regard that it
issued from the inside of the Bread, it foreshewed that he should forthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the Town he had so long besieged; and so it happened: for when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
had besieged the City for the space of seven months, with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
he won it: but before he could win it, he was constrained to use a great
multitude of Ships, and fasten them together with iron bands, upon which
placing many Engines of battery, and other offensive instruments, what with
the moving of the Ships, and the extream Violence of the battery, they
overcame the City. This exploit <hi>Alexander</hi> performed when he was 25
years of age, and about 300 years before Christ.</p>
               <p>There was one thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> did during his Siege, that was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable;
for before any of his Souldiers would attempt to ascend the Walls,
he went in Person, with his Crown upon his head, and Princely Armour,
and scaled a high Tower of the City, where he exprest an extraordinary
resolution, and by reason of his courage did great hurt to the Enemy, who
perceiving him to be the King, resorted to that place in great heaps, and shot
at him with all their might; but he manfully defended himself, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the enemy to fly. In this assault there were 6000 of the Inhabitants
slain; and after he had entred the Walls and sackt the City, he caused 2000
to be tyed to crosses and thrown into the Sea. From whence may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
that God by this young Prince did accomplish this great Work,
that the Prophecies of the Prophets, <hi>Esay 23. Ieremy</hi> 43. and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 25, 26.
might be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> observe) caused the Sea to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105162:183"/>
be filled up, that it might be no more an Island, and joyned it to the
Continent; upon which place he caused <hi>Tyrus</hi> to be rebuilded, and compassed
it about with a Wall five and twenty foot thick, strengthened with twelve Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
that it might be sufficiently fortified to oppose the incursion of any Enemy;
so that it continued safe a long time after, and in the time of our Saviour
Christ was a fair City, though it never attained to the former dignity and
Power that it had before <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered it. The ancient City of
<hi>Tyre</hi> was distant from this City about four miles towards the South.</p>

of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whose Daughter had been cruelly tormented with a Devil,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 15. In the time of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperour, there were many
Martyrs put to death in this City: And at this time it is called by the name
of <hi>El porta del Zur,</hi> that is, <hi>the Haven of Zur;</hi> as it was in the old Testament
called by the name of <hi>Zor.</hi> In the year 1100. when the holy Land was
in the hands of the Christians, there was an Archbishop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> under whose
Government were the Bishops of <hi>Ptolomais, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Beryti, &amp;c.</hi> The holy
man <hi>Origen</hi> lieth buried in this City, in the Church of the holy Sepulchre,
which is compassed about and fortified with a mighty strong Wall. There
also lies buried the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarosso,</hi> who died <hi>Anno</hi> 1160,
after he had done many valiant acts, and sought many great Battels for the
Christians against the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> being overcome by <hi>Saphadinus</hi>
the <hi>Sultans</hi> Son, and put to flight, was drowned in the River of <hi>Suro,</hi> to
the great grief of his Army; but he left behind him a famous report. Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> the third, being a great Enemy to this Emperour, in <hi>S. Marys</hi>
Church in the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> when this Prince submitted himself to his
Holiness; set his Foot upon his neck, repeating these Words, <hi>Thou shalt
tread upon the Aspe and upon the Basilisk, &amp;c. Eusebius,</hi> in his Ecclesiastical
History saith, that there are yet standing in <hi>Tyre</hi> certain Marble Pillars,

said that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia</hi> wrapped the Body of our Saviour in white Satin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:105162:183"/>
for in <hi>Matthew</hi> 27. it is called <hi>Zadin,</hi> which in <hi>English</hi> is <hi>Sattin.</hi> And as at this
day the finest Glass is made at <hi>Venice,</hi> so the finest Glass in those times was
made at <hi>Sarepta,</hi> a City that belonged to the <hi>Sidonians:</hi> about which there
stood many Mines, of which it is called <hi>Sarepta,</hi> as you may read before.</p>
               <p>This Town in times past was one of the chief Cities of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi>
but because of the extraordinary Pride of the Citizens, God afflicted them
with divers punishments, and brought in <hi>Ocho</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> who
besieged it, and by Treason won it, and burnt it to the ground, as <hi>Diodorus
Siculus, lib.</hi> 16. saith. The Citizens whereof were driven to such streights
by the Enemy, that there perished in the fire above forty thousand men.
Within a while after, <hi>Darius,</hi> the last Emperour of the <hi>Persians,</hi> rebuilt it, but
made it nothing so beautiful, neither fortified it in like manner as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
he ordained one <hi>Strato</hi> to be King thereof, a man proud and arrogant.
After, about three hundred and two years before the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
being then but twenty four years of age, having overcome <hi>Darius,</hi> that
mighty Emperour of the <hi>Persians,</hi> at <hi>Issa</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> in a cruel and
sharp War; he sent <hi>Hephestion,</hi> one of his Princes, to the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> with
authority to depose <hi>Strato,</hi> and to let the Citizens understand that they should
chuse him for their King, whom they thought most worthy of that honour,
as <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> sheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. At this time there was a certain young
man among the followers of <hi>Hephestion,</hi> in whose behalf he moved the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
that he might be their King; but they refused, saying, it was not their
custom to chuse any to rule over them, but such as were of the King's stock
and Progeny. <hi>Hephestion</hi> hearing this answer, greatly admired their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and modesty, especially when they refused to accept him for their
King, whom others had sought to obtain with Fire and Sword; saying, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is more required to rule and govern a Kingdom, than to get it;
but yet name one unto me of Royal descent, whom you would willingly
receive to be your King. So they named unto him one <hi>Abdolomius,</hi> who
had been known to have been of the Kings stock, by many descents; but
because of his Poverty he was constrained to dwell in the Suburbs of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a Cottage, and had little else but a Garden to live upon. This man
howsoever poor, and because of that, of many contemned; yet he was
known to be honest, and of an upright life, following with all diligence his
Vocation, without any regard of other business; insomuch as he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ignorant of all these stirs and combustions which had so lately vexed <hi>Asia.</hi>
As he was now in his Garden, digging and labouring, purging it of Weeds,
and planting of Herbs; <hi>Hephestion</hi> with the rest of the Citizens went unto
him, and brought him the Robes and Habiliments of a King. The poor
Gardner stood amazed to see such a Company of Gallants come unto him;
but <hi>Hephestion</hi> told him, that the occasion of their coming was to make a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

exchange with him of those Royal Ornaments which he had in his hand,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105162:184"/>
for those poor and foul Garments which he wore; therefore go and wash
thy self and return. So he did, where immediately they put upon him those
Royal Robes, and saluted him as their Sovereign. After these things were
finished, quoth <hi>Hephestion,</hi> Now remember in what a state thou art, no more
Gardener but a King; and therefore take unto thee the mind and resolution
of a King, that so thou mayest rule and govern this City as a man worthy
of that honour; and remember, that although the Lives and Goods of thy
Subjects are at thy command, yet by them thou wast chosen, neither be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of him that was the Author of thine Honour.</p>
               <p>No sooner was he enthronized in his Kingdom, but Fame (who is more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
than a thousand Posts) had dispersed this News through all the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Cities: some being thereby moved to admiration, and quickned in their
Studies; others stirred up to Indignation and Envy. Those that were mighty,
and Friends to <hi>Alexander,</hi> contemned and despised his Humility and Poverty;
and no sooner were they come into his presence, but they began to accuse him
for his Ignorance; wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> commanded that he should come
before him, where, after he had well viewed the Lineaments and Proportion
of his Person, and could not perceive it any whit repugnant to the fame of his
Birth, he demanded of him, how it was possible that he should endure his
Poverty with Patience. To which he answered, I pray the Gods I may
continue the Government of this Kingdom with the like mind; for these
hands were sufficient for me to live by, and as I had nothing, so I wanted
nothing. At which answer <hi>Alexander</hi> was so well pleased, that he not only
gave him all the Princely Jewels and Ornaments of the first King called
<hi>Strato,</hi> but also a great part of the Booty which he took from the Emperour
of <hi>Persia,</hi> and added to his command all the neighbouring Countries round
about. This History I have inserted, that thereby we might perceive the
mighty power of God in all his works; that can exalt the poor, contented
with his estate, out of the very dust, and can pull the mighty from their
Thrones. So the evil cark and care in this World to gather riches for the
Vertuous to inherit. But to return to <hi>Sidon:</hi> This City did so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and grew so famous in succeeding Ages, that it was the chief Town
(<hi>Tyrus</hi> only excepted) in all <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> joyning upon the West to the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea, extending it self towards the North and South, lying in a
Plain under <hi>Antilibanus,</hi> which Mountain lay some two miles off it upon the
East. It oftentimes, because of the Pride of the Inhabitants, felt the wrath
and punishing hand of God, as well by the Invasion of Enemies, as
sickness and dearth, according to the Predictions of the Prophets, <hi>Esay</hi>
28. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. untill at last in succeeding ages it was utterly destroyed,
the Ruins of which City remain to this day, and make evident that it was
a fair and spatious Town.</p>
               <p>There is to be seen yet to this day a City built out of the Ruins of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105162:184"/>
former (though nothing so large as it) very strong, and mightily fortified,
so that it seemeth almost invincible, if it have men wherewith to defend it.
Upon the one side it joyneth to the Sea, and upon the other side of it there
standeth two mighty strong Castles, one of them scituated toward the North,
upon a very strong Rock, as it were in the heart of the Sea, the which was
built by certain Pilgrims that came out of <hi>Germany</hi> to visit the holy City of
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The other of them was scituated upon a Hill toward the South
of the City, as well fortified, and no less difficult to be conquered. These
two Castles, with the whole City in times past were in the hands of the
Knights Templers. The Land round about it is very pleasant and fertile,
abounding with all kind of good things necessary for the maintenance of life
and delight. There is also found great abundance of Grapes, which are very
delicious and pleasant to the taste, whereof the Wine Canamella is made.
But because the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> are prohibited by the strict Law of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran

many Birds which sing very pleasantly, to the great delight of all such as hear
them: and the Air on the top of it is very pure and pleasant.</p>

place at this day is compassed about with a great Wall, within which is a

worthy to dwell in it, they hold it in such estimation, and reverence it as
the Hill of God. There are to be seen in it divers great Ruines of Palaces,
Towers, and Princely Edifices; in which at this day there harbour many
Lions and other wild Beasts. It is very difficult to ascend up to the top of it
it is so exceeding high: It is one of the principal hills in the Holy Land, not

28 miles, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. Upon the last Day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> being the Sabbath, our
Lord and Saviour Christ healed (in the house of a certain Prince of the
<hi>Pharisees</hi>) a man sick of the Dropsie, and recited the Parable of the great
Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> he went through all <hi>Galilee,</hi> which was 80
miles long, and 24 broad; in which visitation there followed him a great
company. And when there came unto him Publicans and Sinners, he
began to speak of Repentance, but the <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>risees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> murmured at
him, and opposed his Parables, of the lost sheep, of the Woman that had
lost her Groat, and of the prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. And a little after, he
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105162:186"/>
recited unto his Disciples the Parable of the unjust Steward, and of <hi>Dives</hi>
and <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. About the latter end of <hi>February</hi> (as by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the History and Times may appear) he made that Sermon of the
Power of Faith and good Works, <hi>&amp;c. Luke</hi> 17. And going out of <hi>Galilee</hi>
through the midst of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he healed the ten Lepers, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. He recited
the Parable of the unjust Judge, and that of the <hi>Publican</hi> and <hi>Pharisee,
Luke</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>March</hi> he finished this general Visitation. Which Journey
were so many and divers, that his Disciples could not describe them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
in this Month he went into the Borders of <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Petraea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Iordan,</hi> and came to <hi>Bethabara,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> sometimes baptised, and
there followed him a great company, and he healed them, <hi>Mat. 19. Mark</hi> 10.
There the <hi>Pharisees</hi> moved the disputation of the Divorce, and Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
imbraced the little Children, <hi>Mark</hi> 20. In this Month of <hi>March Lazarus</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> who dwelt at <hi>Bethania,</hi> fell sick of a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disease, and they sent messengers to Christ, who at this time was at <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi>
to give him to understand of his Sickness, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. this message came
unto our Saviour Christ to <hi>Bethabara</hi> upon the twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> being
the last day of the twelfth Month <hi>Adar, Anno Mundi</hi> 4000. and about such
time as the seventy Weeks, spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> were fully ended: at the end
of which Prophecy it behoved Christ, that he might fulfill the Prophecies of
the Old Testament, to suffer, and by his Resurrection and Ascension to
enter into the Glory of God, and to be partaker of his eternal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Although our Saviour had received this message of the Sickness of <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
he stayed at <hi>Bethabara.</hi> Two dayes after, and as it may be thought, about
the twenty second day of <hi>March,</hi> which was the second day of the first Month
<hi>Abib, Lazarus</hi> died. But <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead and buried, then our Saviour
went from <hi>Bethabara</hi> towards <hi>Iericho, Iohn 14. Luke</hi> 8. and in the way a
man came to him and said, <hi>Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life?</hi> Christ said unto him, <hi>Go and sell all that thou hast, and give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Poor, and thou shalt find Treasure in Heaven, and then come and follow
me.</hi> But because he was very rich he refused, and went his way. After,
he recited the Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard, making mention
of Predestination. Also in this Journey he reprehended the Sons of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi>
for their Pride and Arrogancy, and fore-telleth his Disciples of his
Death and Passion, and in the way healed the blind man that sate begging,
and so entred into <hi>Iericho,</hi> where he rested all night in the house of
<hi>Zacheus, Mat. 20. Zacheus</hi> signifies Clean.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty fourth of <hi>March,</hi> Christ went from <hi>Iericho</hi> to <hi>Bethania,</hi>
which was twelve miles. Here he healed <hi>Bartimeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Timeus,
Mark</hi> 10. (<hi>Timeus</hi> signifieth Unclean, of <hi>Tame,</hi> He is defiled) And going a
little further, he healed other two, res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the twenty fifth of <hi>March</hi> (being <hi>Tuesday</hi>) our Saviour Christ came to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania,</hi>
where, by the power of his Word he raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> to life, after he
had been buried four dayes, <hi>Iohn 11. Laz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon the twenty sixth day of <hi>March,</hi> the Feast of the Passover of the
<hi>Iews</hi> drawing near, he went from <hi>Bethania</hi> to the City of <hi>Ephraim</hi> near to
the Desart, that he might avoid the Traps and Deceits of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who
went about to take him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. being ten miles.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty seventh day of <hi>March</hi> he returned back again from
<hi>Ephraim</hi> to <hi>Bethania,</hi> (being ten miles) coming thither about the evening,
six dayes before the Passover, at which time <hi>Martha</hi> ministred to him, and
<hi>Mary</hi> anointed his feet, whereat <hi>Iudas</hi> grutched, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. Upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, being the twenty eighth of <hi>March,</hi> he rested in <hi>Bethania</hi> at the
House of <hi>Martha.</hi> Now as he was at Supper with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> many of the
<hi>Iews</hi> understanding that he was there, resorted thither, not only to see him,
but <hi>Lazarus</hi> also whom he had raised from the dead, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty ninth of <hi>March,</hi> Christ sitting on an Ass went to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
Now when the multitude heard that he was come unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
they went out to meet him, some laying their Garments in the way, others
strowing the boughs of Trees where he should go; and those that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cried, saying, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of</hi> David, <hi>blessed be he that cometh in
the name of the Lord</hi> At this time our Saviour Christ wept over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and cast out all those that bought and sold in the Temple, <hi>Mat. 21. Iohn
cap.</hi> 17. About the evening he went out of the City again to <hi>Bethania,</hi>
almost two miles, and there rested all night, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. So this dayes journey
was almost four miles. In the evening of this day the <hi>Iews</hi> chose their
Paschal Lamb, according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Upon the thirtieth day of <hi>March</hi> he went from <hi>Bethania</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
betimes in the morning; in which Country he cursed the Fig-tree that
wanted Fruit, and after entring into the City, he cast out of the Temple
the Money-changers and Merchants, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. About the evening (as
may be gathered by circumstance of time) he returned back again to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania.</hi>
This daies Journey was four miles.</p>
               <p>Upon the last day of <hi>March</hi> in the morning, Christ went back again from
<hi>Bethania</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and by the way as he went, his Disciples beheld the
Fig-tree that he had cursed, and lo it was dried up, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. After, when he
was in the Temple, there came certain <hi>Pharisees</hi> unto him and disputed
with him; at which time he recited the Parable of the Marriage of the Kings
Daughter. Also certain <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> came unto him asking him
whether it was lawful to pay Tribute unto <hi>Caesar, Mat.</hi> 21. 22. He also
sharply rebuked the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and recited the Simile of the
Hen and her Chickens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. After that, he went to the Mount of Olives,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:105162:187"/>
almost a mile. And then his Disciples looking upon the goodly building of
the Temple, from thence he took occasion to preach of the Destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the consummation of the World; so he stayd all that night in
the Mount of Olives, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Upon the first day of <hi>April,</hi> being <hi>Wednesday,</hi> our Saviour Christ rising
before day, taught again in the Temple; and after, as he was going to <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
he said to his Disciples, <hi>Know ye that within the se two daies is the Feast of
the Passover, and the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of Sinners,
and crucified.</hi> At the same time the Chief Priests assembled themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and took counsel how they might do to take him by deceit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.
The same day as our Saviour Christ was in the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper,
(whom he had healed of that Sickness) there came a Woman and brought
a box of precious Ointment and poured it upon his head, at which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
murmured, <hi>Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luke</hi> 21.</p>

               <p>Upon <hi>Thursday</hi> being the second day of <hi>April,</hi> the dayes of the
Feast of the Passover being now at hand, Christ with his Disciples
prepared for the eating of the Paschal Lamb; which was the fourth
Passover of our Saviour, and when about the evening of this day
it was necessary for them to keep the Paschal Lamb, and to prepare the
Passover according to God's Law; Christ sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<hi>Bethania</hi> toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> just at the beginning of the fourteenth day of the
first Month <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan,</hi> which began about the evening of this day. Here
he celebrated his last Supper among his Disciples, between six and seven of
the Clock in the evening; at which time he celebrated the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, concerning the true receiving of his Body and Blood: of which
you may read, <hi>Mat. 26. Mark 14. Luke 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. Afterward, about the
eighth hour, he washed his Dicsiples feet, and then leaning upon the Table,
he pointed out <hi>Judas</hi> that should betray him, <hi>John cap.</hi> 13. From the ninth
hour to the tenth hour, about the second Watch of the night, <hi>Judas</hi> that
Traitor went from his Disciples, <hi>John.</hi> 13. In the mean time Christ made
that long Sermon recited only by <hi>John,</hi> 14, 15, 16. and made that effectual
Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. About the tenth hour (after they had sung a Psalm)
Christ went over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> to the Garden of <hi>Gethsamene,</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than half a mile. There, between the hours of eleven and twelve,
he sweat Water and Blood, and prayed earnestly. About twelve of the Clock,
it being then midnight. Christ was betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> who about three dayes

of Glory, the Son of God. At the same time also the Servants and Officers
of the Priests beat him and mocked him. About five of the Clock in the
morning, Christ was condemned by the whole consent of the Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>drion of
the <hi>Iews, Luke</hi> 22. All these things Christ suffered between <hi>Thursday</hi> and
<hi>Friday.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> according to the commandment of
God begin their day in the evening, therefore that night wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ suffered all these things belonged unto the fourteenth day of
the Month <hi>Abib.</hi> So that just at the same time as the Feast of the Paschal
Lamb was celebrated amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> Christ, the true Lamb of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was made a living Sacrifice on the Cross for the Sins of man. Thus, as we
have observed the hours of the night, so likewise let us observe the hours
of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> being the third day of <hi>April</hi> (which as I have said began the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before) was the fourteenth day of the first Month <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan,</hi> among
the <hi>Iews.</hi> At six a Clock in the morning, about Sun-rising of the same day,
our Saviour Jesus Christ was brought unto <hi>Pilat,</hi> and <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi> hanged
himself, because he had betrayed the Innocent Blood. About seven of the
Clock in the same morning our Saviour Christ was carried to <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi>
that cruel Tyrant, who the year before had put <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to death: here he
was disdainfully handled. At eight of the Clock our Saviour Christ return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who propounded unto the <hi>Iews</hi> (because they were to have a
Capital Offender delivered unto them at the Feast of the Passover) whether
they would have Jesus their King, or <hi>Barrabbas,</hi> who had been a Murtherer,
let loose unto them; but they condemned Jesus, and chose <hi>Barrabbas,</hi> which
name signifies, The Son of the multitude, or a Seditious man. About nine
of the Clock in the morning (which the <hi>Iews</hi> commonly called the third
hour of the day, because it succeeded the morning, and continued till Noon)
our Saviour Christ was Whip'd and crowned with Thorns. About ten of
the Clock <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> in the place called <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> publickly condemned
Christ to be crucified, and washed his hands in token of Innocency. <hi>Pontius</hi>
signifies Cruel and Inhumane; <hi>Pilate,</hi> a man armed with a <hi>Roman</hi> Dart,
<hi>Mart. lib. 10. Iohn</hi> 19. Between ten and eleven, our Saviour Christ carrying
his Cross, was brought to the place called <hi>Golgotha.</hi> About eleven of the
Clock, the third hour of the morning being not yet fully finished) our
Saviour Christ was fastned upon the Cross, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. He therefore hung
four hours upon the Cross, that is, from about eleven of the Clock, till
about three in the Afternoon. And he spake before that supernatural
Eclipse of the Sun three memorable Sayings: First, <hi>Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forgive them, for
they know not what they do, Luke</hi> 19. Secondly, he said to his Mother, <hi>Woman,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:105162:190"/>
behold thy Son:</hi> And to <hi>Iohn,</hi> being converted, <hi>behold thy Mother.</hi> Thirdly,

About twelve of the Clock (in that Meridian which the <hi>Iews</hi> call the sixth
hour, that is the sixth hour from the rising of the Sun) that supernatural
Eclipse of the Sun happened, of which you may read in <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite,</hi>
and <hi>Eusebius.</hi> About three of the Clock in the Afternoon, which
the <hi>Iews</hi> call the ninth hour, (the Sun now beginning to receive its light) our
Saviour Christ spake these four sayings, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? Matth. 27. I thirst, Ioh.</hi> 19. When he had taken the Sponge,
he said, <hi>It is finished, Ioh.</hi> 19. And after, crying out with a loud Voice,
he said, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,</hi> and so died. At which
time there were many wonderful Miracles wrought, as you may read, <hi>Mat.
27. Mark 15. Luke. 23. Ioh.</hi> 19. About four of the Clock in the Afternoon, our
blessed Saviour was pierced through with a Lance, and there issued out of
his side Bloud and Water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. About five of the Clock, which the
<hi>Iews</hi> call the eleventh hour of the day, our Saviour Christ was buried by
<hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> About the sixth hour, there fell an
Eclipse of the Moon, which was natural and not miraculous, neither is it
observed by any of the Evangelists.</p>
               <p>Upon the fifteenth day of the first Month, which answereth to the 4th
of <hi>April,</hi> (being justly called the great and holy Sabbath of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
for that Christ this day rested in the Sepulchre) the Priests and Pharisees
being partly joyful, because, as they thought, the disturber of the common
Peace, and one that opposed their Authority was dead; and partly careful
how they might prevent his Resurrection, went to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and obtained of him
a Band of Souldiers to watch the Sepulchre, and to put his Seal upon the
Stone.</p>
               <p>Upon the fifth day of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ril,</hi> early in the morning, our Saviour Christ,
having overcome Death and the Devil, by his Divine Power raised himself
up from the dead, according as he had foretold his Disciples, and appeared
to <hi>Mary Magdalen, Iohn</hi> 20. and to other Women that touched his Feet,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. About Noon he appeared to <hi>Simon Peter, Luke 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In the Afternoon he travelled with two of his Disciples almost eight miles
to the Castle of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Brother of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who brought up our Saviour Christ. The other, as may
be gathered by the circumstance of the story, was <hi>Luke,</hi> because he hath
set it down so exactly.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the same day, he returned invisibly from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
eight miles, where, when the doors were all shut, and his Disciples were
assembled together for fear of the <hi>Iews,</hi> Jesus came and stood in the midst
of them, and said, <hi>Peace be u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ioseph.,</hi> witnesseth) is not onely taken for a day of rest, but also for the whole
Week: from whence is that saying in the Gospel, <hi>Iejunio bis in Sabbato, i.</hi> I
fast twice in the Week, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Upon the 12 day of <hi>April,</hi> and eight dayes after his Resurrection, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
again to his Disciples, <hi>Thomas</hi> being then present, and the doors shut;
that he might make evident that his Omnipotence was not tied to any
secondary causes, or hindered by the property of any natural Bodies,
which, according to <hi>S. Austin, Ser.</hi> 160. was so much the more wonderful,
because he appeared unto them substantially and effectually, not as Phantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
or Shadow, which vanisheth away, and is without any corporeal substance.</p>
               <p>In the same month of <hi>April</hi> our Saviour Christ appeared again to <hi>Peter,
Thomas, Nathaniel,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and other two Disciples, as they
were fishing upon the shore of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> which stood 56 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi>

our Saviour Christ appeared to above 500 Brethren at once, where many
worshipped him, and others doubted, <hi>Mat. 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. In the month of
<hi>May</hi> our Saviour Christ appeared to <hi>Iames</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> for he had
been seen before of <hi>Iames</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedeus:</hi> both which were after crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with martyrdom in the City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> upon the 25
day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> ten years after the Resurrection; and the Son of <hi>Alpheus</hi> upon
the Feast day of the Passover was thrown from a Pinacle of the Temple, 29
years after the Resurrection of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Upon the 40 day after his Resurrection, he returned fifty six miles to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
where his Disciples were assembled together: and upon the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of <hi>May,</hi> in the sight of all the Apostles, with great triumph and

in Divine Majesty and Glory, <hi>Mar. &amp; Luke. ult. Act. 1. Psal. 28. Ephes.</hi> 1.
1. <hi>Pet. 3. Heb.</hi> 1. So these Travels of our Saviour Christ were 319 miles. But
if you reckon his Travels from the time of his infancy to the day of his
Ascension, they make 3093 miles; besides his general Visitations and
Journeys hither and thither, which were so many, that as <hi>Iohn</hi> witnesseth,

Son <hi>Titus</hi> wasted and destroyed <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and all the Land of <hi>Iudaea;</hi> yet
afterward it was re-edified, and in St. <hi>Ieroms</hi> time, which was 400 years after
Christ, it was a fair City. There was shewn the House of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> and
the Sycomore-tree that he went up to see Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. But by reason of
the often destructions and devastations that hath fallen upon it, there is not
to be seen at this day above eight Houses in the Town, and all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reliques of the holy Places are utterly destroyed, the House of
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> and the Sicomore-tree are no more to be seen in that Place: only
the Place is to be seen where our Saviour restored the blind man to sight,
when he cryed after him, <hi>Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have mercy upon me, Luke</hi>
chap. 18. Also though the Country throughout be very fruitful and pleasant,
yet it is nothing so fertile and pleasant, as it was when the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> did dwell there. For the Roses of <hi>Iericho</hi> are no more to be found
there, but rather in a Village about sixteen miles from <hi>Iordan</hi> towards the
East. And although they stand so far distant off, yet they retain their
ancient name. Between <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iericho</hi> there is a Desart or Wilderness,
which by the Inhabitants of the holy Land is called <hi>Quarentena,</hi> where the
man of which Christ speaketh fell among Thieves, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. There is in the
same place at this day great thieving, and many Robberies committed, as
<hi>Brittenbacchus</hi> saith. In this Place also is to be seen the River <hi>Chereth,</hi> where
the Ravens fed <hi>Eliah, 1 Reg.</hi> 17. Near to <hi>Iericho</hi> also is found the River,

North-eastward, just in the way as you go from thence to <hi>Iericho</hi> in the
Wilderness of <hi>Quarentena,</hi> close by the River <hi>Chereth</hi> in the Tribe of

               <p>THIS City was a type of the Church, which is always subject to the

                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:105162:192"/>
that is, The House of Sorrow and Affliction: being derived of <hi>Baith,</hi> a
House; and <hi>Oni,</hi> Affliction. According to the prophecy of our Saviour,
who foretold of the Afflictions and Tribulations that should fall upon his
Church, <hi>You shall mourn, but you shall be comforted, and your grief shall be
turned into joy.</hi> It was distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> almost two miles towards the
South-East. <hi>Borchardus</hi> the Monk observeth, that close by a Well, about
a stones cast out of this Town, there is shewed the place where <hi>Martha</hi> met
our Saviour Christ when he came to <hi>Bethania,</hi> and a little after called her
Sister to meet him, <hi>Ioh. cap.</hi> 11. There is also shewn in this Town the
House of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper, where a certain Woman having an Alablaster
box of precious Ointment, poured it on our Saviours head, not without the
great indignation of his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. There is also to be seen the house
of <hi>Martha,</hi> to which our Saviour did oftentimes resort, <hi>Luke 10. Iohn</hi> 11.
and 12. and in that place there is at this day a Church built in honour of
those two Sisters, which were the Sisters of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> There is also seen the
Sepulchre out of which <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raised from death to life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.
which stands close by the said Church, and over it is built a Chappel of
Marble, very decent and comely. The <hi>Saracens</hi> hold this Chappel in
great estimation. You cannot see the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from <hi>Bethania</hi>
because of the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> but as soon as you ascend a little Hill
in the way as you go thence to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> you may discern Mount <hi>Sion</hi>
and a part of the City: then when you are descended from that Hill,
the City is again hidden. After that, upon the left side of the Mount
of Olives, some stones cast from <hi>Bethpage,</hi> you do leave a small Village
standing under the Mountain of Offence, where <hi>Solomon</hi> in times past com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Idolatry. From this Village the Ass and the Colt was brought
unto Christ. Not far from thence, upon the South side as you go upon the
Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> you come unto the place where Christ mounted upon the
Ass, as we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. And a little after you may see the whole City of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, and the Church of the holy Sepulchre,
with many other holy places. Then as you descend from the top of the
Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> you may see the place where the multitude cried, <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> And in this descent also
our Saviour Christ wept over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> saying, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem,
how often would I have gathered thee under my Wings as a Hen gathereth her
Chickens, but thou wouldest not.</hi>

you go from <hi>Bethania</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and, as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Habitation of the Priests, which at their appointed times went up to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> to minister to the Lord. It was so called because of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:105162:192"/>
is a notable type of the Church, for that ought likewise to be fruitful, and
to bring forth sweet Figs, that is, good Works, and many other comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Vertues, that so men in their afflictions might be comforted. As it is
thought, the Fig-tree that our Saviour Christ cursed because it wanted Fruit,
stood not far from <hi>Bethpage, Mat. 21. Mark</hi> 11. Wherefore let us take
heed that we be not like fruitless Fig-trees, covered only (like our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>) with Leaves, and bearing no fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. lest so God's

               <head>Of the Castle from whence the Ass and the Colt were brought
upon which our Saviour Christ rode to Jerusalem.</head>
               <p>THIS Castle (as <hi>Adamus Risnerus</hi> saith) was a certain Hold compassed
about with strong Walls, and within beautified with a fair Palace
supported with goodly Columns: it stood not far from the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi>
just in the dividing of the way as you go from <hi>Bethania</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> for
there goes one way to the Fountain-Gate, and another to the Valley
of <hi>Gehinnon.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text it is called <hi>Tirah,</hi> as you may read in
<hi>Matthew,</hi> which signifies not only <hi>a Castle,</hi> but <hi>a firm and sure building, with
good decorum and order:</hi> for <hi>Tor</hi> signifies <hi>a circular order.</hi> It is credible, that
this Hold is a resting place, and that the Ass and the Colt were tied in the
way, for this cause; that if by chance any Travellers were weary (by reason
of the tediousness of their Journey) they might hire them for certain hours
to carry them over the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> and so return them back again.
The Allegorical meaning of this Ass and the Colt, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of many learned men, signifies the People of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were
burthened with <hi>Moses</hi>'s Laws: and the Asses Colt signifies the rest of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
which were not charged with the burthen of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, but tied only
to the Law of Nature. So we also like Travellers and Strangers in this
miserable World, are tied to the Afflictions and Calamities thereof, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in two ways, expecting the death of the Body, and liberty of the Soul;
then our Saviour Christ cometh in Peace and looseth this Body of death,
(as the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) and bringeth us to that Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
eternal Joy, according to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the first of the <hi>Philippians, I desire
to be loosed and to be with our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>

               <p>ABout half a mile and a Furlong from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> towards the East, stood
the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> very fruitful and pleasant, bringing forth Olives,
Palms, Figs, Gossumtine, and many other notable Fruits, but principally,
Palms and Olives, of which the Mountain taketh the Name. It is said in
<hi>Pliny, lib. 16. cap.</hi> 19. that these Olive and Palm trees do never lose their
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:105162:193"/>
Leaves, and are green both Winter and Summer. St. <hi>Austin</hi> calleth it,
<hi>The Mountain of Vnction,</hi> because of the Fertility and pleasantness of it: also
<hi>The Mountain of Health,</hi> because it bringeth forth Oyls and many other
Plants necessary for Physick: also, <hi>The Mountain of Light;</hi> first, because it
lieth upon the East, so that the Sun shineth in the morning very pleasantly
upon it, and in the evening when it setteth, the Beams thereof reflecting
upon the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> casteth a beautiful light to this Mount: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because it bringeth forth Oyl, which is the nourishment and life
of light: thirdly, because it was beautified with the gracious presence of
our blessed Lord and Saviour Christ, which is the Day-star and Light of
the Church, rising up on high to inlighten all those which shall be called
unto eternal happiness. For which cause it typically representeth the Church,
which is the light of the World, wherein are found many <hi>Christians</hi> that
bring forth pleasant Fruit, (good Works) relieving the necessity of such
as are in want, comforting the afflicted, and patiently supporting the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Misery of this World, that so they might triumphantly rejoyce
with Christ in that heavenly City of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What things <hi>Zacharias</hi> hath spoken of this Mount in his last Chapter, is
to be understood of the preaching of the Gospel, and propagation of the
Church through all the World. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> saith in his Epitaph upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
That upon this Hill the <hi>Jews</hi> commonly burnt the red Cow, with the Ashes
whereof the People of God being sprinkled, they were purified and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
of which you may read, <hi>Num. 19. Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hellen</hi> the Empress, Mother to that godly Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
about the year of our Lord 332, caused a fair and beautiful Church to be
built upon this Mount, just in the place where our blessed Lord and Saviour
Christ ascended up into Heaven. It was built round, all of white polished
Marble: upon the top thereof there is no Roof, but a Window, even as
Christ should ascend through it, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, in the Life of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 40. The same St. <hi>Jerom</hi> affirmeth,
in his Book <hi>Delocis Hebraicis.</hi> He also saith, That the Inhabitants of the
Holy Land take upon them to shew in this Church, the Impression of the
Feet of our Saviour Christ, which hapned as they say, just at such time as
he ascended up into Heaven: out of which Travellers and Pilgrims take
Sand to carry with them as an holy Relick, though indeed it is verily to be
thought, that they were feet made in stone by antient Monks, thereby to get
Money from such as resorted thither upon Devotion; for look how oft Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
take thence the Sand, they are presently filled again: from whence
may be gathered, that there is no Sand naturally there. Every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to imbrace a nearer way to Salvation, than to follow those Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Fables; and to seek Christ in the Holy Scripture, not upon the Mount
of <hi>Olives,</hi> or amongst Sand: for since the Grave could not contain him,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:105162:193"/>
the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> cannot hold him, who now sitteth at the right Hand of
his Father, in Power and eternal Glory: but rather, if we be desirous to see the
Footsteps of Christ, let us seek them in the Church, which is dispers'd through
the World; wherein we are sufficiently taught how we should follow him.</p>

               <p>THIS was a Village scituated at the foot of the Mountain of Olives, in
a pleasant and fruitful place. Near unto this Village, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
observeth, there were many pleasant Gardens, which gave forth very sweet
and delectable savours; unto which Place Christ and his Disciples did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
resort, as the Evangelist <hi>Luke, cap</hi> 22. observeth. It was so called from
the pressing forth of Oyl; for <hi>Gath</hi> or <hi>Geth,</hi> signifies a Press, and <hi>Schaemen</hi>
Oyl. In this place the heart of our Saviour Christ was so press'd with
affliction that he sweat drops of Blood: By which Blood the Sins of our Souls
are washed away, and we that are wounded are made whole, as with a most
precious Balsom, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hellen</hi> the Empress, in an Orchard close by this Town, set up a fair and
beautiful Church, over the Sepulchre of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> which she called
by the name of the Mother of God, <hi>Niceph. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 30. It is said, that this
Sepulchre remaineth to this day in this Church, made of white polished
Marble, standing about eight and forty steps under ground, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wider than the Sepulchre of Christ: in it there is two doors, one to go
in, another to go out. But whether this be the right Sepulchre of the blessed
Virgin, it concerneth us not, since it appertaineth not to our Salvation,
neither is mentioned in the holy Scriptures: but if any Man be desirous to
be further satisfied in it let him read <hi>Nice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and her Ascension, both, in my Opinion, of like Credit; because, I suppose,
that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> (who wrote the Acts of the Apostles, and lived in those times)
would not have omitted so memorable an Action. But to return to the
Garden of <hi>Gethsamene.</hi> About some fifty paces towards the East of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of the blessed Virgin, close by the foot of the Mount of Olives, stands
a certain Chappel, just in the place where sometimes the Town of <hi>Gethsamene</hi>
stood. Not far from this Chappel is shewn a certain hollow place under a Rock,
where, the Inhabitants say our Saviour sweat drops of Blood. They also shew
a certain stone whereon the Angels stood which comforted our Saviour. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
thence about a stones cast, they shew unto Pilgrims a place close by the
Cave in the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> sat when our
Saviour was in his Agony. They also shew the place where <hi>Peter</hi> cut off
<hi>Malchus</hi> Ear. There is to be seen a memorable Place where <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:105162:194"/>
our Saviour with a kiss, when he delivered him to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Not far off

them, <hi>Whom seek ye?</hi> Besides many other things (if <hi>Borchardus</hi> may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited)
as the Impression of his hair and head upon a stone; and of his finger,
as if it had been in Wax, upon a Rock: and in the place where he prayed,
of his Hands and Knees, which are so firm in stone that they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
with any Instrument. But there have been many in this place since
these times, which have seen none of these things: from whence may be
gathered, that they have been idle delusions used by ancient Monks to get
money from Pilgrims and Strangers; and I have here remembred them,
that others knowing these, may beware of the like Fallacies and Deceits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely

               <p>This Garden of <hi>Gethsamene</hi> is credibly thought to have been planted in
former times by the Kings, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> but increased and inlarged
by other succeeding Princes, that there they might recreate themselves, and
receive some content by the Fruits of the Earth. But on the contrary, that
great King, the anointed of the Lord, our blessed Saviour, in this place of
Pleasure, this Paradice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> was constrain'd to undergo that almost

of the Pillar of Stone, to which they say Christ was tied when he was whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
in which Stone are to be seen certain red specks, as if they had been
drops of Bloud; and these also (they say) were the Blood of Christ when
he was scourged; besides many other things, of which you may read at the
beginning of this Treatise in the description of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as it is at this day.</p>

               <head>The Description of the holy Sepulchre.</head>
               <p>THE Sepulchre of Christ stood upon the West side of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> close by
Mount <hi>Golgatha,</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> for it was the
custom of the <hi>Iews</hi> to build their Tombs or Sepulchres in their Orchards and
Gardens; and beautifie and adorn them with Lillies, Roses, and other Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
on purpose to put them in mind of their Mortality, according to that
of <hi>David, Psal. 103. The days of Man are like Grass, as a Flower of the Field
so flourisheth he: for the Wind goeth over it and is gone, and the Place thereof
shall know it no more.</hi> And for this cause the <hi>Iews,</hi> but especially the Kings,
would be buried in their Gardens: so <hi>Ioseph,</hi> a good and just Man, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this custom, had hewed him out of a Rock a new Monument, in
which there had been no Man laid; that so when he walked in the Garden
to take the Air, he might be put in mind of his Mortality. In this Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Saviour Christ was buried: and from this Place, upon the third
Day early in the Morning, he rose; to the terrour and astonishment of
such as watched the Sepulchre. From whence may be gathered, that as our
first Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> trespassed against God, and lost Felicity in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
so Christ the Son of God in a Garden made satisfaction for that Sin;
restored us again to Grace, and make us capable of heavenly felicity. This
Sepulchre (as it is described by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> when he went with <hi>S. Peter</hi> to see
if that notable Miracle of the Resurrection were true) was like a little Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
the door thereof being upon the outside, and was but one Room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any division, so that a Man might see all that was within it: for he saith,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:105162:195"/>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. That he did not go in, but look'd in, and saw the linnen Cloaths
where they lay wrapped up: from whence may be concluded, that that
Sepulchre which is now extant (howsoever perhaps it may stand in the same
place) is not the same Sepulchre wherein our Saviour Christ was buried;
for it is described to be four square, to be open at the top, to have within it
two Vaults (an inward and an outward) and that you descend to it by Stairs,
as you may read at the beginning of this Treatise; which description doth not
agree with that of <hi>St. John's.</hi> Again <hi>St. John</hi> saith, that they rolled a great
Stone to the door of the Sepulchre, did not lay it upon the top of it. Also
<hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> affirm, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> and other heathen People
filled up the Sepulchre of Christ with Earth, and built up in the place the
Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> and in it put her Image, where she was worshipped a long
time after, untill such time as that godly Emperess <hi>Hellen</hi> caused that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be abolished, and the Sepulchre cleansed and purified. Afterwards, at
her instigation, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great (who was her Son) built up in the
very same place a fair and goodly Church in the memory of our Saviour, and
bestowed great cost both in the workmanship, and in beautifying it with Gold
and Silver. This Temple (as it was before it was destroyed by the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>)
is said to be built all of white polished Marble, and beautified with
Stones of divers colours, gilt with Gold and Silver, covered on the out side
with Lead to withstand the storms and showers of Rain that happened; but
the inside was gilt all with splendent and refulgent Gold, which cast a
wonderful lustre upon the Beholders. Upon either side of it were two walking
Galleries, one above, which was close; and another below, which was open,
extending themselves the length of the Sanctuary; all the Roof and Vault
being covered over with Gold and artificial Work, the one being supported
with Pillars of Marble, the other with Posts of Wood plaited with Silver.
There were also three Gates towards the East, very fitly and fairly disposed,
by which the multitude that resorted thither go in and out: within these
there stood an Arch, representing, after a sort, the Hemisphere of the
Heavens, extended to the top of the Sanctuary like a Circle, girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with twelve Pillars of equal bigness, representing the twelve Apostles;
and upon the top of this Arch were placed Cups of Silver, beautifully burnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
All which the said Emperour dedicated to God for a Monument.</p>
               <p>There were many other memorable things that did belong to this Temple,
which were admirable to look on, all which, as you came up the high-street
from the market place, were presented to your view; a stately sight, the like
whereof those parts did not afford. This Temple was built by the Emperour
<hi>Constantine, Anno Dom.</hi> 333. Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who was a Dr. of Divinity, and
lived in <hi>England</hi> 700 years after Christ, described the holy Sepulchre after
this manner: This Sepulchre over head was something round, and so high,
that a man could scarce touch it with his hand; standing in that Rock
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:105162:195"/>
which extendeth it self to Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> into the Garden of <hi>Joseph</hi> of
<hi>Arimathea:</hi> representing in form a little Chappel: the entrance thereinto
was towards the East. And further he addeth, that they which went
into this Vail, found on the right hand toward the North, a stone
Tomb which resembled a Coffin, scituated in the pavement, joyning to the
Wall; which stone Coffin was of a mix'd colour, that is, white and red,
being seven Foot long, and three handfuls high. This description, Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Bede</hi> received from certain Monks, that went upon devotion to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
to visit this Sepulchre: but since, it hath been divers times destroyed and
polluted by the <hi>Turks</hi> and other Heathen People. From whence may be
gathered, that the Sepulchre which is now standing and shewed unto Pilgrims,
is some device of the Monks to get Money of Strangers, and procure a kind of
Devotion in the hearts of Ignorant People; wherefore as the Angel said, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.
Let us not seek Christ any longer among the dead, or in the Grave, but in his
holy Church, where the lively pourtraiture of his Divine Presence is set forth
unto us: that so we may be made partakers with him hereafter in that place
of eternal Glory. Concerning the residue of this description you may see it
before.</p>

               <p>THIS City or Castle of <hi>Emmaus,</hi> is distant from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> almost eight
miles towards the North-West. It signifies the Mother of Fortitude;
being derived of <hi>Em,</hi> a Mother; and <hi>Vtz,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call Fortitude.
It stood where three several ways were, that so it might serve for a direction

the Church, which is our true Mother, shewing us the way unto eternal Life.
And although it be but little, and the number in it few, yet it is strong. As
the Castle, though it were small, yet it is almost invincible; and for that
cause called, The Mother of Strength, as the Church is called, The Mother
of the Righteous, against which the Gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail.</p>

which Strangers might resort, and there three ways met; two went of

constrained our blessed Saviour to stay with them, because it was

then about Sun-set. Near unto this Inn, <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Zozemenus</hi> say
(in their Ecclesiastical History) there was a Spring or Well of that admirable

               <p>THIS <hi>Ioseph,</hi> which caused our Saviour Christ to be buried in his Garden,
was a rich man, upright and just in all his Actions, a Senator of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and one that expected the Kingdom of God; born at <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
a City of the <hi>Iews, Luc.</hi> 23. This City was sometime called <hi>Ramathaim So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
and sometime <hi>Ramah,</hi> because it was scituated in a high place, and
in times past was a fair City standing 16 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> toward
the North-west, the description whereof you may read before. At this day
it is called <hi>Ramalea;</hi> being nothing so fair as it was, but like a Country
Town, the Houses being carelesly dispersed here and there, lying without
Walls or Bulwarks to defend it; notwithstanding, the ancient ruines of the
former City is to be seen even at this day. There is also a great Inn or
resting place for Strangers, having within it many Rooms for the receipt of
Passengers, and a Well of very sweet Water. This House was first pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
at the charge of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and by him committed to
the protection of the <hi>Monks</hi> of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> by whom it is at this day made
an Hospital, wherein Pilgrims, Travellers, and Strangers, are entertained,
and find much relief. In an inward Orchard belonging to this Hospital,
there is a fair plat of Ground that bringeth forth great abundance of <hi>Aloes,</hi>
of which there is often mention in the holy Scriptures, but more especially in
<hi>Psalm 48. Thy Garments smell of Aloes and Cassia, when thou comest out of thy
Ivory Palaces, where they have made thee glad.</hi>

                  <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Iews,</hi> together with <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> brought

Body of our Saviour Christ, when they had begged it of <hi>Pilate,</hi> before they
buried it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. Myrrh is a kind of Gum that issueth out of a Tree that
grows in the East Countries, but principally in <hi>Arabia.</hi> The Tree out of
which it issueth is commonly two Yards and a half high, with some Pricks
upon it, the Bark whereof being cut, there issueth out of it drops like Tears,
which congealeth into a Gum, and is called Myrrh: The principal Vertue
that it hath, is to keep the Bodies of the dead incorruptable, see <hi>Pli. li.</hi> 12.
<hi>ca. 15. &amp;</hi> 16. In <hi>Arabia Foelix</hi> there is such abundance of sweet Myrrh, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense,
and other odoriferous Gums, that such as Sail in the red Sea may
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:105162:197"/>
easily smell the savour of them. There is also found in the Holy Land
Myrrh and Aloes. Aloes is the juyce of a certain bitter Herb, which by
some is called <hi>Everliving:</hi> it killeth the Worms, and preserveth from Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
it is also good for the Sight. There is to be gathered in <hi>India, Arabia,</hi>
and the Holy Land, a certain Herb of an extraordinary sweet smell, with
Leaves broad, fat and juycy, which being press'd yieldeth more Aloes than
Honey; from whence this metaphorical Proverb is used, <hi>Quod plus molestiae
quam voluptatis gignit,</hi> that is, more troublesome than profitable. You may
read also in <hi>Plautus,</hi> that the Life of Man tasteth more of Aloes than Honey;
and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> speaking of an evil Wife, saith, she hath more of Aloes than
Honey. So <hi>Euripides,</hi> Every sweet hath his sowre. So also the Holy Cross
seemeth to have more of Aloes than Honey, notwithstanding it preserveth
us from eternal Corruption, and killeth the venemous Worms of Conscience,
cleanseth us from our Sins, and freeth us from the fear of the Devil and
eternal Death, that so we might be recreated, and by the Faith of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

               <head>The Travels of Peter.</head>
               <p>IN the thirty fifth year after the Nativity of Christ, about the Month
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and a little before the Conversion of the Apostle <hi>Paul; Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> were sent from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> being thirty two miles,
that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> might receive that admirable gift of the Holy
Ghost, and there they disputed with <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Samaria</hi> they returned back again to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was thirty
two miles. In this Jonrney they went to divers Towns of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
teaching and preaching unto them the Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>In the sixth year after the Resurrection of Christ, <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Lidda,</hi>
which was distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> twenty miles towards the North-East;
where he cured <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had lain sick eight years of the Palsie upon his
Bed, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to <hi>Ioppa,</hi> which was three miles: here he raised
<hi>Tabitha</hi> from Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the seventh year after the Resurrection of Christ, <hi>Peter</hi> went from <hi>Ioppa</hi>
and came to <hi>Caesarea Strato,</hi> which was six and thirty miles: where he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gospel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, and baptized him and his whole
Family, <hi>Acts. 10. Clemens Recogn. lib.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Caesarea</hi> he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being thirty two miles; where
being accused for going to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he excused himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:105162:197"/>In the eleventh year after the Resurrection of Christ, he was cast into
Prison, and set at liberty by an Angel of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. So he went secretly
from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (as it was thought) into the Desart, or to some other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
place: upon the second day of <hi>August</hi> in the same year, <hi>Herod
Agrippa</hi> King of the <hi>Iews</hi> was struck by an Angel of God at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and he
was devoured of Worms, <hi>Acts 12. Ioseph. Antiq. lib. 19. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>After, <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> being dead and buried, <hi>Peter</hi> returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
where he was in Council with the rest of the Apostles, about sixteen years
after the Resurrection of Christ, and fourteen after the Conversion of <hi>Paul,
Gal. 2. Acts</hi> 15. See also <hi>Bede</hi> upon the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>In the seventeenth year after the Resurrection of Christ, <hi>Peter</hi> went from

               <p>From <hi>Antiochia</hi> he went to <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he wrote his first

               <head>Allegations of the Author to prove that Peter was never at Rome.</head>
               <p>BUT that <hi>Peter</hi> was twenty five years seven Months and five days Bishop
and Chief Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be proved by the testimony of the
Scripture, and is utterly repugnant to the supputation and true accompt of the
times. First, Because it is manifest by that which hath been said, that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and in <hi>Iudaea</hi> during the time that <hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and
<hi>Claudius</hi> were Emperours of <hi>Rome.</hi> And shortly after the Martyrdom of <hi>Stephen,</hi>
he and <hi>Iohn</hi> were sent into <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> might also receive
the gift of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts 8. Paul</hi> also in the third year after his
Conversion, came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there spoke with <hi>Peter,</hi> and remained
with him fifteen days, <hi>Acts 9. Gal.</hi> 1. Fourteen days after the Conversion of
<hi>Paul, Peter</hi> was at the Apostolical Council held in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and there,

that they should go and preach the Gospel unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that he and
the rest would go to the <hi>Iews</hi> and those that were circumcised, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. In the
time of <hi>Claudius Caesar, Peter</hi> was committed to Prison by <hi>Herod Agri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and miraculously delivered by the Angel of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. In
the ninth year of <hi>Claudius Caesar, Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi>
resisted him to his face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. All these things manifestly prove that the
Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome</hi> at such time as any of these three, <hi>viz. Tiberius,
Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> were Emperours; but either in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or else at
<hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it may exactly be made evident out of the holy Scriptures, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Nero.</hi> For, in the second year of <hi>Nero,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:105162:198"/>
Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and sent it from <hi>Corinth</hi> by the hand
of <hi>Phebe:</hi> in which Epistle, he saluted all his Friends which he had in that
City, by name, as by the conclusion of the Epistle more plainly appeareth;
but there is no mention of the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> who (if at that time Bishop

these Epistles he expresly nameth all his Friends that he had in <hi>Rome,</hi>

Prison under <hi>Nero,</hi> in the last year of the Reign of this Emperour, he wrote
from <hi>Rome</hi> his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being a little before his death: at
the end of which Epistle he plainly shews, that he had no Companion there
but <hi>Luke, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. From whence it is manifest, that <hi>Peter,</hi> during all the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
and Life of <hi>Paul,</hi> was never at <hi>Rome:</hi> how then can it possibly be,
that <hi>Peter</hi> should be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the space of almost twenty six years?
Truly there are many learned men, and they also of great Judgment,
which hold this Opinion false, and utterly repugnant to Holy Scripture, neither
can be proved by any good Authors or Histories. But if <hi>Peter</hi> were ever at
<hi>Rome,</hi> he came thither after the last Imprisonment of <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few
years before his Martyrdom. Because (as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> saith, <hi>in Comment. fast.

               <p>BEcause I have before briefly intreated of the Beginning and Foundation of
this City, I shall not need here again to repeat it. I will now therefore shew
the end of it, which was principally caused by the obstinancy of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
who refusing the Doctrine and Prophecy of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus,</hi> imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and followed strange Gods, and offered Incense unto Idols; whereby
the wrath of God was kindled against them, insomuch, that he left this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
City as a Prey to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Foreign Nations, that carried the People
thereof into Captivity; where, for a long time, they remained in great misery.</p>

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:105162:198"/>After the first desolation, because the Country round about this City was
very fertile and pleasant, abounding with Springs, Rivers, Vines, Olive
Gardens, Mountains, fruitful Vallies, fair Cities, and strong Castles and
Towns. <hi>Herod Ascalonites</hi> (that great King of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who put to death
the innocent Children) re-edified it, set up many goodly buildings, beautified
with Marble Pillars and pleasant Walks: And also in the circuit of the Kings
House, and under the buildings of the Nobility in the common Market-place,
the Houses and Vaults were supported with Marble Pillars, according to the
manner of the <hi>Iews.</hi> The Palace (called the Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s House) stood in the midst
of the City, upon the top of the Mountain: and round about it there were
divers other buildings set up, but much lower, even about the descent of
the Mountain; yet scituated, that the Inhabitants might see out of their
Houses the Country round about. Then close to the Palace, in the upper
part of the City, he caused a Temple to be built in honor of <hi>Augustus.</hi> Thus
having finished the inside, he compass'd it about with a mighty Wall, and
upon that placed many Turrets: and then to flatter <hi>Augustus,</hi> called it by
the name of <hi>Sebasten,</hi> which among the <hi>Grecians</hi> signifies <hi>Augustum &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabile
Principem:</hi> now although this City was very glorious and spacious
in those times (for it was three miles about) yet at this day it is utterly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
and destroyed, insomuch, that there is not a House standing, two
Churches only excepted, which were built in honour of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist: and
the chief of these, which was the Cathedral Church, the <hi>Saracens</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to their use, so that at this day <hi>Mahomet</hi> is worshipped in it. In this
stood the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, cut out in Marble, like the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
of Christ, where (as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith) he lieth buried between <hi>Elisha</hi> and
<hi>Obediah</hi> the Prophets. This Church stands upon the side of the Mountain,
in the descent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saracens</hi> do principally reverence St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Baptist next after Christ,
and they affirm the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to have conceived by the holy Spirit, and
not by the Seed of Man: That St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was the greatest Prophet (except
Christ) that ever was. They also believe Christ to be the Son of God, but
not to be equal with God. Yet they prefer <hi>Mahomet</hi> before both, because
they hold him a Messenger sent from God, not unto all Men, but only unto
the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and their Subjects.</p>
               <p>The other Church, which stood in <hi>Samaria,</hi> was upon the top of the
Mountain which somtimes the Kings Palace stood. In this Church, in times
past, there dwelt certain <hi>Grecian</hi> Monks, which were Christians, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
Christian Pilgrims with great Humanity, and furnished them with
many Necessaries.</p>
               <p>But the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> it self hath been so often overthrown, and brought
to such extream misery, that almost all the Ground where it stood is at
this time converted into an Olive Garden. So that as that wicked King

                  <hi>Ahab</hi> turned the Vineyard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> which stood close by his House, into
an Olive Garden; so God in his singular Justice hath turned the Palace of
that King, and the whole City wherein he dwelt, which was the strength of his
Kingdom, into an Olive Garden. There are not so many ruins found
through all the Land of <hi>Iudaea</hi> (though there have been many worthy
Cities destroyed) as are in this place at this day. The scituation of this City
was very beautiful; for a man might have seen from it to the Sea of <hi>Ioppae</hi>

the violence of the Sea. This Haven was so wonderfully co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and set up at such a great charge, that it was admirable to look upon; for
he laid the foundation of it twenty yards under Water, burying in the deep
Stones of an extraordinary greatness, some fifty foot long, eight foot thick,
and ten foot broad, and many of them more. The Haven it self was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with fair Buildings and goodly Walls, supported with Marble Pillars
and mounted up aloft, so that you might see the Ships as they were upon
the Sea, and made way to his Harbour. The entrance into it was upon the
North: at the mouth thereof there stood three mighty Colosses upon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pillars. He also placed upon the Wall of the City towards the Haven
mighty Towers; the chiefest and fairest of which he dedicated to <hi>Drusus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
his Son in law, and called it by the Name of the <hi>Drusian</hi> Tower. The
buildings that joyned to this Haven were all of white polished Marble, and
the Streets of the City were directly towards it. Also the Market-place where
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105162:199"/>
they bought and sold was not far from it. Upon a little Hill, close by this
Port, he caused a Church to be built in honour of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> This
Temple was a very magnificent and stately building, and in it he caused
the Statue of <hi>Augustus</hi> (curiously wrought and cast just in the figure of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Olympius</hi>) to be erected, and worshipped it as his God. There are many other
stately and sumptuous buildings that were set up by this King. But amongst
the rest, he bestowed great cost upon the Market-place, the Theatre and
the Amphitheatre, which he wonderfully beautified, and instituted certain
Games to be there used once every fifth year in Honour of <hi>Augustus,</hi> as <hi>Ioseph
de Bell. Iud. li.</hi> 1. witnesseth. After the death of this King, <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> was
made King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This Prince, some ten years after the Resurrection
of Christ, caused <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> upon the 25 day of <hi>July</hi> to be put
to death in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and when he perceived it was acceptable unto the
<hi>Jews,</hi> in the following year, about the the Feast of the Passover he caused
<hi>Peter</hi> to be cast into Prison; who by the Prayers of the Church was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
delivered, as you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 12. A little after, that is, about the
month of <hi>August,</hi> this King was struck by the Angel of the Lord, and died
miserably: for when he came to <hi>Caesarea Strato,</hi> he caused the publick Shews
to be solemnly practised, and in honour of <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> set forth very
sumptuous Interludes and Plays; to which Feast and Shews all the Nobility
and Gentry of that Country round about resorted. Where the next day,
very early in the Morning, having put on a rich and goodly Garment, made
all of Cloath of Gold, he went into the Theatre; and there, according to his
usual custom, sat in a princely Seat, and made an Oration to the Inhabitants of
<hi>Tyre.</hi> Now when the Sun was up and shone upon his Garments, the Rays ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cast such a reflection upon the beholders, that it dazled their Eyes, insomuch
that they could scarce see. Wherefore those that were his Flatterers, hearing
his gracious Speech, cried with a loud Voice, <hi>O Agrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for although heretofore we feared thee as a Man, yet now we well perceive thou
art of a more Noble and Divine Nature.</hi> But when the King (taking delight in
these speeches) would not restrain the impious clamour of these flatterers, a
little after he lifted up his head, and upon the top of a Pillar he saw an Owl

after he was struck with an extream pain in his Bowels, insomuch, that with a
loud Voice he cried unto his Friends, <hi>I, whom but now was called your God, am

Words being ended, they carried him sick into his Palace, and it was given
out that he was dead.</p>

               <p>This Town flourished for a long time after the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and it was scituated in a fair and profitable place, fortified towards the

more at large in their former description. From this Town it is credibly

that <hi>Babylon</hi> which stood in <hi>Chaldaea</hi> was in the time of <hi>Peter</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;

also <hi>Mark,</hi> who was the Disciple of <hi>Peter,</hi> was the first Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
as you may read in the end of this Epistle. Wherefore that Opinion
which some would have to pass for truth, that <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his first Epistle from
<hi>Rome,</hi> calling it allegorically <hi>Babylon,</hi> is utterly to be condemned, since
there is none who can certainly prove that conjecture, neither is it grounded

               <p>From <hi>Samaria</hi> he returned back again to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 32 miles; and as he

                  <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord being now 59 years of age, died in the
twelfth year after the Resurrection of Christ, and was buried by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
in the Garden of <hi>Gethsemene, Iohn</hi> being then 35 years old. Four
years after her death, he was present at the Apostolical Council in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
Now <hi>Iames,</hi> his Brother, who was called the Elder, was beheaded two years
before; for this Council was celebrated in the presence of <hi>Iames,</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Peter, Iohn, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, &amp;c.</hi> about sixteen years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

               <p>Before the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which happened about the 61 year of
his age, and 38 after Christs Ascension, <hi>Iohn</hi> went from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and came
to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 544 miles, where, after the death of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> he governed
the Churches of <hi>Asia minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 86 year of his age, being cast into a Vessel of boiling Oyl, and
coming out unhurt; by the command of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
into the Isle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> distant from <hi>Ephesus</hi> 40 miles. There he
wrote his <hi>Revelation</hi> to the seven Churches in <hi>Asia minor;</hi> whereof you may
read, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Pathmos</hi> he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was forty miles, being
then 88 years of age, and there he raised <hi>Drusana</hi> from Death to Life. After
this, he governed the Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> four years, that is, from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, unto the fourth year of the Government of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
the Emperour, and called the young Man to repentance which was of the
Society of Thieves: at length he died at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when he was 91 years old,
<hi>An. Dom.</hi> 100. as <hi>St. Ierom</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus li. 2. ca.</hi> 32. observe. So all his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels

                  </gap>ility of the Soil called <hi>Ephesus:</hi>
in future Ages growing into such credit and estimation, that it was mightily
increased and became one of the most famous Mart Towns in all <hi>Asia;</hi> but it
stood somewhat low, so that the Sea brake in upon it and drowned it, and
many of the Inhabitants perished. Nevertheless <hi>Lysimachus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace</hi>
built it up again in the same place where now it stands, and called it <hi>Arsinoes,</hi>
after his Wives name. But he being dead, it was again called by the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
name <hi>Ephesus.</hi> There were many worthy Men that lived in it, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,
Scotinus</hi> and <hi>Hermadorus,</hi> who, for his excellent understanding and
singular honesty, was banished. <hi>Hipponachus</hi> also the Poet, <hi>Perrhasius</hi> and <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
the Painters, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Orator and <hi>Theodotio</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> who interpreted
the Bible. It was in ancient times inhabited by the <hi>Amazons,</hi> whose Queen
kept her court there, and wonderfully increased and adorned it with fair and
beautiful Buildings. Here also that notable Temple dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi>
which as <hi>Strab.</hi> saith, <hi>li. 14. Plin. li. 36. c.</hi> 14. was 220 years a building. It
stood upon Morish Ground to avoid the danger of Earth-quakes. There
were in it 127 Pillars, erected by so many Kings; among which there were
36 that were curiously sicled, and artificially carved and ingraven: It was
425 foot long, and 120 broad. There were so many Gifts and Gratuities
sent from all the Cities and Kings round about, toward the building of this
Temple, that the Riches and Treasure thereof was wonderful; insomuch
that when it was finished, it was accounted one of the stateliest Buildings the
World could afford, and numbered amongst the Wonders of the World.
This Temple thus built at such an extraordinary charge that it was almost
unvaluable, was set on fire by one <hi>Herostratus</hi> a wicked and perverse Fellow,
(in the same Olympiad and Day that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was born) who
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:105162:204"/>
having nothing in him that might make him famous in after-ages, burnt this
goodly Building, that so (though not for his good, but for his evil) he
might get a name. But the <hi>Ephesians</hi> were so incensed because of this
Mischief, that they procured Proclamation to be made through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
round about, that his name should not be once mentioned: which
perhaps for a time was observed, but in future ages they could not prevent
it, but that he was both spoken of and written of. Notwithstanding, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Inhabitants of this City became so exceeding wealthy, that they
soon after rebuilt this Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and made it much fairer than it was
before; all the Citizens contributing with willing hands to the charge of the
building: insomuch that the Women brought all their Silver, Gold, and
other pretious Ornaments, and communicated them towards this great Work.</p>
               <p>Also in after times those fair Pillars before spoken of, were again erected;
towards the rebuilding whereof they received so many and wonderful
Gifts, from all the neighbouring Kings, Cities, and Countries, that this
Temple might (as it was thought) compare with all the World beside for
Riches and Treasure. It was standing in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, who came thither
about twelve years after the Resurrection of our Saviour, and continued
there three years; in which time he so faithfully, and diligently preached
the Gospel, that he converted most of the Citizens from their Idolatry and
Worship of <hi>Diana,</hi> to the reverend Knowledge and Confession of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour. For which cause, <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver Smith (who made a great
gain by Idolatry) stirred up a great tumult; so that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> running up
and down the City for two hours space, cried out with a loud voice, <hi>Great
is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. Here also <hi>Paul</hi> fought with Beasts,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And to this City <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle, and sent it from <hi>Rome,</hi>
996 miles. He made <hi>Timothy</hi> also a Bishop of this City, to whom he wrot
two Epistles; the first was sent him from <hi>Laodicea</hi> to <hi>Phrygia,</hi> being 280 miles:
the second from <hi>Rome,</hi> as I said. By these Epistles <hi>Timothy</hi> was greatly
comforted, and taught them to his Disciples and Auditors, that so they might
constantly continue and persevere in the Christian Faith and Religion to
the end. To conclude, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist came also to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and
wrote his Gospel against the Heretick <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who denyed Christ to be
the true God; for which cause God grievously punished him, so that he
died as he was bathing himself in a Bath, <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 5. ca. 3. Euseb.
li. 3. c.</hi> 22. This was the first Church to which <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his Revelation;
and there, when he returned out of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> he raised his Host <hi>Drusana</hi> from
death to life. So when he had governed the Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> thirty years,
after the death of <hi>Paul</hi> he died, when he was ninety one years old, and was
honourably buried at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not far from the City. There was also another
<hi>Iohn</hi> that liv'd in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to whom (as many think) the Epistles of <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Evangelist were dedicated, as <hi>Ierom</hi> sheweth in his Catalogue of

This was a very fair City, beautified with many goodly buildings,

honoured, as <hi>Herod.</hi> saith. But after his death, his Works beginning to grow
famous, the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> contended who should Patronize him. The
<hi>Colophonians</hi> claim a part in him, because he was in that Town, and there
made some of his <hi>Odysses.</hi> They of <hi>Chios</hi> say he belonged to them, because
he lived there a long time, and taught School. But for ought that can be
found by Authors, the <hi>Smyrnians</hi> have most interest in him. Nevertheless

by the Inhabitants thereof condemned to death for the profession of Christ,

of the Inhabitants, was grievously punished; for within ten years it was cast
down by an Earth-quake, since which time, it was hardly rebuilt again. The
River <hi>Pactolus,</hi> which beginneth in <hi>Lydia,</hi> runneth by this Town of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But

was a famous City, and Metropolitan of <hi>Mysia,</hi> scituated in <hi>Asia minor,</hi>
228 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> North-westward. It stood upon a high Rock close
by the River <hi>Caicus,</hi> from whence it was called <hi>Pergamus.</hi> For in ancient
times all famous and notable places were called amongst the <hi>Graecians Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama,</hi>
as <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi> observe. <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 13. saith, that in the time of
<hi>Lysimachus</hi> the Son of <hi>Agathocles</hi> (who was one of the Successours of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great) it was but a Castle; in which place, because of the strength of it,
he usually kept all his Treasure, and those things that were of account, and
committed the custody of it unto one named <hi>Philetaerus,</hi> an Eunuch of <hi>Tyanus.</hi>
But this man being accused to <hi>Lysimacus,</hi> that he would have forced his Wife
<hi>Arsinoes,</hi> for fear of some future punishment because of that Offence, moved
the Inhabitants of that Hold to Rebellion. At the same time also there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
many Commotions in <hi>Asia,</hi> whereby <hi>Lysimachus</hi> was constrained to leave
this, and make opposition against <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> who had invaded his
Dominions; But in this War <hi>Lysimachus</hi> was slain. And <hi>Philetaerus,</hi> having
in his possession great Riches, that he might enjoy what he had, was always
observant to him that got the Victory, by which means he kept himself and
his Riches for the space of 20 years in that Castle; and then died, and left
all his Wealth to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> his brothers Son, who inlarged his Government,
and overcame <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Son of <hi>Seleucus.</hi> This Man, after he had reigned
32 years, died, and <hi>Attalus</hi> his Son succeeded him in the Government: who
having conquered <hi>Galatia,</hi> made a league with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by them was
first called by the name of a King. After him succeeded his Son <hi>Eumenes,</hi>
the second of that name, who aided the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Antiochus magnus,</hi>
King of <hi>Syria;</hi> for which service the <hi>Romans</hi> gave him all the Dominions that
<hi>Antiochus</hi> had on this side the <hi>Alps.</hi> This man was the first that enlarged
the Castle of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and made it a goodly City, planting round about
it a thick Wood or Grove, and called it <hi>Nicephorus.</hi> And after he had
reigned 49 years, he died, and left his Kingdom to his Son <hi>Attalus,</hi> called

                  <hi>Philometor.</hi> This <hi>Attalus,</hi> after he had done many notable exploits, died
without issue, when he had reigned five years, and left his Kingdom to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who turned it into a Province.</p>
               <p>There lived in this Town many learned Men, as <hi>Galen</hi> the Physician,
who was famous in the time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, and (as the Fame went)
lived 140 years. Of that Town also was <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the Rhetorician, who
was School-Master to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> of which man the <hi>Apollodorean</hi> Sect
took Name, and <hi>Dionysius Atticus</hi> his Scholar. Here <hi>Antipas</hi> was crowned
with the Wreath of Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>To the Bishop of this Town <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his Revelation, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter thereof sharply reprehendeth him, because he bore with the
Sect of the <hi>Nicholaitans;</hi> which, although it lasted not long, yet it was very
dangerous. <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, That <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> one of the seven Deacons for
the Poor at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> of whom you may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. was the first Author
of this Sect: yet <hi>Clem. Alexand.</hi> clears him of it, laying that Offence rather
on certain idle Persons, that misconstruing his Words, being given over
to vile Affections, covered their Evils under his Name, calling themselves
<hi>Nicholaites,</hi> though indeed he had no hand in it, but lived and died honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The Opinion that this Sect held (as <hi>Euseb.</hi> saith, <hi>li. 3. ca.</hi> 23. and <hi>Irenaeus,
lib. 1. chap.</hi> 27.) was, That Women were to be common; That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to eat Meat offered to Idols; That Fornication and Adultery was no Sin:
beside many other wicked and perverse Opinions concerning the Deity, which
would be too tedious to recite in this place. You may read more of it in

likewise oftentimes troubled with Earthquakes, as <hi>Sardis, Magnesia,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi>
are. The reason of these often Earthquakes is thought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are Vaults and hallow Caves under the Earth, into which the
Air (in the time of heat) having free entrance, then closeth up again, so
that it can find no passage out; it striveth with continual motion to make
way through the Earth, by which means the Earth trembleth and shaketh:
and look how much the deeper these Vaults are under the Earth, so much
the more violent are the Earth-quakes; by which means, Cities are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
utterly overthrown and ruined, sometimes the Earth sinketh, and Ponds
and Rivers are swallowed up.</p>
               <p>It was at first called <hi>Diospolis,</hi> that is, the City of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> then <hi>Rhoas;</hi>
and lastly, it obtained the name of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And although at the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was but a small Town, yet by reason of the fertility of the Soile, and
pleasant scituation, it of a sudden became a fair City, beautified with many
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:105162:206"/>
fair and goodly Houses, wherein there dwelt many wealthy Citizens, so
that for their Nobility and Worthiness it was accounted the most famous
Town in all <hi>Asia.</hi> Here <hi>Hiero</hi> dwelt who divided his Inheritance among
the Citizens, and over and above he gave them two thousand Talents of
Gold, besides many other Gifts and Gratuities, to adorn and beautifie the
City. After him there lived <hi>Zeno</hi> the Orator, and <hi>Polemon</hi> his Son; who for
his noble Acts was first by <hi>Antonio,</hi> and then by <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> honoured
with the Dignity of a King, as <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth, lib. 12.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Laodicea, Colossis,</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> where the Apostle <hi>Philip</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
were sunk by an Earth-quake, about the tenth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> and a
little before the Martyrdom of <hi>Paul.</hi> There were three Cities called after
this Name; that is, this which stood in <hi>Caria</hi> (to which <hi>Paul</hi> never came; as
appeareth in the second Chapter to the <hi>Colossians;</hi>) a second stood in <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> and a third in <hi>Syria,</hi> near to
<hi>Antiochia, Seleucia,</hi> and <hi>Apamea.</hi>

                  <hi>PAVL</hi> was born at <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cicilia,</hi> about the tenth year of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Saviour; and was near about the age of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
as the circumstances of Histories do declare. After he grew to some
Bigness, he was sent by his Parents from thence to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being 304
miles; where he had not been long brought up with <hi>Gamaliel</hi> (which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
The Recompence of God) <hi>Act.</hi> 22. but he became the Disciple of
<hi>Simon</hi> the Just, <hi>Luke 2. Act.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Paul</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin, Phil. 2. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. and being yet
but a young Man, he was one of those that kept the Garments of the holy
Martyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was stoned about the end of the four and thirtieth
Year after the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. at which time also St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Evangelist was but four and twenty years of Age. If therefore you would
observe the Age of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in this following discourse of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
deduct ten from the Years after the Nativity of our Saviour Christ,
and the Remainder is his Age. At his Circumcision he was called <hi>Saul,</hi>
that is, <hi>a mortal Man:</hi> but when he was made the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he
was called <hi>Paul;</hi> of which Name there was a noble Family in <hi>Rome,</hi> so
called because of the lowness of their Stature, and smallness of their Body;
as <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> observeth.</p>

                  </gap> Year after the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Paul</hi> was an Inquisitor for
private Heresie, and a cruel Persecutor of the Gospel. The next Year he
went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Damascus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> which was 160 miles; in which
Journey (about the 25 day of <hi>Ianuary</hi>) he was converted; and upon the
28 day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> was baptised by <hi>Ananias.</hi> So he stayed some few days in
<hi>Damascus,</hi> and taught the Gospel of Christ, <hi>Act. 9. &amp;</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>In the same Year that he was converted, the <hi>Iews,</hi> and those that were
Enemies to the Gospel, went about by deceit to take his Life; wherefore
he went from <hi>Damascus</hi> to <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> which was 160 miles; here he
continued teaching the Gospel by the space of three Years, that is, from the
beginning of the 35 to the end of the 37 year after the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the 38 Year after the Nativity of Christ he returned from <hi>Arabia Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traea</hi>
and came to <hi>Damascus;</hi> which was 160 miles; and there he diligently
taught the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               <p>But when in the same Year <hi>Araeta</hi> King of <hi>Arabia</hi> went about to put him
secretly to death, he was let down in a Basket over the Wall, and so went
from <hi>Damascus</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was 160 miles: and when he came
thither he brought <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the Apostles, and shewed them his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and remained with <hi>Peter</hi> fifteen days preaching the Gospel. At this
time he saw <hi>Iames</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpheus</hi> and Brother of our Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.
2 <hi>Cor. 11. Galat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But when his Adversaries that were at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> went about secretly to
put him to death, he went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and was brought by the Brethren
to <hi>Caesarea Strato,</hi> which was 32 miles, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>About the 38 Year after the Nativity of Christ he went thence into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which was 272 miles; here he continued
some Years teaching the Gospel of Christ, <hi>Gal. 1. 2. Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>In the 41 Year after the Nativity of Christ, and about the seventh Year
of his Ministry, he was brought by <hi>Barnabas</hi> from <hi>Tarsus</hi> to <hi>Antiochia</hi> in
<hi>Syria,</hi> which was 120 miles. At this time, and in this Town, all those that
believed in Christ began to be called Christians, whereas before they were
called Disciples and Brothers, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. These things hapned in the eighth
year after the Resurrection of Christ; about this time also <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote
his Gospel, and <hi>Agabus</hi> prophesied of the universal Dearth that should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
under <hi>Claudius, Act.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>In the 42 year after the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Paul</hi> being then at <hi>Antiochia.</hi>
and about 32 years of age, was wrap'd up into the third Heaven, 14 years
before he wrote his second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians, 2 Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>In the 43 year after the Nativity of Christ, the Famin whereof <hi>Agabus</hi>
prophesied, being now begun, he went with the gifts of the Church from

               <p>THIS was the Metropolis of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> scituated upon the River of <hi>Cydnus,</hi>
which beginning at Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> runs thence through this Town
into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. It was first built by <hi>Perseus</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
(whom the Poets feign to be the Son of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Danae</hi>) and called
<hi>Tharsus,</hi> of the Hyacinth stone which as it seemeth, is found thereabous. It
was distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 304 miles towards the North; in ancient time
a goodly City; but through the Injury of the Time, and Invasion of the
Enemy, much impaired, and lay almost ruined, till (as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, <hi>li.</hi> 14.)
it was repaired by <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that effeminate King of the <hi>Assyrians;</hi> of

From his time, until the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> the last King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> it
continued in great Prosperity, and was become a marvellous stately City,
the Inhabitants thereof being grown very wealthy: but then <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great making War upon that Prince, amongst others, brought his Army
against this City: but the Citizens hearing of his notable Exploits, durst
not abide his coming: therefore they fired the City, lest he should make
a Prey of their Riches, and fled: which when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived, he
gave order to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> with all possible speed to quench the Fire, and save
the City. In the mean time the King (being press'd with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Thirst, by reason of the extream Heat that was in that Country,
the Dust, and his long Journey) put off his royal Garments, and cast
himself into the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> which being a cold Water coming out of the
North, struck the heat presently inward, and so benummed his Sinews,
that had it not been for the present help of his Souldiers, and the extraordinary
diligence and care of <hi>Philip</hi> his Physician, he had died immediately; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
by the great Providence of God, and the carefulness of his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:105162:209"/>
he recovered his dangerous Sickness beyond the expectation of Man;
and after overcame <hi>Darius</hi> in a sharp and cruel War, near to a place called
<hi>Issa,</hi> as you may read before, See <hi>Plutarch in vita Alexand.</hi> and <hi>Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
From that time forward this City grew to be very famous, and daily
encreased in Stateliness and fair Buildings. And to add more dignity to it,
there was a famous Academy, in which were many learned and rare Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
insomuch, that they of <hi>Tharsus</hi> exceeded the Philosophers of
<hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> for Learning and Knowledge, though indeed for
number of Scholars and common Resort they exceeded <hi>Tharsus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was born and brought up in this Town, and here learned the
Knowledge of the Tongues, Philosophy, and other good Arts. He also
perused the Writings of <hi>Aratus, Epimenides, Menander,</hi> and other learned
Men, whose Sayings are here and there dispersed through his Epistles.
From thence he was sent to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where he lived and was brought up
at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> who was Provost of that Academy; and after, was
converted to be an Apostle of Christ Jesus, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 22. This Town
at this day is subject to the Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and called by the Name
of <hi>Terassa;</hi> being neither so famous nor so fair a City, as in the time when
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire flourished; for then, because of the extraordinary Vertue
of the Citizens, it was indowed with the Liberty and Freedom of
<hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>THis was a metropolitan Town in <hi>Syria,</hi> distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 160 miles
towards the North-east; being an ancient and fair City, and, before

in a fair and fruitful place, close by the Mountain <hi>Libanus,</hi> which
bringeth forth Frankincense, Ceders, Cypress, and many odoriferous and
sweet smelling Flowers. There were many Kings that kept their Court
in it, as <hi>Hadad, Benhadad</hi> the First, <hi>Benhadad</hi> the Second, <hi>Hasael,</hi> and
others, who grievously opposed the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> in many sharp and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Wars, as you may read before. The Land round about it aboundeth
with white and red Roses, Pomgranates, Almonds, Figs, and other sweet
and pleasant Fruits. In that place the Alablaster stone is found, very fair
and clear. The Air, pleasant and healthful. The River called <hi>Chrysorrus</hi>
runneth close by it, in which there is found golden Veins which yielded
perfect Gold. The Houses without are not very curious, but within all of
polished Marble and Alablaster, guilt with resplendent Gold so artificially,
that it dazleth the Beholders Eyes.</p>
               <p>There was a certain <hi>Florentine</hi> who revolted from the Christian Faith, and
obtained to be chief Governour of this Town; in which he erected a strong

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:105162:209"/>
express the Beauty and Glory of this City: there is great Traffique,

and other kinds of Pagan People, who are preferred before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

saith: all which was done for the love he bore to <hi>Homers Iliads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore look what <hi>Alexander</hi> had promised, <hi>Lysimacus</hi> (one of his
chief Princes, and King of <hi>Thrace</hi>) after his death performed; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Troy,</hi> enlarged the City, beautified it with goodly Buildings, set
up a stately Temple, and then compass'd it about with strong Walls. After
this sort it continued a long time, untill <hi>Fimbria</hi> a Questor of the <hi>Romans</hi>
(when he had slain <hi>Vallerius Flaccus</hi> the Consul, with whom he was
sent, against <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi>) besieged it and within ten
days space won it; making his Vaunts, that he conquered that City in ten
days, which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> could scarce do in ten years; to which one of the
Inhabitants of the City answered, that then <hi>Troy</hi> had a <hi>Hector,</hi> but now it had
none. But for this he cruelly wasted the City. This destruction happened
in the 84 year before Christ: thus it lay desolate till <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s time,
who caused it again to be re-edified and beautified with many fair and goodly
Buildings, because the <hi>Romans,</hi> and especially those noble Families of the
<hi>Iulii</hi> and <hi>Caesars</hi> do derive their Progeny from the <hi>Trojans:</hi> for which
cause, <hi>Augustus</hi> used such diligence in the rebuilding of this City, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
such infinite cost, that he much exceeded <hi>Alexander,</hi> and made it
a fair and goodly City. At this day it is called <hi>Ilium.</hi> But in the place of
old <hi>Troy</hi> there is little to be seen, only a small Town, as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith. It is
distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 760 miles, North-westward.</p>

               <p>In this City the most Christian Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great celebrated
a Councel, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 325. at which time there were present 320 Bishops,
who condemned the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, and instituted the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. But
after that, viz. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 326. the <hi>Arrians</hi> endeavouring to hold a second
Councel in this City, to confirm their Opinions, and to dissolve that which
went before, the Lord hindred them with an Earth-quake, by which almost
half the City was thrown down. Not long after, there happened another
Earth-quake which utterly destroyed it: Notwithstanding it was rebuilt
again, and in it a second Councel held, wherein the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

               <p>THIS City <hi>Troas,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> raised <hi>Eutichus</hi> (which signifies Happy or

<hi>Asia</hi> the less, 720 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> North-westward. <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of
<hi>Asia</hi> called it <hi>Troas,</hi> because it was in the Country where <hi>Troy</hi> was. But
after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> he called it after his own name <hi>Antigonia:</hi> and
the better to honour it, kept his Court there. But <hi>Lysimachus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace</hi>
having got this City into his Jurisdiction, bestowed great cost upon it, and
set up many fair and goodly Buildings, then called it after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s name,
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and so it began to be called <hi>Alexandria Troas, Plin.</hi> lib. 5. <hi>Strabo</hi>
lib. 13. <hi>Ier. de locis Hebraicis:</hi> Now it was called <hi>Alexandria Troas,</hi> to put
a difference between it and divers other Cities of that name, for there was
an <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> another in <hi>India,</hi> and many others elsewhere; but
only this in the Country where <hi>Troy</hi> stood. It was scituated in a high and
spacious Mountain, about a mile and a half from the Shore of <hi>Propontus</hi>
towards the East, between which and <hi>Troas</hi> is twenty eight miles.</p>
               <p>It is a thing worthy Observation, to consider by what divers names the Sea
that lies between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> the less is called, for between <hi>Constantinople</hi> and
<hi>Calcidonia,</hi> close by the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea it is called <hi>Thrascius Bosphorus,</hi> in which
place it is not above half a mile broad: here <hi>Xerxes,</hi> when he invaded <hi>Graecia,</hi>
built up a Bridge for his Army to pass over. There is also another streight and
narrow place in this Sea, which is called by the name of <hi>Cimmeriu Bosphorius</hi>
These two <hi>Bosphori</hi> are so called (as some Authors hold) because a Bull
when he loweth may be heard from the one side to the other: but <hi>Pliny</hi>
seemeth to derive the name from <hi>Io,</hi> that fair Maid which <hi>Iupiter</hi> turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Land of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and of him called <hi>Cecropia.</hi> This <hi>Cecrops</hi> was the
first King thereof, and there succeeded him at least 40, both famous and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Princes. But after it was called <hi>Mopsonia,</hi> of <hi>Mopsus</hi> King of <hi>Thessaly:</hi>
and after <hi>Ionia,</hi> which name it held for a while: and lastly <hi>Athens,</hi> dedicated
to <hi>Pallas</hi> (which goddess the <hi>Grecians</hi> say was born of the brain of <hi>Iupiter</hi>)
which name it held a long time after. There lived in this City <hi>Solon, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,</hi> and many other excellent Philosophers.</p>
               <p>It was scituated upon a fair and strong Rock, beautified with many goodly
Temples and Buildings; but principally that of <hi>Minerva</hi> was most sumptuous,
in which there hung a great number of Lamps, which gave a continual
Light. There was also the Monastery of the holy Virgins, and the Image
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:105162:217"/>
of <hi>Pallas</hi> made all of white Ivory very curious and costly. There were many
Schools, Colledges, and pleasant Gardens in which Philosophers used to
walk, and it abounded with sweet and delectable Musick, and with great
resort of Merchants and Scholars. To conclude, in those times it was the
most notable City in the World.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there were many profitable Havens for the receit of Ships, but
that which was called <hi>Piraeum</hi> exceeded, being capable to receive<note n="†" place="margin">As some say 400.</note>
forty Ships; beautified with many goodly buildings, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
two miles, fortified with seven Walls, and joyning to the
City (whereof <hi>Terence</hi> writeth, <hi>Eunuch. Act. 3. Scen.</hi> 4.) At this day it is
called <hi>Porto Lini,</hi> fortified with two walls four miles in length, extending to
the Hill <hi>Munichya,</hi> the sirname of <hi>Diana</hi> (being compassed in the figure of
a Chersoness, and so joyned to the City of <hi>Athens.</hi> In which distance
there are two other Havens besides that of <hi>Piraeum.</hi> In this <hi>Iupiter</hi>
had a magnificent Temple, and in it were found many artificial Tables, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and graven Images, all which are at this day destroyed and carried
away.</p>
               <p>It hath been three times destroyed; first by <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Mardonius,</hi> which
happened in the year before Christ 479. Then by <hi>Lysander,</hi> who broke
down a hundred paces of the Wall, and almost utterly destroyed their Ships,
and broke down the Haven of <hi>Peraea.</hi> It was also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as they also brake down their Haven and burnt their Ships, but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Town, and held it in great estimation. But was the third time
overthrown and utterly destroyed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who both changed the place
and name of the City, after it had flourished 3113 years. At this day it is
divided into three parts, and called by the name of <hi>Sethina,</hi> because of the
variety of the Inhabitants that live in it, being very well peopled, and a fair
and spatious City, but much altered from that it was in times past. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

yet at this day it is so much altered, that their Language is base, and
their Glory is eclipsed. The uppermost part of the City, where former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Temple stood, dedicated to the unknown God, is now wholly and
absolutely in the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in which they have built a strong and
almost invincible Castle, which hath the command of the rest of the Town.
The second and middle part of the Town is all inhabited by Christians.
In the third there standeth a fair and goodly Palace, supported with
Marble Pillars, and adorned with goodly Works. In this part of the
City there inhabiteth People of divers Sects and Conditions. And
here also is the Seat of a Metropolitan, who hath under him many
Bishops. So that God doth support and maintain his Church even

                  <hi>Paul</hi> was the first man that preached the Gospel of Christ in this City,
and converted many Citizens, but especially <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> who
dwelt upon a Promontory without the City, and as it seems, was one of
the principal Judges and Governours of the Town; for after he had taught
publickly in the Town, and had disputed against the <hi>Iews</hi> and Philosophers
concerning Christ, they supposing him to be a busie Fellow, and one worthy
of death, as a Disturber of the common Peace, brought him before this
<hi>Dionysius,</hi> that so by his Judgment he might receive condign punishment
for his Offence. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> so well behaved himself, and preached with
such admirable Eloquence and Learning, that he not only confuted his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but among others converted this <hi>Dionysius Areopagitus,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the first Bishop of <hi>Athens</hi> (as <hi>Euseb.</hi> saith, lib. 4. cap. 13.) and went
captive with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> and from thence to <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

                  <hi>COrinthus,</hi> a famous City in <hi>Grecia</hi> is scituated in <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> a pleasant
Country of <hi>Achaia,</hi> joyning to the Continent of <hi>Grecia</hi> like an Isthmus

called <hi>Corantha,</hi> built (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, by <hi>Sisiphus</hi> Son of <hi>Aeolus</hi> at
such time as <hi>Ioshuah</hi> governed <hi>Israel;</hi> who was a mighty Pirate. At first it
was but a Castle, and called after his name, <hi>Sisiphyus:</hi> but after, because of
the strength of the place, and pleasant scituation, it became a fair Town
and called by the name of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith; then <hi>Ephym,</hi> of <hi>Ephyra,</hi>
who was a fair and goodly Nymph, and Queen of that place. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
even in those times it was held in great estimation, yet it became
much wasted and decayed through the continuance of time, until it was
repaired by King <hi>Corinthus,</hi> who as some think was the Son of <hi>Marathon; Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
saith, the Son of <hi>Pelops;</hi> others would have him the Son of
<hi>Orestis;</hi> and after his name was called <hi>Corinth,</hi> that is, the Flower of
Maides.</p>
               <p>It was a fair and goodly City, very commodiously built, for it stood
between the two Seas of <hi>Ionium</hi> and <hi>Aegeum,</hi> so that there resorted thither great
multitude of Merchants from all places. Close by the City there stood
a steep Mountain, which was as it were a Bulwark for the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being 560 Feet high, and called <hi>Acrocorinthus,</hi> that is, <hi>The Glory and
Strength of the</hi> Corinthians. It was also compassed about with strong Walls,
and beautified with many goodly Buildings and Temples, but above the
rest, the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> was had in great reputation, which (as
<hi>Strabo</hi> saith) stood upon the top of the Mountain <hi>Acrocorinthus,</hi> wherein
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:105162:218"/>
there were above a thousand Maids prostituted every year. This Temple
was had in such great honour, and was so gloriously built, that above all
the places of the World there was resort unto it. Close by it stood the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Castle called <hi>Sysyphius,</hi> built all of white Marble; and a little below
that, the Fountain of <hi>Pyrene,</hi> dedicated to the Muses.</p>
               <p>There were many mighty Princes that ruled in this City, as <hi>Alethes,</hi> who
was King thereof at such time as <hi>Samuel</hi> judged <hi>Israel,</hi> which was 1103
years before Christ; he bestowed great cost upon it, set up many fair and
goodly Buildings, and ruled over it thirty and five years, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith.
After him there succeeded many Kings, by whose Worthiness and Prowess
it was so much enlarged, and made so famous, that it was little inferiour to
the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> for, at such time as Ambassadours were sent thence
to intreat of some Business concerning the State, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did
not let to give them many reproachful Terms, as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, lib. 8.
because of which Insolency, the <hi>Romans</hi> sent <hi>Lucius Mummus</hi> the Consul into
<hi>Grecia,</hi> who besieged <hi>Corinth,</hi> and within a short time took it, and burn'd
it down to the Ground, in the year before Christ, 145. of which you may
read more in <hi>Florus,</hi> and in the second Decad of <hi>Livy.</hi> It was a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
rich Town, and abounded with Gold, Silver, and costly Brass, also
with Plate, and curious Pictures: so that although <hi>Mummus</hi> conquered
<hi>Corinth,</hi> yet <hi>Corinth</hi> conquered <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Citizens thereof were so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with the Riches and Glory of this Town, that they forgot their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Severity, and with violence followed their Vices, as <hi>Salust</hi> saith, lib. 1.
So that as before <hi>Corinth</hi> abounded with Luxury and divers other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Evils, as Whordom, Adultery, Fornication, Covetousness, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Rapine, and Murther: so <hi>Rome</hi> in future Ages became as bad or
worse than it.</p>
               <p>Thus it continued waste from that time till <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was Emperour of
<hi>Rome;</hi> who having travelled into those parts of the World, and seen the
Ruines of this City, and the profitable Scituation for Traffick, caused it to
be re-builded: after which time, it began to grow great and spacious, little
inferiour to the former in glory, and no less corrupted with Vices, having
forgot the former misery which it sustained by the hands of the <hi>Romans;</hi>
and so continued from the year before Christ 44, until the year after Christ
41, at which time <hi>Paul</hi> came thither and preached the Gospel, by whose
divine Doctrine, and godly Life and Conversation, they were converted
from their evil Courses, and lived more holily and honestly, as appeareth
by the two Epistles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> wrote from <hi>Philippos</hi> to the Inhabitants of this
Town.</p>
               <p>But after, they falling from their Faith, and forsaking their ancient
Integrity, the Lord punished them with a second Desolation; for, at such
time as <hi>Amurath,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> grew to Eminency, and had
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:105162:219"/>
conquered <hi>Thessalonica, Beotia,</hi> and <hi>Attica,</hi> he came into this <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and
made all <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> tributary to him. Then after him <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second
(although the Inhabitants of <hi>Corinth</hi> had fortified their City with three Walls,
and made it so strong, that it was thought to be almost invincible) besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it and won it, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1458. about six years after <hi>Constantinople</hi> was

               <p>It is in compass 56 miles, being so pleasantly scituated that it was a Sea-Mark

               <p>THE City and Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (which is so called from the sweet Smell or
Roses) is scituated in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, a little from <hi>Asia</hi> the less,
upon the South; being distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 140 miles toward the North-west,
as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 14. It is in compass 112 miles. It was at first called
<hi>Ophy,</hi> then <hi>Statilia,</hi> and after <hi>Telchin,</hi> of the Inhabitants thereof, who were
called <hi>Telchines,</hi> a People which, as some say, were Witches; others say,
curious Artificers, and were the first that found out the making of Brass and
Iron. At last it took the name of <hi>Rhodes</hi> from the principal City that stood
in it; for there were three Cities in it, <hi>viz. Lyndus, Camirus,</hi> and <hi>Ialyssus.</hi> In
<hi>Lyndus, Cleobulus,</hi> one of the seven Wise-men of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Chares</hi> that
famous Statuary, who made the Colossus which stood in this Isle, were born.
<hi>Ialyssus,</hi> of a Rose that was found in it, was called <hi>Rhodes,</hi> being scituated
upon an exceeding high Promontory, lying toward the East part of that
Isle. This exceeded the other two Cities, both for Ports, Ways, Walls,
and other Ornaments, and the Inhabitants were governed with such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Laws, and so skilful in Navigation, that it might compare with the
strongest City of the World, and for a long time had the Command of the
Sea round about, and utterly abolished all Pirates and Robbers from those parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Sicul. lib.</hi> 6 saith, that it was called <hi>Rhodes</hi> of <hi>Rhodia,</hi> a fair and
beautiful Maid, who was dearly beloved of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and therefore this Island
was dedicated to the Sun; for as <hi>Solinus</hi> saith, Though the Heavens be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so cloudy yet the Sun shineth in <hi>Rhodes. Pindarus</hi> the Poet, (because
of the fertility of the Soil, and the exceeding Opulency of the Inhabitants)
saith, that it rained Gold in that Country. In former times it flourished
with Learning and good Arts, insomuch that the <hi>Romans</hi> for the most part
sent their Children to be brought up at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> This Isle is very fruitful,
and bringeth forth many things necessary for the maintenance of Life; but
above all, a certain Red Wine which the <hi>Romans</hi> did greatly delight in,
and valued at a high Price. In this City lived that notable Painter called
<hi>Protogines,</hi> which <hi>Apelles</hi> conquered in that Science, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, li. 35. ca. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> King of <hi>Asia,</hi> erected a notable Colossus or Statue of the Sun in
this Isle, which that notable Carver <hi>Chares</hi> made, being outwardly all of pure
Brass, but within nothing but Stones; it was seventy Cubits high, and so
artificially made, that it was accounted for one of the Wonders of the

Wine is made in <hi>Creta,</hi> and called by the same name, from whence it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
brought unto us, though in times past it came out of the Island of <hi>Chius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among all the Hills that are found in the Island of <hi>Creta,</hi> the Hill <hi>Ida</hi>
is most spoken of, because of the height: about it standeth divers Towns and
Villages: it hath many Hills and Woods: for the Island is very full of sweet
Cypress Trees, insomuch that there are Woods full of them. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that
upon a time, there was such an Earth-quake in this Island, that one of the Hills
removed, out of which there came a Man, being forty Cubits high. In this
Island there are no venemous Beasts, but in times past it was inhabited by
cruel People, of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth in his first Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> cap. 1.
where he reherseth the Saying of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> which was after this manner,
<hi>The People of</hi> Creta <hi>are always Liars, evil Beasts, and slow Bellies.</hi> And to
conclude, they resemble some of the Friars among the Papists; for as they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:105162:223"/>
are idle people and shave their heads, so were the Men of <hi>Creta. Titus (Pauls</hi>
Disciple) was a Bishop in this Island, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote an Epistle to them
and to <hi>Nicapolis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and sent it them above 320 miles. This Island in times
past was very rich and populous, for in it there was a 100 Towns; the chief
of which were <hi>Gnossos, Cortyna,</hi> and <hi>Zydon,</hi> but <hi>Gnossos</hi> was the most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and ancientest, wherein King <hi>Minos</hi> kept his Court: in it the notable
Geographer <hi>Strabo</hi> was born.</p>
               <p>This Town of <hi>Gnossos</hi> in times past was called <hi>Ceratur,</hi> of the River <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
which passed by it; but now it and all the Island is called <hi>Candia.</hi> The
<hi>Venetians</hi> every three years appointed a new Duke to govern it. In this
Island stood the Towns of <hi>Salmona</hi> and <hi>Lassica</hi> (by <hi>Pliny</hi> called <hi>Lasas</hi>) and
in the middle between those two Towns was the Haven of <hi>Gutfurt,</hi> whereof
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> maketh mention in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles, cap</hi> 27. saying, That
<hi>Paul</hi> counselled the Saylers that were in the Ship to anchor there, and stay
the Winter season in that Island: but the Captain of the Ship gave more
credit to the Master of the Ship, than to <hi>Pauls</hi> words, whereby in the end
they were in danger of their lives. The Towns of <hi>Salmona</hi> and <hi>Lassica</hi>
with the Haven of <hi>Gutfurt,</hi> lay Southward in this Island, upon the Coasts
of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea: somewhat distant from them stood the Town
of <hi>Asson,</hi> by <hi>Pliny</hi> called <hi>Ausum,</hi> where they hoised out their boat and sayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Northward; and because they had a fair South-wind, they thought to
sail to <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a Haven in <hi>Creta,</hi> but the wind coming about to the
East, drave them back again into the Sea, by which means they were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their Lives.</p>
               <p>This Island was brought under the subjection of the <hi>Romans,</hi> 66 years
before the birth of Christ, and so for a long time continued, until the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi>
entered therein, and took it from the <hi>Romans,</hi> 800 years after the
Birth of Christ. After that, in the year of our Lord 979, the Emperour of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> drave the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of the Island, and kept it; but in the end
the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought it under their Subjection and Seigniory, in the year
of our Lord 1202, and at this day it is called <hi>Candia.</hi>

               <p>THIS Island was so called from the great abundance of Honey that was
found in it; but at this day it is called <hi>Malta,</hi> scituated in the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Sea, 1340 miles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the West. It is very pleasant
and fruitful, bringing forth great plenty of Wheat, Rye, Flax, Cumin,
Cotton, Figs, Wine, Roses, Violets, Time, Lavender, and many other
sweet and delightful Herbs, from whence Bees did gather great plenty of
Honey. The Sun is very hot in this Island, insomuch, that by the extreme
servor thereof, the Inhabitants lose their natural complexion and look of
a tawny colour. In Summer Evenings there falleth great plenty of dews,
whereby the Earth is refreshed and the Herbs increased. There is neither
Snow or Frost seen in it; for the Northern Winds (which with us are the
Authors of Cold and Frosts) with them procure Rain, which greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth
and increaseth the Fruits of the Earth; so that the Pastures and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
become very pleasant and full of Grass: and although it be but 28
miles long, and 60 miles about, notwithstanding it is very populous; for in
the eight Parishes that stand in this Isle, there is numbred above twenty
thousand Men. The Inhabitants are very honest, religious, and godly;
and the Women fair, chast, and modest, for they never come abroad
but with their faces covered. The Children that are born in this Country
fear not any Snakes; neither are hurt by any thing that is venomous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that they will take Scorpions and eat them without danger, although
in all other parts of the World those kind of creatures are most pernicious. In
this Isle also there are bred a kind of Dogs that are but small, yet very white
and shagged, and so loving, that the Inhabitants of all the neighbouring
Countries will buy them, though they be at dear rates.</p>
               <p>The chief City thereof (called <hi>Malta)</hi> is so strongly fortified both by
Art and Nature, that it is almost impossible to be conquered, unless it be
either by Treason or Famine. The Town or Castle whereof is fortified with
the Knights of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Order, who have mightily expressed their Valour
and Resolution in defending this Town from the <hi>Turks.</hi> About a mile from
this, the ruines of a goodly fair City are to be seen. And upon the East
Promontory, a little from the City of <hi>Malta,</hi> there yet remain the decays
(which are worthy to look upon) of a goodly Temple, dedicated to <hi>Iun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:105162:224"/>
It seemeth by what remaineth, that this Church hath been a fair and goodly
thing in times past.</p>
               <p>There is also here and there in the Earth found certain brass Monies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon the one side a superscription written in <hi>Greek</hi> Letters, and upon
the other the Image of <hi>Iuno.</hi> There stood upon the South side of <hi>Malta</hi>
a Temple dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the ruines of which are yet extant; and
in it are found Mountains worthy of admiration. At such time as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Massanissa</hi> King of the <hi>Numidians</hi> had conquered this Island, amongst
other pretious things that he found in these Temples, he took thence a
great deal of goodly Ivory: but that religious King did faithfully restore
all those things back again, and dedicated them to the several Temples.
Thus we may perceive, that the Inhabitants of this Island of <hi>Malta</hi> were
wholly given to Idolatry and Superstition, untill such time as <hi>Paul,</hi> by the
Inconstancy and Vehemency of the Wind, was driven upon it, and converted
them from that perverse and prophane Worship to the Christian Religion,
at such time as he suffered Shipwrack, and wintered amongst them, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.
The Inhabitants shew upon the North part of this Isle, the place where
the Ship was cast away wherein the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was; in which place they
have built up a Chappel, and dedicated it to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> They shew also
a Cave, in which they say he lived; and they verily believed that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
all Venome and Poyson out of that Island at such time as he was there.</p>
               <p>It was first subject unto the <hi>Africans,</hi> as may appear by certain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pillars which are here and there found, in which there are ingraven cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Characters of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> not much unlike to Hebrew Letters.
And although the Inhabitants are Christians, yet their Speech is much
like the <hi>Saracens,</hi> which differeth little or nothing from the antient
<hi>Punick.</hi> At such time as <hi>Dido</hi> built <hi>Carthage</hi> (which is thought to be 890
years before Christ) <hi>Battus</hi> was King of this Isle, and held a Confederacy
with <hi>Dido:</hi> for when <hi>Hyarbas</hi> King of the <hi>Gelutians</hi> made War upon <hi>Dido,</hi>
because he could not obtain her in Matrimony, she received Aid from
this <hi>Battus;</hi> and when for the love of <hi>Aeneas</hi> she had killed her self, <hi>Hyarbas,</hi>
having conquered <hi>Carthage,</hi> banished her Sister <hi>Anne,</hi> who was entertained
by this <hi>Battus.</hi> But <hi>Hyarbas</hi> taking that unkindly, made War upon <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and conquered the Island of <hi>Malta:</hi> so it continued in the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> a long time after, until the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and then one <hi>Titus Sempronius</hi> (about such times as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
brought his Army before <hi>Trebia</hi>) won it 217 years before Christ.
And after it continued under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Romans</hi> 130 years, and
then it was conquered by the <hi>Saracens;</hi> but they held it not long, for <hi>Roger
Norman</hi> King of <hi>Sicilia</hi> got it out of their Power, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1090. And
so it continued in the hands of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1520. And
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:105162:225"/>
then <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth being Emperour, gave it to the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
upon condition that they should oppose the <hi>Turks</hi> Gallies, and defend that
part of Christendom. So the Knights of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> together with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
sailed to <hi>Malta,</hi> and so fortified it that it is impossible to be taken,
unless by Famin or Treason. There were many famous Bishops that lived
in this place, and very devout Christians. In the time of the Emperour <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
there was a Councel held, at which were present 240 Bishops. At this
day this Bishoprick is subject to the Archbishop of <hi>Palermo;</hi> and the chief

               <p>THIS was a City of the Isle of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> built by one <hi>Archia</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
standing close by the Sea Shore on the North side of the Isle, 2756 miles
from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> towards the West. It was a fair and goodly City, in antient
time called <hi>Tetrapolis,</hi> because it was divided into three parts: one of which
parts stood in the Isle of <hi>Ortygia</hi> separated from the Continent with a little
streight Sea, and with that famous Fountain <hi>Arthusia.</hi> The other part was
called <hi>Acradine,</hi> and the third <hi>Tycha;</hi> to which in after-times there was built
up a fourth, and called by the name of <hi>Neapolis.</hi> All this City was compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in with three Walls, so strong and so admirably fortified both by Nature
and Art, that it opposed the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in equal War. It was called
<hi>Syracusa,</hi> from drawing or sucking; and in process of time obtained the
whole Jurisdiction and Government of that Isle; which was so well peopled
in the time of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant, that he was able to make and maintain
an Army of one hundred thousand Foot and twelve thousand Horse. There
were two Havens in that part which was called <hi>Ortygia,</hi> so marvellously for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with such huge Rocks and other Munition, that they were wonderful to
look upon. There also stood a Castle or Tower called by the name of <hi>Mercia,</hi>
which was so strong, that when all the rest of the Town was conquered,
yet that maintained War for a long time. In this Hold the Kings and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
of this Country usually kept their Treasures, and other things that
were material. There were many worthy and famous Princes ruled in it,
but above them all <hi>Dionysius</hi> the elder exceeded the rest; who when he
saw what abundance of Vessels of Gold and Silver <hi>Dionysius</hi> the younger
had heaped together, cried out and said, <hi>In te Regius affectus non est, qui ex
tanta poculorum vi amicum neminem conciliasti:</hi> That is, Verily, the mind of
a King is not in thee, that out of so many Cups couldest not procure one
Friend: For after he was banished, and constrained to keep a School. Both
these <hi>Dionysians</hi> were learned Men and great Philosophers. It is thought
that this Island was some time a part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and joyning to the Field of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi>
but in time, through the violence of the Sea, separate from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:

were three Mountains standing upon three Promontories in three several

and another called <hi>Pelorus,</hi> which lay distant near about two miles

of <hi>Italy</hi> toward the Sicilian Sea, being distant from that Isle sixty Furlongs,
and called by the name of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> as some think, from <hi>Rumpo,</hi> to break;
for that near about the place where that Town stood, the Sea being very
Tempestuous, broke the Isle of <hi>Sicilia</hi> from the Continent. Others think
it was called <hi>Rhegium,</hi> because it was so strong and beautiful a City that
it might well have been the Seat of a Prince. Close by this City, in the
Sicilian Sea, there stands a Rock somewhat above the Water, representing
in Figure the Proportion of a Man, and round about it are to be seen other
little Rocks like barking Dogs. In this place the Water is so extream vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
and runes with so strong a current, that it is very dangerous for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
(especially such as are ignorant) to sail that way. Wherefore
the Poets made this verse, to signifie a man that stood in a Dangerous and
Doubtful estate,

But that Mariners might avoid these dangerous places, upon the North angle

this Lake: and seeing the Dolphin (it being a strange Fish in those parts,
and very amiable to look upon) did take great delight in it, and oft times
fed it with Bread and other things as he could get: insomuch, as the Dolphin
when it heard the Boy's Voice upon the Bank of the River, would resort
to him, and receive at his hand his accustomed Food. Thus it continued so,
that the Dolphin would suffer the Boy to handle him, take him by the
Gills, play with him, yea, and sometimes to get upon his Back, then swim
with him a great way into the Lake, and bring him back again, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to go safe upon the shore. After this manner he continued for many
Years together, and in the end the Youth died. Yet the Dolphin resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his usual place, expecting his accustomed Food from the hands of this
Boy; but missing him, he left the shore, languish'd away, and died. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

of <hi>Rom, i.</hi> He hath exalted or made high. But the <hi>Grecians</hi> derive it from
<hi>Romen, i.</hi> Strength and Power. Now although the Providence of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to every Creature, nay, to the very hairs of a Man's Head, yet
where he determines to express his singular Power, there he worketh beyond
the expectation of man. And who knows not that the beginning of this
City was mean, raised from a confused Company, destitute both of Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Community, and Laws; yet hath it been, and for the most part is, the
glory of the World, and the great Commander of the Princes of the Earth.</p>
               <p>It was so called at first by <hi>Romulus</hi> (as <hi>Livy,</hi> lib. 1. saith) who first built it,
seven hundred fifty and one years before the Nativity of Christ; being sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
upon seven Hills, that is, <hi>Capitolinus, Aventinus, Palatinus, Cealius,
Exquilinus, Viminalis,</hi> and <hi>Quirinalis.</hi> But after, when the City was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with Walls, the Hill <hi>Ianiculus</hi> was inclosed within it. The
Vallies that lay between these Hills were so raised up with Arches, Vaults,
and artificial Mounts, that in process of time they became level with the
top of some of those Hills. It was beautified with fair and sumptuous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
so that as it was the head of the World for Command and Power,
in like manner it exceeded all the rest of the World for Glory and Riches,
but principally for stately Buildings. There were many goodly Temples,
dedicated to <hi>Iupiter, Apollo, Aesculapius, Hercules, Diana, Iuno, Minerva,
Lucia, Concordia, Fides, Pietas, Pax, Victoria, Isis,</hi> besides many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to other Gods. But above all, that was the most sumptuous that
was called <hi>Pantheon Deorum;</hi> at this day called the Church of <hi>Alhallows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, here was to be seen the Princely Edifices of Kings, Emperours,
Consuls, Senators, Patricians, and other <hi>Romans,</hi> who were mighty in
Wealth and Substance, built all of polished Marble, beautified with Gold
and Silver; beside Palaces, Bulwarks, Theatres, triumphant Arches, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and such like; all which were glorious, and greatly adorned the City.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:105162:227"/>
But above all these, the House of <hi>Nero</hi> was most worthy of Observation,
which to see to, was built all of burnish'd Gold very curiously wrought.
Here also stood the Monuments of the two <hi>Caesars, Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augustus;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
their Statues, the one made of pure Brass, the other of white Marble.
Besides, there were many fruitful Orchards, Water Courses, and wholsome
Baths, brought thither by <hi>Antonius, Nero, Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great.</p>
               <p>Also the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> erected many goodly Churches for the
use of the Christians, and endowed them with great means; and amongst
the rest, that which was dedicated to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Latteran,</hi> a fair and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church, and for Riches and curious Workmanship might compare with
the stateliest Temples that ever had been in the World, most of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Images being made of Gold and Silver: he also erected the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican,
which was dedicated to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and another holy House dedicated
to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> in either of which he placed their several Sepulchres and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,
bestowing extraordinary Cost to beautifie them. So many were
the Gifts and Gratuities of this Emperour, that they can scarce be numbred;
so that although the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> the Fourth, Pope of
<hi>Rome,</hi> bestowed great Cost to beautifie and adorn the City, yet were they
nothing comparable to that which this Emperour did. These things then
being presented to your view, you might justly say, That <hi>Rome</hi> in her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
and Eminency was the Glory of the World; but as all Estates are
fickle and uncertain, still subject to Variety and Change, so was this: first
envied of the World, because of the extream oppression of her Governours;
and after made desolate by Violence and Force, all her former Glory being
eclipsed, and the greatest part of these goodly Buildings laid level with the
Ground. Thus have I shewed you what <hi>Rome</hi> was when it was in her
Prosperity; it resteth now to shew what <hi>Rome</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> at this day differeth as much from the ancient <hi>Rome</hi> as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Shadow. For, although the Pope hath beautified and
adorned the West part of it with many fair and goodly Buildings, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it by the name of new <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it is nothing comparable to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
City, as it was when <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great were Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ours
thereof, neither doth it stand in the ancient place; for the first City
stood upon the East side of <hi>Tyber,</hi> this upon the West. The chief part of
the other stood upon the Mountains <hi>Capitolinus</hi> and <hi>Palatinus,</hi> upon
which were the stately Buildings of Senators, Kings, and Emperours, but
now they lye desolate and waste. The Capitol also, and the Temple of
<hi>Iupiter Feretrius</hi> (goodly Buildings) beaten to the Ground; only some
Ruines, to shew that such things there hath been. And what now resteth,
that are worthy note, are in the Command and Power of the Pope; which
are not many: the most that can be named, are the Vatican, the Tower
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:105162:227"/>
of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> the Pope's Palace, his Banquetting-house, and the Gardens and
Walks about it; which are so well scituated, that they are a grace to all
<hi>Rome,</hi> the rest are but ordinary and common Buildings. Thus may you
see that there is nothing in this World but hath a period, to which, if with
much Labour it attaineth, then it commonly declineth, seldom continueth;
for who knows not with what labour, what perils by Sea, what dangers by
Land, through how many Forein Wars and Domestick Seditions <hi>Rome</hi>
was raised to her greatness? And how suddenly was all this lost? What the
Vertue and Wisdom of grave and resolute Consuls, Captains and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
had with great hazard heaped up, thrusting their Capitol and
other Treasuries full with the Triumphant Spoyls of Forein Nations, was
left to be consumed either by Seditious Souldiers or prodigal Emperours,
and the State left as a Prey to those that were mightiest; so that they were
accounted most honourable, that with most Injury could get to themselves
either Countenance to oversway Authority, or Opulency to purchase Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency;
insomuch that there hath been no action so evil, nor any attempt
so pernicious in former times, but may be match'd in the declining of the
<hi>Roman</hi> State: Where more Murthers? where more Corruption? where
more Oppression than is mentioned in Histories to be practised amongst
the <hi>Romans?</hi> the Lives of Men, the state of Provinces, and the Crowns of
Kings sold for Money, but now her time is finished, and her Ruins are left
for succeeding Ages to admire; that so in beholding they might learn to know
the difference between Virtue and Vice; and from thence conclude, that
there is nothing permanent; and that those things wherein men most glory
do oftentimes soonest decay. For if this City which commanded the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Princes of the Earth (whose Colonies, Armies, Legions, Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and Treasures were so Mighty, and extended so far, that there was
almost no Countrey unconquered, or Nation that did not fear to hear the
Inhabitants thereof named) is made desolate and laid level with the Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what then may be said of petty Cities, Towns, Lordships, Manors and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
shall not they likewise be subject to the like Calamities, and wasted
and destroyed through the continuance of time? Verily yea. <hi>Wherefore let
not the King glory in his Power, nor the strong man in his Strength, nor the Rich
man in his Riches: but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord.</hi>
