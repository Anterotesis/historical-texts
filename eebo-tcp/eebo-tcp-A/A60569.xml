            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in God,
HENRY
Lord Biſhop of London,
Dean of His MAJESTIE's
Chappel-Royall,
AND
One of the Lords of His MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIE's

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I had no particular obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to your Lordſhip, the very
Argument of the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
upon a Preſumption
at leaſt, that they are faithfully
made and collected, would ſoon
have determined my choice, and
ſuggeſted to me where I ought
<pb facs="tcp:47668:3"/>
to addreſs my ſelf in a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How highly your Lordſhip
has merited of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
by taking it into your care, and
by opening a Sanctuary for the
poor diſtreſſed Biſhops and
Prieſts of that Communion to
fly unto, is not unknown at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi>
and whatever the
ſucceſs of it may be, They
cannot be ſo unjuſt, as not
to applaud your Lordſhips de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as worthy of your great
Charity and Piety, to relieve
the neceſſities of thoſe, whom
either curioſity and love of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſhall draw into theſe parts,
or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> cruelty and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall drive and force out of
their own Country; and at the
ſame time to reduce them from
thoſe errours and corruptions,
which have of late crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, by bringing them
<pb facs="tcp:47668:3"/>
into a nearer and more familiar
acquaintance with the Doctrin,
and rites of Worſhip eſtabliſht
in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It
cannot be doubted in the leaſt,
that the moſt likely way to effect
this excellent deſign, was not
onely to permit but to encourage
the building of a Church in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
for their Nation; where
they might enjoy the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their Worſhip in all things
that are decent and inoffenſive,
and any way eſſential to their
Religion. That this has been
done with ſuch Chriſtian gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
and prudence, they owe,
next to His Majeſty unto your
Lordſhip: whom they muſt for
ever look upon as their great
Patron. And if the Governours
of their Church have not ſuch a
grateful reſentment of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as it highly challenges and
<pb facs="tcp:47668:4"/>
deſerves, or if They, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the happineſs and benefit,
ſhould render themſelves leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, yet your Lordſhip will
not loſe your reward with God:
and all good men conſider it as
the effect of that publick and
generous mind, which has been
so conſpicuous in all parts of
your Lordſhips conduct. With
what a ſteday courage your
Lordſhip has defended the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this day
of Trial, againſt the furious aſſaults
of her reſtleſs enemies, the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> on the one hand, and the
Giddy <hi>Sectaries</hi> on the other,
(who both agree in the ſame
deſigns of pulling down the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
and overturning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in order to her more
effectual ruine,) all her true and
genuine Sons, who love and pray
for her peace and proſperity,
<pb facs="tcp:47668:4"/>
cannot but moſt gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.
And though the
ſpirit of fury rages ſtill, and is
not to be charmed or allayed by
that mildneſs and ſweetneſs of
temper, which is ſo natural in
your Lordſhip, yet they cannot
but inwardly admire you, againſt
whom they have onely this to
object, that you are a Biſhop.
It is for the great honour of our
Church, that we can ballance
your Lordſhip againſt any of
your renowned Predeceſſours,
and againſt the moſt celebrated
Biſhops of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as <hi>Antonine, Borromeo</hi> and <hi>Sales:</hi>
and it is the great happineſs of
our Church too, that a Perſon of
such Illuſtrious Birth and Merit
is advanced to ſo high a Station
and Dignity in it. It will be the
proper work of thoſe, who ſhall
write the Hiſtory of our Times,
<pb facs="tcp:47668:5"/>
to tranſmit a full character of
your Lordſhips worth to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which, when envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
are laid aſide, and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
judgment is made of Perſons

great reſpect and honour to your
Name and Memory: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will better ſuit with my
Meanneſs, with my Function,
and with my Obligations, to

            <p>HAving obliged my ſelf by Promiſe in
a Letter, which I wrote from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
in the year 1669. to an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Gentleman at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> upon
my return into <hi>England</hi> to preſent him
with an account of the State and Condition
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as to matter of
Doctrine and Rites of Worſhip and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
(an inbred curioſity, which made
me undertake that Voyage at firſt, and
afterwards ſufficiently expoſed me to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that barbarous Country, where they
are ſo jealous of every inquiſitive <hi>Franke,</hi>
that appears in any of their inland Towns
out of a place of Trade, as if he were a Spy,
and come to view the ſeveral places, where
they might be attaqued with the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
or rather the duty of my Function
inciting me to make uſe of thoſe happy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
<pb facs="tcp:47668:6"/>
which I there enjoyed, in order to a
full and ſatisfactory diſcovery:) to comply
with this obligation, and to ſatisfy the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
as it is very well known, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
excellent perſons, who were pleaſed
in Diſcourſe and by Letters, to mind me
of a Promiſe alſo, which I had made in
my <hi>Latine</hi> Epiſtles, of publiſhing at ſome
time or other an account of thoſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which I had collected upon this
Argument, I drew up about five years
ſince a ſhort Scheme of them in <hi>Latine,</hi> and
not long after preſented it to the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Father in God, the preſent Lord
Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> one of the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the Age for promoting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Learning, and whoſe merits
to the Vniverſity will make up a great part
of the future Hiſtory of it, who did me the
honour to print it at the Theater, where
ſo many excellent Books have been by his
Lordſhips direction and care publiſhed.</p>
            <p>That I now publiſh the ſame in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
(though with large additions) it is more
to doe right to the world, then to my ſelf,
who have no private paſſion to gratify in it:
my deſign in the one and the other being
to contribute ſomewhat to the publick
good.</p>
            <p>It cannot be imputed to me as a piece of
<pb facs="tcp:47668:6"/>
vanity and oſtentation, that I ſay, that I
have taken all imaginable care to repreſent
things truly as I found them, and relate
nothing but what is confirmed by the
Offices uſed in the Service of that Church,
and other Eccleſiaſticall Writings, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and Catechiſms, and the like;
or by notoreity of practice and fact, there
being a neceſſity to premiſe ſo much to
make the following Narrative credible.
In the contexture of which, I wholly aimed
at truth without ſerving any Party or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
and have dealt impartially in the
caſe without the leaſt tincture of Affection
or Prejudice. To which purpoſe I have
ſtudiouſly endeavoured to couch things in
a plain cloſe ſtyle, without enlarging upon
them unneceſſarily, being more ambitious
in a ſubject of this nature, of the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being accounted an honeſt and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
then ſpruce and elegant Writer. I
have ſometimes indeed referred to the
judgment of Antiquity, but it was wholly
in order to the better underſtanding the
preſent practice of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and I can
ſay moſt conſcientiouſly, that thoſe few
reflexions, which I have made, are wholly
owing to a juſt zeal and love for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of truth, and the advancement of
ſtrict and diſcreet Piety, whereby my
<pb facs="tcp:47668:7"/>
my Reader may not onely be bettered in his
judgment but in his life too.</p>
            <p>You will here clearly ſee, with what
great difficulties the poor <hi>Eaſtern Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
ſtruggle, againſt what mighty oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they ſtill maintain the profeſſion of
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and how the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
triumphs, notwithſtanding the cruel
mockings and inſultings of the profeſt
Enemies of it: though it muſt be moſt
ſadly confeſſed, that ſeveral corruptions
and errours in point of Doctrin and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Rites and Practices in Worſhip
have crept in among them, to the great
diſadvantage, ſcandal, and diſhonour of
our Holy Religion, which is hereby conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
expoſed to the cenſure and contempt
of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who, dull and ſtupid
as they are, do not pretend to examine
the grounds and reaſons of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Belief, but judge of the whole by ſuch odd
phantaſtick miſrepreſentations, and fortify
their old prejudices every day more and
more with freſh matter of diſlike.</p>
            <p>The common people among the <hi>Greeks</hi>
doe as they are directed, without the leaſt
examination or demurr, and depend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
upon their Teachers and Spiritual
Guides in matters of Religion: being
wholly ignorant of and unacquainted with
<pb facs="tcp:47668:7"/>
the Scriptures, few having the leiſure and
fewer ability to reade them. It was the
pious deſign of that great man <hi>Cyrillus
Lucaris,</hi> (of whom more at large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
in cauſing the New Teſtament to be
tranſlated into vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> for the uſe
and benefit of the meaner ſort, that they
might be built up in the moſt Holy Faith,
and thence be fully inſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Doctrin of <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
But though they had curioſity and learning
enough to conſult theſe Sacred Writings,
the Copies are very rare and ſcarce to be
met with, and no care is taken to furniſh
out a new Edition: and it is too too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
not without deſign, to keep them
more in ſubjection and awe, not to ſay,
ignorance. They are bred up in the ſame
perſwaſion as formerly, and ſo zealouſly do
they retain the outward Services of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in all its punctilio's and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that even the Biſhops themſelves, who
would be content to relax ſomewhat of the
ſeverities of their Faſts, dare not attempt to
make any alteration in the leaſt, leſt their
people, obſtinate to exceſs, ſhould be offended
at it, and doubt of the truth of what they
would have them ſtill profeſs and believe.</p>
            <p>And indeed, conſidering the preſent
ſtate of things, there is little ſign or hope
<pb facs="tcp:47668:8"/>
of a Reformation. For the miſery of it
is, that though it is manifeſt to all, who
underſtand Antiquity, how much the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Greeks</hi> have in ſeveral points of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin
varied from the Belief of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours,
and have corrupted the ſimplicity
and purity of Religion by a mixture of odd
opinions and fancies, they pretend not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding;
that their Tenents are
agreeable to the Fathers; and that they
follow the Traditions of the ancient
Church. But without looking back much
beyond this laſt Century, whoever will
compare the anſwers of the Patriarch <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remias</hi>
to the Letters of the Divines of
<hi>Wittenberg</hi> in the year 1576. with their
Confeſſion of Faith publiſhed in the year
1662. and with the <hi>Bethleemitick</hi> Synod
held in the year 1671. will find ſuch a vaſt
difference between the modeſty of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
and their bold determinations, as
will encline any ſober and conſidering man
to believe, that they have of late more then
ever been wrought upon by the ſly artifices
and inſinuations and underhand dealing
of the ſubtile Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
watch continually over the poor <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and take advantage of their poverty and
diſtreſs to bring them to a further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
and in time, to a down-right
<pb facs="tcp:47668:8"/>
ſubjection. I do not doubt, but that
time, which is the great revealer of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
will diſcover the myſtery of the
laſt Synod held by the Patriarch of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi>
who, when I waited upon him at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> not long before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
knowing me to be a Prieſt of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Chaplain to his
Excellency, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour
then at the Port, entertained me very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully,
and acquainted me, that he
had ſeveral Papers againſt the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
which he would take care to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and put into my hands to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>England:</hi> but he did not, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
tell me the particular Subject and
Argument of them, nor thought fit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to ſend them, as he had at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.
Reflecting upon this diſcourſe, I
was the more amazed at the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Synod held by his Authority:
and perchance it would not be want either
of good manners or charity to gueſs by
what arguments they were prevailed upon,
and how they were influenced.</p>
            <p>This deſign of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which
has been carrying on for ſo many years,
was ſoon diſcovered by <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris</hi>
Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a man of
great parts and of an extraordinary cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb facs="tcp:47668:9"/>
who was reſolved to give a check
and put a ſtop to it, as much as in him
lay, and by degrees to reform thoſe abuſes
and errours, that had prevailed among
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and introduce a ſtricter alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and union of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church
with the reformed Churches of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
This drew upon him the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, then Pope,
and the Congregation of Cardinals <hi>de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagandâ fide,</hi>
as they ſpeak at <hi>Rome,</hi> who
knew no good could be done, while he ſate
upon the Patriarchall Throne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finding after ſeveral attempts to bring
him over by fair means to relinquiſh his
pretenſions, that he was too ſtout and too
honeſt to ſubmit to their overtures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
they made uſe of ſeveral evil arts
to dethrone him; and in order thereunto
blackened and defamed him with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
calumnies, and purſued him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
diligence and malice, and never
deſiſted till they had got him ſtrangled.
Out of reſpect to the memory of this good
man, who ſuffered ſo much in his life-time
by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the great inſtruments made
uſe of in his Perſecution, and Tragicall
end, and is ſtill moſt unworthily treated
by Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> (from a man of
such excellent Learning and Piety ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:47668:9"/>
diſingenuity could ſcarce be expected) in
the height of his zeal for the <hi>Roman</hi>
Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and by
the <hi>Latinizing Greeks,</hi> who contrary to
all laws of humanity, return him hatred
for his good will, and tear his reputation
in pieces by moſt reproachfull language and
ſlanderous imputations, to gratify, at this
diſtance of time, not ſo much their Paſſion,
as a little baſe paltry worldly intereſt, as
I have juſt reaſon to ſuſpect and believe,
I have added a ſhort account of the ſtate
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which I have drawn out of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Papers and Memorials.</p>
            <p>After all theſe triumphs gained over the
poor <hi>Greeks,</hi> who now declare ſo fiercely
for a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let it be remembred how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that, (beſides their ignorance of the
true ſtate of the Controverſy, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of which they never thoroughly
ſtudied nor yet underſtand, as appears by
their ſilence and ſtupid amazement, when
they are urged with them) they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it publickly to be adored, that they
have no <hi>fête di Dieu,</hi> or <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi>
Feſtival, which to me was the moſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
ſight in the world, (for who would
not be confounded to ſee the moſt Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> turned into a
<pb facs="tcp:47668:10"/>
pompous piece of Pageantry?) and laſtly,
that they do not as yet ſing in their
Churches any thing like that, which the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> teach their people to ſing in the
ſolemn Proceſſion of that day: <hi>Non eſt
panis ſed eſt Deus homo, &amp; ſalvator
meus:</hi> not to mention the other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at preſent in the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, as communion in both kinds,
communicating Infants, and the like;
which I chuſe rather to leave to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
judgment and obſervation upon his
peruſal of the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe errours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
we preſerve a great charity for this
diſtreſſed part of the Catholick Church,
and wiſh and pray heartily for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery; and that
in the mean while they may ſee from what
purity of Doctrin and Worſhip they are
faln, and may be reſtored to their ancient
integrity and ſplendour. This <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
compaſſion obliges us to doe. We leave it
to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and to the other fierce <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to aſcribe
the ruine of the <hi>Empire</hi> to their Hereſy,
as they term it, about the Proceſſion, to
their Schiſm and defection from <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
See. Next to the juſtice and all-wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:47668:10"/>
Providence of God in the diſpoſal of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
and putting periods to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we can aſſign other more probable
cauſes of their oppreſſion, and among them
chiefly, the want of timely aſſiſtence from
<hi>Italy,</hi> though two or three of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
had been there in perſon to beg it.
But this is properly the work of a Civil Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,
and is beſides the intent of this
Preface; which I ſhall ſoon put an end to
after I have added this one thing; That I
cannot reflect without horrour upon what I
have read in <hi>Cardinall Pole</hi>'s third

               </note> Book <hi>pro defenſione Eccleſiaſticae

the Fifth had been at that time unde ſail
with his Fleet, and ſteering his courſe
toward <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he would never
be at reſt, how great ſoever the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Journey were, till he had found
him out, and then being brought into his
<pb facs="tcp:47668:11"/>
preſence he would importune him to leave
off that deſign, and employ his Armies
againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> and againſt King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth (his natural Liege Lord
and Sovereign) as being a far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
work. And all this out of a pretended
love to his Country, and charity for the
Church infuſed into him, as he ſpeaks, by
the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Emperour, in this eloquent
harangue<note n="a" place="bottom">pag. 79.</note> he tells him, that ſeveral
Legions lay hid in <hi>England,</hi> that had not
bowed their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
for leſſer crimes then Hereſy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to Catholicks had depoſed their
Kings, as for miſpending the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that they ſtill retain'd the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and that nothing was wanting
to execute their deſign, but his Imperial
Preſence.<note n="b" place="bottom">pag. 80.</note> Soon after he addreſſes
to King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf, and tells him in
downright terms, that if the King of
<hi>France</hi> would ſuppreſs his deſigns againſt
the Church (that is, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>)
it would be no leſs glorious to him, then
if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had recovered <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
out of the hands of the <hi>Turks.</hi> At what a
<pb facs="tcp:47668:11"/>
high pitch of indiſcretion and fury do men
arrive by their intemperate heat and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry!
They forget themſelves not onely
to be Subjects but even <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> at the
ſame time they would appear extraordinary
zealous <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and care not how
far the great <hi>Turk</hi> prevails, provided that
a pretended Hereſy, which conſiſted onely
in a recovery of the eſſential Rights of the
Crown from the uſurpations of the Papal
See (which was the onely caſe at that time
here in <hi>England</hi>) had been extirpated,
and the <hi>Germans</hi> reduced to the ſame
ſubjection to <hi>Rome</hi> they were in before
the appearing of <hi>Luther:</hi> which had been
the readieſt amd moſt effectual way to
have made <hi>Solyman</hi> Maſter of <hi>Vienna,</hi>
which was one of his earneſt wiſhes, if the
Emperour and his Council had not been
perſons of greater Policy and more Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and had not foreſeen the fatall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of ſuch <hi>Catholick</hi> advice.</p>
            <p>Certainly it is a more innocent and
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> wiſh, that there were a happy
end put to the differences now on foot,
which diſturb the quiet and peace of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
that ſo ſome of the powerfull
Princes of it may turn their Forces <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
upon the great enemy of their <hi>Faith</hi>

               <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there to their eaſe and liberty.
This indeed is too great a good to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

being a neceſſary part, the Patriarch is
forced to bribe ſome one or other with

it by lot. All things thus prepared,

towards <hi>Judas,</hi> who throws out
his Legs with ſome kind of haſt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
in a very fooliſh and indiſcreet
manner, the Patriarch, both by his look
and behaviour in the action, ſhews a
manifeſt diſlike; which cauſes laughter
and ſport among the people preſent at
the ſolemnity, who hitherto are uſually
grave and ſerious. He who repreſents
S. <hi>Peter</hi> is uſually the chief perſon in

has his feet waſht. He, upon ſeeing
the Patriarch approach him, conteſts it

               <p>As formerly ambition and greedy

in the Church occaſioned great
diſorders and diſtractions amongſt the

and ſometime introduced a Schiſm,
whereby Altar was ſet up againſt Altar,
to the great ſcandal of Religion and
breach of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion, the

and taking advantage hereby to oppreſs
and ruine both parties: So it is ſtill;
the Peace and Quiet and the great and
real Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sacrificed to this reſtleſs Paſſion.
The oppreſſion which the <hi>Greeks</hi> lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the <hi>Turks,</hi> though very ſad
and diſmal in it ſelf, becomes more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
and troubleſome by their own hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Quarrels and Differences about the
choice of a <hi>Patriarch:</hi> there being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
ſeveral Pretenders among the
Metropolitans and Biſhops, and they
too making an intereſt, by large ſumms
of mony, in the <hi>Vizir,</hi> or the other <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's,</hi>
to attain their ends. He who by
his mony and his friends has prevail'd,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47668:52"/>
and has defeated his Competitors, will
endeavour to reimburſe himſelf, and
lay the burthen and debt, which he has
contracted, upon the Church, which
muſt pay for all: while the reſt, who
envy his preferment, and are vext at
their diſappointment, unite their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and ſtrength to get him diſplaced,
by remonſtrating againſt his injuſtice
and ill management of affairs, and put
up freſh Petitions to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and
bribe luſtily to be heard. The <hi>Turks,</hi>
glad of ſuch an opportunity of gain,
readily enough admit their Complaint,
and put out and put in, as they ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
In the mean while, large ſums
of mony are uſually taken up at a great
intereſt by the contending Parties, to
carry on theſe fooliſh and <hi>un-chriſtian</hi>
Quarrels. Sometime, beſide the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Patriarch, there have been three
others alive at the ſame time, who have
enjoyed the Title. Such were in the
years 1669, 1670. <hi>Païſius, Dionyſius,</hi>
and <hi>Parthenius:</hi> the Patriarch then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt Reverend Father <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
before Archbiſhop of <hi>Heraclea.</hi>
But I concluded from the murmurings
and diſſatisfactions I obſerved among
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that he would not continue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47668:53"/>
long in that dignity; and the event
soon juſtified my fears. For <hi>Parthenius,</hi>
being a man of an unquiet temper, and
not able to brook his former diſgrace,
makes in with the <hi>Vizir,</hi> and recovers
his former pretenſions, and by the uſual
arts prevails, and was reſtored to the
Patriarchal throne: <hi>Methodius</hi> being
thrown into priſon by the <hi>Caimacam</hi> or
Governour of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But he
being after ſome time reſtored to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by the new Governour, and
thinking himſelf not ſafe from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and revenge of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> who
had got him diſplaced, takes ſanctuary in
my Lord Embaſſadour's Palace at <hi>Pera,</hi>
where he had all manner of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.
<hi>Parthenius</hi> by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
carriage and cruell exactions
grew hatefull to the Biſhops of his See,
and to the generality of the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
whereupon they accuſe him of fraud
and injuſtice, and that he had detained
for his private uſe the yearly tribute due
to the Emperour, which had been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected:
whereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to diſplace him, provided that they
made good the ſame ſumm. Thus after
eight months ſitting he was baniſhed to
the Island of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47668:53"/>
of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> made Patriarch. In
this ſtate of affairs I left <hi>Turky:</hi> what
has happened ſince, I leave to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

theſe Revolutions and Changes, I am
filled at the ſame time with amazement
and pity, and cannot but put up this
hearty prayer to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> (and I
doubt not, but that whoſoever ſhall
caſt his eyes upon theſe Papers, will
joyn with me as heartily in it,) that
He would be pleaſed to inſpire the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Biſhops with ſober and peaceable
counſels, that, laying aſide all partiality,
and the conſideration of baſe worldly
intereſt, they may ſtudy the good and
quiet of their Church, and ſee at laſt in
this day of their moſt ſevere Viſitation
the things which belong to their peace,
before they be hid from their eyes, and
before their name and Religion be
quite loſt and extinguiſht. To which

being no rich Livings to invite them to

the Clergy muſt be content with their

But cuſtome and long uſe make things

Marriage after Orders. So that if any

That in the year 1661. or 1662.
(for I have forgot the exact year) the
preſent Emperour Sultan <hi>Mahomet Chan,</hi>
hunting not far from the <hi>Euxine,</hi> (to
which kind of exerciſe he is very much
addicted,) in the purſuit of his game, at
laſt, wearied and tired, lighted to reſt
at a Fountain at ſome little diſtance
from their Convent. Upon the news
of which, they conſulted, whether they
should wait upon him with ſome poor
Preſent or no: at laſt one of the pert
Monks undertook it. Advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Emperour, having made his
reverence after the cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and making an excuſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
he was guilty of, he preſented
him with a little Cheeſe and a basket of
Cherries: then which latter nothing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47668:65"/>
could have been more welcom to him,
being thirſty and over-heated with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
riding, and who yet in ſuch an
extremity abhorred the leaſt thought of
Wine. After ſome little time he calls
the poor <hi>Kaloir,</hi> and very calmly asked
him, whether he would become a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi>
out of deſign queſtionleſs to
have preferred him. But he, no way
wrought upon by this powerfull tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
continued ſpeechleſs in his humble
poſture, with his eyes fixt upon the
ground. The Emperour no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with his behaviour, which he
lookt upon as a modeſt denial, <hi>Well,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>I perceive you have a mind to
continue as you are;</hi> and then bidding
him look up, made a half circle with
his hand, telling him, he gave the
grounds lying about, which he thus
markt out, to the Convent; and then
commanded one of his favourite-Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
to give the poor man thirty pieces
of Gold.</p>

not thrown away into the ſtreet, like
other common water, but poured into
a hollow place, which they call <gap reason="foreign">

might have interrupted the ſeries

            <p>As to the moment of Conſecration,<note place="margin">In what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made.</note>
in which the Symbols become and are
made the Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
'tis certain that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> herein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the authority of ſeveral ancient
Writers of their Church, do not hold
this Divine Myſtery to be perfected and
conſummated by or after the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of thoſe words, <hi>Take, eat, this is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47668:84"/>
my Body;</hi> the Change, what-ever it be,
not being made, according to S. <hi>John
Damaſcen,</hi> but by the deſcent and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
of the Holy Spirit upon the Gifts
or Elements placed upon the Altar.
Therefore in order to the completion
of this Sacrament, they adde Benediction
and Prayers, in which they do expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
implore the Divine grace of the
<hi>Holy Spirit of God:</hi> the Prieſt, after
he has recited the words of our B. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
in the Inſtitution, invoking God
in theſe words, <hi>Send thy Holy Spirit
upon us, and upon theſe holy Gifts lying

then with his hand lift up, and held
over them, <hi>changing them by the Holy
Spirit.</hi> Theſe are the formall words of
the Liturgies of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and
S. <hi>Baſil</hi> now in uſe. It is of no great

of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
hereafter. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are now
aware, that there is no hope and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of reconciling <hi>Greece</hi> by bluſtring
and force; and therefore they betake
themſelves to cloſer arts and methods of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47668:88"/>
ſubtlety: the <hi>Greeks</hi> bred up in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege

after they have finiſhed a courſe of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

of working an Union, and of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their Countrymen from the ſcandal
and guilt of Schiſm and Hereſy; who
are permitted to diſſemble their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and oftentimes are advanced
to great Dignities in the Church; to
whom, being men of great eloquence,
and wit, and learning, and policy, I
believe theſe Alterations are chiefly to be
aſcribed. In the mean time, let the
Zelots of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church triumph,
that the preſent <hi>Greeks</hi> declare abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
for them: we need not envy
them a victory, which they have gained
by ſuch baſe and treacherous Arts, not
to ſay Bribery. But however, this is
one great argument, that the opinion of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is wholly new among
them, that they have not much ſtudied
the point, but heedleſly take it upon
truſt with an implicite faith. For when
their Biſhops and Prieſts are urged with
the horrid and monſtrous conſequences
of it, fully made out from Scripture and
Philoſophy, they ſtand amazed, and
return no other anſwer but this, that it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47668:88"/>
is a great Myſtery, and not to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
'Tis certainly a great, an holy, a

and heartily acknowledge; but how

anticipated the uſual time of the

the <hi>Agapae</hi> or Love-feaſts, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>and in breaking of bread, and prayer,</hi>
that is, in receiving the Sacrament, and
in joint and publick devotion. This
was done partly out of the great love
and affection which they bare to our
B. <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> who ſhed his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Heart-bloud for us; and partly out
of obedience to his bleſſed will, who
therefore was pleaſed to inſtitute and
command it, that it might be a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Memorial of his precious Death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
his coming again; (for they did
not think it a meer matter of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
whether they received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
or no, as many in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Age are apt to deceive and flatter
themſelves;) and partly out of a deep
ſenſe they had of the many Benefits
flowing from a worthy Participation of
it. For being convinced by the moſt
ſatiſfactory way of proof, experience,
that the Sacrament was a moſt effectual
inſtrument of conveying Grace into
their Souls, that hereby they were
ſtrengthened in Grace and Vertue, that
hereby they held a cloſe Communion
with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and became <hi>one with him,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47668:94"/>
and were fulfilled with the Divine Grace
and heavenly Benediction, and, laſtly,
were more and more confirmed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to undergo all the troubles
and torments either of life or death for
his Name; they were frequent and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
in their approaches to the Altar.
At that time it was made death by the
law for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
meetings; an horrible Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
raged every-where throughout the
Empire; they were dragged before Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals,
and ſentenced to be burned, or
crucified, or tormented worſe. All
this they beheld with their eyes, without
ſhedding a tear, without a ſigh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regret and trouble of mind; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
greatly, that they were counted
worthy to ſuffer reproach and death it
ſelf for the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that
they were thus made conformable to the
image of their <hi>Saviour,</hi> and partakers of
his Sufferings. It was altogether uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whether their lives were not to end
before the day: they therefore daily
contemplated <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
this inſpired them with new
courage, and their zeal became more
ardent and vigourous then the flames
that conſumed them. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47668:95"/>
oftentimes prevented by the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
induſtry of their Idolatrous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and purſued to the very Grotta's
and Caves, and continually hunted out
by the Heathen Officers, from whoſe
violence nothing could be ſafe, and
thus deprived of theſe happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
In ſuch perplexity of affairs
what was to be done? They would
joyfully lay down their lives for <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
so that they might but firſt receive <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in the Sacrament. Hereupon it was
permitted them to carry away with
them ſome part of the conſecrated
Bread, and reſerve it either about them
or in their houſes, that if they were
diſcovered, and ſeized upon, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before a Judge, and immediately
ſentenced, and dragg'd to execution,
they might have wherewithall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and ſtrengthen them in their laſt
Agonies. This was afterward indulged
to Hermites, who had retired to the
Woods or Mountains, and other ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
places ſcarce acceſſible, to enjoy
themſelves and their Devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt moleſtation from company.
With which kind of life frequent jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyings
to Cities and places of reſort did
no way ſuit and comport. Very few
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47668:95"/>
of them being dignified with the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
it ſeemed very hard and ſevere,
that they ſhould be deprived of ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
a repaſt as the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is, in their receſſes and ſolitudes. A
maſs of conſecrated Bread was either
sent to them accordingly; or elſe, when
they thought fit to come and converſe
with the World for a few hours, they
carried it away with them upon their
quick and ſpeedy return. When this
cuſtom of reſerving the Sacramentall
Bread in private hands began, it cannot,
I ſuppoſe, be exactly ſtated: it is moſt
probable, that it might be about the
beginning of the Third Century. But
however this is certain; that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not onely juſt ſuſpicion, but juſt
and full proof, that the Holy Bread
which was reſerved was abuſed to very
evil purpoſes, it was forbid by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
held at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> the chief City of the
Province of <hi>Tarragona</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the
year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 381, Canon the third,
that <hi>any ſhould preſume to carry any of
the Holy Bread away with him.</hi> Upon
the ſame reaſon, ſeveral pieces of the
conſecrated Bread were reſerved and
kept by the Prieſts, to diſtribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Sick people, and eſpecially to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47668:96"/>
Laps'd perſons, (who, through humane
frailty, had been guilty of ſome ſinfull
compliance in the times of Perſecution,
and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> were deprived, in the
way of penance and humiliation, of the
Sacrament, till the hour of death,) who
poſſibly otherwiſe could not have gone
out of the world with peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
A famous inſtance of this we have

that they had ſuch an high eſteem and

neceſſary <hi>in articulo mortis:</hi> which was
the effect of their great Piety, which
deſerves the higheſt commendation and

            <p>I cannot here forbear my wonder at
the odde fancies of a late learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerning the Bleſſed Sacrament,<note place="margin">A juſt Cenſure on a little poſthumous Piece of Mr. <hi>J. H.</hi>
               </note>
in which, as in many other arguments

preſuming too much upon the ſtrength
and nimbleneſs of his wit, to make out
plauſibly any Paradox, he, to run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Times, unluckily pitcht upon.
And I think the Publiſher of theſe
Poſthumous Remains was not aware of
the ill effects that ſuch Notions, whereby
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47668:97"/>
the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ſo horribly
ſlighted, may produce, to the cooling
thoſe ardours of Devotion and zeal,
which all truly devout perſons have to
this Holy Inſtitution of our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
No perſon certainly whatever can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Symbols of our Bleſſed <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s
Paſſion and Death too often, ſo
he come with that due preparation of
mind which theſe pure and tremendous
Myſteries require: and the time of
one's laſt Sickneſs eſpecially is very
proper. Our Church, indeed, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that a frequent and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
uſe of the Sacrament in the time of
Health is ſufficient; and that ſuch devout
and religious perſons, in caſe of ſudden
Sickneſs, have leſs cauſe to be diſquieted
for the lack of the ſame. Our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
does not neceſſarily depend upon,
nor is reſtrained to an externall and oral
Communion; whether there be or
be not an opportunity, God accepts
the will and deſire of a contrite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
heart, in ſtead of this commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Sacrifice. Nor do we attribute
ſo much efficacy to the Sacramentall
Sign, as to the internal Grace, for fear
we ſhould detract from the perfection
of the Sacrifice of the real and natural
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47668:97"/>
Body of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> once offered upon
the Croſs, of which this is a Type and
a Repreſentation, though not onely ſo.
I urge it no farther, but that it is very
convenient for ſick perſons, when they
foreſee that their Sickneſs may prove
mortal, to receive; and undoubtedly
they would find the great benefit of it.
I put an end to this Digreſſion, with
reference to the preſent practice of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches, as to the
Reſervation of the Bleſſed Sacrament;
that the reaſon which held formerly,
has ceas'd long ſince. For there are

ſuch as have advanced in Piety, they

Every Prieſt is not a Confeſſour, nor
indeed can be without the licence of the
Biſhop, who uſually chuſes out grave
and elderly and prudent perſons, to
exerciſe this ſolemn part of the Prieſtly
Function. Men of this faculty and of

Out of this great variety, it is
moſt clear and evident, that the ſentence
of Abſolution is not pronounced by the
Prieſt, who is the onely Miniſter of this

and conſequently of great efficacy,
and does very much conduce, as I have
intimated before, to the preſervation of
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion among them. For
fear of theſe Cenſures, they are not
onely affrighted from the commiſſion of
thoſe Sins which would bring a ſcandal

the ſentence of Excommunication, that
was canonically paſt upon him. Such
great power has the dread and reverence

querulous and contentious people.</p>
            <p>If any perſon happen to die before

ſo timorous and ſuperſtitious herein,
that they will not anſwer any one in
the dark at the firſt call, though they
know his voice never ſo well, for fear it
ſhould be this Spirit; for then they
look upon themſelves as dead men, and
fall into an irrecoverable melancholy.
This opinion is ſo rooted in their minds,
that there is no perſwading them to the
contrary: They will tell you of matter
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47668:104"/>

opened, and the bodies found undiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
though I could not hear of the
ſucceſs of the experiment, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my diligent enquiry. But I found
the Prieſts equally credulous, not ſo
much out of deſign to keep the poor
people in awe of the Church-cenſures,
as out of weakneſs, being led away with
the ſame popular errour. The Biſhops
<note n="a" place="bottom">Thus <hi>Metrophanes,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> menaces the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Candia,</hi> unleſs they ceaſed from moleſting the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Iſland, that they ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

And this latter is inſerted in the ſentence

Oblations, but onely to ſhew the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
they bare to the memory of the
holy Apoſtles and Martyrs in this ſolemn
kind of pomp, and at the celebration
of the Holy Sacrament, at which time
they onely prayed to God, that He

Here the <hi>Greeks,</hi> out of politick ends,

onely was to be had upon theſe hard

ready to take an entire poſſeſſion of the
Empire, were forced to comply. But
upon their return home, there were
great ſtirs and tumults in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

Agreement, and the Subſcribers were
look'd upon as Betrayers of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht

againſt any attaque which might be

ſeveral Proteſtant Nobles and Divines,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47668:134"/>
who had embraced the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
at <hi>Vilna,</hi> in the year 1599.
Here ſeveral Propoſals were made about
their uniting in Spirituals, which met at
firſt with oppoſition from the ignorance
and obſtinacy of the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Biſhops
and Prieſts, and became afterwards, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſedate reflexion on things, more
inclinable to terms of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.
But they being unwilling to
determine any thing of this nature
without conſulting the Patriarchs of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there
was a ſtop put to the Debate for a time,
while Letters were diſpatch'd away
from the <hi>Evangelici</hi> about this excellent
deſign which afterward fell to the
ground, and proved abortive.</p>
            <p>It was much about this time, that
<hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> out of his great zeal to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, had publiſhed an Edict
for the preventing the farther ſpreading
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion in his Dominions,
and forbidding Strangers to enter there
without leave; and ſoon after wrote a
Letter to Patriarch <hi>Meletius,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

and ſubmit to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> This
Letter he anſwered with all due and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47668:135"/>
beſtow his Royal favour upon <hi>Cyril</hi> his

would diſguſt the King and all of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, he forbore
either to deliver or make it publick.
And here it was, in all probability,
that, reflecting upon the great hazards
which he ran during his ſtay in thoſe
parts, his heart failed him, if it be true

with undaunted reſolution and

            <p>His active way of life, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the world, gained by his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels

every-where conſpicuous, and worthy,
in the judgment of thoſe who knew him,
of the higheſt dignity of that Church;
for which he ſeemed every way fit and
proper. The Patriarchal See of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
becoming vacant, he was choſen
to ſucceed <hi>Meletius;</hi> as being a perſon
of a publick ſpirit, and of equal zeal
and learning and prudence. Here he
continued above nineteen years. The
great deference which the other <hi>Oriental</hi>

to the chief See, that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
puts them upon frequent voiages thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the affairs of their reſpective
Churches require. Here he came about
the beginning of the year 1612.<note n="a" place="bottom">This I find in a Letter written by Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>April</hi> that year.</note> In

<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with whom he had daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
said many things in favour of
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
of the minds of the People.
But he was oppoſed herein by <hi>Cyrillus,</hi>
who perceiving the deſigns of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi>
who began to grow confident of
ſucceſs, was reſolved to ſet himſelf
againſt them, and ever after deteſted
them vehemently.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed <hi>God,</hi> that during his laſt

died. At ſuch a time horrid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and diſſenſions uſually happen among
the Metropolitans and Biſhops about
the choice of a new Patriarch: of which
the <hi>Turks,</hi> greedy of mony, know how
to make a mighty advantage. For the
chief Vizir and the Baſſa's expect in ſuch
caſes, that the ſeveral Pretenders ſhould
make application to them. Without
the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s confirmation, no one
dares accept the title or exerciſe the
power of a Patriarch: nor dare the
<hi>Greeks</hi> refuſe whom they impoſe, be
the perſon otherwiſe never ſo unfit, or
the Election of another never ſo Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47668:136"/>
               <hi>Cyril</hi> had a great party among
the Biſhops, who wiſh'd that the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conduct and management of the
affairs of their Religion might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him: and therefore were very
zealous in his promotion to the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate.
To prevent which, the oppoſite
Faction made uſe of the accuſtomed evil
arts of bribing the <hi>Turks,</hi> and proffer'd
to advance conſiderably the yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
which they pay the Emperour for
the Exerciſe of their Religion, ſo <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Marmara</hi> might be the
man. Mony doing all things in <hi>Turkie,</hi>
they got him eſtabliſht Patriarch. The
new Patriarch, which is uſual, makes
uſe of the Intereſt, which he has lately
gained, with his maſters the <hi>Turks,</hi> and
proſecutes ſuch as oppoſed him, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes

the Service of their Church in their

very ſenſible what an active man <hi>Cyril</hi>
was, and with what zeal he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelf againſt their ſeveral Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Encroachments; and thence
they could not but conclude, that, now
having attained to this ſupereminent
Dignity in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, he
would vindicate the honour of his See,
and by degrees work off the <hi>Greeks</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:47668:137"/>
from thoſe Errours and Miſperſuaſions

            <p>And now began with this new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

part of his whole life, from the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs

who were ſo exaſperated againſt
him, that they were reſolved by all

Of whom I cannot forbear to ſay this
little, (for I do not pretend to write a

Negotiation: that he was a Gentleman
of excellent parts, and of great honour

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47668:138"/>
and with an agreeable ſucceſs; before

were in great diſorder, and little regard
had to the Capitulations and Privileges
accorded by the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> either to

               <hi>February</hi> 1622. The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who
bore <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a grudge for his former
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47668:139"/>
zealous oppoſition of their Deſigns, as
well as preſent, laboured openly, by
the help and aſſiſtence of the <hi>French
Ambaſſadour,</hi> to have him depoſed, in
order to their preferring <hi>Gregorius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> who had ſubmitted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and was very willing
to truckle under them. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s intimacy
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch Ambaſſadours</hi>
and thoſe under their protection, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their malice; and indeed was the
goodly pretence they made uſe of to
juſtifie their proceedings againſt him, as
one tainted with Hereſy: which forced
him in his own defence, with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of four Archbiſhops and the reſt
of the Clergy aſſembled in the great
Church, to excommunicate the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Pretender. This Eccleſiaſticall
Cenſure made them the more outragious;
and to effect their purpoſe better, they
accuſe <hi>Cyrillus</hi> to the <hi>Vizir,</hi> whom they
had gained, of a deſign of delivering up
an Iſland in the <hi>Arches</hi> to the Duke of
<hi>Florence,</hi> whoſe Gallies uſed to rove in
thoſe Seas. Whereupon he was ſeized,
depoſed, and baniſhed to <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and
the excommunicated Biſhop was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Patriarchall dignity, upon
promiſe of paying twenty thouſand
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47668:139"/>
dollers: a certain ſumm, more or leſs,
being uſually paid to the <hi>Turks,</hi> from

preferred by Bribery, in the nature of
an acknowledgment, upon every new
advancement. The <hi>Greeks</hi> upon this
grew diſcontented, and refuſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
towards the levying this ſumm;
and no ſupplies coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> as
were expected, <hi>Gregorius,</hi> after ten
weeks ſitting, was willing to give way
to <hi>Anthimus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
whom they knew to be rich, and had
prevailed upon to accept of the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He making his Covetouſneſs veil

and returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in

               <hi>September</hi> following. Whereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus,</hi>
now grown conſcious of his
Simony, and of having invaded his See,
waited upon him privately, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himſelf to him, acquainting him
with his readineſs to reſign to him, as
being the rightfull Patriarch. This ſo
alarmed the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, now
grown warm in the quarrell, as well
out of a point of honour as of bigotry,
that he ſends for <hi>Anthimus</hi> to his houſe
over the water at <hi>Pera,</hi> and what by

notwithſtanding this encouragement and
aſſurance, <hi>Anthimus</hi> being afraid of the

brought the aſſurance of a conſiderable
sum of mony, in caſe they could once
more ſecure the diſplacing of <hi>Cyril:</hi> but
the deſign taking vent, it was happily
prevented. However the cauſe was not
given over as deſperate, but new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
were carried on at <hi>Rome</hi> with
greater ſubtilty, and endeavours were
uſed to corrupt the Patriarch, and this

Fathers, the neceſſity of auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
thus drawing up a confuſed
charge of Articles againſt him, whereof
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47668:142"/>
ſome were wholly untrue, (for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
profeſſed a greater reſpect to the
ancient Councils and Fathers then he;)
that he ſent ſeveral Young men to the
Univerſities of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi>
in order to his propagating the ſame
Doctrin all the <hi>Eaſt</hi> over; and that he
diſtributed Catechiſms amongſt his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
full of the ſame Errours, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Embaſſadours.
And if that he would gain their eſteem
and favour at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſhould admit
the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, and condemn
and anathematize the Errours and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
Upon theſe propoſals of <hi>Roſſi,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
conſulted our Embaſſadour, and
was over-perſwaded by him, contrary
to his own temper, to make no reply
at the preſent. But this ſilence was
taken for a contempt and a refuſal,
which they could not brook; and
therefore in the way of revenge, they
stirred up ſome of the Biſhops, whom
they had made of their party, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him, and offered twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Dollers to fix one of them in his
place. During this hurly-burly, he
thought fit to retire, till the Jeſuiticall
intrigue was made known to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47668:142"/>
who yet would underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, till their eyes were opened
with a Preſent of ten thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> now expected to enjoy
the Peace which they had bought at ſo
dear a rate; but the event ſhewed, that
their expectations were vain and ill
grounded: for at <hi>Rome</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to give over a game as a loſt,
which they had ſome kind of hope to
retrieve by foul play. To effect this,
they thought fit to ſend an <hi>Anti-Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,</hi>
though onely with the Title of
<hi>Apoſtolicall Suffragan,</hi> and with him a
Treaſurer, with full and abſolute Power
and Authority to doe as they ſhould
think fit, and agreeable to the Intereſts
of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
this deſign, new Titular. Biſhops
of <hi>Smyrna, Naxia,</hi> and the other Iſlands,
were created. Monſignor <hi>Suffraganeo</hi>
arrives at <hi>Naxia, December</hi> 1626. where
he was complemented by the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſadour, who ſent thither his
Chaplain, titular Biſhop of that place,
and two <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> to receive him. They
brought him to <hi>Scio;</hi> where at firſt he
met with the ſame reſpect as the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have ſhewn to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47668:143"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as if the <hi>Pope</hi> had
come amongſt them and appeared in his
likeneſs. But the man ſwelling with the
thoughts of the extraordinary Power
wherewith he was intruſted, and not
able to contain himſelf, begins to lay
about him, to the great ſcandal of thoſe
of his own Communion, as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks
as others. The <hi>Greeks</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
were alarmed at this unparallel'd
boldneſs; and, ſeeing that the Liberty
of their Church was now ſtruck at and
invaded, made friends to the <hi>Vizir,</hi>
and repreſented their caſe ſo effectually,
that the <hi>Suffragan</hi> was forc'd to fly, and
the titular Biſhops, who had the ill
luck to be apprehended, were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Priſon, notwithſtanding the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of their great Patron.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church were
in a likely way of ſettlement, to the
great vexation of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who
were horribly perplext and confounded
at their late ſhamefull baffle and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
They ſeemed to acquieſce, but
it was onely till a fair opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it ſelf of renewing the onſet
with greater fury and violence. This
they wiſht for, and knew could not be
long wanting in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where there is
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47668:143"/>
ſuch frequent alteration among the chief
<hi>Miniſters,</hi> and ſuch change of humour
too, upon any freſh emergence: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a maxime of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Politicks, to
ſuſpect a Deſign in every little accident,
and take ombrage at it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
so it hapned.</p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1627. there arrived at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
upon a ſhip of <hi>London,</hi> a
certain <hi>Kaloir,</hi> called <hi>Nicodemo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxa,</hi>
born in <hi>Cephalonia;</hi> who having
learned in <hi>England,</hi> where he had lived
ſeveral years, the art of printing, had
brought with him a Preſs and Types in
order to the publiſhing of Books for the
uſe and information of the poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Greeks.</hi> The deſign was excellent
and moſt Chriſtian: but it being wholly
new, the great difficulty was, how to
get the luggage aſhore, without giving
any jealouſy to the <hi>Turks.</hi> The good
man was brought to our Embaſſadour by
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
to beg of him to own the goods,
otherwiſe in great danger to be ſeiſed.
Which accordingly he did, upon a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
application of the Patriarchs of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Geraſimus,</hi> hapning then to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, who with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47668:144"/>
the Sieur <hi>Van Haghe,</hi> came
to his Lordſhip's Palace to conſult him.
But to prevent all ſiniſter interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he thought fit to doe
it openly, having firſt given the <hi>Vizir</hi>
notice of it.</p>
            <p>There was a longer demurr about
working at the Preſs, it being very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to foreſee how liable they were to
be accuſed by the jealous Turkiſh <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes</hi>
and <hi>Imams,</hi> that is, Juſtices and
Prieſts, of printing Books againſt their
Religion. The Embaſſadour would by
no means be perſwaded by the Patriarch
to permit this to be done in his houſe,
but adviſed them to take a houſe in the
neighbourhood, promiſing them his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.
It was impoſſible that this
should eſcape the knowledge of the
<hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
who hearing that the Preſs was ſet up,
and all things ready for their work, grew
strangely diſſatisfied at it, as if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
had been chiefly to print Books
againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by
publiſhing Catechiſms and Rudiments
of Learning ſpoil the trade of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
who had ſet up a School in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and taught <hi>Greek</hi> Children <hi>gratis,</hi>
and by theſe means oftentimes made
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47668:144"/>
Proſelytes of their Parents. They firſt
tried to win <hi>Mataxa</hi> by fair means;
but this way not ſucceeding, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Heretick and <hi>Lutheran;</hi> and
ſoon after it was told him, that they had
deſigns upon his life: which put the
poor man into ſuch a fright, that he
made it his earneſt requeſt to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
that he might be permitted
to lie in his houſe, not daring to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſtay in the night in his own lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
where he worked in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
for fear of having his throat cut.
The Patriarch, to vindicate himſelf from
the aſperſions caſt upon him by the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi>
as if he had introduced new and
ſcandalous Doctrines in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, ſent a little Book to the Preſs
concerning the Faith and Doctrine of
that Church, which ſome years before
<hi>Mataxa</hi> arrived he had compoſed, and
deſigned to have ſent into <hi>England</hi> to
be printed there, and to dedicate to
King <hi>James:</hi> but now he inſcribed it
to his Son and Succeſſour, <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt, of bleſſed and glorious memory.
They look'd upon this as ſuch a bold
Defiance of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that
they were reſolved not onely to deſtroy
the Preſs, but to ſacriſice the Authour
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47668:145"/>
and Printer to their revenge. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
procured a copy of a Book written
by <hi>Cyril,</hi> and printed in <hi>England,</hi> in
defence of our B. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Divinity,</hi>
which he chiefly intended againſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and finding ſome few paſſages in
it againſt the Opinions of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
they gained a Buffone, who was
a cunning Raſcal, and in eſteem with
the <hi>Vizir,</hi> by promiſing him twenty
yards of Sattin, to acquaint him, that
<hi>Mataxa</hi> was a Souldier, and ſent to
ſtir up the <hi>Greeks</hi> to mutiny: that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of printing Books for the
uſe of Children, he had diſperſt others
of a quite different argument, and ſuch
as oppoſed the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (meaning this
little Book of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s, ſeveral copies of
which he had brought over with him:)
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour protected
him, that the Patriarch was the Authour:
and that great numbers were ſent into
<hi>Vkrain,</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Empire upon the abſence of
the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> who then deſigned
an expedition into <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vizir</hi> upon the firſt notice,
without examining whether the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were true of falſe, or ſo much as
likely, (which I intimated before to be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47668:145"/>
the raſh and heady practice of the <hi>Turks,</hi>)
ſends a Company of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> no leſs
then one hundred and fifty, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a Captain, to ſeiſe upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxa:</hi>
and this at the inſtigation of the
<hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, who contrived
that the deſigned aſſault ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
till Twelfth-day, having learned,
that our Embaſſadour had invited the
<hi>Venetian Bailo,</hi> (a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick,
but a man of a more mild and Chriſtian
temper then the <hi>French Count,</hi> and with
whom he maintained a friendly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
correſpondence, notwithſtanding
their different ſentiments in ſome few
poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of Religion, no way eſſential to
it,) the Patriarch, and ſeveral other
perſons to an entertainment. But <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxa,</hi>
very happily abſent, at <hi>Galata,</hi>
with the Embaſſadour's Secretary, in
his return to <hi>Pera,</hi> not knowing that
his houſe was beſet, paſſed unknown
through the Souldiers, being in a hat;
and though pointed at by ſome as the
man, yet others ſaying, that he belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour, he
eſcaped at laſt, and got into the Palace,
half dead with the fright he was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
The Captain miſſing his chief prey,
binds his Servants, rifles his Cheſts,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47668:146"/>
empties the Room, and carries all away
with him, as the goods of a Traitour,
to the value of ſeven thouſand Dollers.
The Patriarch lying under the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Crime ſo capital, and fearing
the ſad effects of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> fury upon the
firſt impreſſions, before the fit is over,
durſt not go home to his own houſe that
night. The next day the Book was
examined, and the particular place,
in which was the ſuppoſed Blaſphemy
againſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> interpreted by two
<hi>Greek Renegado's,</hi> in the preſence of the
<hi>Vizir</hi> and ſeveral Churchmen: but no
great matter upon their examination
could be made of it. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> himſelf,
relying upon his innocency, appearing
the ſame day, againſt whom ſeveral
crimes were objected, but without the
leaſt proof. The day following, the
Embaſſadour thought fit to demand
audience of the <hi>Vizir,</hi> to expoſtulate
the caſe with him, and to ſatisfy him in
ſeveral particulars relating to <hi>Mataxa,</hi>
which he did with an admirable ſucceſs;
the <hi>Vizir</hi> confeſſing with ſhame, that
he had been over-credulous, wondring
at the impudence of thoſe, who had
abuſed him by falſe informations, and
promiſing to ſee reſtored all the goods
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47668:146"/>
which had been taken away three days
before in that great hurry. And to
wipe off the prejudice out of the minds
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prieſts, he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it
and condeſcended to go ſoon after to
the <hi>Mufti</hi> to ſatiſfy him alſo.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe heinous provocations,
the Embaſſadour and the Patriarch were
ſo juſtly offended, (the Embaſſadour,
for that they endeavoured to ruine his
reputation in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court, and
had ſpoken not onely reproachfully of
him, which he generouſly ſlighted, but
of the King his Maſter, whom <hi>Roſſi,</hi> in
a diſcourſe with the Patriarch the day
after the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſeiz'd upon the Preſs,
had called the Head of the Hereticks;
the Patriarch, for that they conſpired
againſt his life,) that they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſhew their reſentments upon the
Authours and Contrivers of the Plot;
and prevailed ſo far, notwithſtanding
the reiterated inſtances of the <hi>French</hi>
Embaſſadour, as to have <hi>Cannachio Roſſi</hi>
and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> thrown into priſon.
The <hi>Turks</hi> deſigned to ſtrangle them, as
having contravened the Laws of their
Government; but at the interceſſion of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour chiefly, they
forbore to execute this bloudy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47668:147"/>
and baniſht them and the reſt of
their Order the dominions of the <hi>Grand
Signor,</hi> as diſturbers of the publick
peace.</p>
            <p>Soon after, Sir <hi>Thomas Row</hi> leaves
<hi>Turkey,</hi> ſucceeded by Sir <hi>Peter Wych,</hi>
a Gentleman of great worth and rare
accompliſhments, and every way fit
and qualified for that weighty and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Employment: who, following the
example of his Predeceſſour, took the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church into his Protection, and
had a particular value and eſteem for <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril:</hi>
But not having had the happineſs
hitherto to meet with any account of his
Embaſſy under his own hand relating
to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I ſhall out of others give
a brief Relation of the Troubles which
befell the good Patriarch, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his death.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">V. Hotting. pag. 558.</note> For ſome few years after this
blow given his enemies, <hi>Cyril</hi> was at
quiet, but far from being ſecure. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
were then carrying on in the dark,
and the diſcontented <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops were
made uſe of in order to his Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and particularly <hi>Joaſaph</hi> Archbiſhop
of <hi>Philippopoli,</hi> who ſtruck at him, but
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47668:147"/>
miſs'd his blow, the other keeping his
ground. They grow furious and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
hereupon, and knowing what
were the moſt effectual arguments with
<hi>Turks,</hi> they offer twenty thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
in favour of <hi>Iſaac</hi> Metropolite of
<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who had eſpouſed the <hi>Roman</hi>
Intereſt, and was in great vogue and
reputation among them. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
having had one of his Pages
kill'd in his preſence in his Seraglio at
<hi>Beſhiktaſh,</hi> (a place about four miles
from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> upon the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi>)
being much troubled at the ſad accident,
and looking upon it as ominous, and
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were friends of <hi>Cyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
lamenting the ſad miſfortunes they
were likely to fall under by the loſs of
him, refuſed at laſt to give his conſent
for his Removall. In the mean while
his Exchequer was not to ſuffer, and if
they would continue the old Patriarch,
the ſame ſumm was to be paid in, which
was profered to make a new one.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadour <hi>Cornelius
Van Haghe,</hi> having obtain'd a copy of
the Confeſſion of Faith in <hi>Latin,</hi> which
he had begun to print in <hi>Greek</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
at the time the Preſs was
broke, ſent it into <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47668:148"/>
was firſt printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> about the
end of the year 1630. This alarm'd
them at <hi>Rome,</hi> as much as if an Army
had been on their march towards that
City. At firſt it was look'd upon as a
thing feign'd, becauſe onely writ in
<hi>Latin;</hi> and it was given out, that the
Patriarch's name was onely made uſe of
for a blind: but however an anſwer
was publiſhed by one of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
a <hi>Candiot, Joannes Matthaeus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryophilus,</hi>
bred up in the <hi>Gregorian</hi>
College at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Titular Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Iconium;</hi> and printed at <hi>Rome</hi>
1631. under the Title of <hi>Cenſura Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionis
Fidei, ſeu potiùs Perfidiae Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianae,
quae nomine</hi> Cyrilli <hi>Patriarchae</hi>
Conſtantinopolitani <hi>circumferatur:</hi>
which was alſo put into <hi>Greek</hi> by the
ſame hand, and dedicated to <hi>Vrban</hi> the
Eighth, and printed at <hi>Rome</hi> 1632. by
the Printers of the Sacred Congregation,
as they ſpeak, <hi>de propaganda fide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Cyrillus</hi> thought fit to
tranſlate this Confeſſion, which had
made ſo great a noiſe in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
word for word into <hi>Greek,</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
addition of four Queſtions and
Anſwers: which was done in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1631.
though not printed till 1633. at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:47668:148"/>
It was now no longer a queſtion or
doubt, who was the Authour. He
himſelf own'd it in all companies, when
he was conſulted about it: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the artifices and violence
uſed upon him, he would never be
brought to deny or diſſemble the thing,
or retract his judgment. Which will
more fully appear from the following
Memoire, which I have copied out
of a Letter written by the Sieur <hi>Van
Haghe,</hi> Embaſſadour of the States of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople, Jan.</hi> 17.
1632. wherein he ſays that <hi>Cyril</hi> viſiting
the new <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, the Count
<hi>de Marcheville,</hi> was received very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully,
the Embaſſadour giving him
the Title, which was then newly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the Cardinals, of <hi>Eminentiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
Signore.</hi> After dinner, the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
ſhew'd him his Confeſſion, which
the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> had
ſent him, by order of the Pope, with
expreſs order to demand of him, if he
had made it, and if he would perſiſt in
it. The Patriarch, after he had taken
up the Book in his hand, and look'd
carefully upon it, repli'd, That truly it
was his Confeſſion: but before they
demanded, whether he would perſiſt
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47668:149"/>
in it, they ought firſt to ſhew and
convince him by the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had erred: that it was more then
five hundred years, ſince the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church had been entirely ſeparated
from the <hi>Roman;</hi> and that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with the Pope, and was no
way obliged to render an account of his
Faith to him, or to any who depend
upon him: adding further, that he had
more then a hundred Metropolitans and
Biſhops, beſides a great number of
other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, under his
Juriſdiction, to whom, if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
he would be always ready to give
ſatisfaction in a general Synod of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church, referring all to the Word
of <hi>God,</hi> and the ancient Fathers of the
Primitive Church. To this juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
the Embaſſadour made no other
anſwer but this, That at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in
<hi>France</hi> they held his <hi>Eminence</hi> for a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt;</hi>
which Sect was much hated by
the King his Maſter: and I wiſh, ſaid
he, that your Eminence were a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi>
as the King is, whoſe favour
and liberality might be gain'd this way.
The Patriarch repli'd in theſe few words:
In the affairs of my Belief, and eternal
Salvation, I ſhall neither follow the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47668:149"/>
King of <hi>France,</hi> nor any perſon in the
world whatſoever; and I ſhall never
doe any thing otherwiſe then what my
Conſcience directs me. Here the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
ended; the Patriarch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
taking his leave of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
having given him thanks for his
kind and noble entertainment: but to
prevent all miſreports that might paſs
upon the account of this Viſit, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his friends with the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of it.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt in the leaſt, but that
this ſtout and honeſt Profeſſion, which
<hi>Cyrillus</hi> made before the <hi>French</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour,
in which he continued to the
laſt minute of his life, will, in the eſteem
of all indifferent perſons, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not perverted either by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
or paſſion, fully vindicate him
from all thoſe unjuſt, and malicious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations,
wherewith he is charged by
his enemies, whom his zeal and love
for Truth had provoked beyond all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of reſpect and Chriſtian charity, to
an irreconcileable hatred of his perſon.
What artifices were uſed by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
to gain him, and make him theirs,

to expoſe himſelf without any concern

onely that he might preſerve the

carrying him on board a Veſſel lying at
<hi>Santo Stephano,</hi> a ſmall Port upon the
<hi>Propontis,</hi> a little below the <hi>Seven
Towers,</hi> in order to his tranſportation.
But as ſoon as they had launched forth,
he perceiving their deſign to murther
him, fell upon his knees and prayed
with great fervency and earneſtneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
himſelf for death. After ſome
revilings and buffettings, they did not
long delay to put the fatal ſtring about
his Neck, and ſoon diſpatcht him.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47668:157"/>
Having done the bloudy work, they
stript him and threw his naked Body
into the Sea: which was afterward ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by Fiſhermen, and by ſome of
his Friends buried upon the Shore, where
it had lain expoſed for ſome time. But
it ſoon appeared, that the malice of his
enemies was not yet ſatisfied: for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
him the honour of a Grave, they
addreſt to the <hi>Caimacam;</hi> and got an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from him to have his Body dug up,
and thrown into the Sea again: and it
was done accordingly. But the Body
was afterwards recovered, and buried
obſcurely in one of the Islands, that lie
over againſt the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi>
Thus fell this great man <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris</hi>
by the hands of violence, whom both
for his Piety and Sufferings, which were
wholly upon the account of Religion,
I ſhall not be afraid, having juſt reaſon
so to doe, notwithſtanding the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
