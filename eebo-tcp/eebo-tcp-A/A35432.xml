            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Is more then Magick, and does plainly tell</l>
               <l>Coffee's extraction has its heats from Hell.</l>
               <l>Pure English Apes! ye may, for ought I know,</l>
               <l>Would it but mode, learn to eat Spiders too.</l>
               <l>Should any of your Grandsires Ghosts appear</l>
               <l>In your Wax-Candle-Circles, and but hear</l>
               <l>The name of Coffee so much call'd upon,</l>
               <l>Then see it drank like scalding <hi>Phlegeton;</hi>

               <l>The merriest Ghost of all your Sires would say,</l>
               <l>Your Wine's much worse since his last yesterday:</l>

               <l>These sons of nothing, that can hardly make</l>
               <l>Their Broth, for laughing how the Jest does take;</l>
               <l>Yet grin, and give ye for the Vine's pure Blood,</l>
               <l>A loathsome Potion, not yet understood,</l>

               <l>Would know its Vertue, may go look't in Prose,</l>
               <l>For 't cannot stand in Verse, (though 't lye in Print)</l>
               <l>Because there's neither Rime nor Reason in 't.</l>
               <l>Yet I have heard a grave Grand-Signior tell,</l>
               <l>Coffee does dull and yawning Sleeps expel.</l>
               <l>Why Frenzie, Fevers, or the Poor Mans Gout,</l>
               <l>Will do this feat as well, and that without</l>
               <l>A God-a-mercy; nay, 'twill make 'em do</l>

               <l>Though in the power of this Turkish Spell</l>
               <l>I'm faithless as a Jew or Infidel,</l>
               <l>Yet I believe I eas'ly might confess</l>
               <l>Coffee potential in such Cures as these.</l>
               <l>First, (for example) are there 'mongst ye some</l>
               <l>Have soundly had the <hi>Morbum Gallicum?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Let 'em drink Coffee, and from Whores abstain,</l>
               <l>I'll pawn my Pen they're Pocky well again.</l>
               <l>From <hi>Venus</hi> Racks, let's fall to <hi>Bacchus</hi> Stocks:</l>
               <l>Are ye dead drunk? ha' ye caught a catching Fox?</l>
               <l>Take me then Coffee, drink it scalding hot,</l>
               <l>(For though it scalds, yet know, it burneth not)</l>
               <l>Sleep upon't soundly; when you re-awake,</l>
               <l>Y'are a lives man again, I'll undertake.</l>
               <l>Is any of your sober Signiors ta'en</l>
               <l>With Maggot-Meagroms, or the Worm i'th' Brain?</l>
               <l>(For though such Worms in Ages heretofore</l>
               <l>Sought their forc'd fortunes at mens Postern Door;</l>
               <l>Yet as the Moon and humane Humours change,</l>
               <l>They alter too, and now through th' head do range.)</l>
               <l>If any be thus craz'd, and by the Rimples</l>
               <l>About his Nose, you fear he'll fall i' th' Simples,</l>
               <l>Well worm him first, and take a special heed</l>
               <l>No spawn remain of the sly Serpents seed;</l>
               <l>Then to the Mistress of the great <hi>Mogul</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Let him carouse a Coffee-Kettle full,</l>
               <l>And rise a wonder of the Turkey-shore,</l>
               <l>As wise and well as ere he was before.</l>
               <l>Such cures can Coffee work. I could afford</l>
               <l>Ye many more; but <hi>to the wise a word.</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now Stew'd Prewen-mongers, and all you</l>
               <l>Drink-dablers, that have so long kept ado</l>
               <l>With <hi>China-Ale, Stupone, Virgin-Wine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>

               <l>Devices more, all to no purpose, know,</l>
               <l>Ye ha'nt the way; these are all things that grow</l>
               <l>Here, here at home, when as a forraign Fart,</l>
               <l>Mixt and miscall'd according unto Art,</l>
               <l>Sells quick as the new Perukes now adays,</l>

               <l>Or let some Jew derive its stock and stem</l>
               <l>At least as far as from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That so it be'nt smelt out; let him but frame</l>
               <l>Ought but to call't out of it's Christian Name;</l>
               <l>Poste up its Vertues ev'ry where in good</l>
               <l>Strange Hebrew-English, which not understood</l>
               <l>Makes much the better; there lies all the knack,</l>
               <l>The Jest's pure Hogo, and the Conceit's smack:</l>
               <l>For in this Age, nothing's cry'd up for good,</l>
               <l>Save what's stark naught, or what's not understood.</l>
               <l>So that, I fear, these very Rules may run</l>
               <l>I' th' compass of some commendation.</l>
               <l>But to the scope: There must be got mad Boys</l>
               <l>For your first setters, or as't were Decoys,</l>
               <l>I' intice the Novists, till they've made a Rode</l>
               <l>Unto your Door, and your Knack 'gins to mode;</l>
               <l>When you'll, I fear, be forced to have wait</l>
               <l>Some tall-gown'd-Porter at your thronged Gate</l>
               <l>To make distinction of your Guests, lest none</l>
               <l>Enter but friends, and men of fashion;</l>
               <l>And this will take the Youngsters so, you'll see</l>
               <l>A Leaguer dayly at your Door will be;</l>
               <l>You'll be besieg'd with Money and good Words</l>
               <l>For the rare Juyce that your Back-sides affords;</l>
               <l>Ye shall make Coffee stink. In short, be all</l>
               <l>Made men at length, for to make men withal.</l>
               <l>'T shall ne'er be said, a Turdy Turk could do</l>
               <l>More with a meer Sirreverence then you.</l>
