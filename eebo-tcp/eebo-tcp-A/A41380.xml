            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T pleaſed the high Court of Parliament to accept a Petition, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the Summer Iſlands, and to recommit it unto your ſelves,
for examination, your care and readineſſe in attending that truſt,
was very eminent, onely you met with obſtructions, partly from
the Company who are concerned in the Petition, partly from the
ſad breach between City and Armies emergent in that nick of time,
and ſince, by the neceſſitated abſence of Captaine <hi>Sayle,</hi> and my ſelfe, whoſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
was requiſite. In purſuance thereof, Honourable Sirs, I beſeech you reſume the
Complaints which are before you, That your Petitioners may not languiſh under an
uſurped power; nor the power and honour of Parliament be trampled on, by the vileſt
of our Engliſh Nation. Sirs, to ſet this wheele on motion, I have preſumed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the copy of the Petition, and papers affixed, as preſented unto the High Court of
Parliament. As alſo ſome few Acts and Lawes, made by governours Councell and
Aſſembly with us; with ſome Animadverſions upon them for your better information,
leaving it to the wiſdome and juſtice of Parliament to judge thereof. Sirs, I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this courſe, not with deſire to aſperſe the Honourable Company, the Nobility and
Gentry of that Court, from whom we have alwayes found helpe, when their leaſure
would permit their preſence at the Court; but to diſcover the practice of the trading-party,
who hold the people in bondage, and ſtudy to vex thoſe, who plead for liberty.
Beſides, Sirs, Thoſe of the Company concerned in the Petition, will be ready to give
out, that your Petitioners durſt not owne their act, and therefore withdrew, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
the proſecution thereof; whereas the world ſhall know, that was not the reaſon;
But the attendance upon places, care of our families, a good providence opening a way
for our returne; with our great expence, under long delayes, were the true cauſes of
it. Sirs, Mr. <hi>Steele,</hi> who is of Councell hath the copy of papers at large, if you deſire
further ſatisfaction then what is Printed. The wiſe God make you as Angels to judge
righteouſly, and as Gods to relieve the oppreſſed.</p>

OR,
The Preface to the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y purpoſe is not to compile a Hiſtory, nor to enter upon a
diſtinct Narration of all tranſ-actions with us: (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that will be performed by a better hand) but onely to
give a briefe aſſay of things, that the Honourable Court
of Parliament, with others, may clearly perceive, wee
have not complained without a cauſe. I ſhall briefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a few things to cleare a way to the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Reader is deſired to take notice,</p>
            <p>1. That the Iſland called <hi>Summer Iſlands</hi> (alias <hi>Bermuda)</hi> is governed
by a Company of Merchant Adventurers of <hi>London,</hi> who hold their power by
Patent from King <hi>James,</hi> who keep Courts, make Lawes, and reverſe them at
pleaſure, choſe Deputy governours, Magiſtrates, and Commanders over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
there, all which, depend for direction in their reſpective places, upon the
Company of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That though there be many noble Lords, and worthy Gentlemen of that
Company, yet are they ſtrangers (for the most part) how things are carried in the
<hi>Bermuda</hi> Court; for their more weighty imployments, take them off from ſo low
and inconſiderable affaires. The Court is upheld by a Deputy, and a few aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
many of whom being of the trading party, wait upon the quarterly
Courts, to conſult what may tend to their advantage, and the government of the
Iſland in ſubordination to that end.</p>
            <p>3. That the pretence of the preſent difference in the Iſlands, is about a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
gathered there into Goſpel-fellowſhip; the beginning whereof, and by what
authority gathered; the manner of its proceeding, with the oppoſitions it met with
in its infancy; is faithfully reported by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> Paſtor of that Congregation,
in his anſwer to a ſcandalous paper, ſent from the Iſland, and Printed under the
Patronage of Mr. <hi>Prynn;</hi> all which I ſhall paſſe over to prevent tediouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>4. That through the indulgence of the High Court of Parliament, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Committee for the <hi>American</hi> plantations, the Congregation in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Iſlands</hi> is indempnified in matters of Gods worſhip by their orders.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall give a briefe account of the proceed of things,
occaſioned ſince the Company of <hi>London</hi> choſe Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of theſe Iſlands.</p>

their Governour in <hi>Summer Iſlands</hi> (how regularly they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

that he being an honeſt and diſ-ingaged perſon, and now cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with authority, might the better heale the diſtempers of the
Iſland, who arriving at the Iſland, ſoon diſcovered his purpoſe and

their complaints, and put them into a way of ſecurity and peace: The complaints were
read and committed to examination, but no report made after five months atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
At length it pleaſed the Lords, and many Gentry to be preſent at Court, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to heare, and iſſue matters: But the trading aſſiſtants (with their friends) perceiving
this buſineſſe would be now called upon, left the Court, in whoſe abſence (though
thirty or forty ſtill remained) yet according to their orders, requiring ſeven Aſſiſtants
at leaſt, with the Governour or his Deputy, there was not that number to make a
Court, which loſt us that opportunity, and clearly taught us what to truſt too; upon
which, Captaine <hi>Sayle</hi> and <hi>William Golding</hi> beſought the Parliament. The Copy of
whoſe Petition was as followeth:</p>
            <p>To the Honourable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes aſſembled in Parliament;</p>

                        <p>HAving received divers Petitions from ſeverall of the Inhabitants of theſe Iſlands,
thereby craving a free trade for Tobacco, and to have priviledge to tranſport the
ſame at their own pleaſures, not weighing nor regarding the priviledge and royalty
of the Honourable Company, after long diſpute, and ſerious debate, and well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how far forth we can in juſtice anſwer your expectations in this particular; and
moreover well regarding his Majeſties Letters Patent, granted to the Honourable
Company, we for your better ſatisfaction, have thought good to affixe that branch
or clauſe, whereby we are abſolutly prohibited, and debarred of this priviledge; and as
we are all nearly concerned in the premiſes as you are, ſo we do hereby declare, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
promiſe, that if it were in our power to grant, or lawfull for us to do, &amp;c.
we ſhould be no ways wanting, and dilatory to advance our own priviledge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,

held, and ſet upon the goods ſent hither from the Honourable Company, and that

skill and indeavour, by enforming the Honourable Company, as well on your, as
our own behalfe: to have ſuch things reformed, as are neither for their honour, nor
for our profits: not doubting of reliefe therein, when we ſhall, with all candor and

1. The Inhabitants have beene denyed the liberty of their perſons.<note place="margin">Illuſt.</note> In a letter from
the Company to Captaine <hi>Sayle,</hi> then Sheriffe 1638. or thereabout, under the hands
of eleven of the Company, there is this ſtreight command, We charge you from his
Majeſtie upon like paines <hi>viz.</hi> (his head) neither to depart your ſelfe, nor to permit
or ſuffer any other to be ſhipped, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this Order from the Company; 1. The Inhabitans of the <hi>Summer-Iſlands,</hi>
had ſent forth a Colony to inhabit St. <hi>Lucea</hi> (one of the <hi>Caribee</hi> Iſlands) and
many moe ſtraitned for want of land and liberties, intended to have tranſplanted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57140:5"/>
and had been at charge to make proviſion aforehand, by ſending a ſmall Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and ſervants thither; but upon this ſtreight command were reſtrained, and the
Colony ſent forth, for want of timely ſupply and ayd, were cut off by the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Indians; and many by this meanes damnified in their eſtates and lives. The
trading party of that Company foreſaw that they would ſoone want Tenants and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
if a way were opened to the inhabitants of <hi>Summer-Iſlands</hi> of more freedome
and inlarged ſubſiſtence. Alſo in the government of Captaine <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> a new oath
was deviſed, every one was to bring forth his Tobacco, and to ſweare there was all that
they had made, and becauſe Mr. <hi>Painter,</hi> Magiſtrate, refuſed to take that oath, and
M. <hi>Stirk</hi> Miniſter, drawing up a modeſt Petition to the Governour for the non-impoſing
of it to the prejudice of the Subjects liberties, both were baniſhed the Iſland; &amp; though
the Company of <hi>London,</hi> did not allow the ſentence of baniſhment, yet they did make no
manner of reparation unto M. <hi>Painter</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Stirke</hi> upon thoſe who had ſo cenſured them.
<hi>Wil. Righton</hi> is at this preſent under the ſentence of baniſhment by Captaine <hi>Turner</hi>
the now Deputy governour, becauſe he refuſed to have his children baptized by Mr.
<hi>Vyner,</hi> though the ſaid <hi>Righton,</hi> belongs not to any of thoſe tribes to whom M. <hi>Vyner</hi> was
ſent to take charge of, <hi>An. 1647.</hi> by the now governour a councell of War was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and one <hi>Feadle</hi> was judged (without any other tryall) to be tyed to the Gallowes,
for words (as it is ſaid) he ſhould ſpeake concerning the Governour tending to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teny;
Mr. <hi>Painter</hi> Magiſtrate, firſt wronged, and after railed upon, by one <hi>Edwards</hi> of the
Company in an open letter ſent to <hi>Summer-Iſlands,</hi> Mr. <hi>Painter</hi> for returning this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> the Oyle-man hath done me much wrong, the Lord reward him
according to his deeds; was judged by the Company to ſuffer corporall paines, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
puniſhment. In the government of Captaine <hi>Tucker,</hi> a ſilly boy, whoſe
name was <hi>Deane,</hi> for ſtealing a piece of cheeſe, was condemned to dye, and executed.</p>
            <p>2. The Inhabitants may not diſpoſe their proper goods.<note place="margin">Illuſt.</note> Inſtance in Tobacco (the
onely ſtaple commodity and means of ſupport to the Inhabitants) which the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtraightly forbids to be diſpoſed of, otherwiſe then to their Magazeen ſhip, witneſſe
their knowne practice, and [frequent orders in their letters to their Governours and
Officers; one of their letters hath it thus, The Governour &amp; Sheriffe, are to be required
(as formerly) not to permit any trade at all, either with natives or ſtrangers, nor any
Ship or Veſſell to come and remaine there longer then the ſpace of—dayes,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> hath the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of ſeverall of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> and that
onely to take in water and proviſion to ſupply them in caſe of neceſſity and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Alſo in another Letter of the Company, they expreſly forbid the Iſland to trade
upon any tearmes with <hi>New England,</hi> who at that time wanted cattell, which we could
ſpare, and they had ſuch commodities as we wanted; but neither they, nor we might
enjoy the liberty of mutuall commerce, ſurely this ſavours of want of bowells towards
them, and envy to the good of our poore Colony. Witneſſe the Company approving
under ten of their hands, their Sheriffes act in ceaſing the Tobacco traded for by a
Dutchman, 1636. for ſuch power the Company gives to the Mr. of the Magazeen ſhip,
requiring the Governour and Sheriffe to be aſſiſtant to them; likewiſe Captaine <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Dennis</hi> by Commiſſion from the Company, <hi>An. 1643.</hi> ceaſed ſome three or foure
thouſand of Tobacco, traded for by a Merchant of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> ſhip, with the Inhabitants
for ſhoos, ſtockings, lockram (commodities which the Inhabitants wanted to cover their
nakedneſſe, and the Magazeen ſhip brought not that yeare, whoſe loading (except that
which ſhe left by the way at <hi>Barbadus,</hi> was chiefly ſalt and <hi>Madera</hi> wine) and though
offer was made by the Merchant to pay penny <hi>per</hi> pound which the Company claims as
their due, yet unleſſe three halfpence for fraught was added, <hi>Dennis</hi> would not ſuffer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57140:5"/>
him to carry away the Tobacco but poſſeſt himſelfe of it as forfeited to the Company,<note place="margin">See anſw. of Comp. to Mr. <hi>Copl.</hi> Mr. <hi>Steel.</hi>
               </note>
this practice had almoſt put the Iſland into a muteny, who hereby enraged, threatned
Captain <hi>Dennis</hi> ſhip; but by the wiſdome and vigilancy of Cap <hi>Sayl</hi> our Governour, the
people were appeaſed; yea the deſire of trade from M. <hi>Copeland</hi> Miniſter, in a letter to the
Company, hath muteny in it, ſo the Court judged in their anſwer to his witneſſe;
Captaine <hi>Turners</hi> words at his firſt comming, who proteſted in the hearing of many,
that if any Inhabitant ſhould refuſe to ſend their Tobacco, home in the Magazeen ſhip,
he would ſeize on the Tobacco, and impriſon their perſons; at this preſent yeare 1647.
he commanded his counſell to take notice what Tobacco every man had, and returne
the names of ſuch as ſhould refuſe to ſend it home in the Magazeen ſhip. Inſtance
in other goods, <hi>Anno 1636.</hi> or thereabout. At a full and honourable Court, liberty
was granted unto the Inhabitants to build a Pinace or two, to trade with the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for ſuch commodities as they had (excepting Tobacco) the yeare following (when
ſome of the Inhabitants to their great coſt and hazzard had prepared a veſſell for that
purpoſe) the Company or part of them, ſent expreſſe command, 1 That no perſon ſhould
be tranſplanted, as above, 2. no live cattle, 3. no proviſion (but upon limited conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
incompatible with merchandizing, ſhould be ſent away. 'Tis as though they had
ſaid, you ſhall build a veſſell (if you will) to looke upon, and undoe your ſelves, but
ſhall have no encouragement to employ her. That it was thus ordered by the <hi>Bermuda</hi>
Court, their orders in Mr. <hi>Steels</hi> hand can witneſſe.</p>
            <p>The deniall of this freedome of a Pinace once granted, and before revoked, built,
was probably the occaſion of the loſſe of <hi>Lucea,</hi> the lives of many there, and hopes of
that plantation, and therein, that addition of honour and revenue to the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for the Colony ſent forth thither from <hi>Summer-Iſlands,</hi> engaged their undertakers
to ſupply them with men, and other neceſſaries, which was that chiefe cauſe of building
that Pinace, which (before finiſhed) might not be imployed to helpe the Iſland, or
them at <hi>Lucea.</hi> After this, ſome of the Inhabitants, craving the concurrence of ſome
of the Company of <hi>London,</hi> bought a ſhip, and furniſhed her with a Cargoe of goods,
ſit for the plantation of <hi>Summer-Iſlands,</hi> which when the Company underſtood, they
made a ſtrict order, forbidding the ſhip (now ready to ſet ſayle) to come at that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
till firſt their Magazeen ſhip had been there; the Traders feared ſhe would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up the Dollards which the Spaniards left there the yeare before, and marre their
Market, the hindring this Ships comming to <hi>Bermuda,</hi> was a great prejudice to that
Country, and the undoing of many owners there; for miſſing that opportunity the ſhip
was loſt to them both in hopes and principall. Inſtance in Oringes and Lemons,
with which the Country abounds, and moſt periſh for want of uſe; even theſe may not
be diſpoſed of, untill the <hi>London</hi> Ship (which uſually comes out of ſeaſon) be firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor may the Inhabitants diſpoſe of their owne Cedar, but by order from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
nor any of the Inhabitants have wine, or ſtrong-waters ſent them but by order
of their Court.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the Companies cenſure of Mr. <hi>Painter</hi> to pay 40 li. Ster. unto Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
oyleman (beſides corporall and exemplary puniſhment) for writing to Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
as before; yea the Court have ordered that planters in the Iſland might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
of buying ſhares, deſiring rather to keep them racked Tennants, and perpetuall
ſervants,
and yet the Inhabitants who are free of the Company have no more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Iſland, then the moſt wretched Tennant. Thus the trading party ſerve
themſelves of all the profits, which that poore Iſland, with the induſtry of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
produceth. The orders of the Company in the hand of Maſter <hi>Steele</hi> can
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57140:6"/>
witneſſe, I have not wronged them in the premiſes.</p>
            <p>3. To the third Complaint, Impoſt upon Tobacco, formerly three halfpence, ſince
one penny <hi>per</hi> pound, this yeares 1647. three halfpence. Firſt, this Impoſt was never
granted by the conſent of the Inhabitants, that I can gather. Secondly, proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
by divers of the Company. Thirdly, and why may it not be lawfull (if the
trading party will vote it) to take <hi>2d. per</hi> pound impoſt, yea the whole bulke of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco;
yea our beds, lands, ſervants, children; truly, they and their now Governour are
agreed to take all, as you ſhall heare afterwards. The ends pretended, not regarded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Commanders in the Iſland, not ſupplyed with that number of ſervants,
which the booke of Orders, and the Companies Law allow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but two Miniſters, who have ſalleries paid them, to wit, 40 li. <hi>per
annum,</hi> when yet there are nine publicke Churches (beſides the chappell) to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the congregation, with the Paſtor and Teacher, are compelled to pay Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt
out of their Tobacco towards the maintenance of the univerſall Miniſters ſent by
the Company, when yet they attend not their Miniſtery, nor were they ſent to the moſt
of them, nor hath the Paſtor or Teacher the leaſt allowance from the Company: truly
the ſinging men and Porters under <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the time of the Babylonian captivity
found better uſage; for it was decreed concerning them, that it ſhould not be lawfull
to impoſe tol, tribute, or cuſtome upon them <hi>Ezra 7. 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, no conſiderable quantity of Ammunition and Armes, to ſecure ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Garriſon. And all the uſe the Ammunition ſerveth to (for preſent) is to keep
in awe the Independents; for when Captaine <hi>Sayle</hi> was in the Harbour, with a ſmall
ſhip, with ſome twenty men Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> kept a guard, pretending feares, but
when a Spaniſh ſhip was wrackt, and a hundred of Souldiers, &amp; Sea-men came a ſhoar;
and moſt of the Inhabitants of ability gone aboard,<note n="*" place="margin">But diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt the guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pretence of fear was removed.</note> no appearance of a guard. Captaine
<hi>Turner</hi> had another game in chaſe, the nine Hogs-heads of corne paid him by the
Country for the former guard, is a trifle to what he rakes now from the Spaniards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard of juſtice or civility.</p>
            <p>5. Debts not paid by the Company, no ſatisfying account given the Country.
The Company had in ſtocke about <hi>Anno 1637.</hi> eleven hundred pound Sterlin, were
in debt <hi>Anno 1647.</hi> eighteen hundred pound have had yearlly for impoſt upon the
Tobacco, three hundred, foure hundred, it may be five hundred pound Sterlin; wee
know of little in compariſon laid out for the good of the Countrey, or honour of the
Company, and yet a new taxe is levyed with pretence to pay debts: The Company
will never be out of debt, whiles they know to pay themſelves out of the Tobacco of
the Country. Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> when his time of government was expired, comming
to <hi>London,</hi> ſued the Company, and recovered damage, the which was levyed upon the
ſhares, even theirs who had done no wrong. In <hi>Anno 1635.</hi> or thereabouts; the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Company bought the Plantors Tobacco, and agreed for a price; but the
price of Tobacco falling, they turned it upon the Plantors, to their exceeding
damage.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, exceſſive fraught, to wit, three halfpence <hi>per</hi> pound; firſt, the Tobacco
for the ſeven or eight yeares have ſeldome yeelded more to the Plantors in the
Iſland, Secondly, other Plantations, <hi>viz. Virginia, Chriſtophers, &amp;c.</hi> who trade with
what ſhips they will, pay not above penny <hi>per</hi> pound, and yet the diſtance between them
and <hi>England</hi> is greater. Exceſſive rates ſet on Merchants goods. This the paper affixed
to the Petition witneſſeth, as the ſenſe of the Inhabitants, yea of the Aſſembly, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57140:6"/>
choice friends of the trading party: nor will men wonder, who conſider the ſtate of
the Inhabitants who muſt trade with no ſhips but the Company, and muſt have their
goods, or goe naked, and at their prices, and the Company ſhip their Tobacco, or it
muſt periſh, and at their price too, not allowing in goods for Tobacco above two
pence <hi>per</hi> pound, which at firſt penny amounts not to above one penny <hi>per</hi> pound; yet
I muſt not wrong the trading Company, for <hi>Anno 1647.</hi> they ſent little or no goods
to ſupply the Countrey, their Cargo and Purſer ſtayed at <hi>Barbadus,</hi> where is better
trading, and ſent the ſhip to make a fraught out of the Countries Tobacco.</p>
            <p>The truth is, had not providence put the inhabitants into a way of weaving Cotten,
which they buy for Porke, Beefe, and Fiſh, of one ſhip or other (upon hard tearmes)
trading between them and <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Inhabitants had long ſince turned Adamites
out of neceſſity. I have heard ſome paſſionately profeſſe that if the Company would
take care to feed and cloath them and theirs, they ſhould bore their eares, and
they would be their ſervants for ever: and now let the world judge what Maſters they
ſerve. I could adde much more, and tell the world, of particular wrongs, offered by
ſome members of that Company, to the poore Plantors here, but I ſpare them, as
not the miſcarriage of the body, with whom I have to deale, and not with the body
neither, but with the feet and toes of it.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to reflect on the government in the Iſland,<note place="margin">Qu. 47. A crooked barke fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brought a private letter, and had 5 l. allowed. 1. Branch of the fifth gen. head.</note> as it lyes in order in the
Petition, confining my ſelfe to the time ſince Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> was ſent over by the
trading party, who being one of them, acts their principles, and from beginning told us
of private inſtructions, under which (its like) we have ſuffered much, though not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that plea, but by an aſſumed power, and a high hand. I ſhall branch the fifth head
into particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> refuſed to take his oath at his enſtalment, which other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
never did, this will be witneſſed by men of fidelity; if he hath ſince taken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his counſell in a clandeſtine manner, it is unknowne to us, and I ſuppoſe (if done
at all) it was neare two yeares after he tooke his place. I meane not the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
Allegeance, or Covenant, but that proper to the Deputy-governour of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Iſlands.</hi>
His excuſe was, he tooke it in <hi>England,</hi> but that was denyed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
and Secretary of that Company in open Court.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Bran. 2.</note> calls an aſſembly, pretending the Company ſo ordered it; but that alſo
was denyed, and the lawes of the Company ſay, the ſecond yeare it may be lawfull for
the Governour to call an Aſſembly, he within twenty dayes. 'Tis probable this plot
was laid at <hi>Barbadus,</hi> where Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> meeting with Captaine <hi>Parker</hi> (who not
long before ſtole away from <hi>Barmuda</hi> thither, and ſince (comming well from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions)
in his way homeward, dyed of an impoſtume, blood iſſuing out of his mouth,
eares, and noſtrills.) The grand ingenier of trouble to the Congregation in <hi>Summer-Iſlands,</hi>
put Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> upon this deſigne, and named the men fitteſt to act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
who for the moſt part were made choice of. This Aſſembly thus met, call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a grave Aſſembly. Truly there were many grave and grey headed drunkards of
that<note n="*" place="margin">Concilium <hi>or rather</hi> Conciliabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</note> Convention, who proved the grave of piety, juſtice, and civility. But this is
too low a ſtyle for them, therefore (by their Speaker) they are called a Parliament, and
by the Governour ſummoned downe under the name of Burgeſſes, that under this
pretence, without reſpect to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> or Company under whom they
ſtand, they might exerciſe an independent power over the Congregation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, being met, an oath of Secrecie is impoſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>

                        <p>WHereas it pleaſed Almighty God to deſigne me for this place, and the honourable

have (through Gods providence) diſcerned divers ill-affected people, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory

eſtabliſhed, and obſerved by my Worthy Predeceſſors, in conſideration whereof, wee

theſe Iſlands, as our predeceſſours might have, had, or ſhould have; aſſuring all thoſe
that ſhall perſiſt in their wilfull diſobedience to the power and authority derived from

milde behaviour towards ſome, hath been ſleighted, and experimentally too to much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed;
But for ſuch as will endeavour to live in the feare of God, and in obedience to
the Lawes, I ſhall both by my ſtate and perſon endeavour to maintaine them in their
rights and juſt priviledges; and whereas (with griefe of heart I ſpeake it) there is a
party in theſe Iſlands, that have withdrawn themſelves, not onely from the rules of civil
Government, which are preſcribed and warranted unto us to walke by, but alſo have
of their owne inventions ſet up, and impoſed a diſcipline, and bound them in covenant

indeed diſorder (as I may juſtly tearme it) being not warrantable by the Parliament, and

Aſſembly, to make and ſet forth an order, thereby to declare the danger of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
diviſion, tending to the ſubverſion of the knowne Lawes, and orders of Church

of theſe Iſlands, to yeeld due obedience to the ſame, as they and every of them
may avoyd the penalty due to contemners of Authority, and as they tender the peace and

            <p>The Impriſoning of Mr. <hi>Copland,</hi> an aged and reverend preacher many weeks for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exciſing
on a faſt day at the Mill (as they call it) the day was by Proclamation allowed
by the Governour, but the place liked him not. Alſo a ſecond time he was impriſoned,
the Governour pretending Mr. <hi>Copland</hi> ſhould ſay, That the devill in the Governour
and his Councell had caſt ſome of the Church into priſon, and before Mr. <hi>Copland</hi>
could be releaſed, he muſt be bound to his good behaviour, who asking the Governour
what would breake his behaviour, he replyed, if you preach againe; to which Mr. <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
anſwered, Sir I knew not till now, that preaching was a breach of the good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
Inſtance, the impriſoning of <hi>John Briſtow</hi> ten dayes, and fining him three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound of Tobacco, becauſe he would not deliver the keyes of his hired houſe, unto
the Governours new Marſhall, without the conſent of the Landlord, or the Governours
expreſſe command; and for that the ſaid <hi>Briſtow</hi> (the Marſhal) took <hi>M. White</hi> committed
to his charge, till the Governour ſhould ſecure him. This <hi>Briſtow</hi> was no wiſe peccant
in his office by the Governours owne profeſſion, he is no Independent, but an honeſt
man, and not for the Governours turne. Inſtance the impriſoning of Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> for
ſaying he was Councellour (as he thought) of <hi>Pagets</hi> Tribe, and therefore refuſed to
pay his levy, and before his cenſure or impriſonment. The <hi>London</hi> ſhip arrived, and
Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> was choſen Counſellour (as he had information it ſhould be) by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
yet is he committed to common Gaole, and denyed the place of<note n="e" place="margin">Nequid uſquam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſti oculis occurrat. Bran. 8.</note> Counſellour

            <p>Sleighted the power of Parliament, which appeares, Firſt, by denying the liberty
granted <hi>M. White,</hi> and others, by that ſupreame Court. Secondly, by the words ſpoken
in the Aſſembly (the Governour preſent) by <hi>Th. Wood</hi> a member thereof, when that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
grant was publickly read, it is ſaid he, but a peece of parchment, and a little wax.
Thirdly, by that ſecret charge of Apoſtacy and Rebellion on Parliament and Nation.
See the act for ſuppreſſing Independents, <hi>ſupra.</hi> Fourthly, by the anticipation of any
power to poſſeſſe the Kings Caſtle, except from the Company. See act for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fifthly, their ſleighting the Ordinance and power granted to the Committee for the
American plantations, When pleaded by the Magiſtrates againſt the Act for caſting
them out.</p>
            <p>The Governour and Aſſembly turned out of place,<note place="margin">Bran. 9.</note> Magiſtrates of knowne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
which is firſt againſt the Ordinance of Parliament to the Committee of
Plantations then pleaded to by the Magiſtrates, but none regarded the power and
authority thereof. Secondly, It is alſo againſt the Companies Declaration, which
was likewiſe urged but without ſucceſſe, in which courſe the Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
ſtill perſiſt, for <hi>Anno 1647.</hi> Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> choſen Counſellour by the Company
was rejected; likewiſe Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> making an overture in the vacancy of a
Counſellour in <hi>Smiths</hi> Tribe, that the Tribe ſhould have liberty of naming two
men, and he with his Councell would agree to chooſe one of them; but when it
came to acting, the Governour ſet by the men in nomination, and choſe one <hi>Thomas
Burrows</hi> formerly cenſured at an Aſſizes, as unworthy to beare the place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
for miſdemeanours there proved againſt him.</p>
            <p>Of known integrity to the Parliament. This Iſland (Captaine <hi>Sayle</hi> being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
aſſiſted with the Councel, ſince caſt out by Captain <hi>Turner)</hi> owned the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the moſt of the Plantation ſtood either newter, or in open defiance to it;
the report whereof occaſioned one <hi>Ferns</hi> a Kings Man of warre to make prize of
goods belonging to Captaine <hi>Sayle</hi> and other friends to the Parliament, to their
damage at leaſt five hundred pound.</p>
            <p>The Governour forbids appeales.<note place="margin">Bran. 10.</note> The Magiſtrates aforementioned after ſome
dayes impriſonment, ſent their appeale to the Parliament and Company unto the

beene denyed his appeale to the Aſſizes held in this Iſland, to Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
and High Court of Parliament. So in <hi>Robert Naltons</hi> cauſe, whoſe appeale
to Aſſizes would not be granted, the Governour at Councell table is above all.</p>
            <p>The Governour with his Aſſembly forbids Miniſters to preach, witneſſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>This Order hath no truth in it, unleſſe, in that paſſage, to the great diſturbance
of the preſent Miniſters; to wit, Mr. <hi>Vyner,</hi> M. <hi>Hooper,</hi> both of them profeſſing they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57140:12"/>
will adminiſter no Sacrament (which yet was the condition they made with the

Aſſembly ſilence, are allowed by the Company, ſent over by them at firſt with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, even ſince the difference about the Congregationall way, the Company
wrote thus unto M. <hi>Copland</hi> and M. <hi>Golding,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of the people, wee
have ſent over two Miniſters, who (we doubt not) will be ready according to the
Directory to give them due ſatisfaction in point of adminiſtring Sacraments and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Wee will not take upon us to preſcribe you any thing. Our deſire is, that
you and they, as fellow labourers may joyne hand in hand, for the good of the
people. We are farre from preſſing you againſt your conſciences, we know well,
that conſcience is a tender thing, and muſt be tenderly dealt withall. Your owne
diſcretion (we doubt not) will ſufficiently inſtruct you to be peaceable, not to vent
your ſelves one againſt another in the Pulpit, but to minde your maine worke
which (as we conceive is) to preach Chriſt to the people, &amp;c. Subſcribed with
nine of the Companies hands.</p>
            <p>Now our adverſaries cannot charge us with diſobedience, unto the wiſe, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
counſell given by the Company in this their letter: though (to our faces)

with Schiſme, Hereſie, Errors, to be as <hi>Chora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the Mill (though Chriſt ſaith, two ſhall be grinding at the Mill, the one taken,
and the other left) with ſuch like ſtuffe, which we forbeare to publiſh; whoſe labour
were deſired by the people. The moſt conſiderable of <hi>Sandios</hi> Tribe petitioned the
Governour to enjoy M. <hi>Whites</hi> Miniſtery, and many of <hi>Smiths</hi> tribe, M. <hi>Goldings;</hi>
but the Governour would not hearken to the deſires of either, and yet (if we may
beleeve him, and I have heard him ſpeake it forty times) he doth all for the glory
of God, and the good of the Country.</p>
            <p>Conceals good orders.<note place="margin">Bran. 12.</note> 
               <hi>An. 1647.</hi> The Company required that the Congregation
ſhould injoy their liberty and the Chappell to exerciſe in, this the Governour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
from the Congregation, and makes the people believe, there is no ſuch liberty
granted to the Congregation, ſtengthens the hands of lewd perſons. Thoſe private
Inſtructions which the Governour tearmed (as it is ſaid) a boxe of poyſon, were
doubtleſſely communicated to his Aſſembly, elſe they durſt not have proceeded
with ſo high a hand againſt the Congregation. Alſo the letter that went in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Sayles</hi> ſhip, carried by a crooked fellow, <hi>ſupra An. 47.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With many other vexatious wayes.<note place="margin">Bran. 13.</note> 1. Inſtance, The Governour ſweares men, to
their owne damage.<note place="margin">Vexatious wayes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by warrant cauſed eighteeen men of <hi>Sandyes</hi> tribe to appeare at <hi>Georges</hi>
(twenty miles diſtance,) before the Aſſembly met a ſecond time, becauſe under
their hands they ſignified, they deſired not that the Aſſembly ſhould ſo meet. Alſo
many of <hi>Pagets</hi> Tribe were moleſted upon the ſame pretence, by warrant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Tho. Boſtwick,</hi> and one <hi>Oker,</hi> to anſwer their contempt for being active in
getting hands to a Petition to the Aſſembly, deſiring them to mediate with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57140:13"/>
for free trade. Likewiſe the Governour ſent forth a warrant to apprehend
Mr. <hi>John Somerſale</hi> as fellon upon ſuppoſition, he would refuſe to obey the warrant
of the Aſſembly met a ſecond time, againſt which Aſſembly, he the ſaid <hi>Somerſale</hi> one
of them, had openly proteſted and withdrawn from them <hi>Octo. 7 An. 647. Will. Golding</hi>
was ſerved with a warrant to attend the Governour ſitting with his Councell and
Aſſembly eight miles diſtance, &amp; when the ſaid <hi>Wil. Golding</hi> appeared, the Governour
with the reſt, ſaid nothing to him; at which time <hi>Will. Golding</hi> heard Captaine
<hi>Wood,</hi> and other ſay, they would maintaine Their Lawes with their lives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Governour and Councell have changed the levy, payable by the
Country for generall uſes, it was formerly aſſeſſed by the head. Now by the Acre,
to wit, one pound of Tobacco <hi>per</hi> Acre; the levy this yeare amounted unto eleven
thouſand of Tobacco, or thereabouts, uſually (in other Governours times) not above
five thouſand; all the generall worke in view, is the covering of the Seſſions
houſe, which is made a Dove-coat, and ſet with looking-glaſſes for the Pigeons
to dreſſe themſelves by, no forts, no publick houſes repayred, though there is need
enough.</p>
            <p>The Governour gives the Country no account, but in groſſe how this levy
grow, onely the Counſellours told us, <hi>Item</hi> three hundred pound of Tobacco for
Cedar planks ſent by the Governour as a preſent to Mr. <hi>Prim</hi> (who aſperſed the
Congregation.) And one Major <hi>Williams, Item</hi> ſeven hundred pound of Tobacco
in arrears ſince the former yeare, five hundred pound of Tobacco for ſervants to
over-ſee Mr. <hi>Whitnalls,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> buſineſſe, when they were employed Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
to <hi>England</hi> from the Governour unto the Company; alſo more for their
charges levyed upon the Country thirty ſix pound Sterlin, ſince which time, ſixty
pound Sterlin, out of the Spaniſh wreck hath been disburſed upon that account.
The occaſion of ſending theſe men for <hi>England</hi> was this, Captaine <hi>Sayle</hi> and <hi>Wil.
Golding</hi> having appealed from the Governour and Aſſembly, and reſolving to goe
for <hi>England</hi> to exhibit their Complaints againſt them; the Governour with ſome of
his Councell judged meet to ſend Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitnall</hi> to maintaine the Acts
made by the Aſſembly, and accuſe the Congregation, but prevailing in neither, they
returned.</p>
            <p>Now the Country muſt beare their charges, yea the Congregation (againſt
whom they were imployed) before convicted of any offence done, muſt contribute
to the vaine expences of theſe men. Alſo the Congregation are forced to pay for
Communion wine for the uſe of the Tribe, though neither they, nor theirs, have
any benefit by it. Alſo to the Readers of the reſpective Tribes, though ſome (or
moſt of them) be knowne drunkards.</p>
            <p>Many of the inhabitants unſatisfied with this account, refuſed payment; and the
Counſellours by the Governours warrant (ſigned before any levyes were
demanded) diſtrained on their Tobacco, and tooke their owne demands.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Governour at a muſtering diſ-armed thoſe of the Congregation,
and their friends, and all at the ſame time, paſſionately beat one <hi>Chapline</hi> with his
keyne, for asking (after his armes were taken from him) whither hee muſt
ſtay in the body, or go forth. Alſo one <hi>Hill</hi> upon a ſleight pretence. Likewiſe, hee
commanded a file of Muſqueteers to ſeize Mr. <hi>Painters</hi> Armes, which were then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;
and why may not the Governour ſend a file of Muſqueteers to ceaſe my
bed money, or ſervants?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, at an Asſizes <hi>Wil. Golding</hi> (then in <hi>England)</hi> was ſued by Mr. <hi>Christopher
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57140:13"/>
Pits</hi> for five hundred pound of Tobacco, which the ſaid <hi>Pits</hi> recovered, and upon
execution forceably tooke from the wife of <hi>Will. Golding</hi> in his abſence: but how
comes <hi>Will. Golding</hi> to be liable to this debt? Thus, Captaine <hi>Chadocke</hi> undertooke
for ſome ſuch debt, for Mr. <hi>Worth,</hi> whom he tooke with him to <hi>Trinidado,</hi> but ſtood
nor engaged to pay that debt to M. <hi>Pits,</hi> Captain <hi>Chadock</hi> makes M. <hi>Rich. Waylet</hi> (who
married Captaine <hi>Chadocks</hi> daughter) a letter of atturney, Captaine <hi>Chadock</hi> dyed,
and his two ſonnes inherit and divide his eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> M. <hi>Waylet</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Actio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalis, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur cum perſona.</note> dyes. Now M. <hi>Golding</hi>
marrying with M. <hi>Waylets</hi> widow is ſued for his debt, and the Governour informes
the Iury, that it is juſt that Captaine <hi>Chadocks</hi> daughter ſhould pay it, and the Iury
found it ſo. At the ſame Asſizes, M. <hi>Painter</hi> is warned to make his appearance, but
muſt not know wherefore, who giving his attendance, an action of defamation was
laid againſt him by M. <hi>Vyner,</hi> for ſaying M. <hi>Vyner</hi> drunke <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> as faſt as Mrs.
<hi>Foord</hi> could ſtill it, or ſuch like words, M. <hi>Painter</hi> deſires reſpite untill the next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes,
but would not be granted. M. <hi>Painter</hi> denies the words</p>
            <p>The Governour is his accuſer, the ſole witneſſe and Advocate to the Iury to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the action, and likewiſe the Iudge, and lury findes the action five hundred
pound Sterlin for the Plaintiffe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, at an Asſizes held <hi>An. 1647.</hi> M. <hi>White</hi> obtained a warrant to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
down ſome perſons, againſt whom he had juſt acceptions, entred his Actions,
and prepared his witneſſes, but when he moved the Court, his actions might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon; it was denyed, notwithſtanding the Aſſizes before he tooke the oath of
Supremacy, which the Governour urged upon him, ſuppoſing his refuſall would
have rendred him uncapable of the liberty of a Subject, the Governour aſhamed
to urge the oath a ſecond time, is not aſhamed to give Mr. <hi>White</hi> a flat deniall of
trying actions.</p>
            <p>Eightly, whiles <hi>Will. Golding</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> the Governour complying with
lewd fellows, ſought to take away the life of his deare wife, pretending words of
muteny againſt her, and told her aforehand, he would hang her; but nothing being
proved, he loſt his longing, and diſmiſt her accuſers without a checke.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, a Spaniſh Ship endangered amongſt the Rocks, <hi>Feb. 14. 1647</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
(before the ſhip was wrackt, or the Company of the Ship forſaken her) with
his owne hands, and by his appointment, did ſo pillage and ranſacke (even beyond
modeſty) the diſtreſſed men that came a ſhoare, that he hath made the Iſland ſtinke
in the noſtrills of the Spaniards, and expoſed the Inhabitants, and other of the
Engliſh Plantations to their wrath, when they ſhall fall into their hands; and herein
he is incouraged by the trading party (who not contenting themſelves with invading
the liberties of the Inhabitants, expoſe their lives to the fury of a forreigner) for
the Company in their inſtructions ſent over with Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> give liberty to
pillage all Spaniards who ſhall fall upon the coaſts. As alſo in a generall letter to
Captaine <hi>Chadock, An. 1640</hi> they give theſe inſtructions: and that when any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
doe hereafter fall into diſtreſſe on thoſe Iſlands, and ſhall ſend, or ſeeme to
capitulare before their arrivall on land, that you and the Councell there, doe require
them to caſt themſelves on, or ſtand to your courteſie, or otherwiſe, that you keep
them off, and doe not ſuffer them to land. Signed with fourteen hands: Captain
<hi>Turner</hi> laying hold upon this advantage, ſo minded the enriching of himſelfe thereby,
that he neglected the ſafety of the Iſland; for how eaſie had it been for the juſtly
provoked (though diſarmed party) if the feare of God had not reſtrained them, to
have joyned with the Spaniards, and have wrought their will upon him, and his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57140:14"/>
faction without reſiſtance. I onely hint this, to let the world ſee, that Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
(as they call them) dare not take thoſe advantages, which carnall prudence
prompt others too; but quietly commit themſelves unto the<note n="f" place="margin">Scutum tibi potius, quam gladium ſume. <hi>Liu.</hi>
               </note> Righteous Judge of
all the world for compenſation for wrongs done them, in the day of recompence
for Zions controverſie.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the complaints contained in the Petition. Animadverſions
upon the requeſts therein, fall next under conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we crave liberty to tranſplant our ſelves; firſt, becauſe it hath been, and
may againe be denyed,<note place="margin">Requeſts.</note> while the Company continue an unlimited power over us,
in what we have and are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Iſland will not beare the increaſe of men and beaſts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Land is worne out, not enjoying a Sabbath theſe thirty yeares.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We have ſerved the Trading Company long enough and for nought,
and are unwilling to leave our children bondſlaves.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We cannot beare the yoke of tyranny, nor the inſolency of worthleſſe
and illiterate men, to be our lawleſſe judges; eſpecially in the matters of God
the things whereof they ſavour not.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, We are deſerted of the Company who in juſtice ſhould relieve us; and
at beſt in our redreſſes to them, the remedy hath proved worſe then the diſeaſe,
who (if at any time they have ſaved the children of the needy, yet, have not
broken in peeces their oppreſſors, Pſal. 72. 4. the failing in either is a defect in
juſtice.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Suppoſe our Rockes were Amber-greece and our mountaines the
fineſt gold, yet would the trading party invent waves, by raiſing rents, by new
impoſitions, by limiting us to their ſhip and goods; by demurages or the like, to
keepe us ſtill in rags (almoſt) to nakedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Liberty of free trade of propriety of goods.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is our birth-right, and that ancient bounds left us by our fathers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit,
let them whom it doth concerne conſult the word of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. 27. 17.
Curſed be he that removeth his neighbours landmarke, and let all the people
ſay, Amen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we earne it with the hazard of our lives, and a kinde of baniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is the priviledge of all other Engliſh Plantations, who have either
meanes, or hopes of ſupport, beſides Tobacco, which we want.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in caſe the <hi>London</hi> ſhip ſhould miſcarry, where ſhould the Inhabitants
ſeeke ſupply, or hope for it.</p>

            <p>Seventhly, Many worthy members of the Company would grant this liberty,
who being free thereof, are intereſt in all due profits as any other.</p>
            <p>Third head. That offenders be put into a way of Triall; Firſt, becauſe the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57140:14"/>
faction of the Governour is ſo prevalent, that we can have no hopes of right here,
having this experience, that ſuch as have been named by the Tribe for Jury men
(if they comply not with the Governours liking) have been diſcharged, or put
upon the Jury of life and death, though no uſe of ſuch a Jury at that time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe many crimes are capitall, requiring witneſſes to depoſe <hi>viva
voce:</hi> now we have not liberty, or power to examine witneſſes, and take atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they deſired from the Governour, could not be obtained, or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
when ſeemingly granted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, moſt of the Magiſtrates are parties in the charge, and how can we
with prudence engage them in theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we cannot confide in all, who have power to take atteſtations, it is
knowne to us, Atteſtations have been mended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Fourth head: That the Deputy-governour may be queſtioned: Firſt, <hi>in erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
that his examples be not a preſident or emboldning to the ſucceeding Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
becauſe juſtice upon offenders, is not ſpeedily executed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>Secondly, That the peace of the Country may be preſerved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how elſe ſhall the oppreſſed be righted, or ſecured for the future?
<hi>Job</hi> hath a ſaying, That the hypocrite reign not leſt the people be enſnared, <hi>Job 34.
30.</hi> That the new elected Counſellours and Commanders may be reduced. Firſt,
The Company who plead this priviledge, have nor done it; they reſtored indeed
two Counſellours but the Governour allows but one of hem? Secondly, elſe uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
in authority will be juſtified. Thirdly, elſe it is all one, as though the
Governour was paramount; for if he be left to himſelfe, to place and diſplace
Magiſtrates and Commanders, (they being his creatures) muſt in all comply
with him or loſe their honour. Fourthly, elſe thoſe Magiſtrates and Officers
who have beene faithfull to the State and Company, and have ſuffered ſo much
infamy cannot be repaired in their reputation. (Fifthly, they and others will bee
diſcouraged for the future to ſerve the publicke, if thus left under the feet of vile
men. Sixtly, elſe the Iſland will ſoone be corrupted; moſt of that new creation,
being men of foule mouthes and lives, giving bad examples, not daring to puniſh
ſin in others, themſelves being in the ſame or greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>Truly there is nothing owned for ſin with us, but going to the Mill, walking ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
humbly, and non-compliance with workers of iniquity. Theſe are the ill-affected
perſons, the Malignants, the diſobedient to Authority, refractory, &amp;c. In
the language of the Governour and Aſſembly, in their Acts and Proclamations.<note place="margin">Ob virtutes certiſſimum exi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Concluſion. The reſult is, to leave the world to judge whether theſe things ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up, and put together, will not amount in the Governours Councell and
Aſſembly in Summer-Iſlands, to a premunire exerciſe of Arbitrary power, injuſtice,
impiety, oppreſſion in a high degree, (that I ſay not) tyranny in ſome of them
who have thus acted? and whether it is not a righteous thing that thoſe who have
uſurped power ſhould be made uncapable of the exerciſe of power for the future?
As for the Trading party in the Company, who have drawne downe (at leaſt
collaterally) diſhonour (that I ſay not) guilt upon that Honourable Society, I ſhall
leave them to the wiſdome and juſtice of a full Court of their owne; or rather at
the bar of the ſupreame Judicature of our Nation, before whom the Complaints
lye; waiting with patience their Honours Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57140:15"/>
Now if any man ſhall object. I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 words">

               </gap>, and beſides my calling.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, I am forty that there was occaſion given me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Miniſters are men, their lives, families, eſtates, and liberties, are civill
things, and whilſt invaded, cannot but complaine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Company and Aſſembly have quited me of a third part of that
labour in the exerciſe of my Calling, whilſt a Preacher to the Country. I can
now ſpare time to ſtudy men eſpecially thoſe who ſtudy my undoing in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is deare unto me.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is not improper to the Miniſters of the Goſpell to beare witneſſe
againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of men, and when their mourhes are ſtopt, to ſpeake
in Print, the words of truth and ſoberneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, who knowes but the diſcovery of theſe things may lead ſome concerned
in them unto repentance, which is all the harme I wiſh theſe lines produce.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am engaged, and ſhould ſeem to mocke the Honourable Parliament
and Committee, ſhould I not purſue the complaints exhibited to them; nor would
the condition of that Congregation, the ſtate of my family, my perſonall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and expence, far above my eſtate, (not having the leaſt allowance from the
Congregation or Company) nor yet the unſetled ſtate of the Nation, as then it
ſtood; ſuffer me to ſtay and plead to the Petition, all which conſidered I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to make this Remonſtrance profeſſing (in the preſence of God) I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
it with all fidelity, not making lies my refuge; if any miſtakes be, it is
through miſ-information and in leſſer things. The ſubſtance of the Remonſtrance,
ſpecially in matters concerning the Governour, his Councell and Aſſembly, will
he atteſted (if need be) by faithfull witneſſes. The Lord ſettle truth, juſtice
and peace, throughout the earth, and honour our Nation to be the <hi>Coryphaus</hi> and
firſt leader in it. Amen.</p>
