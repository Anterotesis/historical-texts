         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the yeare 1662. the States Generall concluded a treaty of Comon Alliance with the King of great Brittaigne, wherein the States were obliged to regulate the trade of India, reſtore Pollero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and Eſpecially to give ſatisfaction for the two Shipps the <hi>Bona Eſperanza</hi> and <hi>Henery Bonadventura</hi>) as alſo to referre other loſſes of his Majeſties Subjects unto Comiſſioners, who were to receive a liſt of their dammages, under ſeverall reſtrictions, and limitations of time and place. Then the States Generall entred into a new league with France (never intending to performe the treaty with England) inſinnuating to the French King and his Miniſters, that the King of great Brittaigne reſented ſeverall affronts, that were done to him by the French during his Exile, and that he might take occaſion from

               <p>But it is objected by their Friends that if the Kings Subjects should eate any quantities of herrings, barrell codd, or ſtoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, there would not be ſuch a conſumption of beife, mutton and veale in his Majeſties Kingdomes, which brings up the rents of Land. And it is pretended that the King is at noe loſs by the Hollanders, Zelanders, and Frizlanders fishing for herring

               <p>As to the Kings Right to the Herring fishing. It admitts noe diſpute, being upon his owne Coaſt. But if any man gives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment to a vulture, or huggs a ſerpent in his boſome, he may be diſtroyed for his kindnes and eredulity, As for the Herrings and Codd, that would be loſt for want of Catching, and the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſteries and Cloyſters left deſtitude for want of proviſions, it is a great fallacy. There would be noe leſs fish taken if all ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were obliged to pay the King a yearely tribute for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that right, which the Laws of God, the laws of nature, and the laws of nations, appropriates to the <hi>King of great Brittaigne</hi> upon his owne Coaſt: And it would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the price of Lands, or leſſen the value of mutton beife or veale, if more Herrings, Codd, and ling, were Eaten in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, but rather increaſe the publick Treaſury, the rents of Lands, and the particular Eſtates of all trades men. And for incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Fishing trade at home, if Every Inkeeper Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe keeper, and vintener in England, should be obliged to buy a barrel of pickled Herrings once a yeare. The Hollanders doe eſteeme every ſtranger, that comes to inhabite in their united Provinces to render unto the publick yearly <hi>(viis et modis) 5.</hi> pound ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at leaſt, although he be of a meane Capacity, there being ſoe many Exciſes / <hi>Verpounding:</hi> Poll money, Chymdy money etc. That from every Burger who expends 150. pound per annum in his Family a third parte of it goes to the States for publick uſes. And if the Fishing trade were ushered in againe to the ancient ſea porte Townes of <hi>Suffolke, Norfolke, Lincolne, Yorke</hi> and <hi>Northumherland,</hi> from whence the firſt Herring fishers carried it unto Anchuſen in North-Holland, upon certaine priviledges granted them there (as may be ſeene both by the records in the Statehouſe and <hi>Three Herrings</hi> given in an Eſchutchen for the Armes of that Citty) It would multiply His Majeſties Subjects

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35202:40"/>
and utterley undone in their Eſtate and Credit: And that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon, and upon the moſt humble ſupplication and Adreſſes of <hi>Francis Earle of Shrewsbury,</hi> and <hi>William Courten</hi> Eſquire, Sonne and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Sir William</hi> deceaſed, <hi>Sir John Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Sir Edmond Turnor</hi> Knights, <hi>George Carew,</hi> and <hi>Charles Whittaker</hi> Eſquires, on the behalf themſelves and divers others intereſſed in the ſaid two Shipps, <hi>Bona Eſperanza</hi> and <hi>Henery Bonadventura,</hi> and in the Eſtates of the ſaid <hi>Sir William Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> deceaſed, <hi>Sir Edward Littleton</hi> Barronet, and <hi>Sir Paul Pindar</hi> Knight deceaſed, that We would take their Caſe into Our Princely conſideracion. <hi>We out of a juſt ſence</hi> We then had, and ſtill have of their unjuſt ſufferings in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both by Our own Letters under Our ſigne Manuall to the States Generall of the United Provinces, &amp; by <hi>Sir George Downing</hi> Knight and Barronet, Our Envoy Extraordinary, to whom We gave Eſpecially command ſo to do, required ſatisfaction to be made according to the Rules of Juſtice, and the Amity and good correſpondence, which We then deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conſerve with them firme, and inviolable. <hi>And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas</hi> after ſeverall Addreſſes made to the ſaid States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall by Our ſaid Envoy, and nothing granted effectuall for relief of Our ſaid Subjects, (whom We take Ourſelves in Honour and Juſtice concerned to be ſatisfied and repaid) We lately commanded the ſaid <hi>Sir George Downing</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſignify to the ſaid States, that We expected their finall Anſwer, concerning ſatisfaction to be made for the Ships and Goods, by a time then prefixed and ſince elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that We might ſo govern ourſelves thereupon, that Our aforeſaid Subjects might be releived according to Right and Juſtice; And yet no ſatisfactory Anſwer hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that We cannot but apprehend it to be, not only a fruitles endeavour, but a proſtituting of Our honour, and dignity, to make further Application, after ſo many denyals and ſlightings. <hi>And whereas <hi>Iohn Exton</hi>
