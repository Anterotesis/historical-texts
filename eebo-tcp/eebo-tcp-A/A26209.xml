         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV have here in
the firſt place a
faithfull Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
of the
eighth Chapt. of the 22. Book
of the City of God, written by
<hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> in his latter
days, upon occaſion, as himſelf
tells us in his Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations,
of the inſolency of
<pb facs="tcp:30313:3"/>
the Pagans, who attributed the
loſs and ſaeking of the City of
Rome by the Goths under <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
to the juſt judgment of
their falſe Gods upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
and the Profeſſors thereof.
This inſolence of theirs, moved
this zealous man to take
greater pains then ordinary in
22. Books to vindicate the
cauſe of Chriſt and his Church.
'Twere a happy thing if we had
another <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> who
could and would oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as a <hi>wall</hi> for the houſe of
God againſt ſo many inſolencies
as are practiſed now adays in
defiance of it: but by none
more freely than by thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:30313:3"/>
are ſo farr from alleaging any
thing of a hand of true or falſe
God in what paſſes in the
world, that they too too ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preſume publickly to own
thoſe blaſphemies, which in
good <hi>King David's</hi> time, ſome,
who perchance had ſo little
witt and grace as to be of their
opinion <hi>in their hearts,</hi> yet
were ſo wiſe and civill as to
keep their thoughts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Againſt ſuch Poyſon
this whole Tract of <hi>St. Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
is a moſt excellent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote,
But becauſe the Doſe
poſſibly might ſeem too large,
I have elected this one Chapter,
which, for the brevity and
<pb facs="tcp:30313:4"/>
variety of accidents therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
cannot chuſe but be
very eaſie and pleaſant to take.
And, in the ſecond place, I
have added ſome of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of it, chiefly againſt that
deſperate Epidemicall diſeaſe,
which reignes, I fear, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and is the cauſe of
many other dangerous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſtempers. If what was
intended for a private friend,
prove any way beneficiall to
the publick, ſo farr at leaſt,
as to work kindly with ſome
one good perſon or other, and
cauſe him to mind the great
buſineſs for which we are
come into this world, which
<pb facs="tcp:30313:4"/>
is to believe in, and ſerve and
obey our great and good God, I
have my end, and to God be the
Glory.</p>

Book of St. Auguſtine of the

            <head type="sub">Of miracles which have been
wrought for introducing the Faith
of Chriſt into the world, and do
not vet ceaſe to be wrought, in
confirmation of the ſame faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
introduced.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hy ſay our adverſaries,
do not ſuch miracles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in theſe our days,
as you pretend have been
done in former times?
I might anſwer: that
ſuch miracles were neceſſary in theſe dayes,
that the faith of Chriſt might be eſtabliſhed
in the world. Whoſoever now requires
miracles for his faith ſeemes himſelf a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30313:5"/>
Prodigy, refuſing to believe by the worlds
generall example. But the truth is, they
who alleage ſuch things, have a deſign to
introduce a <hi>diſ belief</hi> even of ſuch wonders
as have formerly been done. How comes it
then to paſs, that Chriſt is ſo generally
held and believed to have been taken in
body into Heaven? How happned it,
that in thaſe criticall times, when men
made ſuch ſcruples of admitting any thing
which ſeemed to carry impoſſibility with
it, they believed things notwithſtanding,
even without the vouching of miracles,
which were extreamly incredible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Will they, perchance, ſay, that
they therefore believed them, becauſe they
were credible? why then do they themſelves
refuſe to believe them.</p>
            <p>Thus therfore I argue in brief: Either
ſome things in themſelves incredible and
not ſeen, came to be believed upon the
evidence and atteſtation of other things
ſeemingly alſo incredible, which things,
notwithſtanding, were both done and ſeen
to be done: or elſe thoſe things were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
in themſelves, and ſtood in no need
of miracles by way of further proof, and
as ſuch, are a convincing evidence againſt
the incredulity of ſuch <hi>Nullifidians.</hi> Thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30313:6"/>
much in order to the confuting of ſuch
vain ſensleſs men. For it cannot be denyed,
but that many miracles have been wrought
for the atteſting that one great health-giving
Miracle of the bodily Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion of Chriſt into Heaven.
For in the ſame moſt infallible writings
are delivered both the wonders themſelves,
and the faith intended to be eſtabliſhed
by them. Theſe things were made known
for the gaining belief, and, by that belief
which they have gained, are come to be better
and more clearly known. For they are read to
the people that they may be believed, and
yet they would not be read to the people,
were they not believed. For even in our
dayes miracles are wought in his name,
ſome by his moſt holy Sacramenes, ſome
by the prayers and reliques of his ſaints,
but they are not ſet forth with ſo much
fame, as to be ſpread about the world with
the ſame glory which thoſe others are. For it
is the Books of Holy writ which were to
be every where divulged, which makes
them to be read and Fixt in the memories
of all men. But theſe things are only
known, where they happen to be done,
and that ſcarce of a whole City, or the
inhabitants of the plaee. Many hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30313:6"/>
of them, eſpecially if they happen in
ſome great Town: And now when things
are carried from one to another, they bear
not ſo great an authority as to be believed
without doubt or difficulty, even although
they be told by one Chriſtian to another.</p>
            <p>The miracle which happned at <hi>Millan,</hi>
when I my ſelf was upon the place, by
which a blind man was reſtored to his
ſight, may indeed have been known by
many, becauſe both the City is great,
and the Emperour himſelf was then there,
and an infinity of People were witneſſes
of it, who were come thither to the bodies
of the Martyrs <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius.</hi>
which bodies being wholly concealed and
unknown to any one, were revealed to
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his ſleep, and were
found by him; at which time and place
the foreſaid blind man recovered his
ſight.</p>
            <p>But now (unleſs it be ſome very few)
who ever heard of the Cure done upon one
<hi>Innocentius?</hi> (who had born Office in thoſe
parts) at which my ſelf was preſent, and
beheld it with mine own eyes. For he being
a very pious and religious perſon, was
pleaſed to entertain me and my brother
<hi>Alipius</hi> coming from beyond Seas, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30313:7"/>
although we were not yet in Orders, had
already dedicated our ſelves to Gods holy
ſervice, and happened to be in his houſe
when the thing fell out, of which I ſhall
now give you the relation.</p>
            <p>He was then under the Phyſicians hands
for more then one very dangerous <hi>Fiſtula,</hi>
which he had in the lower and hinder-part
of his body. They had already made
inciſion and were now perfecting the cure
by other applications. In the inciſion he
had ſuffered very great and tedious pains;
But among the reſt, one hollow turning
there was which the Phyſicians had miſt,
and it was ſo hidden, that they never
toucht it, which ought alſo to have been
laid open. In concluſion having now healed
up the other wound, that only place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
without remedy. He ſuſpecting their
delay, and very much fearing to be cut
again (which indeed another Phyſician,
who was of his houſhold and could not be
admitted by the others ſo much as to be
preſent at his firſt cutting, that he might
ſee how they went about their work, had
foretold him, and for which he had turned
him out of his houſe, and was hardly
brought to receive him in again) burſt
out into paſſion and cryed out: what will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30313:7"/>
you cut me again? I ſee I muſt come to
what he told me, whom you would not
permit to be preſent at your doings. They
mockt at the poor mans want of ſkill; and
comforted the Patient with all the good
words and promiſes that might be. But
many more dayes paſt, and nothing was
done by all their endeavours; yet ſtill the
Phyſicians perſiſted in their promiſe that
they would not cut him any more, but
would cure that place with other applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
To ſatisfie him, they called another
grave and very famous man in the Art,
one <hi>Ammonius</hi> then living, who viewing
the place, promiſt him the Effect which
the others with their art and diligence had
aſſured him off. Vpon whoſe word, as if all
went well, he now taking heart, began
cheerfully to make ſport with his domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
friend, who had told him ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of another inciſion. But at length,
after many dayes ſpent to no purpoſe or
effect, being now tyred out, with much
confuſion they were forct to confeſs, that
with no inciſion no cure could be wrought.
At this (vnexpected news) being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frighted, be started and grew pale. But
being come again to himſelf, ſo ſoon as he
was able to ſpeak, he bad them all begon,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30313:8"/>
and never more come neer him: And now
there remained nothing for the poor man,
tyred quite out with grief, to reſolve upon
in this ſad condition, but to make uſe of a
certain rare chirurgion one of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
that he might do that, which anger had
made him reſolve never to permit the others
to do. But when he was come, and had
behold their work with the eyes of an Artiſt,
like an honeſt civil man, he perſwaded
the Patient to leave the finiſhing of the
work, to thoſe who had already taken ſuch
pains about him, to his great admiration:
adding withall, that without inciſion
there could be little or no hope at all of a
perfect cure. For his part it was much
againſt his cuſtome and inclination, to
deprive them of the honour they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
by ſome ſmall addition which was
ſtill to be made to that great Art and
Induſtry which they had ſhewed in thoſe
other wounds, which he profeſt himſelf a
great admirer of. By this he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
reconciled to them again, and was
contented (ſo he of <hi>Alexandria</hi> would
be preſent and aſſiſting) that the ſame
men ſhould lance the place, which they
all agreed was incurable without it. The
buſineſs was deferred untill the next day,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30313:8"/>
but when they were gone, the whole family
fell into ſuch a paſſion of grief for the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Maſter, that it ſeemed a
mourning at a funerall, and admitted
very little comfort from our endeavours.
In the mean time he was dayly viſited by
certain Godly men; by <hi>Saturninus</hi> of
bleſſed memory, then <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi>
and <hi>Geloſus</hi> a Prieſt, and ſome of the
Deacons of the Church of Carthage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom and who of all the reſt is
now only living, was <hi>Aurelius Biſhop,</hi>
whom I cannot mention but with much
reverence and reſpect, with whom I have
ſince often ſpoken of this ſubject, calling to
mind the great wonders of God; and I
found that he did very well remember what
we are now relating. Theſe men then, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
him in the Evening, according to
their cuſtome, he beg'd of them with teares
in his eyes, that they would Vouchſafe to
be preſent the next morning as ſpectators,
more likely, of his laſt paſſage, then of the
torment he was to endure, For he was
ſtruck with ſuch a horrour from the paines
he had formerly indured, that he made no
queſtion but he ſhould die under the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
hands. They, on the other ſide, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to comfort him, and exhorted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30313:9"/>
him to have a confidence in God, and to
undergo couragiouſly what the will of God
did inflict upon him. From thence we
went in to prayers, where we Kneeling,
according to cuſtome, upon the ground,
he caſt himſelf down, as if he had been
forct by ſome violent impulſe, and began
to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in what manner, with what
feeling, and motion of Spirit, with what
abundance of tears, with what ſighs and
grones, even to the trembling of every joynt
of his body, ſo as, almoſt, to take his very
breath from him, is not for any man to
expreſs in words. Whether others did pray,
and did not ſuffer the ſame diſtraction by
ſo ſad an object as my ſelf did, I know not.
For my own part I confeſs I was not able
to pray at all. This only I remember I ſaid
in my heart. O Lord what prayers of thy
poor ſervants wilt thou vouchſaſe to hearken
unto, if thou doſt not hear theſe. For it
ſeemed to me that nothing could be added
to the earneſtneſs he made uſe of, unleſs
he ſhould even have expired with the force
of praying. We ſtood up, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Biſhops</hi> bleſſing we departed from
him, he begging again that they would not
fail to be preſent with him the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and they exhorting him to courage and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30313:9"/>
conformity. The day came he ſtood ſo much
in fear of, and the ſervants of God failed
not to come according to their word. The
Phyſicians alſo came: all things were
prepared which the time and occaſion
required: the inſtruments alſo were laid
in a readineſs, every one being in fear and
expectation: thoſe who were of greater
power and authority ſtand neereſt at hand
to encourage him. He was now laid in
his bedd, the bands were looſened, and
the place laid open: The Phyſician, with
with his lancet in his hand lookes careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to find the place affected. He makes uſe
both of his ſight and feeling to diſcover
it. In fine tryes all experiments, but finds
nothing but the ſkar of a ſoare now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
healed. Vpon this diſcovery, the joy
which poſſeſt every ones heart, and burſt
forth with tears into thankes-giving to,
and prayſe of ſo mercifull and omnipotent
a God, I ſhall leave to every ones thoughts
to imagine, rather then preſume to expreſs
in words.</p>
            <p>In the ſame City of <hi>Carthage</hi> one
<hi>Innocentia</hi> a moſt vertuous woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
one of the chief of the Town had a <hi>Cancer</hi>
in her breſt, a diſeaſe for which Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
allow no remedy. The ordinary prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30313:10"/>
therefore is, that either the part
affected be cut off, or, that a man may
live a little the longer (for ſooner or
later nothing but death is to be expected
from it) according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> all
means of cure are to be wholly laid aſide.
Thus much ſhe had vnderſtood from a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Phyſician of her very familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
And therefore had now
wholy betaken her ſelf to begg aſſiſtance of
Almighty God, when behold, <hi>Eaſter</hi> now
drawing neere, ſhe is admoniſht in her
ſleep, that ſhe ſhould ſtand on that ſide of
the <hi>Font</hi> appointed for the women, and
ſhould cauſe the firſt that came from Holy
<hi>Baptiſme</hi> to ſign the place with the ſign
of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhe did ſo and was
immediatly cured. Now the Phyſician
who had adviſed her to forbear all padling
with it, if ſhe intended to prolong her
life, looking afterwards upon her breaſt,
and finding her perfectly cured of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
of which his own eyes had been
witneſſes, was extream earneſt with her to
know what meanes ſhe had made uſe of, being
very deſirous, as neer as we can gueſs, to
know that Receipt, which might prove
<hi>Hyppocrates</hi> his aſſertion falſe. But when
he had heard what had paſt, with a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30313:10"/>
ſlighting kind of voice and countenance
(ſo that the good woman began to fear leaſt
he ſhould utter ſome unhandſome words in
contempt of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) he is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
by way of a religious kind of
raillery; I thought ſaid he, you would
have told me ſome great mattter. And ſhe
being now in a great fear and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
be preſently added what great matter
was it for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to cure a <hi>Cancer,</hi> who
raiſed to life one who had been four
dayes dead? When I heard of this, I
was very much troubled that ſo great a
miracle wrought in ſuch a City, and upon
a perſon of ſuch note, ſhould be concealed,
and thought fitt both to admoniſh and
almoſt to chide her for it. And ſhe making
anſwer that ſhe had not concealed it, I
askt thoſe Matrous her very familiar friends
who happned then to be in her company,
whether they knew any thing of it before.
They aſſured me they never had heard word
of it. You may ſee then, ſaid I, whether
you have not been too ſilent in the buſineſs,
ſince even theſe your familiars never had
notice of it; And then having deſired her
to make a ſhort relation of the whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
ſhe did ſo in their hearing, adding
every materiall circumſtance, they much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30313:11"/>
admiring and glorifying God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And who perchance hath heard of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Phyſician in the ſame City, who was
troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> who when he
had given his name in order to <hi>Baptiſme;</hi>
the day before he was Chriſtned, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd
by certain black hairy boyes or
negroes, who appeared to him in his ſleep,
and whom he perceived to be devils, to be
baptized that year: and when he would
not obey, was kickt by them upon his
feet, ſo as to cauſe him a more grievous
pain, then ever he had felt before in his
life. But he perſiſting the more reſolutely
to overcome them by thoſe regenerating
waters, and being baptized according to
the vow he had made; in the very receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Holy Sacrament, was not only
freed from that more then ordinary tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he then endured, but was
alſo quite freed from his <hi>Gout,</hi> nor did
ever, during his whole life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
many years after, feel the leaſt pain
in his feet more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We indeed knew this,
and ſome of our brethren, who lived not
farr from the place where it happen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>A certain man of the City called
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30313:11"/>
               <hi>Curubis</hi> was freed by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> not only
from a <hi>palſie,</hi> but alſo from an extream
ſwelling in his <hi>genetories;</hi> and he was
ſo freed, that immediately be appeared as
if he had had no ſuch infirmities before.
And who, I pray, had notice of this, but
only thoſe of that Town, and ſome few
others who by accident heard of it? But
we having intelligence thereof, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Holy Biſhop <hi>Aurelius,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his coming to <hi>Carthage,</hi> although
we had our informations before, from
ſuch, whoſe credit was out of all queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hesperius</hi> one of this place (a perſon
of good quality) hath a farme called
<hi>Zubed,</hi> in the territory of <hi>Fuſſelen;</hi> he
having notice that his houſe there was
haunted with evill ſpirits, to the great
diſturbance of his cattell and ſervants, my
ſelf happening to be abſent, earneſtly
deſired of our <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that ſome of them
would be pleaſed to go thither, and drive
the malignant ſpirits away by the force
of their prayers. On of them went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
[<hi>Obtulit ibi Sacrificium Corporis
Chriſti.</hi>] <hi>offered there the Sacrifice of
the Body of Chriſt,</hi> praving moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the ceſſation of that great affliction,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30313:12"/>
by the mercy of God it preſently ceaſed.
Now <hi>Heſperius</hi> had received a preſent
from a friend, a parcell of <hi>Holy-earth</hi>
brought from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> from the very
place where <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having been buried,
roſe again the third day. This <hi>holy Earth</hi>
he had hung up in his own chamber,
as a preſervatiue for his own perſon. But
now when his houſe was freed from the
foreſaid moleſtation, he bethought himſelf
how, with decency, to diſpoſe of the <hi>holy
earth,</hi> which, <hi>out</hi> of <hi>reverence,</hi> he thought
not fitt to keep any longer in his chamber.
It happened accidentally, that my ſelf, and
my then-companion <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Synes</hi> were in a place not farr off. He
intreated us to come unto him: which we
refuſed not, and having made us the whole
relation, he made it alſo his petition, that
the <hi>holy earth</hi> ſhould be layd in ſome
decent place, which ſhould be turned into
a place of prayer, where Chriſtians might
meete for performance of their devotions.
We could not refuſe him; but did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
And it fell out that a poor country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>youth,
who was ſtruck with a <hi>palſy,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, beg'd of his parents that they
would carry him to the holy place,
where having done his devotions, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30313:12"/>
returned upon his own feete ſafe and
ſound.</p>
            <p>There is a village called <hi>Victoriana</hi>
ſome thirty miles diſtant from <hi>Hippo</hi> the
Royall. There are <hi>Relickes</hi> of the <hi>Saints,
Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius</hi> who were of
<hi>Millan.</hi> Thither vvas carried a certain
yong man, vvho vvaſhing his horſe, in
the midſt of Summer, in the River, the
divell entred into him. In this place the
poor creature lying neere dead, or at leaſt,
as if he had been dead, the Lady of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as uſually, came vvith her maids
and ſome <hi>Religious women</hi> to ſay their
evening prayers. At their beginning to
ſing their <hi>hymnes,</hi> the miſerable creature,
as one ſuddenly ſtruck, ſtarted up, and
vvith a hideous out-cry, daring not, or
having not povver to ſtirr the altar he had
laid hold on, he ſtood there as one faſtned
or bound to it, and vvith a moſt horrid
noiſe begging that they vvould ſpare him,
confeſt, where and vvhen and in vvhat
manner he had entred into the body of the
miſerable young man. At length promiſing
to go out, he named diſtinctly every part of
his body, vvhich he threatned to cutt off
in his departure. And uttering theſe vvords
he vvent out indeed. But one of his eyes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30313:13"/>
fell out, and hung upon his cheek fixt by
a little ſtring vvhich vvas faſtned to the
inner part of his eye, and all the black of
the eye vvas covered vvith a vvhite film.
Thoſe vvho vvere preſent and ſavv it, (and
novv many vvere come in, upon the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
voice he had made) fell all to their
prayers for him? although they ſavv that
he vvas novv perfectly come to himſelf:
Yet being in great trouble about his eye,
vvere of opinion that a Phyſician vvas to
be ſent for. Vpon this; his brother in-lavv,
vvho had married his ſiſter, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
him thither, ſaid, Certainly the
ſame God, vvho, through the prayers of
his bleſſed Saints, has been pleaſed to
chaſe avvay the Divell, is able alſo to
reſtore his eye unto him. And vvith that,
putt the eye, vvhich vvas fallen out, into
its place again, as vvell as his ſkill would
ſerve him, [Orario, <hi>uſed for a ſtole by</hi>
St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hierome <hi>and others.</hi>] and bound it
up vvith a ſtole, and ſo thought fitt to
leave it for ſeaven dayes ſpace. At the end
of vvhich dayes opening his eye, he found
it perfectly recovered. Other cures vvere
vvrought in the ſame place, vvhich brevity
makes me not to mention.</p>
            <p>I my ſelf knevv a yong maid of <hi>Hippo</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:30313:13"/>
vvho vvas immediatly dispoſſeſt of the
Divell by only anointing her ſelf vvith
the oyle, into vvhich ſome of the teares of
a <hi>good Prieſt</hi> had fallen, vvhilſt he vvas
praying for her. I knovv alſo a Biſhop
vvho by his prayers for a young man, vvhom
he never ſavv, delivered him from the
povver of the Divell.</p>
            <p>There vvas an ancient man of <hi>Hippo</hi>
called <hi>Florentius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a very devout creature,
but very poor, vvho vvas by trade a tailour.
This poor vvretch happened to loſe his
coate, and had not in the vvorld vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith
all to buy him another. He makes his
prayers to the <hi>twenty martyrs,</hi> vvhoſe
memory is very famous in theſe parts, and
beggs of them, vvith ſomething a loud and
earneſt voice, that they would help him to
a coat. Certain gybing young fellowes who
by chance were preſent, and overheard him,
followed him as he went away, ſcoffing
at him for having beg'd fifty half-pence
of the <hi>martyrs</hi> to buy him a garment. But
he walking ſilently on, eſpyed a great fiſh
lying paunting upon the ſhoare, which by
the help of the young man he took and ſold
to one <hi>Carchoſo</hi> an honeſt Chriſtian Cook,
for thirty pence, telling him vvithall vvhat
had happened; and with this little money
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30313:14"/>
intending to buy vvool, for his vvife to
make him a coat vvith, as vvell as ſhe
could, But the cook opening the fiſh, found
of gold ring in the belly of it, and out of
meer commiſeration, and upon ſcruple of
conſcience reſtored it to the poor man, Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
behold how the <hi>twenty martyrs</hi> have
furniſht thee with a garment.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Projectus</hi> Biſhop brought the
<hi>Reliques</hi> of the moſt glorious <hi>martyr St.
Stephen</hi> to the <hi>Tibilitan</hi> waters, there
was a great meeting and flocking of people
to the place in honour and memory of the
<hi>Saint.</hi> There it happened that a blind
woman beg'd that ſhe might be led to the
Biſhop as he was carrying the <hi>holy relicks:</hi>
ſhe gave him certain flowers which ſhe
carryed a long with her: they were again
returned to her; ſhe applyed them to her
eyes, and immediatly ſhe ſaw. All the
company being in a mazement, ſhe led
the way alone, and now had no need of any
body to lead her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucillus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Synes</hi> happened to
carry in proceſſion a <hi>Relique</hi> of the ſame
glorious <hi>Saint</hi> which is kept in a Caſtle of
the ſame place, not farr from <hi>Hippo,</hi> the
people, ſome going before, others following;
vvhen, by the carrying of ſo holy a thing,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30313:14"/>
he vvas ſuddenly cured of a <hi>fiſtula,</hi> vvhich
had cauſed him much trouble for a long
time, and vvas novv in expectation of the
coming of a Phyſician his particular friend,
for the lancing of the place, Certain it is
that from that very time he could never
diſcover any thing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eucharius</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by
nation, dvvelling at <hi>Calama,</hi> by the
<hi>Relickes</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Saint,</hi> which the
Biſhop <hi>Poſſidius</hi> had brought thither, was
cured of an habitual infirmity of the ſtone.
The ſame Perſon aftervvards falling into
another violent fitt of ſickneſs, was ſo farr
given for dead, that they began to tye his
thumbs together, when his own gown which
had been carryed to touch the <hi>Reliques</hi> of
the forenamed <hi>Saint,</hi> being brought back
again, and laid over his body, by the help
of the glorious <hi>Saint</hi> he was reſtored to life
and health.</p>
            <p>There was a certain man, called
<hi>Martialis,</hi> who was of prime note amongſt
thoſe of his quality; he was now well in
years, and had a great averſion from
Chriſtian Religion; he had indeed a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
who had embraced the faith, and a
ſon-in-law, who had been baptized that
very year. Theſe, when they found him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30313:15"/>
ſtruck with a dangerous ſickneſs, beg'd of
him moſt earneſtly, with many teares
that he would become a Chriſtian. But he
would by no means hear of it, and putt
them off with great indignation. His
good ſon-in-law took upon him, to get to
the place where the <hi>Reliks</hi> of Bleſſed <hi>St.
Stephen</hi> were decently kept, there to pray
for him, with all the earneſtneſs he could,
that God would be pleaſed to inſpire him
with his holy grace, that he might believe
in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He performed this with many
ſighs and teares, and with great fervour
of devotion. Then returning he took with
him ſome of the flowres which lay upon the
<hi>Altar,</hi> and, at night, laid them under his
pillow. He went to ſleep: but before day
he cryed out (with much earneſtneſs)
that they ſhould make haſt to the Biſhop,
who was then accidently with me at
<hi>Hippo.</hi> But having underſtood that the
Biſhop was abſent, he deſired the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
might come vnto him. They came, and
he preſently declared that he did believe;
and to the great joy and aſtoniſhment of
all, was immediatly baptized. And
(which was ſtrange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long as he lived
after, had theſe words perpetually in his
mouth: <hi>Chriſt receive my ſoul:</hi> although
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30313:15"/>
he was wholy ignorant that theſe were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
laſt words which were uttered by the moſt
bleſſed <hi>Martyr</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he was
ſtoned to death. Theſe were alſo the laſt
words of this happy man, who lived not long
after.</p>
            <p>There were alſo cured, by the interceſſion
of the ſame <hi>Martyrs,</hi> two who where ſick
of the Gout, the one a citizen, the other
a ſtranger. But the citizen was abſolutely
cured without any more adoe: the ſtranger,
as I underſtood, had by revelation what
he was to apply when the fitt took him;
So that upon application, his pain imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
ceaſed.</p>
            <p>At a place called <hi>Audituras,</hi> where
there is a Church, and in it a <hi>Relique</hi>
of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> a certain little boy being
at play in the court-yard, ſome reſty oxen
coming with a cart, runne the wheel over
the child, who preſently gaſping, dyed.
His Mother immediatly took him, carryed
him to the <hi>holy Reliques,</hi> and he did not
only recover, but ſeemed to have received
no hurt at all.</p>
            <p>A certain <hi>Nunn</hi> at a houſe called
<hi>Caſtiniana</hi> not farr from the ſame place
falling very ſick, ſo as to be given over by
all, They carryed her gown to the ſame
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30313:16"/>
               <hi>Reliques,</hi> but before it was brought back
again, ſhe dyed. Notwithſtanding her
parents would needs lay the ſame gown
over the dead corps, upon which ſhe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
life, became a ſound woman.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Hippo</hi> one <hi>Baſſus</hi> a <hi>Syrian</hi> made
his earneſt prayers at the ſhrine of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Martyr</hi> for a daughter of his who lay
very weak and in great danger, and he
had brought with him one of her garments;
when, behold, ſome of his ſervants came in
great haſt to tell him that his daughter
vvas dead; but ſome of his friends meeting
them, vvhilſt he vvas at his devotions,
forbad them to deliver their ſad tydings,
leſt he ſhould not have been able to conceale
his grief from the notice of the world. But
coming home, and finding all in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he caſt his childs garment upon
her, and ſhe was immediatly reſtored
to life.</p>
            <p>Again in the ſame city of ours there
dyed, of ſickneſs, the ſon of one <hi>Ireneus</hi>
a Collectour. And now when the dead
Corps was laid out, and ſome were mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and lamenting, whilſt they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for the funerall, a friend of his
amongſt others who endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the afflicted father, ſuggeſted this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30313:16"/>
adviſe; that they ſhould annoint the body
with the oyl of the holy <hi>martyr (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
which was burning in the Lamp
before his holy Reliques.</hi>) They did ſo,
and the young man came again to Life.</p>
            <p>With us alſo, one <hi>Eleuſinus,</hi> who had
born the office of <hi>Tribune,</hi> layd his dead
child upon the <hi>Reliques</hi> of the ſame
<hi>Martyr,</hi> which are kept in his houſe
neere the City, and there offering up his
moſt earneſt prayers, accompanyed with
many teares, he received him again a
live.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay, or do? The deſire
I have of drawing to an end of this my
intended, Treatiſe, gives me not leave to
mention all I Know of this Kind: and
without doubt, moſt of my friends, who
ſhall happen to read what I have here ſett
down, will reſent my omitting ſo many
other particulars which themſelves are very
well accquainted with as well as I. whoſe
pardon I muſt begg; and deſire them to
reflect what paines and labour it would
require to do that, which the work I have
here vndertaken, will by no meanes allow
me. For to omitt others, if I ſhould now
only ſett down the miraculous healths
reſtored to the ſick by this <hi>Holy Martyr,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:30313:17"/>
(I mean the moſt glorious <hi>St. Stephen</hi>)
as well in the Town of <hi>Calama,</hi> as alſo
in our own, many books were to be written,
neither could we poſſibly make a perfect
collection of them all, but only of ſuch as
Memorials have been written of, to the
end they might be read to the people. For
it was our deſire to have it done ſo, that
ſince it pleaſed Almighty God to honour
this our age with miracles not inferiour to
thoſe of former times, the Knowledge and
memory of them might not be loſt. It is
not yet full two years ſince that <hi>Holy
Relique</hi> was firſt plac't at <hi>Hippo</hi> the
Royall; and although it be moſt certain,
that many miraculous things have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
of which there have been no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
given in, yet the number of ſuch
as have been in that manner atteſted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to about threeſcore and ten, at
at ſuch time as I was writing this. But
at <hi>Calama,</hi> where a <hi>Relique</hi> of the <hi>St.</hi>
had been longer kept, and where the good
cuſtome of giving in Memorialls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was more
uſed, there is an incomparably greater
number. At <hi>Uzali</hi> alſo, which is not farr
from <hi>Utica,</hi> we are aſſured of many ſtrange
things wrought by the ſame <hi>Holy martyr,</hi>
there having been placed a <hi>Relique</hi> of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30313:17"/>
the ſaid Saint by the Biſhop <hi>Evodius,</hi> a
long time before we had any. But it is not
the cuſtome there to give in Memorials, or,
as I may rather ſay, it has not been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly,
though now, happily they have alſo
brought in that good practice. For, we being
lately there, a certain noble woman, called
<hi>Petronia</hi> having been miraculouſly cured
of a great and tedious ſickneſs, for remedy
whereof all the art of Phyſick had come
ſhort, we perſwaded her, with the conſent
of the Biſhop of the ſaid place, to give up
a Memorial which might be read to the
people, and ſhe moſt readily complyed with
our deſires. In which Relation ſhe inſerted
alſo this particular, which I muſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt,
although I am obliged to make
what haſt I can towards a concluſion of
this work. She tells us there how ſhe was
induced by a certain <hi>Jew</hi> to put a Ring
upon a hair girdle, and to weare it next
her body, vnder all her cloaths, which
Ring was to have, vnder the other preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtone, a ſtone found in the Reines of
an oxe. Being thus girt, by way of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
remedy, ſhe came towards the Church
of the <hi>Holy Martyr.</hi> But being come paſt
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and having lodged at a farm
of hers neer the river <hi>Bagrada,</hi> riſing up
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30313:18"/>
to go on her Journey, ſhe ſaw the Ring
lying before her feet, and wondering, ſhe
viewed the hair girdle, which the Ring
had been faſtned upon, and finding it as
faſt and firm as ever, without any one
knot being looſed, ſhe imagined the <hi>Ring</hi>
it ſelf might be crackt or broken; but
finding that alſo perfectly whole and entire,
ſhe preſumed to take that ſtrange accident
for a happy preſage and pledge of her
future miraculous recovery, and untying
the girdle, threw it with the ſaid Ring,
into the river. Thoſe, haply, who do not
believe our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> to have been born
without the leaſt violation of the pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity
of his B. <hi>Mother,</hi> or to have come into
the roome where his diſciples were, the
doores being ſhutt, will have much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to believe what here is related. But
let them, in the name of God, make
farther inquiry into the matter, and if
they find it to be true, let them hereby be
induced to believe thoſe other things. She is
a Lady of great quality, nobly born, and
nobly married, ſhe is now dwelling at
<hi>Carthage;</hi> So famous a City, ſo noted a
Perſon, muſt needs afford their curioſity
full Satisfaction. Moſt undoubtedly the
Holy <hi>Martyr</hi> himſelf, by whoſe
interceſſion ſhe received health, did
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30313:18"/>
did believe in the ſon of an ever-pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
he did believe in him, who came in to
his diſciples, the doores remaining ſhut; And
finally (the truth whereof is the ſcope and
aim of whatever we have here reherſed)
he believed in him who aſcended into Heaven
with the ſame fleſh, with which he roſe
again from the dead. And therefore it is,
that he worketh ſuch great wonders, becauſe
for that faith it was, that he was ſo happy
as to lay down his life. Many miracles
then are wrought even in theſe our dayes;
the ſame God working them by whom he
pleaſes, and by what meanes he pleaſes,
the ſame God who has wrought all theſe
which we have read: But yet even theſe are
not Known a like to all, neither is there
that care taken that by often reading of
them, the memory of them may not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
For even in thoſe places, in which
(according to the cuſtome now uſed by us)
authentick Relations are given up, by
thoſe who have received ſpeciall favours, to
the end they may be read and notified to
the people, thoſe, indeed, who happen to
be then preſent, hear the ſame read; but
many more prove to be abſent. So that
even thoſe who were preſent, do hardly
remember, after ſome ſhort time, what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30313:19"/>
they heard, and ſcarcely is there one to be
found, who takes the paines to give notice,
of what they had heard, to others whom
they know to be abſent.</p>
            <p>One thing there is which happened in
our City, which though it be not greater
in it ſelf then ſome of thoſe things which
I have already related: yet it is ſo clear
and ſo noted a miracle, that, I believe,
there is no one perſon in all <hi>Hippo,</hi> who
did not either ſee it with his own eyes, or
has not been ſufficiently informed of it, ſo
as never to be forgotten by any. There were
ten children, ſeven brothers and three
Siſters, of good rank amongſt the citizens
of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who, by the
curſe of their mother, who had extreamly
reſented an injury done her by her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
upon the death of their father her
huſband, had ſo heavy a puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon them by God, that they went
about miſerably trembling and ſhaking
every joynt of their bodies. In which
wretched condition being not able to endure
the ſight of their fellow Citizens, they went
wandering over all the <hi>Roman</hi> dominions,
as each one thought beſt. Of this number
two of them came into our City, a brother
and a Siſter, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Palladia,</hi> being now too
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30313:19"/>
much taken notice of in many other places
by their own remarkable miſery.</p>
            <p>They arrived here about a fort-night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Eaſter;</hi> they were every day at the
Church, and particularly at the Shrine of
the moſt glorious <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> they offered
up their moſt fervent devotions, begging
pardon and mercy of Almighty God, and
humbly praying that they might, at length,
be reſtored to their former condition. And
now even there, and whereſoever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
the eyes of the whole Town were
upon them, Some, who had ſeen them in
other parts, and had been informed of the
cauſe of their trembling, gave notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to others, as they were able. <hi>Eaſter</hi>
was now come, and upon <hi>Sunday</hi> in the
morning, when the people were in great
number preſent, the young man who was
holding by the railes of the <hi>chappel</hi> where
the <hi>Reliques</hi> of the <hi>H. Martyr</hi> were kept,
and praying moſt earneſtly, upon a ſudden
fell down, and lay as if he had been aſleep.
At which ſight ſome who were preſent were
ſtruck with admiration, Some were frighted,
others compaſſionated the poor creature's
condition. And now ſome would have lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him up; others were againſt it, and
thought it beſt to ſee what the event of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30313:20"/>
the buſineſs would be, when, behold, he
roſe of himſelf, and trembled no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now cured, and ſtood a ſound man,
looking upon them who gazed upon him.
Who, think you, of all the company, could
then contain himſelf from praiſing our
great and good God? The whole Church
was filled with the cryes and acclamations
of the people. From thence they ran up to
me, where I was ſitting ready to go in
<hi>proceſſion.</hi> They crowd in upon me, one
after another, every one as he came, telling
the ſame thing as new, though we had
heard it again and again from others before.
And now when I was full of joy and
rendering thanks unto Almighty God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my ſelf, the young man himſelf came
to me, accompanyed with many others,
and fell down at my knees, whom I raiſed
again with a kiſs of peace. I went forward
to the people, the Church was full, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be heard but loud expreſſions of
joy, of praiſe and thanks-giving to God,
no man being able to contain himſelf, but
every one crying out on all ſides. I ſpoke
to the people, and they fell again to their
acclamations louder and louder. At length
having obtained ſilence amongſt them, the
leſſons were read out of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:30313:20"/>
according to the Feaſt. But when the time
was come for me to preach, I ſaid but little,
indeed, as the preſent ſolemnity, and the
exceſs of joy in every one ſeemed to require;
for I thought it better to leave them to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great power of God in his workes,
then to trouble them with eloquence of
words. The young man dined with us that
day, related unto us exactly the whole
paſſage of his mothers and his Brethrens
calamities. The next day, after Sermon,
he promiſed a narration of the whole matter
to be read the day following unto the people,
which being done accordingly on the <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, I cauſ'd them both,
brother and ſiſter, to ſtand upon the ſtepps
of the pulpit, in which I was to preach,
whilſt the narration was reading. All
the people ſaw them, one of each ſex; him,
indeed, they beheld now free from that
ſad paſſion of trembling: which they ſaw
as yet his poor ſiſter tormented with in
every joynt of her body. And they who
had not happened to ſee him before, ſaw in
the ſiſter what the great goodneſs of God
had miraculouſly wrought in the Brother.
They ſaw in him matter of joy and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation;
in her they beheld a ſubject of
commiſeration, and what their fervent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30313:21"/>
prayers were to be offered up for. In the
mean time, their Relation having been
read, I bad them retire from the throng,
and began to frame a ſerious diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the whole buſineſs. when behold,
whilſt I was ſpeaking, new exclamations
of joy were heard from the chappel of the
<hi>Martyr.</hi> Thoſe who were hearkning to me,
turned themſelves immediatly, and began
to run altogether towards the place. For
the ſiſter going from the ſtepps of the pulpit
where ſhe had ſtood, went immediatly to
make her prayers to the <hi>H. Martyr;</hi> who,
ſo ſoon as ſhe arrived at the railes, fell down,
in like manner, as in a ſleep, and roſe
perfectly cured, Whilſt then we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
what the matter was, and the cauſe
of ſo great joy, they came with her into the
body of the Church where we were, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her from the <hi>Chappel</hi> of the <hi>Martyr</hi>
whole and ſound But then there began ſuch
an out cry of admiration in all the people
of both Sexes, that it ſeemed the noyſe and
their teares would never have an end, She
vvas brought to the very place where ſhe
had ſtood ſhaking a little before. The people
rejoyc'd to ſee her now become like unto her
Brother, whom they lamented before for
remaining ſo unlike unto him. And they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30313:21"/>
found the goodneſs of God had accepted
already of their good intentions, though
they had not yet actually offered up their
intended devotions for her. The noyſe of joy,
without any articulate expreſſion of words,
was ſo great, that we were ſcarce able to
endure it: And now, what do you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
vvas in the hearts of thoſe vvho in
this manner did rejoyce, but only the faith
of Chriſt, for vvhich the <hi>Bleſſed St. Stephen</hi>
had ſpent the laſt drop of his blood?</p>

here ſend you what I

with your late

a faithfull and almoſt verball Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the 8th. Chapt. of the 22th.
Book of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of the City of God,
into that language which the education
of thoſe you ſeem chiefly to deſire it for,
has made them beſt acquainted with.
Had that Gentleman who many years
ago undertook the whole work (which
is long ſince extant in print) been as
true to his taſk, as he was willing (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30313:22"/>
to the mode) to be favourable
to his prereſolv'd Principles, I might
have ſpared this little pain, at leaſt of
tranſlating, though not of ſetting down
in paper thoſe few reflexions, which you
have formerly, upon occaſion, heard me
make upon this ſubject, which becauſe
they were pleaſing to you (at leaſt you
were pleaſed to own them ſo) your
farther requeſt of having them read at
your command, for memories ſake,
has obliged me not to ſpare my labour,
which can never be unpleaſant to me,
when any ſatisfaction of yours can be
hoped for. If ſometimes you find me,
as it were perſonally arguing the caſe
with him or them whom I pretend to
oppoſe, I hope you will not be offended
at the method, which is not unuſuall,
in diſcourſes of this nature.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I hope I ſhall not need to
mind you that this whole Treatiſe of
<hi>St. Aug.</hi> of the City of God is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,
both by ancient and modern
Authours, owned to be the genuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of that great wit, that I cannot
find any one ſo impudent (though it
contain many points, which ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
would be willing enough
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30313:23"/>
to deny or conceale to have been this
great Doctors opinions) who ever yet
called this verity in queſtion. Sure I am
that <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> himſelf in his 2. Book
of Retractations owns it as ſuch, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging
alſo the reaſon of his vndertaking
the work, and making bold to call it
<hi>Grande opus,</hi> as moſt certainly it is, in
what acception ſoever you take it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>laborious</hi> or <hi>learned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay even thoſe who ſeeme to have
taken a reſolution upon them to deny all
things of this nature, and to have made
it their buſineſs to pick up and cull out
whatſoever may afford any poſſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of exceptions; or be fitted, with
their pleaſant gloſſes, to make ſport for
a prophane Reader (ſuch as poſſibly ſome
one who would adventure to go a ſtep
or two farther, might make with ſome
paſſages of <hi>H.</hi> Writ it ſelf) and who,
with great boldneſs have dared to lay
Fanaticiſme and fondneſs at the dores
of the great <hi>St. Gregory,</hi> venerable <hi>Bede
&amp;c,</hi> whom the world hitherto had
looked upon as worthy and creditable
Perſons: yet even theſe, I ſay, theſe
daring men have thought fit to keep
themſelves within ſome bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30313:23"/>
in relation to this account of
miracles made by <hi>St. Auſtin:</hi> nor have
they (ſo farr as hitherto they have
made the world acquainted with their
thoughts) preſumed to blaſt him in this,
or any other Relation of his of this kind,
with <hi>fond credulitie,</hi> or proclaimed him
a <hi>father of Legends &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which I remember raiſed
admiration in us both, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall
of this whole Chapter, was, how
any man can think the invocating of
Saints, the honouring their Relicks, the
uſe of the ſign of the Croſs, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Body of Chriſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,
ſince they are here mentioned
by this ancient Doctor of the Church as
having been of uſe in his dayes; and
that without the leaſt contradiction of
any Orthodox perſon then in being;
but rather with the atteſtation of, and
approbation by ſo many miraculous
events from Heaven. The queſtion is
not here about doctrinall points, in
which I know ſome are very ready,
when it is to their purpoſe, to allot
even to the Ancient Fathers themſelves
their errours and human failings, but
about <hi>matter of fact,</hi> whither ſuch things
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30313:24"/>
as are here related by this Holy and
learned Saint, did really happen ſo or
no. If they pretend miſinformations,
which this great Perſon might be ſubject
to, as well as other men; let me firſt
intreat them to have ſo much reſpect, at
leaſt for this great Doctor, as to ſuppoſe
him no fool. And ſecondly let me deſire
them to remember, that he writ in a
time when the eyes of many friends and
enemies, <hi>Pelagians, Manicheans, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
&amp;c.</hi> were upon him; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
certainly would not permit
him to ſtuff his writings with old wives
tales; but oblige him to make ſtrict
inquiry into the verity and certainty
of ſuch paſſages, as he was to make uſe
of for the proof of ſuch Points of
Chriſtianity as were then in conteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. But thirdly, whatever
his care was in the examination of the
extrinſick atteſtations of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by him, which in ſuch a Perſon,
and in ſuch circumſtances we cannot
well (without forfeiting both our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and diſcretion) ſuſpect to have been
inferiour to the weight and importance
of the matter; yet cannot I ſee how we
can, with credit, refuſe him our belief
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30313:24"/>
of ſuch particulars, at leaſt (and they
are not a few) as his own eyes gave
him evident information of; unleſs
we can find in our hearts to give ſo
great a man the downright lye. And
yet, if all this, to ſome wilfull pre-oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
perſon ſhould prove uneffectuall,
at leaſt this cannot be denyed, but St.
<hi>Aug.</hi> without controule of any in thoſe
dayes, which were above a thouſand
years ago, ſpeakes here very poſitively
and confidently of many practices, now
ſtiled, by ſome, novelties and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with approbation, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
atteſtation. So that I cannot but
think it a very pregnant proof, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
demonſtration, that they were
eſteemed no novelties nor ſuperſtitions,
but lawfull and laudable practices, by
him and all others in his dayes, ſo many
years ago, as may well ſerve to vindicate
them from the imputation of Novelliſme.
This, only in paſſing, for the Satisfaction
of thoſe who pretend a Zeal for purity
of Religion, and are offended at ſuch
paſſages as are found in St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
and ſuch illations as moſt connatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow from them, not ſo much becauſe
they have any thing againſt the ſaint
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30313:25"/>
himſelf (whom at other times they
would willingly perſwade the world
to ſuppoſe to be of their Party) as becauſe
Prejudice and Education have gotten
poſſeſſion of their underſtandings, and
are reſolved to keep it in ſpite of Reaſon
and moſt powerfull Authority.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſort of men
whom I think equally, if not more neerly
concern'd in this Relation; I mean
your pretended great Maſters of wit,
who, I fear, many times make not that uſe
of ſo precious a treaſure, as it is truly
capable of, relying ſo much upon that
which they call Reaſon, that they wholly
loſe their way to Religion; and whilſt
they pleaſe their fancies with ſome pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nice ſpeculatious, become themſelves
meer ſcepticks, and, too too often, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Atheiſts. They are not altogether
behind hand with that great ambitious
Spirit, who not being able to reduce
to known naturall principles, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the cauſe of the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the; ſea, is ſaid to have caſt himſelf
as a very raſh Sacrifice into it. For theſe
men finding the nature of God (as it
muſt needs be ſuppoſed, if we ſuppoſe
him to be) above the reach of their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30313:25"/>
to make ſhort work, think it their
readieſt courſe to caſt him quite off; or,
at leaſt, make him ſo pittifull an one,
according to the model of things which
their ſlender ſenſe and experience has
made them acquainted with, that he
muſt have no care or providence of
things of this world which are extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall
to his own being, leſt he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a condition of perpetuall trouble
and diſquiet. Others, whom I think
all their kind ought to be highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at, do ſo degrade, and even un-man
themſelves, and all their race, that they
make them, as to their beginning and
ending, little (if at all) ſuperiour to the
meaneſt of thoſe creatures which enjoy
a ſenſible Being, and have a feeling of
thoſe pleaſures they are naturally capable
of, placing in them all their preſent, and
renouncing all expectation of any other
future felicity. And ſo are not at all to be
wondered at, if having taken up ſuch
Principles, either upon truſt or deſign,
they firſt look upon themſelves as the
chief, if not the only thing they are to
obſerve and gratify, and then, as is too
frequently ſeen, become in their lives
and purſuit's like unto thoſe brutes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30313:26"/>
whom they are by a very wiſe man right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compared unto (<hi>ſicut equus et mulus,
quibus non eſt intellectus</hi>) without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
or reaſon, wholly drowned in
ſenſuality, and abſorp't in beſtiality. And
yet, which is not only ſtrange, but mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
alſo, whil'ſt they thus become
meer brutes in converſation, pretend
ſtill to be the only maſters of refined rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſpeculation; making it one
great part of their witty and agreeable
divertiſements to devide, and laugh at all
thoſe, who having eſpouſed better and
nobler principles, endeavour to deveſt
themſelves indeed of the <hi>Man,</hi> not by
degenerating into the Nature of beaſts,
but by raiſing themſelves to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Angels, with whom they one
day hope and expect to enjoy thoſe pure
delights which they know very well are
not to be comprehended by poor mortalls
here in baniſhment, but believe they
are prepared for thoſe faithfull ſervants
of the great God, in whoſe power and
will it is to provide for them never-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
yet always ſatiating delights, when
thoſe their mortal bodies ſhall have put
on Immortality.</p>
            <p>And now to come cloſe to what I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30313:26"/>
would be at upon this account, I would
fain know of any indifferent perſon who
has not quite abandoned his reaſon,
whether thoſe great pretenders to, and
Monopolizers of wit be not at a great
loſs, in caſe theſe things prove true,
which you have here ſeen related by
the great St. <hi>Auguſtine?</hi> whether here
does not manifeſtly appear (ſo far as
effects can manifeſt a cauſe) firſt that
there is ſome thing in the world above,
or beyond nature: ſecondly that this
<hi>ſome thing</hi> has a providence and kindneſs
for mankiud: and thirdly, that there
is ſome thing remaining after death in
thoſe bleſſed Saints, whoſe prayers and
interceſſions obtain of the living God
ſuch miraculous favours for thoſe, who
humbly addreſs themſelves unto them?
Againſt the Verity, or certainty of theſe
things thus circumſtanced by the perſon
relating, the witneſſes atteſting, all
ſucceeding Ages unqueſtionably accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it will be worth the ſeeing what
the diſſenting party, with ſome pretenſe
of reaſon do uſually object.</p>
            <p>For I take them for men of greater
parts, and knowledge of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world in theſe dayes, then,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30313:27"/>
by their peremtory denying the whole
ſtory, to pretend to oblige mankind to
a tame ſubſcription and Acquieſcence
to their <hi>Ipſe-Dixit's:</hi> themſelves hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already baniſht out of the world all
Implicite faith of this nature at leaſt:
for in an other kind, I preſume, when
the health of their dear bodies is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
they will ſtill think it neceſſary
to adviſe with, and rely upon their
Phyſician in his art, though themſelves
dive not into the reaſons, nor can give
any juſt account of his proceedings. I
preſume alſo they will not apprehend
that they have forfeited any ſhare of their
reaſon, when they give credit to, and
rely upon their Councel in point of law,
though themſelves, perchance, never
read ſo much as <hi>Littleton,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not the full import of all thoſe
great hard words thoſe learned men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
into Conveyances <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe and
the like caſes the Great St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
Confeſſes l. 6. Confeſs c. 5. that after
many doubts and perplexities, which
himſelf, as well as ſome others in his
days had been ſubject to, he found it
abſolutely neceſſary to have recourſe to
<hi>Faith</hi> even in human, proceedings, much
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30313:27"/>
more was he convinced of the neceſſity
of it in things ſupernaturall, which, as
ſuch, are <hi>ex terminis</hi> concluded to be
above the reach and capacity of our
weak-ſighted Underſtandings. In things
therefore of this high nature we may
confide (though we penetrate not into
the intrinſick Principles of the things
propoſed) that we proceed rationally,
and as becomes prudent men, if, having
diſcovered ſufficient motives of the
credibility of the things offered to be
believed, we ſubmit, and yeild aſſent,
regulating our judgments and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
accordingly. Thus much a good
Chriſtian knowes to be his duty when
ever things appear veſted with Gods
revelation. But that only, which in our
preſent caſe (concerning things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
immediatly of an inferiour degree)
I think reaſonable to demand, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the perſons we are arguing
with to grant, is, not to deny human
or hiſtoricall faith, at leaſt to matters
of fact propoſed with ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Unqueſtionable credibility,
that peremptorily to deny them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
poſitive and clear evidence againſt
them, would make the world believe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30313:28"/>
their whole ſoules were turn'd <hi>fancy,</hi>
or <hi>will,</hi> and that they had renounced
all right to the nobleſt part of man,
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and Vnderſtanding. Their only
courſe then, if they purpoſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their pretentions to Rationality,
muſt be to argue cloſely with convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
proofs, both in matter and
forme, with undeniable Premiſes,
and fairely deduced Concluſions. One
thing let me begg of them by the way,
that they will pleaſe to be mindfull,
that it is highly againſt Reaſon, and the
Rules of reaſoning, firſt to reſolve upon
and fix the Concluſion, and then come
lamely in with the Premiſes. Thus may
you have heard many a good woman
prove her child to be the faireſt, <hi>becauſe
he is.</hi> Thus may you ſee many a cauſe
menaged with great earneſtneſs at the
Barr, though the Councell be not half
ſo confident of his cauſe, as he is pleaſed
at the liberality of his Client. Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Willfullneſs, and Intereſt, are
the true Premiſes and Proofs in ſuch
Cauſes and concluſions. Many an odd
argument is alleaged, not ſo much
proving the thing in queſtion, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing
our good will for it. But I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30313:28"/>
expect better things from rationall men,
and pretended lovers of truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, they may perchance ſay,
<hi>St. Auguſtine was a man, and might
conſequently both deceive, and be deceived.</hi>
That he was a man, and no Angel, is
without queſtion: but withall you may
take notice that he is held by the whole
world to have been an honeſt, and a
holy man, therefore he did not go about
<hi>to deceive:</hi> he was ever eſteemed a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and a diſcreet man; he had the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of unſuſpected, diſintereſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of whole Communities, of whole
Cities; nay of his own eyes in many
remarkable particulars: Ergo he was
<hi>not deceived.</hi> If this be not a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
then any your <hi>Might be</hi> can
afford to your purpoſe, I muſt needs
confeſs we are to ſeek for new Principles
of arguing. For to affirm poſitively up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo remote a poſſibility, that he was
either deceiv'd, or deſign'd to deceive,
would be a ready way indeed, but it
muſt needs be a very raſh one</p>
            <p>For never was a meer Poſſibility yet
admitted amongſt rational men for a
poſitive proof of either ſide of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
which does admit of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30313:29"/>
Much leſs can it have place
indifferently, where one ſide is fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch proofs, as greater cannot
be required by any unbiaſſed judgement,
to a determination in the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of inquiry. And if this be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
as exactly rational, then cannot
I imagine upon what Principles we can
be induced to apoſitive crediting any
thing of this nature, in any age of the
world before us.</p>
            <p>For they all being Contingencies,
and the poſitive and negative not being
poſſible to coexiſt, no <hi>Might be,</hi> or
<hi>May be</hi> can determine the judgement
any further then to a meer ſuſpenſion:
which is not only prudent, but neceſſary,
where proofs come equal on both ſides.
And as this is neceſſary, upon equality,
ſo certainly is it moſt rational to incline
to ſome one ſide upon the prevalency
of motives, or even abſolutely to aſſent,
where they arrive to that degree, that
no wiſe man can find, or hope to find
greater in matters of this nature. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiuely,
no <hi>May be,</hi> or <hi>Might be</hi>
can be thought to be upon equall terms
with it.</p>
            <p>But that which I ſuſpect may make
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30313:29"/>
you ſo backward in giving aſſent to this
Relation of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> may be the
generall prejudice you have againſt all
things of this nature. And this, haply,
has been bred, and nouriſh't in you
by your averſion from thoſe many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends
ſtuff't up, as you imagin, with
ſuch kind of old-wives tales, which to
you appear not only improbable by their
number, but alſo very lyable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by reaſon of Circumſtances.
what if I ſhould freely grant (as I
ſhall not make much difficulty to do)
what you ſeem here reſolved to ſuppoſe:
that there have been miſtakes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
abuſes in this kind? what if
I frankly own, that ſome ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
has taken that for a miracle, which
ſome more underſtanding man knowes
very well to be within the compaſs of
nature; or ſome ſtrong-fancied creature
has taken her devout dream for a Viſion?
Will your inference hold, <hi>Ergo all are
ſuch; Ergo theſe related by St. Auguſtine
are ſuch?</hi> Is there no true gold, becauſe
ſome, upon the touch, has been found
falſe? Are there no true Diamonds,
becauſe the skillfull eye of a Lapidary,
or the wheel has diſcovered ſome to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30313:30"/>
counterfeit? Then I pray call to mind
whom you deal with, whoſe reputation
you ſo ſeverely call in queſtion. It is that
of St. <hi>Aguſtine,</hi> out of whom I did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
ſelect theſe paſſages, not that I
doubt but there are a thouſand as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
things of this nature, in
other grave Authors; but becauſe I did
ſuppoſe (and I imagined I had reaſon
for it) that the great eſteeme and reſpect
the world generally has for this great
man, would gain him ſome credit with
you alſo. 'Tis He that tells you here of
many cures (ſuch as whole Conſults
of Phyſicians eſteemed incurable)
wrought ſuddenly and permanently.
'Tis He that tells you of Devills caſt
out by the force of Prayer and Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes.
'Tis He that tells you of many
dead perſons rays'd ſuddenly to life and
health. 'Tis he that tells you he ſaw
many of theſe things when they happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his own eyes.</p>
            <p>'Tis he, that tells you of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of whole Communities, whole
Towns and Cities, in proof of many
particulars. 'Tis he that tells you of
Memorialls given in, and read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
and kept carefully, that they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30313:30"/>
might be confirmed, or contradicted,
if any thing occurr to any one of thoſe
thouſands, who ſaw, or heard them.
'Tis he, that tells you that there were
ſo many other Miracles wrought in the
places he mentions, and known by his
brethren then living, to have been
wrought, that he thought himſelf
obliged to put down his excuſe, for not
ſpecifying them alſo, as well as others,
which he happens to mention. 'Tis he,
who writ theſe Things in a time, when
he could not but know, that there were
enemies enough, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
(Heathens and Heretiques, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans
and Pelagians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) who
would have been very glad of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of diminiſhing his credit, and
authority, by diſproving what he had
writt with ſo much advantage to his
own cauſe, and ſo much prejudice of
theirs. This certainly muſt needs have
obliged ſo diſcreet, and ſober a perſon,
to have uſed more care then ordinary,
in the examination of thoſe Things,
which he intended for publique view,
in proof of thoſe great myſteries of our
faith, <hi>The Reſurrection, and glorious
Aſcenſion of Chriſt, our Saviour, in Body
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30313:31"/>
into heaven.</hi> And here by the way give
me leave to tell you, that this ever
has been, and to this hour is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
endeavour of Prelates in the Church,
(and it is their high obligation) that
nothing of this kind be taken, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
as miraculous, but upon very
ſtrict examination, authentique proofs,
and depoſitions of ſworn witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So that, it cannot in reaſon be thought
other, then willfull raſhneſs in any man,
poſitively to deny them all, upon no
better ground, then meere prejudice,
or ſuſpicion. I pray taken notice of what
I ſaid laſt, <hi>to deny them all.</hi> For, to come
a little home to you, I muſt take the
liberty to tell you, that if any one of
theſe hundred Miracles, related here
by <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> or any one of thoſe
thouſands related, examined, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by others, proves true, your
buſineſs is done, You will be compelled
to own ſomething <hi>beyond the reach of
your eyes,</hi> or perchance, underſtandings
which has a beeing, and a power,
above the force of nature, manifeſting
it ſelf abundantly in ſuch admirable, and
Supernaturall operations.</p>
            <p>But, I pray, Sir, do you not find it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30313:31"/>
ſmart? Have I not touch'd the Apple
of your eye? For, whatſoever is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as becomes a man indeed) of reaſon,
and rationallity, is not ſenſe (<hi>id eſt,</hi>
Senſation;) your Cheifeſt engine; by
which you would overthrow what the
believing world ſubmits unto. Some,
I confeſs, I have heard own it; and I
fear there are too many, who have it in
their hearts, that it is great folly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any thing, of which their eyes, or
ſome other of their material ſenſes does
not inform them. This indeed is plain
Engliſh; and ſuch as makes them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
It has enough of the ingenuity,
though little enough of the pretended
Rationality. Yet ſuch as it is, it is the
very language, (as there is reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to imagine) which moſt of that
<hi>Cabal</hi> would ſpeak, if they durſt permit
their tongues to be true to their
thoughts; and their reputation were
not at Stake upon another pretended
ſcore. But let the whole Rationall
world judge, whether this be not the
moſt deſperate, and the moſt abject
ſpirit of levelling that ever was; to
leave man, the nobleſt creature of this
our ſublunary world, upon equall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30313:32"/>
termes, with the meaneſt of thoſe others
which enjoy the benefit of Senſe: nay
amongſt which many (ſome in one,
ſome in another) ſo far ſurpaſs man,
that unleſs he were enabled to challenge
a ſuperiority upon the ſcore of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and Vnderſtanding, he would be
forc'd, in other reſpects, to yield pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency.</p>
            <p>But I pray, had not <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi>
eyes, as well as you? were all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant's
of <hi>Hippo, Carthage, Millan,</hi>
and other Towns, and Cities, blind?
To Suppoſe that, would he very ſtrange
indeed, and beyond the ſpirit of an
only-illuminated Fanatique. To ſay they
all conſpired to cheat you, and that
no body of thoſe, whoſe concern was
ſo deeply engag'd, ſhould diſcover the
cheat, is a thing beyond wonder. And
yet one of theſe you are neceſſarily
reduc'd to; unleſs you have ſtubbornly
reſolved, that this alone muſt be your
rule, to believe nothing, but what <hi>your
own eyes</hi> are witneſſes of. And if ſo,
then I pray, Firſt, Suppoſe that yon
are ſubject to be dealt with in your own
kind, and to be truſted, or relied upon,
no further, then men can meaſure you,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30313:32"/>
and your actions by their eyes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you are obliged never to mention
<hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> unleſs
you have taken the paines to travel to
ſee them. Thirdly, never talk to us of
your <hi>Ariſtotles, Epicurus's &amp;c.</hi> for we
take them from you as meer <hi>Chimaeras.</hi>
And fourthly, let us entreat you, to
do the reſt of mankind ſo much right,
as to renounce hereafter your unjuſt
pretenſions to both uſe, and ſubſtance
of Reaſon. This I apprehend ought to
be done in good conſequence; and
I think you may be oblig'd to it by
deduction, in as good form, as any
Logick is capable of. But that I may
not appear too rigorous, and may have
ſome hopes to enter again into your
favour, I will deal plainly with you,
and tell you my apprehenſion; which
is, that you are not all ſo black, as you
are painted, whatever the world may
be apt to think of you, grounding
themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the extravagant ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of ſome <hi>deſperado's</hi> of your Partie.
For, I make no queſtion, but if ſome of
you were men of Trading, and had a
deſign of improving your eſtates, you
would either ſend, or go, up on like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30313:33"/>
of advantage, to <hi>Aleppo, Scanderoon,</hi>
or <hi>Mexico, &amp;c.</hi> though you had never
ſeen thoſe hopefull places, but by other
mens eyes. You would be ready to do
your King, or Country, ſervice, as
Ambaſſadours, or Agents, either at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though you had
hitherto never ſet foot out of little
<hi>England,</hi> to aſſure your ſelves of the
exiſtence of ſuch places, or of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or States reſident therein.</p>
            <p>Be but conſequent to your ſelves, and
I hope we may be good friends again.
You will ſend to <hi>Aleppo, &amp;c.</hi> by way
of Trading: you will go to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
&amp;c.</hi> in Embaſſy: But where is your
aſſurance all this while, that there are
any ſuch places in the world, as men
here talk to you of? And here I might
alleadge all thoſe ſeeming poſſiblities of
being miſtaken, or deceived, which
are wont to be made uſe of, (and is
imagined with great applauſe) in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
now indiſpute, much, or altogether,
of the ſame nature. For, how do you
know, but your factour, (far enough
out of your ſight) has a mind to diſpoſe
of your goods, for his own advantage,
in ſome other place, better known to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30313:33"/>
him, then <hi>Aleppo</hi> is to you? what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ground have you for your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that your Prince has not a mind
to be rid of you, and ſo ſends you to
ſome Utopia, or other? Is this poſſible,
or not?</p>
            <p>You will, perchance, tell me, you
are ſo morally certain in theſe your
undertakings, as to the exiſtence of place
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the world affirming it, no
ſober man queſtioning it, that it were
a ſpice of madneſs, to entertain the
leaſt doubt concerning it. <hi>Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain!</hi>
I pray, Sir, what mean you by
that? I ſuppoſe, you never ſaw the
places with your own eyes. If you had,
that would have produced ſomething
more, then <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> and would
cut off all manner of doubt, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of doubt indeed. But I do not
find, that your <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
(if ever) of that efficacy. For,
though I am morally certain, I ſaw ſuch
a man in the market-place, whom I
diſcovered by his ſtature, complexion,
cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and am emboldened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to affirm, that I ſaw him, though,
perchance, but in paſſing, and afarr
off; yet I will not venture my credit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30313:34"/>
upon it. For one man may in ſtature,
complexion, cloaths, be like another,
and I may at a diſtance be miſtaken.
I hold ſuch a man to be my friend,
and an honeſt man, and am <hi>morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
he will not break his word with
me upon loane of a hundred pounds;
but will pay it again exactly at the day
appointed: but yet for all that I will
not venture my money, without ſome
better ſecurity, then his bare word.
This, I fear, is not the <hi>Moral Certainty</hi>
you would be at.</p>
            <p>But now, ſuppoſe a queſtion ſtarted,
(in which your inheritance were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned)
whether ſuch an one were your
Father, or (to put it on the ſurer ſide)
ſuch an one (ſo ever reputed by your
ſelf, and all others generally) were your
Mother? Here, I think, you would
make out ſuch a <hi>Moral certainty,</hi> (for
I ſuppoſe, Phyſicall certainty you could
have none, either from ſelf-evident
principles, or perceptibility of ſenſation)
that you would venture your life, and
fortunes upon it. Here would be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
which might ſend you to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroon</hi>
or <hi>Mexico,</hi> to the Emperour, or
<hi>grand Signior,</hi> rather then loſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30313:34"/>
deſcended to you by ſo ſure
a title. And you could not faile of the
applauſe of all wiſe men for ſo doing.
No man would cenſure you for it, unleſs
as full of malice and peeviſhneſs, as he
muſt needs be of raſhneſs, and ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>By this time then, I ſuppoſe, you
may have diſcovered ſeverall ſizes, or
degrees of Aſſurance, in that you call
<hi>Morall Certainty:</hi> of which though ſome
is ſo weak, as to admit, both in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and practice, ſome fear and dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy;
yet others come to ſuch a height,
that albeit ſome detain them ſtill within
the limits of <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> (others
allowing them ſomething at leaſt of a
<hi>reductively Phyſical</hi> certainty) yet ſuch
an one, moſt aſſuredly, it is, as leaves
the ſubject of its inheſion, in no more
doubt, or perplexity, concerning the
verity, or certainty, of its objects
Exiſtency, and conſequently, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
determined to act accordingly,
as if Cognizance thereof had been taken
by the very eyes, or ſenſes.</p>
            <p>This I apprehend to be the very caſe,
in reſpect of this relation of the great
<hi>Saint Auguſtin;</hi> who affirms many of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30313:35"/>
the things are here related, upon the
teſtimony of his own eyes, (which to
him was a <hi>Phyſical Certainty</hi>) and that
of others, whole Citties and townes,
no man of that age, or many Subſequent
ones, contradicting, or raiſing any doubt
thereof: which to us is a moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
ground, of as much, and as
great <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> as things acted
in former times are capable to derive
unto following ages. And now I hope
no man will undertake ſuch a folly, as
to go about to make any materiall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparity
between Time and Place. For
certainly both are ſubject to the ſame
exceptions, where ſenſe has not actually
its operation; and both equally to be
aſſented unto, when they come attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſame ſtrength, and weight
of probation. Unqueſtionably all Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
arguments, <hi>of not ſeeing, &amp;c.</hi> muſt
be caſt out of doores, as of no force,
or conſideration imaginable; unleſs you
can think it reaſonable, upon the ſame
kind of proof, or motive, to deny the
being of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or a <hi>Pompey,</hi> or of a
<hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> or even of a
<hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> or <hi>Eighth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, to deal candidly, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30313:35"/>
ſlubber over any thing, which may ſeem
to have the leaſt ſhadow of a probable
diſparity, I imagin this may be one thing,
which by ſome may be reflected upon;
that though ſome former ages, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> daies, did not
at all queſtion theſe things, but allowed
them as currant, yet have there not been
wanting ſome in theſe latter times, (and
thoſe, in profeſſion at leaſt, not at all
of the party in this preſent diſcourſe
look'd upon) who refuſe to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to the things here related; which
by conſequence become failing in a very
materiall circumſtance, which thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mentioned inſtances are inveſted
with; <hi>that they are by ſome queſtioned,
and oppoſed.</hi> I know very well, there
are ſome whoſe concern is ſo to do:
But upon what grounds, beſides what
have already been mentioned, and I
hope, to the ſatisfaction of any ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
man, diſproved, I cannot imagine,
(ſuppoſing this to be the genuine work
of <hi>Saint Aguſtin;</hi> which I have not
yet found any, even of theſe diſſenters
to diſallow) unleſs it be this one; that
<hi>this relation containes ſeverall things, and
practices, contrary to their ſuppoſed Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30313:36"/>
faith, or Reformation: wherefore
there muſt be, and is, deceipt, and miſtakes
in it.</hi> But I pray give me leave to mind
ſuch objectors of the caution I gave
about the beginning of this diſcourſe,
concerning ſetling the Inference or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
before the Premiſes or proofs
came under conſideration; which is
an exact kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which,
me thinks, is worth the reflecting upon,
and is here punctually put in practice.
whereas I apprehend, the argument
may, and ought to be inverted, and
retorted thus.</p>
            <p>The great Saint Auguſtin writes theſe
things, relates theſe practices confirmed
by miracles done in his own ſight, atteſted
by thouſands of eye witneſſes; no man,
in thoſe dayes, diſproving the matters of
fact: Therefore theſe things are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Orthodox faith, or true Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>If this be not a more rationall
deduction, then the former grounded
upon meere conjectures, or a ſuppoſall
of the Queſtion, let any impartiall man
judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet one <hi>Reſerve;</hi> and that
ſeemes to have divided it ſelf into two
wings. The one is, that theſe things
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30313:36"/>
my poſſibly have been effected <hi>by the
occult power of nature:</hi> the other, that
he, who knowes the art of applying
<hi>Actives to Paſſives,</hi> (the devil, God
bleſs us) had a hand in them. The
one ſavours ſtrong of the Phyſitian; the
other ſmells rank of the Phariſee. But
we muſt make as good a ſtand againſt
them, as we are able. And firſt, me
thinks, this is juſt the proceeding of
that peeviſh, or ignorant boy; who
being bidd by his maſter to ſpell <hi>Hugh</hi>
(a proper name of a man, in Latin
<hi>Hugo</hi>) firſt, fell upon that which was
moſt obvious, <hi>H. V. Hu;</hi> then <hi>Hew:</hi>
But being told that he was quite out,
and that there was a <hi>G.</hi> in it, preſently
it was <hi>Hug;</hi> then <hi>Huge:</hi> any thing,
but the right <hi>Hugh;</hi> though this would
have coſt him as little breath as any,
or ſome at leaſt, of the reſt. But, for
the love of God, Gentlemen, ('Tis
that I wiſh you, as the nobleſt exerciſe
of your wills, and which will much
facilitate your underſtandings) if we
muſt needs fly <hi>to occult meanes, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
(of which we can give but a very
ſlender account, and can by ſuch meanes
only pretend to cloak our ignorance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30313:37"/>
under certain pretty inſignificant words;
<hi>Such occult meanes or qualities,</hi> being
things, we only gueſs at, and which
are as remote from our ſenſe, and
underſtanding, as any thing we are
preſſ'd to) why ſhould we not rather
betake our ſelves to him, whoſe Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
once owned, makes all things
clear? where as now we grope only in
the dark, and are apt to ſtumble at a
thouſand blocks, before we are aware
of them. Is not this one great one, I pray,
<hi>that a body once dead,</hi> that is, which had
loſt the principle of life, <hi>ſhould live
again, contrary to the experience, which
we our ſelves have noted in thouſands?</hi>
nay, as contrary to the inclination, and
neceſſary tendency of nature to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it would be for fire to cool, or
ice to warm? But, which is more
remarkable in our caſe, that this ſhould
be effected, by only laying a gown, or
garment, upon the Shrine, or Reliques,
of a deceaſed <hi>Saint,</hi> (with invocation of
God by his interceſſion) and then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſaid garment unto the party
deceaſed, that he, or ſhe ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
recover not only life, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
health, is ſo unheard-of an effect,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30313:37"/>
by way of any power, or vertue, which
can be appropriated to pure nature,
that I think, they muſt be deſperately
reſolved, who dare allow it ſo much.
as a probability, or indeed poſſibility.
Add to this the ſtrange cures of thoſe
other diſeaſes, the Gout, Palſy, Canker,
Fiſtula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof ſome were held
abſolutely incurable by the meanes of
any naturall applications, according to
the Aphoriſmes of the great maſters in the
art of Phyſick: to others, all remedies,
though applied by very skilfull hands,
proved very unſucceſsfull: yet theſe were
cured ſetledly, and permanently, and
which was moſt to be wondred at, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly:
And that by ſuch meanes, as
could not poſſibly be imagined, to carry
any natural proportion with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
effects; viz. by <hi>earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
by <hi>the water of Baptiſme,</hi> by <hi>flowers,
which had only touch't the Bodies
of holy men, by the ſign of the Croſs,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will ſay, perchance, that <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
can do much.</hi> Surely, we need not
go farr to prove it, if you can phanſie,
that ſuch things as theſe were done
by phancy. I confeſs, I have hitherto
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30313:38"/>
taken fancy rather for a diſeaſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
then a cure for any. I have heard
of ſome indeed, who have fancied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Kings, and Queens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I
never yet heard of any reall Crowns
they got by that their fancy; unleſs
it were crack't ones in Bedlam. I
have been told of others, who have
brought upon themſelves very malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
diſeaſes, as the ſmall pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
by apprehenſion, or fancy: which I
imagin very feaſable, by an oppreſſion
of the ſpirits, weakening the reſiſtance,
which otherwiſe might have been made
againſt the infectious Atomes; or
through conſent of parts, diſordering
the humours of the body, ſo as to
prepare it for any diſtemper, which
the aire was apt to infuſe. But I
never yet read, or heard, of a Gout,
Canker, or fiſtula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was
either got, or loſt, by the force of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
eſpecially in an inſtant: much
leſs can it enter into any ſober mans
fancy, how a dead man ſhould riſe from
death to life, and perfect health, by that,
which he was immediately before, as
uncapable off, as a ſtone is of ſmelling,
or underſtanding. Certainly, if ſuch
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30313:38"/>
Philoſophy, or Divinity rather, (for
there muſt needs be ſomething more
then human in it) be once held forth
as current, our new ſect of Fanaticks
need not doubt of a large encreaſe of
proſelytes. Great-bellyed women will
fancy ſtrongly for cherries in <hi>December,</hi>
and not loſe their longing. No man
will want wealth, health, or content,
if fancy can prove ſo omnipotent. But
I am apt to take this, (for I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is intended for any other, though
ſome of the party make great flouriſhes
upon it) for a meer ſhift, or ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
or as a dark corner, wherein
they would faine hide their nakedneſs,
that they may not be diſcovered; or
rather that they may not be forced to
diſcover him, who has put boundaries
to Nature univerſally, as well as to
the Sea, and who has reſerved unto
himſelf the power of working ſuch
wonders.</p>
            <p>Now, as for the Phariſees <hi>daemonium
habet,</hi> I beſeech thoſe, who pretend
to Chriſtianity, and the uſe of prayer,
and ſome Sacraments at leaſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
that theſe were not fit meanes,
or inſtruments, for the ſworn enemy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30313:39"/>
of them, and the implacable hater of
mankind to make uſe of, in order to
ſo much good, as the reſtoring health
to the ſick, and confirming them, and
all the ſpectators, in the faith of him,
who took fleſh upon him, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of him and all his works.
This carries high improbability with
it, if not impoſſibility. 'Twas never
yet heard, he intended ſo much, even
<hi>temperall good,</hi> to any of our kind,
whatever his knowledge may poſſibly
be of <hi>Actives</hi> and <hi>Paſſives.</hi> Beſides,
that in ſome of theſe paſſages, he muſt
have acted directly againſt himſelf,
putting himſelf out of poſſeſſion: And
we know who tells us, upon the like
occaſion, <hi>Luke. 11. 18. that his kingdome,
ſo divided, could not ſtand long:</hi> which
certainly his intention, and moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
endeavours ever were, and are, to
encreaſe, not deſtroy. Again, the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dead to life muſt needs be a thing,
as remote from his ſphere of Activity,
as it is improper for his malice. <hi>For thou,
O Lord, art he, in whom does reſide the
power of life, and death. Sap.</hi> 16. 13.
<hi>Thou art true, and ſole Authour of life.
Acts. 3. 15. who wer't pleaſed to offer up
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30313:39"/>
thine own precious life upon the Croſs, to
free us from the tyranny of this Prince of
darkneſs, and purchaſe for us a life free
from all danger of ever dying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this little has been but too much
concerning this point, in relation to
thoſe, who own Chriſtianity, and have
any reſpect for the great ſervant of
God, <hi>Saint Auguſtin:</hi> who certainly
never intended to ſet forth to the world
any thing, which either did belong,
or could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the leaſt ſhadow of juſt
ſuſpicion, be aſcribed to, or eſteemed
the work, of that inveterate enemy of
God, and his whole Party.</p>
            <p>But now as to thoſe others, who are
yet to ſeek Religion, and perchance <hi>a God</hi>
too, I could heartily wiſh to hear an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of, this nature made by them.
I ſhould then hope, they were ſomething
on their way towards the diſcovering
ſomething elſe about him, if their eyes,
or fancies, could once permit them to
ſuppoſe a <hi>being of him,</hi> whom this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
neceſſarily involves. But though
an hundred publique Exorciſmes, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
convictions of witchcrafts at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Aſſizes, and other trials, have long
ſince made this evident enough, yet I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30313:40"/>
fear, they will try an hundred Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more, before they will own his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
what ever kindneſs they may have
for his works. Men of theſe very principles
I imagine they were, who came, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years ſince, unto a worthy, learned
Gentleman, (from whom I had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation)
and told him plainly, <hi>that they
were now ſatisfied, that there was no ſuch
thing, as a devil, either on earth, or in hell.
For certainly if there had been, they ſhould
have heard ſome newes of him. For they had
tryed all the tricks, charms, conjurations,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>that ever they could hear, or read of,
in all the books, that ever they could light
upon, (and they were not a few) which had
treated of that black art. But the devil of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
could they either ſee, or hear of. O Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(replyed this diſcreet perſon) I thought
you had had more witt, then to imagin the
devil ſuch a foole, as to make his appearance
at your Summons; (which no power of yours
could oblige him to obey) that you might be
induced thereby,</hi> (for it ſeems they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
themſelves ſo farr, concerning
their intentions) <hi>to believe, or be confirmed
in your belief of a God. I hope, you have
already found, or may (I am ſure) find bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
motives to ground your belief upon, then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30313:40"/>
any that father of lies can, or will, afford
you.</hi> His diſcourſe certainly was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous;
and ſuch as I preſume, gave
thoſe gentlemen a much more pleaſing
ſatisfaction, then if their bold curioſity
had been complyed with in ſome falſe
aſſumed ſhape; which was all could
poſſibly be expected from him; who is
a pure ſpirit, and who, by conſequence,
is (of himſelf, and in his own nature) no
more the object of our corporal eyes, then
colour is of our ears, or ſound of our taſt.
But indeed, in thoſe circumſtances, they
had little reaſon, (whatever Pact, or
Compact they might pretend) to expect
even ſo much from that falſe ſeducer,
when ſomething was to be feared, or
ſuſpected, which might be in any way,
beneficiall, or advantageous to thoſe,
whom he hates ſo mortally. Farr then be
it from us to imagin, <hi>that Fiends</hi> could
have any hand, or finger, in ſuch health
and life-giving wonders, as are here
related by the holy <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> in
confirmation of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>One exception more I find made, and
much inſiſted upon by ſome, by which (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſuppoſition of the preſent) they would
fain make the world believe, they have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30313:41"/>
ſome reaſon to deny, or, at leaſt, queſtion
things ſo long ago paſſ't. For why (ſay
they) <hi>if the ſame power be ſtill in being,
are not the ſame, or the like miraculous
events, heard of, or ſeen in theſe our daies,
as did appear in the time of St. Auguſtin,
and other former ages?</hi> This muſt needs
be confeſſ't a bold undertaking, thus to
demand an account of him, whoſe will
is his Eſſence, and whoſe actions <hi>ad ertra</hi>
(that is, in relation to creatures) are all
as free, as his great Intrinſecall Attributes
of <hi>Wiſdome, Goodneſs, Omnipotency, &amp;c.</hi>
are neceſſary, and eſſentiall to his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
being. But it is noe improper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of that liberty theſe men aſſume unto
themſelves, or of the <hi>libertiniſme</hi> they
profeſs, and are ſuch adorers of, to oblige
even God himſelf, under pain of being
denyed, or diſavowed by them, to ſhew
himſelf to their eyes, their corporal eyes
I mean; (for to their intellectual he
does ſufficiently manifeſt himſelf, if they
did not wilfully ſhut them) when, and
where their humour thinks fit to demand
it of him.</p>
            <p>You may remember, that this was the
very Heatheniſh queſtion, which was put
to <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> himſelf, as he mentions it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30313:41"/>
in the beginning of this his eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and which he anſwers, Firſt with
putting the <hi>prodigy</hi> upon them, who
now demand miracles for their belief,
having had ſufficient teſtimonies of former
miracles; which have already ſetled the
world (for the moſt, and wiſeſt part) in
a ſtate of credulity. You know alſo, that
the ſeveral relation of miracles, wrought
in thoſe very times, when this queſtion
was put to him, and are in this chapter
ſummed up together, were <hi>ex abundante</hi>
alleadged by this great Doctour, to ſhew,
<hi>that the hand of the ſame omnipotent God was
not abbreviated.</hi> And all men, that have
heard any thing of the paſſages of theſe
our daies, and are not prereſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing but their own eyes, may, if
they pleaſe to take notice of them, or the
deſign I have in hand, (which was only
to ſet down my reflexions upon this one
chapter of <hi>St. Aguſtine</hi>) would permit
me to mention them, be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that ſuch ſupernaturall works
have been in all ages, <hi>and are ſtill</hi> wrought
by the ſame hand, and by the ſame
meanes, as may ſerve to convince any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
ſober man of the truth we are
pleading for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:30313:42"/>
And that I may not ſeem to ſay this
meerly <hi>gratis;</hi> as alſo, that I may, in ſome
meaſure, comply with that method, which
the great <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> made uſe of,
though with ſome ſmall encreaſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
paines, (which may alſo engage
you to an additionall of Patience) I will
make bold to touch upon ſome few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqueable
paſſages, (amongſt many)
in which either the undoubted authority,
or unqueſtionable impartiality of the
writers, or the things themſelves ſo freſh
in memory, as even to admit of living
witneſſes, (ſome of them at leaſt) may
juſtify me.</p>
            <p>But here, I ſuppoſe, I ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to mention the miracles recorded
by <hi>St. Gregory the great,</hi> in his Dialogues,
and other works, nor thoſe of his Zealous,
miſſionaries, ſent for the Converſion of,
or eſtabliſhing Religion in our Country,
although <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Acts</hi> and
<hi>Monuments,</hi> printed in the year 1576.
pag. 117. ſaith of <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> and thoſe
who accompanied him in that great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
<hi>that the King was moved with
the miracles, wrought through Gods hand
by them &amp;c.</hi> and although the ſame are
atteſted by many of the ſame age, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30313:42"/>
particularly by our venerable Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Bede,</hi> in the age following, who
adds many more, of his own knowledge
ſome, others of unqueſtionable authority.
Thoſe recorded by <hi>St. Hierom, St Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,
St. Chriſoſtome, St. Athanaſius, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius,
Theodoret, Lactantius, Epiphanius,
St. Cyprian, Euſebius, Evagrius, &amp;c.</hi> all
men of great prudence, and integrity;
although many of the particulars written
by them, are owned by <hi>Oſiander</hi> and the
<hi>Centuriſts, &amp;c.</hi> (no friends of ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which both in ſubſtance, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
make highly againſt them, and their
up-ſtart tenets) would, I fear, be ſubject
to the ſame exception, as being of too
ſtale a date. And thoſe of <hi>St. Malachy,</hi>
written by his ſamiliar friend, <hi>St. Bernard;</hi>
as alſo thoſe of <hi>St. Bernard</hi> himſelf, written
by his contemporary, and ſcholar, <hi>Godefri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi>
as alſo thoſe wrought by the two
great founders of Religious life, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>St. Francis,</hi> and <hi>St. Dominick,</hi> and
many others, though not many ages ſince,
yet becauſe ſomething at leaſt out of ours,
and our fathers memories, will hardly be
admitted as current. But why thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wrought almoſt in our own daies,
at the converſion of <hi>Congo,</hi> a region of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30313:43"/>
               <hi>Afrique,</hi> which are recorded by Mr.
<hi>Abraham Hartwell,</hi> in his book dedicated
to the Archbiſhop, <hi>Anno 1597. and done
by Gods omnipotency in the preſence of a
whole Army; (lib. 2. cap.</hi> 3.) <hi>and the
ſame mentioned, and acknowledged by</hi> Mr.
John Porey, <hi>not long ſince of Gonvil and
Cajus Colledge in Cambridge, in his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall
deſcription of Africa, publiſhed
in the year 1610. pag. 410. 413. where
he approves of, and commends</hi> Mr. Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<hi>for publiſhing his foreſaid</hi> Treatiſe;
why theſe, I ſay, and the like, ſhould
now be diſputed, I ſee no ground, or
reaſon, if there be any thing of credit, or
belief, left in the world. Again, thoſe many
miraculous paſſages, which have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Lorett<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> at our Ladies of <hi>Sichem &amp;c.</hi>
are ſo witneſſed, and owned, by the
whole Chriſtian world, as evident ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
works of the omnipotent hand
of God, that of him, who ſhould now go
about to contradict them, we might with
all the reaſon in the world ſay, what the
great <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> has, in the preface of
his <hi>Diva Sichemenſis, or Aſpricollis, printed
at Antwerp, in the year 1605. Quid enim
de hominibus dicam, &amp;c. For what ſhall I
ſay of ſuch men who ſhould go about to deny,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30313:43"/>
or ſo much as doubt of theſe ſo evident things,
but that they are not men? or, that they
wilfully ſhut their eyes, that they may not
ſee ſo clear a ſun-ſhine of truth? For, moſt
of theſe things have been evident to our very
ſenſes.</hi> And again, in the beginning of his
fifth chapter; <hi>Behold, theſe things were
done in our very ſight, and hearing. They
were celebrated with the concourſe, applauſe,
and ſpiritual profit of nations. what credit
can be given to human things, if it be here
denyed?</hi> I cannot omit to put you in mind
of that one particular paſſage, which
you may have met with in this Author,
<q>chap. 45. concerning one <hi>John Clement,</hi>
native of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> who was of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
a ſhape, his thighs and his feet
being contracted and turn'd upwards
towards the fore-part of his breaſt, ſo
as his knees did grow, and ſtick thereto,
his body round, or ſphericall, unfit to
ſtand, lie, or go; and had been ſo, and
known to be ſo, by the whole town
of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> for twenty years; that
was, from his nativity, or rather from
the time of his being cut out of his
mothers womb, after ſhe was dead in
labour of ſo monſtrous a creature. This
poor man then, as <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> relates
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30313:44"/>
in his foreſaid book, and fourty fifth
chapter, in the year of our Lord 1603.
and moneth of <hi>July,</hi> being moved in
his mind to go to our Ladies Chappel
at <hi>Sichem in Brabant,</hi> where he had
heard of many miraculous cures report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been done, was carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a wagon, and having done his
devotions with much fervour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
in concluſion he felt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and bound up thighs and feet
to be looſed, and ſtretched forth, ſo as
preſently he ſtood on his feet, to the
great amazement both of himſelf
and the beholders, who had ſeen in
what a ſad condition he had entred into
the holy place that very day. <hi>Lipſius</hi>
profeſſeth, that he himſelf examined the
ableſt phyſicians he could meet with,
about this accident, and they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
(though ſome of them, ſaies he,
not at all credulous of things of this
nature) that this was certainly an effect
of the powerfull hand of God. And
the thing was made ſo publique by the
diſcourſe of all, that ſundry gentlemen,
attendants of the <hi>Earle of Hartford,</hi> then
Ambaſſadour in thoſe parts made it
their buſineſs to be ſatisfied of the truth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30313:44"/>
of things, as well by ſeeing, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating
the party himſelf, as by other
publick, and authentique teſtimonies
of the fact, and could not diſcover
any thing with reaſon to except againſt.
This is freſh, as I may ſay; having
happened in the very age we live in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I might alſo think it very reaſonable,
to exact ſome credit to be given to thoſe
ſtrange things done in the other world,
I mean in the</hi> Indies, <hi>by the meanes, and
interceſſion of the great Apoſtle of thoſe
parts,</hi> St. Francis Xaverius, <hi>in the times
neighbouring cloſe to our age alſo: The
particulars whereof were examined
with very great ſtrictneſs, by the expreſs
command of the king of</hi> Portugall, <hi>and
atteſted by the oaths of ſo many perſons
of worth, and reputation, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the book called</hi> Rerum in Oriente
geſtarum Commentarius, <hi>may well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to ſay, as he does pag. 8. and be
believed,</hi> that upon execution of the ſaid
King of Portugalls commiſſion to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,
for examining the ſaid miracles &amp;c.
and Certificate thereupon being made, it did
appear, that Xaverius, in teſtimony and
proof of the Chriſtian faith, by him then
preached, and taught, cured miraculouſly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30313:45"/>
the dumb, the lame, the deaf, and with his
word healed the ſick: and (fol. 9.) raiſed
ſundry dead perſons to life; and that after
his death; (<hi>as is there related, fol.</hi> 14)
Anno 1552. the grave being opened
wherein his dead body for a time had lain
buried in lime to the end his naked bones
might be carried from thence to Goa (<hi>fol.</hi>
15.) they found his body not only uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,
but alſo yeilding forth fragrant
ſmells; although in the ſevere triall, and
ſearch, made by command of ſome great-ones,
it was found, that he was neither embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor bowelled. His body is ſtill kept at
Goa; Where to this day (ſayes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary)
it remaineth free from corruption:
witneſs whereof (ſaith the ſaid Treatiſe)
are all the Inhabitants of that City, and
travellers, that repaire thither.</p>
            <p>It is not many years ſince that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
was written; which ſpeaks in
this manner of that holy Saints body,
remaining <hi>incorrupt to that very day.</hi> And
to our comfort the ſame wonder ſtill
continues even in our daies, as very late
information aſſures us, eſpecially from
the mouth of a worthy grave perſon,
whoſe care it was, for five years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſee it decently kept; and who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30313:45"/>
was a daily Eye-witneſs, during that
time, of the miracle.</p>
            <p>Neither has Almighty God been back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in his favours to <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, by
the meanes of the ſame great Apoſtle;
as might be evidenced by moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
proofs, had I not tranſgreſſ'd too
farr in this point already. And yet in
this (I hope no very unpleaſant) ſubject, I
muſt beg your leave to inſiſt a little longer;
at leaſt till I have minded you of that
famous miracle, wrought upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Marcello Maſtrilli</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> in the
year 1584. on the third of Jan. in ſome
of our memories, I am ſure of it. You
may ſee it more at large in <hi>Bartoli,</hi> or
in the late learned Treatiſe of <hi>Reaſon and
Religion,</hi> written by E. W. with the
proofs, and unqueſtionable teſtimonies
thereof. There are thoſe yet living, (as
you may eaſily gueſs) who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the wonder, and ſaw with their
eyes a man deſpaired of by all the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
and ſurgeons; who having layn
moſt dangerouſly ſick of a violent feavour,
cauſed by a terrible wound received in
his head, twenty-four-dayes together,
withall the ſymptoms imaginable of
death upon him, inſomuch that all things
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30313:46"/>
neceſſary for his buriall were put in a
readineſs, upon a ſudden, and almoſt in
a moment as I may ſay, by a viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of that great Apoſtle, <hi>St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Xaverius,</hi> and by the application only
of certain holy relicks, according to the
direction of the ſaid Saint, ſo perfectly
reſtored to health, that he, who for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
daies before had not been able to turn,
or ſtirr himſelf in his bed, immediately
roſe nimbly out of it, threw off the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
with which the wound of his head
was bound up, caſt himſelf down upon
his knees, to give God thanks for his
miraculous reſtauration, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of his holy patron; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
himſelf with eating ſome thing,
whereas he had not been able for many
dayes before, to ſwallow ſo much as a
drop of water. That very night he writ
the whole relation, of what had paſſ't
with him and the bleſſed Saint, with his
own hand, ſaid maſs in the Church the
next morning, and that very day, for
many hours together, was obliged to be
preſent at the juridicall examination of
the fact, before the Cardinall, Archbiſhop
of the place: And all this after ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of weakneſs, both from his long
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30313:46"/>
ſickneſs, and almoſt continuall fits of
Convulſion, without the leaſt difficulty,
or decay of ſpirits. Not long after, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt aſſiſted the Lady, his mother, in
her laſt ſickneſs, he prepared himſelf for
the performance of the vow he had made,
during the time of his danger, (and
which the bleſſed Saint, who appeared
to him, cauſed him to renew in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence)
of dedicating himſelf to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of poor ſoules in the Indies,
where (as now at the time of his cure
foretold him by the H. Saint) he, ſome
few years after, ſuffer'd martyrdome for
the faith of Chriſt: which alſo was not
without miracle. for, having by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, eſcaped the ordinary cruel
torture of water, uſed by thoſe Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and which none uſe to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
certain death, he was at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
after the executioner had ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
times endeavoured to do his office, but
without effect; his ſtrength failing him,
till the holy man himſelf gave him leave,
or commiſſion, for it. And of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
concerning his dying for Chriſt,
(which could not be, but from the all-ſeeing
providence of God) there are
many yet living, and among others my
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30313:47"/>
unworthy ſelf, who can declare upon
oath, that they had notice of it, ſome
years before it came to paſs. In ſo much,
that as I have been informed from a very
good hand, the late Lord of <hi>Caernarvan,</hi>
that valiant and worthy perſon, who
afterwards teſtified his loyalty to his
prince by the loſs of his life, happening
to be in the court of <hi>Spain,</hi> when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrilli</hi>
paſs't by <hi>Madrid</hi> in his way to take
ſhipping for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and by the command of the king
of <hi>Spain,</hi> was obliged to make relation
of the whole paſſage of his miraculous
cure, the ſaid Lord of <hi>Caernarvan</hi> was
heard to ſay, <hi>that if the man did go into
the Indies, and there loſe his life, as he had
ſaid was foretold him, he would believe all
he ſaid for ſcripture. I would to God ſome of
our Nullifidians could be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, at leaſt as farr, as human faith
ſeems to oblige them.</hi> I ſhould hope, it
would be a ſtep, or diſpoſition toward
their believing ſomething, in which they
are more nearly concerned.</p>
            <p>But againſt much of this I hear there
is a certain Engliſh Doctour, (who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
would gladly <hi>ſee ſome of
theſe things with his own eyes; and then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30313:47"/>
he would tell us more of his mind</hi>) who
for once is contented to enter into league
with a <hi>Roman</hi> Doctour; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he ſeems to hate (as bad as Hell
does Holy-water) any thing, that has
relation to that ſuperſtitious place; and
he tells us from his <hi>Roman</hi> Dr.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> in his 2. diſcourſe, in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtant grounds of faith: <hi>pag. 685. and pag.</hi> 617.</note> 
               <hi>that it
is ſo ordinary an
effect of nature to
preſerve bodies a
long time from
corruption, by the
uſe of lime, &amp;c.
that it is meere
ignorance to take the late mentioned incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the body of St. Francis Xavier,</hi>
(which the reſt of the world ſo much
admires, as an effect of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to that Apoſtolical man) <hi>for any
thing extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>praeternatural.</hi>
But with this Doctours good leave, the
general perſwaſion of the world, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom we find ſome Doctours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo)
grounded upon experience, and the
corroding, or rather <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> quality,
and force of <hi>unſleck't lime,</hi> (not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
perchance, expreſſed by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Doctours ſingle word <hi>Calx</hi>) with which
the body of <hi>St. Xaverius</hi> was twice co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30313:48"/>
is contrary. But then we would
gladly know, from this learned empirick,
how this dead body of the Saint came
to be preſerv'd entire, freſh, moiſt, and
ſweet, (more then ordinary living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
many moneths, nay years, after that
<hi>natural preſerver</hi> of his was taken from it:
or whether he has any thing in his own,
or his <hi>Roman</hi> Doctours experience, which
tells him, that bodies once covered with
lime, do afterwards preſerve themſelves,
or are preſerved by ſome relict quality,
from the lime for moneths and years.
This, I am ſure, would be new, and
worth ſo great an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
For his <hi>Roman</hi> Doctour does
here abſolutely deſert him; who in the
ſame place, and number cited by our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctour, concludes it to be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
where there are found ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
as were diſcovered by many
curious Inſpectours into the incorrupt
body of St. <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi> But any thing
muſt paſs, rather then God ſhould ſeem
to have any regard to the honour of his
Saints, or any miraculous thing be done
by them, or at their interceſſion.</p>
            <p>And yet I am half of opinion, that
this good Gentleman, (whether before
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30313:48"/>
he was well awars or no, I cannot well
tell) had ſome more reſpect then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
for this great Apoſtle of the Indies;
ſeeing he is pleas'd to own,<note place="margin">Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet, ibid. pag. 615.</note> 
               <hi>that if it
were at any time reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to expect a power of
miracles, it would be for
the converſion of Infidels;
and Xaverius, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
(poor Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits)
going upon ſo generous a deſign, might be
favoured in it by ſome extraordinary effects
of divine power.</hi> Only he (the good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour)
would willingly have appointed
God, what miracles he ſhould have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
them to work, in this, and the
like occaſions. <hi>Vtinam ſaperet, &amp; intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the ſcene is altered again.
<hi>For as to all thoſe miracles, whoſe relation
we have from the Jeſuits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet, ibid. pag. 617.</note> 
               <hi>we are (ſaies he)
to conſider, what credit
their teſtimony deſerves
with us. For, if they are
men, who think it lawful
to lie for a good cauſe, (as
no doubt the honour of their ſociety is ſuch
with them) how can we with any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diſcretion relie upon their words?</hi> Thus
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30313:49"/>
this ſevere Doctour is pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
his Reader. What credit they may
have with ſuch pre-reſolv'd Gentlemen,
as himſelf, and his like, I know not:
But we have a very ill account of things
abroad, if very many (who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
no fools neither, and who have
had ſome reaſon to be better acquainted
with theſe mens principles, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
then he, who (for all that we know)
never ſaw, or convers'd with any of them
in his life,) have not another opinion of
them, then the character here beſtowed
upon them ſeemes to allow. And yet I
perceive the man is ſomething wary too,
and uſhers in this pretty piece of Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his with an <hi>If. If they are men, who
think it lawfull to lye for a good cauſe, &amp;c.</hi>
It would be ſomething ſatisfactory, to
ſee in what Authour of theirs (and it is
ten to one, he has ſeen more then one
of them, in the libraries of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
or perchance in his own cloſet)
he finds this ſuppoſed doctrin of theirs,
<hi>that it is lawfull to lie for a good cauſe.</hi>
Thus much I promiſe him, that if he can
prove this to be their doctrin, I will joyn
with him, and proclaim them not only
<hi>knaves,</hi> but very <hi>fools</hi> alſo: (and that is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30313:49"/>
not the Character the world generally
gives them:) For though a lie may
take for once, when 'tis handſomely
told, and may bring ſome advantage
with it; yet to make a trade, and open
profeſſion of it, (which they muſt needs
be ſuppoſed to do, who hold it lawfull
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and hope to thrive by it, were
to take the reſt of the world to be of
very weak capacities, and to go about
to impoſe upon all mankind, which
were in effect to declare themſelves,
utterly void of all wit, and unfit for
human converſation. It is true, <hi>Omnis
homo mendax.</hi> Every man, one time
or other, by the common corruption of
nature, is ſubject to be falſe to his
principles; and to offend againſt ſome
known verity: neither do I find, that
<hi>Black coates</hi> are excepted in the general
clauſe. But to do it, and hold it <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to lie, for a good, or bad cauſe,</hi> is
a thing, for which I am pretty ſure,
none of their Authors can be quoted,
whom the Doctour is ſo civilly pleaſed
to father it upon. I confeſs, it is a
pretty odd paſſage (eſpecially with thoſe
pleaſant Comments upon it) which the
Doctour, upon the back of this his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30313:50"/>
unexpected Caution, fetches as farr as
<hi>Perſia.</hi> But, I find the Doctour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is pleaſed to furniſh <hi>Hierom Xavier</hi>
with ſeveral Authors, (good or bad, I
am not now in humour to diſpute;
for ſo much as his talent of inventing
untruths is concern'd) for part of which
this one (very poſſibly indiſcreet) <hi>Jeſuit</hi>
did utter; the Doctour himſelf mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the reſt of the ſtory with ſeveral
<hi>interpolations</hi> from others, whom we
take to be none of <hi>Xavier's</hi> tribe. But
yet we do not find, that he was either
ſo impious as to promulge this by way
of <hi>a new Goſpel,</hi> or ſo inſolent, as to
inſert many things, taking them even
from the Doctours own relation, (which
notwithſtanding I begg his leave,
with time and opportunity to examin
a little further, before I enter it into
my Creed) ſo maliciouſly falſe, as to
ground ſo general a ſuppoſal, <hi>that thoſe
of his calling think it lawfull to lie for
a good cauſe.</hi> But it is remarkably
the fortune of this great Doctour, to
be alwaies undertaking, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
at great and extraordinary
things: ſuch as indeed many have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
queſtioned, whether himſelf did
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30313:50"/>
in reality hold to be ſuch <hi>Truths,</hi> as
he ſeems to ſet them out for.</p>
            <p>Sure we are, moſt, or many of his
own pretended Party do not think
themſelves obliged to maintain or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them as ſuch. <hi>Qui nimium probat,
nihil probat,</hi> is an <hi>Axiome,</hi> which every
freſh man is ſoon acquainted with, and
knowes, by the very light of nature,
what ſuch <hi>Proofs</hi> amount to.</p>
            <p>But now, as to this particular, of
the <hi>Jeſuits holding it lawfull to lie for
a good cauſe,</hi> the thing appearing to me
to be <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> to be made good
either out of their Books, Leſſons,
Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or notorious general
practice, me thinks I have reaſon to
expect ſomething more home, and
poſitive, then has hitherto been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
or brought to light. Till this
be effectually done, I muſt believe, I
am obliged to confirm my judgment
to that of the generality of knowing
men; who have heard them ſo often
teach much better things in their
Schools and Pulpits; and who have
found them more civil in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
then either to practiſe any
ſuch thing themſelves, or brand a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30313:51"/>
large community with it: in which
there be many, who by their quality
in the world, as Gentlemen, deſerve
more civil treatment, from thoſe, who
know, what Breeding is.</p>
            <p>Amongſt others of them I find the
forementioned <hi>Marcello Maſtrilli;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom was wrought that remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
cure, deſcribed ſo lately, and
which happened ſo few years ago.
This good man was, and is, owned
by the chief nobility of <hi>Naples,</hi> to
have been a near relation of theirs;
and one, who by his actions brought
no ſtain upon his family: And yet he
alſo muſt fall under the general cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of our kind Doctour, and be
reckoned among thoſe, who make no
ſcruple <hi>to lie for a good cauſe, &amp;c.</hi>
But could the Doctour make this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
good, <hi>of his being a lier,</hi> I ſhould
not ſtick to enter that other, <hi>of his
being a fool.</hi> For, that a man ſhould
ſtretch a little too farr, in hopes of
ſome profit, or preferment, is that,
which perchance may paſs <hi>for wit,</hi> as
the world goes now a dayes. But that
a man ſhould invent a ſtory, which
ſhould oblige him to leave his native
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30313:51"/>
country, where he was in good eſteem,
both for his birth, and parts; which
in probability had been attended with
a fortune anſwerable, before he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
it, (as many more are known
to have done) upon better motives,
as may well be imagined, then to take
up a trade of lying. That he ſhould
(I ſay) in this manner oblige himſelf
to quit all theſe advantages, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his perſon to a long and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Journey, and to the cruelty of a
ſavage people, from whom he could
expect nothing, but what he found,
barbarous uſage, and a cruel death, is
beyond any maxims of modern wit, or
diſcretion. But the piercing Doctour
will (perhaps) tell us, <hi>that the honour
of his ſociety was the good cauſe,</hi> which
put him upon the contrivance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him to the execution according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
If this could be made out, I
ſhould confeſs, it were ſomething to
be admired indeed, that a man in this
age, for ſuch meer human reſpects, ſhould
become ſo great a <hi>ſelf denier:</hi> But I
doubt, would hardly be imitated by
any, but ſome of his own party; who
by his example have been moved to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30313:52"/>
abandon likewiſe their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and comforts, and venture their
lives through ſea and land, upon the
only ſcore of relieving the ſpiritual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of thoſe poor deſolate Nations.
Could we once ſee an example of this
kind in ſome of thoſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſo much Zeale for the Goſpel,
we might, perchance, be moved to
think better of <hi>their Principles.</hi> But
though their merchants, and factours,
venture indeeed yearly into thoſe Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern,
and Weſtern parts, to fetch us
home gold and ſilver, and ſilks, and
ſpices, and Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I never
heard of any of the good Doctours
Partizans, who ventur'd (without,
or with a <hi>Viaticum</hi>) to go to thoſe
remote parts upon the bare hopes of
encreaſing the flock of Chriſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
their ſtock no otherwiſe, then
by ſuffering all manner of evil uſages,
dangers, wants, and many times death
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But not to wrong the good Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
nor put more incivility upon him,
then ſome, perchance may apprehend
he deſerves, I muſt own, that I find
him ſometimes inclined (as <hi>pag. 684.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30313:52"/>
of his Second diſcourſe</hi>) to ſuppoſe
this paſſage of <hi>Maſtrilli's</hi> miraculous
cure to have ſomething of truth in
it: and I am apt to think he has
ſome reaſon for it; there being ſuch
irrefragable teſtimonies of many, who
were not Jeſuits, for the poſitive verity
of it; and ſo little to be ſaid for the
negative. For which notwithſtanding,
could it have been done, I believe,
he might have found ſome curious
wel-willers of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who would
have been induſtrious and ready enough
to have furniſhed materials.</p>
            <p>But then he comes off again with
E. W. And asks him, <hi>what this, or
the like, would make to the proof of
Pope Pius the fourth's Creed?</hi> As to
that I ſhall leave him to E. W. and
others; who, I make no queſtion,
will do him reaſon. But I muſt entreat
him in the mean time, that out of his
animoſity againſt E. W. he will not
deprive us of ſuch grounds, as make
againſt Atheiſm for Chriſtianity; the
ſupporting of which was my only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
whileſt I mention this, and ſome
few other late paſſages: ſome of
which I hope, the kind Doctour will
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30313:53"/>
not be two earneſt againſt, but think
well of, and allow; at leaſt of thoſe
mentioned by <hi>Saint Auguſtine:</hi> And
then I have my end in ſubſtance:
though theſe others, alleaged (as I
ſaid) <hi>ex abundante,</hi> ſhould fall under
ſtronger exceptions, then I find as
yet brought by any body againſt
them.</p>
            <p>Having made ſo good a return, as
I hope, out of theſe forreign parts,
I muſt needs ingage your patience once
more, whileſt I touch upon that, which
happened ſo lately in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the
year 1640. to one <hi>Michael Pellicer,</hi>
who had his leg reſtored by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of our bleſſed Lady, after it had
been cut off, ſome four fingers below
the knee, and buried in the ground,
above two whole years before. The
particulars you may find alſo more at
large, in the forecited <hi>Reaſon and Religion,
pag.</hi> 328. Certain it is, that there
were many grave perſons, as you may
there read, who had the Examination
of the buſineſs, many, who knew
the young man, whileſt he was lame
by the loſs of his leg. (the Surgeon
alſo well known, who cut it off) as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30313:53"/>
alſo when he went perfectly, and ſound
afterwards, upon both his legs; the
one being ſuddenly reſtored to him,
by the interceſſion of the Bleſſed Virgin.
Certainly if this was ſo, it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
a power more then human,
and above nature. That it was ſo, after
the teſtimonies of ſo many eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the ſtrict examination made,
and ſubſcribed by ſo many grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I cannot imagin, how any man
in reaſon, or prudence, can call in
queſtion. I know, there have been
thoſe, who being very loath, (God
knowes, upon what motives; they
muſt one day give him a very ſevere
account of them) to own any thing of
this nature; and having nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of authority, or reaſon, but only
their own fancy, and prejudice, to
object againſt it, have (according to
their cuſtome in things of difficulty, or
evidence brought againſt them) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to avoid the force of it by a
pretty piece of drollery, ſaying, <hi>That
it is an eaſie thing for a ſtump to grow
a leg, in its paſſage from Spain hither.</hi>
Such Raillery, I confeſs, might have
been expected from a man of mirth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30313:54"/>
upon the ſtage, or in a tavern, where
it is not unuſual for ſuch ſlippery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tong'd
blades to make bold with the
moſt ſerious, and the moſt ſacred things,
if they chance to come in their way,
and afford them any ſubject of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
or exerciſe of wit. But, that
a grave Doctour, in ſo ſerious a matter
ſhould have no other ſhift, and ſhould
dare to make uſe of ſo ſlight an one,
or imagin any ſober underſtanding
man ſhould be ſatisfied with it, is very
ſtrange, and indeed ſomething prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
But I leave him to make his beſt
of it: Though I cannot but heartily
wiſh, that both he and others would
make that uſe of theſe, and many other
events of the ſame, or like kind, (which
might have been alleaged) for which
they were intended by the Omnipotent
worker of them; which certainly was,
to raiſe in us a lively faith of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and power of God above nature;
and conſequently a reſolution to obſerve
the will, and commands of this our
great, and good God, though it were
neceſſary for this end, to renounce
thoſe inclinations of fleſh, and blood,
and ſenſe, which are (as is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30313:54"/>
the real grounds, and motives of
our denying, or waving ſuch other
principles, as do much more become
the dignity, and worth of thoſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſoules, with which he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
us.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt make a diſcovery,
and ſpeak plainly my ſenſe, which is,
That, that which ought to be our cure,
is the ground of our diſeaſe. The
conſideration of theſe extraordinary,
Supernatural works of God ought in
reaſon to move us to reverence, and
adore his greatneſs; as alſo to check
our unruly natures, in obedience to
him, and his commands, who is the
Authour of nature. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it falls out too too often, that
diſcovering him, by theſe great works
of his, to ſtand in our way, though
our underſtandings (at firſt at leaſt)
cannot chuſe but think it reaſonable,
to comply with the duty we owe to
ſo great a God, his poſitive laws, and
that of nature, obliging us to it; yet
the love we have of our own wills,
and the extraordinary kindneſs we have
for the ſenſual inclinations of fleſh
and blood, work ſo powerfully, by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30313:55"/>
little and little, upon us, that we begin
to be willing to deny him, not only
a due ſubjection, but even a common
being amongſt, and providence over
his creatures. For I take it to be as
great a truth, as any in morality, that
<hi>Atheiſm ſeldome, or never, begins in the
underſtanding;</hi> but that it is bred, and
born <hi>in the will;</hi> and that when men
are once reſolved to abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to liberty, and ſenſe, then they
caſt about, how to rid themſelves of
any thing, which may check them in
this their pleaſant courſe. And then
away with reaſon, away with honour,
away with conſcience, away with God
himſelf. And when they are once
come thus farr, and feel ſomething of
that, which they call <hi>ſweet Liberty,</hi>
what wonder, if they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with it, as farr as it will go, and
as long as it is capable of pleaſing
them; and laugh at, and make ſport
with thoſe, who take a more ſober,
and ſerious courſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall never forget that pleaſant
paſſage between Sir <hi>Thomas Moor's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilier,</hi>
and his <hi>honeſt Frier.</hi> I pray
pardon me for troubling you with a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30313:55"/>
ſtory, (or tale, if you pleaſe to call it
ſo) which is ſo well known; I wiſh
only, the import of it were as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reflected upon. <q>The good
<hi>Frier,</hi> going one day abroad into
the country, either to beg relief for
his Convent, or about ſome Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
employment, for the ſpiritual
aſſiſtance of his neighbour, was met
accidentally by a Gentleman, well
mounted, and well and warmly
clad, as the ſeaſon of the year re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
The poor <hi>Frier</hi> was fain to
make uſe of his own legs, and had
but his ſingle garment; which, though
courſe enough, yet was too thin to
guard him ſufficiently from the cold
weather: his legs and feet bare,
only ſaved harmleſs from the ſtones
by a paire of woodden clogs <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The frolick Gentleman thought this
a fit ſubject for his drollery, and ſo
accoſted him with the uſual ſalute,</hi>
of well met, Father: how do you do?
<hi>The good</hi> Frier <hi>had nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

And beſides, your ſtockings (I doubt) do
not bear out the wet and dirt, no more
then the upper part of your ſhoes; (<hi>his

as for the wet and cold I meet with, it

for Gods ſake. Heaven, Sir, is
worth this, and a great deal more. Ay,

you ſay ſomething indeed. But what if
there be neither God, nor Heaven;
where are you then? <hi>The good, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
Frier <hi>was quick to this, ſaying,</hi>
Ay but, my dear Sir, If there be a God,
and a Heaven, and a Hell, where's
your worſhip then? <hi>My good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had no more to reply, but march't
fairly off, rubbing his hands, as if he
had met with a nettle.</hi>

pleaſant-humour'd Gentleman, of a
plentifull Fortune, of a handſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

your age: You are unwilling to let
any field, or place, or opportunity
paſs, without taſting, or taking your
fill of all the pleaſures they afford you
right or wrong, with the allowance, or
againſt the expreſs command, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the living God. And for your
greater encouragement in this, which
you uſe to call <hi>enjoying your ſelf,</hi> you
ſay (perchance) in your heart, <hi>why
not? whom am I to pleaſe, but my
ſelf? It may be, there is no ſuch thing,
as ſimple, or fearfull men talk of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for thoſe, who live otherwiſe then
I do; or a Hell for thoſe, who think
well of, and follow my pleaſant practice:
nay, perchance not ſo much as a God,
who takes notice of theſe my waies, and
intends to diſpoſe of me hereafter accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>
But now, I pray, Sir, what if
there be? what if there be an eternity
