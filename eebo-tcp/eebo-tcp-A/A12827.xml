         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One is because the reuenues of the sayd places dissolued heretofore, were spent in the countrey and went from hand to hande there, for vittaile cloth and other thinges: and now are gone to one place out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trey.

                  <p>Truth it is also, that it wringed the countrey abroade for the time, and had kept it so still if the Kinges Maiesty had not dispersed the same lands abroad among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Doth not all theyr toules customes, taxes, tallages, and subsidies chiefely growe by such artificers? What king can mainteine his estate with his yearely reuenues onely growing of his landes: For as many seruaunts in a house well set a worke, gaines euery man somwhat to their mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: So doth euery artificer in a Realme ech gaine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and altogether a great masse to the king &amp; his realm euery yeare it brigeth.</p>

The occasions or causes of these, although I haue before diuersly declared after the diuersitie of mens mindes and opinions. Yet here I wyll take out of the same, But onely such as I thinke verely to be the very iust occasions in deede. For as I shewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, diuers men diuersly iudge, this or that to be the cause<note place="margin">The originall cause in euery thing is to be searched.</note> or occasion of this or that griefe, and bicause there may bee diuers causes of one thinge, and yet but one principal cause that bryngeth forth the thinge to passe: Let vs seeke oute y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause, omitting all the meane causes, which are driuen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the least oryginall cause, as in a presse going in at a slraight, the formost is driuen by him that is nexte hym, &amp; the next by him that followes him, and the third by some vi olent and stronge thing that dryues him forwarde, whych is the first and pryncipall cause of the putting forwarde of the rest afore him. If he were kept backe and staied, al they that goe afore would stay withal. To make this more plain vnto you: as in a clocke there be many wheeles, yet the first wheele being sturred it dryueth the next, and that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thyrde &amp;c. till the last that moues the instrument that strickes the clocke: so in making of an house, there is the maister that would haue the house made, there is the Carpenter, &amp; there is the stuffe to make the house with al: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sluffe neuer stirres till the worke man do set it forward, the workeman neuer trauailes but as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maister prouoketh him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good wages, and so he is the principall cause of this house making. And this cause is of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> learned called efficient, as that, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bringeth the pryncipal thing to effect.

and therefore they be called of some causae sine quibus non, and of some other <hi>Materiales, &amp; Formales,</hi> but all commeth to one purpose.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of all thinges reared by tillage, for it requires both great charge of seruaunts &amp; of labor.
