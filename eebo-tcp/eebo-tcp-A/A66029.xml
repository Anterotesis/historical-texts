            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may justly seem a wonder, that amongst the vast multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Books, wherewith the world does abound, there should be so little written of this subject here insisted upon, being in it self of such great consequence, and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>There is scarce any kinde of skill, or ability which may be taught and learnt, but it hath been reduced to an <hi>Art,</hi> and laid down according to some rules and method, for the more facil and full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60725:3"/>How copious are the Treatises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning humane <hi>Oratory?</hi> and divers have written particularly of the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> besides the many <hi>Examples</hi> of it in <hi>Homilies,</hi> or Sermons. And so likewise for the <hi>models</hi> or <hi>patterns</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> which are very numerous, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all Languages But for the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or the rules whereby a man may be directed to an ability of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or pouring out his soul in this duty; there is (for ought I can finde) but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle written of it in any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anguage, though it be of such general use for all kinds, and professions of men, and though the <hi>Gift</hi> be as much better then the <hi>Pattern,</hi> as the <hi>Receipt</hi> is better then the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very sensible that the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty in a <hi>spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> is by infusion from above, and does not fall under the rules of <hi>Art,</hi> but yet
<pb facs="tcp:60725:3"/>
there are some special advantages in the performance of it, both for the furnishing of the <hi>judgement,</hi> and the exciting of the <hi>affections,</hi> which a man may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with by study and premeditation; and the enquiry after these is the proper subject of this discourse.</p>
            <p>Every one will be ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for an excellent ability, when a man can readily sute his desires unto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral emergencies, and upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion pray without book; but many look upon it as being extreme difficult, and not for an ordinary person to attaine. That which is here endeavoured, is to make it plaine and facil.</p>
            <p>There are three special hinderances which do indispose men for this service; want of <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> &amp; <hi>Words;</hi> for the supply of which, here is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a copious feild of <hi>Matter,</hi> a regular frame for <hi>method,</hi> and Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:60725:4"/>
phrase for <hi>Expression,</hi> which no man need be ashamed to imitate or borrow.</p>
            <p>The knowledge and consideration of these things, must needs be very usefull for all callings of men, (every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned to performe the <hi>duty,</hi> and consequently to labour after the <hi>Gift</hi>) Especially for such whose businesse it is, after a more peculiar manner <hi>to give themselves unto Prayer,</hi>

               <p>It is of very great concernment for every man
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60725:6"/>
to be rightly acquainted with it in both these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: How it <hi>must</hi> be <hi>performed</hi> as a <hi>Duty,</hi> and how it <hi>may</hi> be <hi>attained</hi> as a <hi>Gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am at this time to discourse of it only in this latter sence: The <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed-</p>
               <p>It is such a readinesse and faculty proceeding from the Spirit of God whereby a man is inabled upon all occasions in a fitting manner to expresse and to enlarge the desires of his heart in this duty.</p>
               <p>Unto the attaining of this Gift in its true lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and fulnesse, there are three sorts of ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Something to be <hi>infused</hi> by the Spirit of God, who must sanctifie, and spiritualize the judgement and affections, before we can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend, or desire any thing as we should.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some <hi>natural</hi> endowments and abilities disposing us for this Gift, as Readinesse of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, Copiousnesse of Phancy, Tendernesse of Affection, Confidence, and volubility of Speech, &amp;c. which are very great advantages to this purpose, being naturally much more eminent in some then in others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Something to be <hi>acquired</hi> or gotten by our own industry. Namely, such a particular and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct apprehension, both of our sins and wants, and the mercies bestowed upon us, that we may be able to expresse the thoughts and dispositions of our minds concerning them, in such a decent forme, as may excite both in our selves and others sutable affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60725:6"/>The first of these is by some stiled the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer: the two later the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer: the two first of these do not fall under the rules of Art, being not to be taught or learnt, and therefore to these our endeavours cannot of themselves contribute, the one being a special grace, the other a common gift of the Spirit grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on innate propensity of temper or constitution; and so tis the third cheifly that concerns our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent inquiry.</p>
               <p>Each of these may be separated from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There may be true <hi>grace</hi> in the heart, where there is but a very small measure either of this <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> ability. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, a man may have the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer, who has not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer; that is, there may be a great degree of these common gifts in such as are altogether estranged from the life of grace.<note place="margin">Psa. 68.18</note> 'Tis probable that <hi>Judas</hi> was eminent for these, and therefore was chose an Apostle; and so those others, who at the last day shall plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Lord have not we preached in thy name, and cast out Devils, &amp;c.</hi> they did all this <hi>in his Name</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat 7.22.</note> that is, they were by him both outwardly <hi>called</hi> and <hi>gifted</hi> for these services.</p>
               <p>Such as have onely the second of these may sometimes exceed those that have the third, whence it comes to passe that men of very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary parts in respect of any <hi>acquired</hi> abilities, may be more ready and copious in this service, then those who in respect of other knowledge are much beyond them.</p>
               <p>But then only is this Gift compleat, when there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60725:7"/>
is a joynt concurrence of all these three ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, when the heart is sanctified, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities improved by industry.</p>
               <p>That is a very apposite text to this purpose, and does treat particularly concerning this subject <hi>Prayer,</hi> under the notion of a Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi>

               <p>So then all kinde of good habits or abilities, and particularly this gift of Prayer, with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees, or ingredients of it are to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto the Spirit of God, as being the cheif donor of them.</p>

               <p>In the Primitive times indeed when the Church was in its <hi>Infancy,</hi> then the teat was put into their mouthes, they were extraordinarily inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with these gifts by immediate infusions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the usual means of study and labour; but

               <head>CHAP. II. Two extreams that make men defective in this Gift. Confining themselves wholly to set-formes. Depending wholly upon sudden suggestions.</head>
               <p>FRrom what hath been already said, 'tis easie to inferre that there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams which usually hinder men from a proficiency in this Gift.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they so confine themselves to the help of books and particular set-formes, as not to aime at or attempt after any farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60725:10"/>
of their own knowledge and abilities in this kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men depend altogether upon sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den suggestions, as if it were a quenching, or confinement of the Spirit, to be furnished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with matter or expressions for this service.</p>
               <p>Unto those that erre in the first kinde, I would suggest these considerations.</p>
               <p>First, by way of concession: As for those weaker Christians and new Converts, who have not their hearts enlarged with an ability to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse their own wants and desires, 'tis both lawful, and convenient for such to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not onely in their <hi>families,</hi> but even in their <hi>secret</hi> performance of this dutie, by the use of some good book or prescribed form, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by farther endeavour and experience, they may attain unto some measure of this gift.</p>
               <p>Such persons may perhaps finde oftentimes their own case and condition more pithily and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately set down in a prayer penn'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they are able to expresse it themselves. And if the use of such a form do prove a means to warm their affections, and enkindle their graces, certainly then it cannot be justly stiled a quenching of the Spirit. 'Tis not <hi>essential</hi> unto the nature of prayer, that it be either read, or rehearsed by memory, or by immediate and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den suggestion; (these things being such <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall</hi> adjuncts, as have not any absolute intrinsecall necessity or unlawfulnesse) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it be delivered with understanding and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60725:10"/>
suitable affections, with humility and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an inward sense of our conditions. Nor is there any great difference (as they are considered in themselves) betwixt repeating by memory, and reading out of a <hi>Book</hi>; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory being but a kinde of invisible Book for the register of our thoughts, though in this case it should be specially remembred, that in the use of such prescript formes, to which a man has been accustomed, he ought to be narrowly watchfull over his own heart, for fear of that lip-service, and formality, which in such cases we are more especially exposed unto. This I thought good to premise for the removall of prejudice on the one hand.</p>
               <p>But now in the second place, for any one so to set down and satisfie himself with his Book-Prayer, or some prescript form, as to go no farther, this were still to remain in his Infancy, and not to grow up in his new nature: This would be as if a man who had <hi>once</hi> need of crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, should <hi>alwayes</hi> afterwards make use of them, and so necessitate himself to a continual impotence. 'Tis the duty of every Christian to grow and increase in all the parts of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as well <hi>gifts</hi> as <hi>graces,</hi> to exercise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every holy gift, and not to stifle any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hose abilities wherewith God has endowed them. Now how can a man be said to live suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto these rules, who does not put forth himself in some attempts, and endeavours of this kinde? and then besides, how can such a man suit his desires unto several emergencies? What
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60725:11"/>
one sayes of <hi>counsel</hi> to be had from books, may be fitly applied to this <hi>Prayer</hi> by book; That 'tis commonly of it self, something flat and dead, floating for the most part too much in <hi>generalities,</hi> and not <hi>particular</hi> enough for each severall occasion. There is not that life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in it, to engage the affections, as when it proceeds immediately from the soul it self, and is the natural expression of those particulars, whereof we are most sensible.</p>
               <p>And if it be a fault not to strive and labour after this gift, much more is it to jeer and despise it by the name of <hi>ex tempore Prayer,</hi> and praying <hi>by the Spirit</hi>; which expressions (as they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used by some men by way of reproach) are for the most part a sign of a prophane heart, and such as are altogether strangers from the power and comfort of this duty.</p>
               <p>Whereas 'tis commonly objected by some, that they cannot so well joyn in an unknown form, with which they are not beforehand acquainted; I answer; that's an inconsiderate objection, and does oppose all kinde of formes that are not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely prescribed. As a man may in his <hi>judgement</hi> assent unto any divine <hi>truth</hi> delivered in a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> which he never heard before; So may he joyn in his <hi>affections</hi> unto any holy <hi>desire</hi> in a <hi>Prayer,</hi> which he never heard before. If he who is the mouth of the rest, shall through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence deliver that which we cannot approve of, God does not look upon it as our Prayer, if our desires do not say <hi>Amen</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>If it be again objected, that this ability of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60725:11"/>
praying without Book, may perhaps be fit for Ministers, and such as are of more eminent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge, but is not to be expected from others.</p>
               <p>I answer, 'tis true, such persons are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially concerned in this <hi>Gift,</hi> and 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fault and shame for <hi>them</hi> to be without it; but yet <hi>others</hi> are not exempted from labouring after it, no more then they are from the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or need of it, or performing the <hi>Duty.</hi> And as for the pretended difficulty of it, I shall in this discourse make it evident, that if it be but <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> attempted (as all religious businesses ought to be) 'tis easie to be attained by any one that has but common capacity.</p>
               <p>Unto those that are in the other extream, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending altogether upon sudden infusion, and neglecting to prepare themselves for this service, by study and premeditation, unto such I would propose these considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Concession. 'Tis true, a man ought not to tye himself, so precisely unto any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form of words (though of his own compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and fitted to his condition) but that he may either adde or alter, according as any emergent occasion, or some new affection suggested shall require. Sometimes perhaps he shall feel his heart more warm, his desires more vigorous, and his expressions more copious and ready. And in this case he should not suffer himself to be streightened, or confined within any old form, but may expatiate more freely according as he findes his inward inlargements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60725:12"/>But then to the second place, this do's not hinder, but that <hi>generally</hi> 'tis both lawful and necessary to prepare our selves, as for this gift in <hi>generall,</hi> so for every <hi>particular</hi> act of it, by premeditating; (if we have leisure for it) both matter, and order, and words. For though it be a gift of the Spirit, yet 'tis not to be expected, that it should be suddenly infused into us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any precedent endeavours of our own, no more then the Gift of Preaching, for which the ablest Ministers are bound to prepare themseves, with diligence and studie, there being not any ground for a man to expect more immediate sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from above in the duty of Prayer, then in that of Preaching.</p>
               <p>But here it should be considered, that there is in this businesse of preparations great difference to be allowed for, in respect of
<list>
                     <item>Persons.</item>
                     <item>Times.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a vast distance betwixt the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of severall persons, even those that have been practised and experienced in this kind, some being naturally of a warmer temper, more easie affections and ready expression; others more cold and slow in each of these. Now the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>udy and strictnesse in the preparation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words, is not alike required from each of these. The proportion of gifts, which any man hath received, is the measure of his work and duty: To whom much is given, of him much will be required, in respect of <hi>preheminence</hi> and <hi>abilitie:</hi> And <hi>when the iron is blunt, a man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60725:12"/>
must put to the more strength,</hi> in respect of <hi>care</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi>; one of these ought to be the more <hi>able</hi> and <hi>eminent,</hi> the other ought to be the more <hi>studious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The measure of one mans gifts is not a rule for another man to work by, or to be censured by. And therefore (by the way) 'tis a great mistake in those who are apt to judge one man as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing short in his <hi>duty,</hi> because he has not the same eminency of <hi>gifts</hi> with another; though such an one perhaps, can with fitting, proper expressions, inlarge himself in this duty upon any sudden occasion, yet he should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne another that cannot. Our <hi>abilities</hi> are not rules for <hi>other mens actions. God accepteth according to what a man hath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12</note> 
                  <hi>and not according to what a man hath not.</hi> In respect of <hi>duty</hi> we should labour to emulate the best, but in matter of <hi>Gifts,</hi> as we must not neglect the means of improving them; So we must be content with our portion, though we come behinde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, if our affections could alwayes <hi>lead</hi> our prayers, then the expression would be more facil, and the premeditation might be the lesse. But because there will be sometimes a necessity that our affections should <hi>follow,</hi> and be stirred up by our expressions, (which is especially to be aimed at, when we pray in publick, in reference to those that joyn with us) and will very often fall out likewise in our secret devotions; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis requisite that a man should be alwayes furnished with such premeditated formes, as may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60725:13"/>
be most effectual to this end, namely to excite the affections.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose, if those heads, which will be alwayes pertinent, and of continual necessity, were comprehended in some set forme, studied with care and diligence, they might perhaps be more serviceable for the stirring up of our faith, and affections, then they could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be, if they did proceed onely from our own sudden conceptions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We should likewise distinguish betwixt the several <hi>times,</hi> and occasions of performing this duty, when we are call'd to it, either <hi>publickly</hi> with others, or <hi>secretly</hi> betwixt God and our own souls. Now there is not the same degree of premeditation and study required for each of these; A man may in secret take a greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to inlarge himself in such sudden expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are not in themselves perhaps so proper, and significant, which yet may be suitable to the present intention, because they set forth his own immediate thoughts. But now when we are to be the mouth of others, then our businesse must be to engage their affections that joyn with us, and therefore our expressions here should be so proper, and deliberate, as may be most effectual to this end; now such kinde of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated formes; as may serve well enough to set forth our own desires, will not perhaps be so proper to excite anothers.</p>
               <p>That is certainly the fittest <hi>forme,</hi> which does most adequately answer the chief <hi>end</hi> of Prayer, namely, to stirre up the affections, and expresse
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60725:13"/>
the desires: Now this in our publick devotions, where we are to joyne with others, and to make impression upon them, I say in such cases this may generally better be done by study and premeditation, then by leaving it to sudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. Such crude notions, and confused matter, as some men by their neglect in this kinde will vent, does rather nauseate and flat the devotion then excite it.</p>
               <p>And therefore upon such occasions we should take care that our expressions be so weighty, and serious, as may be suitable to the end, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of this service; and the lesse any mans former practice and experience hath been, by so much the greater ought his warinesse and study to be at such times.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but observe two kinde of imprudencies, with which good men are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apt to be overtaken, an affectation of <hi>length,</hi> and an affectation of continual <hi>varying their phrase,</hi> when as their inward inlargements do not perhaps fit them for either.</p>
               <p>And by this means, they become exposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some empty, impertinent, unseemly expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They should consider, that though it be in it self very useful, and argues an excellent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do these things well, yet there may be too great an affectation of them. And then besides, neither is every man, nor perhaps any man at all times fit for them; I mention these onely as right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand infirmities, upon which profane men will be apt to take great advantages, and to confirme themselves in their prejudices, and therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60725:14"/>
prudent Christian should be watchful against them.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more unsuitable to the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this duty, to that reverence which we owe unto the divine Majesty, then to bespeak him in a loose, carelesse, empty manner, though God is not bettered by any thing we can give or do; All our services being to him as nothing; yet he is pleased to esteem of them by their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suration to us, if in respect of our abilities they are the best, and with any thing below our best, we cannot expect he should be satisfied. All kinde of worship should proceed from a desire, and study to honour God, and therefore ought to be performed with our utmost care and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Under the Law men were bound to Sacrifice unto God the best of their substance; and if sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be a type of Prayer, then also we are bound to pray unto him in the best manner and forme that we can invent; and consequently in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated form, when that may be most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to direct us in our desires, and to stirre up our affections. The multiplicity of our wants, the unfaithfulnesse of our memories, the dulnesse and slownesse of our apprehensions, the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of our thoughts, will all require our best care for the remedy of them and premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be a very proper means for this purpose.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Job 9 14. Mr <hi>Caryll</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>houghts to the solemn performance of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tware of crude, tumultuary meditations; of idle, impertinent, wilde expressions; Take heed of all empty repetitions, digressions, prolixity; for God is most glorious and wise, whereas thou art a poor unworthy creature, and therefore should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not dare to bespeak him, without a great deal of fear and preparation. <hi>Let thy words be few</hi>; Not that brevity, or fewnesse of words is the proper excellency of Prayer; God is as little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with that, as with the length of them; He is not wearied and tired, as men are: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those that speak little, do probably study, and ponder more upon what they say.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose 'tis said, that the wise Preacher sought out, and gave good heed to find, and to set in order <hi>acceptable words,</hi> Eccles. 12.10. and of such words 'tis said in the next verse, that they will prove as <hi>goads</hi> and <hi>nails</hi> fastened by the Masters of Assemblies, that is, when they are deliberate and proper, they will leave a strong and lasting impression upon the hearers.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that set forms are properly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60725:15"/>
helps of insufficiency, and therefore should not be used by those that have abilities of their own.</p>
               <p>It may be answered, though set forms made by others be as a crutch or <hi>help</hi> of our <hi>insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> yet those which we compose our selves are a <hi>fruit</hi> of our <hi>sufficiency</hi>; and may likewise prove a very great advantage, for the more solemn performance of this duty, (especially in publike, and with others) both for the direction of our desires, and exciting of our affections: Though a man ought not to be so confined by any preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated form, as to neglect any special infusion. He should so prepare himself, as if he did expect no assistance; and he should so depend upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance, as if he had made no preparation.</p>
               <p>If it be objected again, that men ought to rely upon that promise, <hi>Dabitur in illa hora,</hi> Matth. 10 19. <hi>Take no thought what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same houre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, 'tis true, when God does call men to extraordinary services, of which that Scripture speaks, he does accordingly fit them with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary assistance. But yet when men may use the common means, 'tis there a great presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to depend upon extraordinary help. That's a remarkable saying of the son of <hi>Syrach: Before thou prayest, prepare thy self, and be not as one that tempts the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecc. 18.23</note> He that rushes upon this duty, without using the common means of fitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for it, does tempt God; for to tempt God, is to expect any thing from him without using the ordnary helps. So our Saviour answered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60725:15"/>
the Devill, when he would have perswaded him to fling himself from the Temple, when as there were stairs for descent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> And of this fault are those guilty, who depend so much upon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate infusion, as to neglect all premeditation or previous studie.</p>
               <p>If any should think that that phrase of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, of <hi>praying with the Spirit,</hi> does imply a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall resignation of a mans self to his immediate suggestions; That may easily appear to bee a grosse mistake, for in the very same place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14, 15. He speaks likewise of <hi>singing with the Spirit.</hi> And I presume no man would think it fitting, to rely wholly upon his bare infusions, in the duty of singing without preparation both of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> too.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer upon this subject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would willingly remove those inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate prejudices, which some of good affections may be transported with in this point; And that this holy duty might not so often suffer in the solemnity of it, by mens presumptions, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this kinde.</p>

               <p>HAving thus discoursed concerning the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of this Gift, together with the two <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi> which on either hand do so much hinder mens proficiency in it; I shall in the next place briefly suggest some few arguments or motives to engage us upon the diligent enquiry after it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>excellency</hi> of it in comparison to those other abilities, which are so much valued, and sought after in the world. As for <hi>Manual</hi> trades, men are content to bestow the labour of seven yeers in the learning of them. And so for the <hi>Liberal</hi> Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, you know what numerous and large volumes are written concerning them: how much time and pains men will lay out in the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them, counting their labour well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if after many tedious watchings they can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any kind of eminency in these professions; And yet these things can onely accommodate us with some outward conveniencies, and help us in our <hi>conversing with men</hi>; whereas this Gift of Prayer is of much higher, more universall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and does enable us to <hi>converse with God,</hi> and therefore may much better deserve our enquiry. 'Tis counted a commendable thing for men to have any special skill in Arts that are meerly for <hi>recreation</hi> and diversion of the minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60725:16"/>
more in this Gift, which is the chief refuge, and <hi>refreshment</hi> of the soul in all its dejections? 'Tis a desirable thing to be expert in <hi>humane</hi> Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereby we are able in ordinary affaires, to perswade and prevail with <hi>men</hi>: How much more in this <hi>divine</hi> Oratory, which in matters of nearest and greatest concernment does give us power to prevail with <hi>God</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>suitablenesse,</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of it, in respect of that Religion which we professe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which this gift is of such great consequence, and has such immediate relation. An ingenuous man would be ashamed to pretend unto any Art or faculty, wherein he is grossely ignorant: So may that man be to professe Religion, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to attain this Gift. A Christian that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, is like an Oratour that cannot speak, or a Travellour that cannot go; there being no other ability more necessary for us in our <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> callings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we are <hi>Artists,</hi> then this is for our <hi>general</hi> callings, as we are <hi>Christians.</hi> Now as a man would be loth either to be, or to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ignorant in the mysteries of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, so should it be a shame to us to be very defective or negligent in this gift. 'Tis part of our spiritual Armour; and for a Souldier to be without any skill in the use of his armes, is both an unsuitable and a dangerous condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the special <hi>advantages</hi> and fruits of this Gift, enabling a man upon all occasions to relate his condition, according to the special cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it; to suite his desires and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions according to several emergencies, which in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60725:17"/>
the midst of all our dejections and tumultuous thoughts, will be a meanes to induce a quietnesse, and Serenity of minde, if a man can but pour out his soul, and lay open his case before God. So that by this meanes he may have a continual supply of comfort upon every occasion; besides those special raptures and elevations of spirit, which men that are much conversant in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inquisitive after this gift, shall sometimes be affected with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> that a man shall be exposed unto by the want of it, when he is surprised by any sudden exigence, or lies under any great strait, wherein he cannot expect any help, but from the hand of God; (as who is there that can promise himself a continual freedome from such extremities, but that they may at some time or other befall him?) I say, that in such a case a man should not know how to relate his own condition, or to bespeak Gods assistance without having recourse to some prescribed forme, which perhaps hath no proper reference to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occasion; How inconvenient and prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all would this be? Our liberty of recourse to God in such cases, is one of the greatest priviledges of a Christian, and therefore our ignorance in the due manner or proper way of this addresse, must needs be a great disadvantage; there being but little difference betwixt not having a medicine, and not knowing how to apply, or make use of it.</p>
               <p>True indeed, the best men have <hi>sometimes</hi> found such a straitnesse upon their spirits, and such unaptnesse for expressions, that they have not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60725:17"/>
been able to pour out their souls in this duty, but then they have still complained of this, as being a great discomfort and unhappinesse.<note place="margin">Isa. 38.14.</note> So <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, I did chatter as a Swallow, and mourn as a Dove, mine eyes fail with looking upwards.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi>

                  <hi>Behold, how I mourn in my prayer, and make a noise.</hi> And therefore it must needs be a much greater unhappinesse to be <hi>alwayes</hi> in this condition, and under a continuall disability of expressing our own wants and desires in this duty.</p>
               <p>These particulars rightly considered cannot but inflame our hearts unto an earnest desire of this Gift.</p>

               <p>THe next thing to be discussed is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means, or directions, for the more facill attaining of this Gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where there are these two general things to be prescribed; Namely <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60725:18"/>
are likewise necessary for all other acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Without <hi>Rules</hi> a man will be apt to go compasse, and roving in the enquiry after this Gift, not the shortest and most proper way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without frequent <hi>Practice,</hi> according to these Rules, he shall never attain this habit. 'Tis not the bare knowledge of a way, without walking in it, that will bring a man to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end. Habits are both <hi>acquired</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by exercise. Those things that we learn <hi>for</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we learn <hi>by</hi> practice (saith the <hi>Philosopher.</hi>) And that is one reason why many ignorant men do sometimes in this Gift excell those that are much more eminent for learning and knowledge; because though these do better understand the Rules, and <hi>Theory,</hi> yet the other do <hi>practise</hi> more; and by that means attain to a greater readiness and facility in this gift, and this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is the reason why in these later times, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men have attained to a greater prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence this way, then was usuall heretofore, because formerly this kinde of study and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was lesse in use: Men did generally confine themselves to particular forms, and did not make it their businesse to improve in this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rules</hi> to this purpose are chiefly of two kindes. Namely such as concern,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis convenient that the affections should

be so engaged in this service, as that they may lead the way and guide us both in our <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>expression,</hi> to which purpose the most proper means wil be to get a clear and distinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of our own conditions in these two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>

The apprehension of their present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will make them both importunate and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, in the desire of mercy. And thus will it be in proportion, with every one as he does apprehend his own necessity, in respect of any want, or danger. To which purpose that g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ace of <hi>Humility,</hi> will be of special advantage, which is alwayes sensible of it's own need and poverty; and the more it does receive, by so much the more does it bemoan it's own indigence.</p>
               <p>Now, when a man has brought his heart to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60725:19"/>
this temper, it will be most proper for him to lay aside all needlesse artifice, or affectation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himself in his addresses unto God with the same plainnesse, and simplicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we use to do with men. Let him seriously consider. 1. What sins those are which (if he were now to die) would most affright his conscience. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them in particular, aggravate, and bewaile them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. What that is he would chuse above all other things to desire of God, if he were sure to have his wish; Pardon, Grace, Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Contentment, Heaven, Protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. and let him beg each of these, urging the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to this purpose. 3. How his condition does differ from others below him. What blessing there is that he could least spare. Others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, are wretchedly ignorant, prophane, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous, sick, &amp;c. whereas he is exempted, and therefore ought to give thanks for each of these enjoyments.</p>
               <p>And in in the mention of these, he may poure out his thoughts in the most obvious expressions, As suppose after this manner. O Lord my God, I am at this present guilty of such or such a sin, which I have relapsed into, notwithstanding my conviction and promises; I desire to be humbled for it, and to renew my resolutions against it; and do earnestly beg thy mercy in pardoning of it, thy grace to strengthen me for the future. There is such a blessing I stand in great need of: 'Tis not in mine own power to procure it, thou can'st easily, and thou hast promised to bestow it, &amp;c. There is such a mercy which I see other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60725:19"/>
men want, and this makes their condition sad and miserable; and therefore I desire to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible of thy favour in my enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>Thus going over particulars, in the most facil natural expressions, and if new matter does not presently occurre, a man need not therefore break off this exercise, but may take some time to meditate and consider of his condition, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect some other particulars.</p>
               <p>'Tis not necessary that he should still keep on in this duty, in a continued frame of speech (I speak of our secret, Closet-devotions betwixt God and our own soules; for as for publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein we are to joyn with others, though but in a family, we ought there to be more close and exact in our preparations, as being to work upon the affections of those that joyn with us) But I say in these private devotions a man may take a greater freedome, both for his phrase and matter, he may be sometimes at a stand, and make a pause, there may be many intermissions and blanck spaces, in respect of speech, wherein by meditation he may recover some new matter to tontinue in this duty.</p>
               <p>Now to him that shall attempt it after this manner, it will not be very difficult to pray in private, without the help of books, or prescribed formes. And 'tis not easie to expresse what a vast difference a man may finde in respect of inward comfort and satisfaction, betwixt those private prayers that are thus conceived from the affections, and those prescribed formes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60725:20"/>
which we say by wrote, or read out of books.</p>
               <p>This will be one good way so to ingage the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon this service, that they may go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and lead us on in the particular subject of our prayers, in which frequent practice will make a man very expert; especially if by observation he be furnished with a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easury of the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter and expressions to this purpose; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by when his affections are dull, and indisposed, he may be able to quicken them.

               </p>
               <p>From some of these heads a man may fetch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to quicken and confirme his faith, to perswade the possibility of obtaining help by this duty. And that is another good means of enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the affections upon this service.</p>
               <p>Sometimes indeed, the Spirit of God may raise in a man such vigorous inlargements of heart, that he shall not need any distinct application of his thoughts to these rules; but at other times when he is more heavy and indisposed, then ought he to be the more careful in using these means; when the winde does not blow to help us by the <hi>sailes,</hi> we must ply the <hi>oares</hi> so much the harder.</p>
               <p>But now, if notwithstanding all our endeavours in this kinde, we do still finde in our selves a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse, distraction and aversnesse from this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (as that may be frequently our condition) in this case there are these two remedies to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bewaile, and pray against that indisposition in particular, and though you can say nothing else, yet say this, O Lord, as this coldnesse and deadnesse of heart, is my <hi>fault,</hi> so I desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, and to be humbled for it; but as it is thy <hi>will</hi> and <hi>chastisement,</hi> most justly inflicted for my former negligence, and formality, so I desire to submit unto it, thy will be done; but yet I will not cease to beg pardon for it, and power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
               <p>A man does not only then pray well, when his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60725:23"/>
devotions are accompanied with some special comforts and inlargements; but then also when he is sensible of much coldnesse and indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The right performance of this duty, does not so much consist in the acts of the sensitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as in the regulating of the will. As God takes the Will for the deed in sinful actions, so much more in good duties, as being more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then to punish,</p>
               <p n="2">2. What you want in the <hi>degrees</hi> of your duty, be careful to make up in your <hi>humility,</hi> and this will be the most proper improvement of all our failings, when we can <hi>strengthen</hi> our selves by our very <hi>infirmities. O Neminem à Deo derelictum, quando etiam vilitas ipsum seminarium est sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> (saith one of the Ancients.<note place="margin">

Our most inlarged devotions are nothing worth, without this fruit of humble and upright conversations; and with this consequent, our coldest, most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained prayers, may be looked upon as succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

Answerable to these three defects that men u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually complain of, Namely</p>

               <p n="3">3. Crude, unseemly, improper phrase, for want of fitting <hi>Expression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary each of these may be remedied if a man be furnished with</p>

               <p n="2">2. A fitting <hi>Method</hi> will teach us how to guide and regulate our thoughts, that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in their true place and order, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly hudling, or impertinent digressions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An expertnesse in proper <hi>phrase</hi> and <hi>expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> will inable a man so to deliver his thoughts,

as that they shall make reflexion back upon his own heart, and have more powerful efficacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others.</p>
               <p>Now for the fitting of the <hi>judgement</hi> in these respects, there are these directions to be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the supply of <hi>Matter</hi>; a man should be carefull to keep by him, some register of the most rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having severall Catalogues, or Common-place-heads, unto which the emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of these divers natures may be distinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. This I conceive to be the meaning of those places that speak of <hi>watching unto prayer and thanksgiving</hi>;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.18 Col. 4.2. 1 Pet. 4.7.</note> which do not only signifie a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mark your <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> your <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>wants,</hi> your <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>enjoyments</hi>; make a distinct register of them that you may have them in readiness upon any special occasion.</p>
               <p>'Tis usuall for younger students to be very carefull in gathering of Common-place books, for other matters, (of which notwithstanding, when they come to riper judgements they will finde but very little use.) But now of how much greater advantage would it be, if they were but diligent to collect under proper references any such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter, or expressions in Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60725:25"/>
at any time they finde themselves to be more especially affected?</p>
               <p>It would very much conduce to the promoting of this gift, if men would first propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, some brief <hi>Systeme</hi> or Logicall frame (as suppose this that follows, or the like) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining distinctly, the chief parts to be insisted upon in prayer. And then use each of <hi>these</hi> as a severall head of reference by way of common-place, to which they might reduce any more pertinent observable passage which they shall either hear or read. This course industriously observed, might probably in a short space raise a man to a great abilitie in this kinde, and would be a good meanes to preserve the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of such passages, as we have at any time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, to be more especially quickning and efficacious upon our own hearts, which otherwise we are so easily apt to forget.</p>
               <p>If any shall object that this course will require much studie and care; 'Tis considerable that no eminent gift in any kinde, is attained without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable diligence. He that would be expert in any other common ability, whether pleading, disputing, &amp;c. must apply himself to those Arts and exercises whereby they are to be learnt; and therefore much lesse should a man grudge his pains in such a weighty businesse, of more then ordinary consequence.</p>
               <p>Men that would be thought <hi>wary</hi> and thriving in the world, are thus observant of their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall estates, keeping Books of accompt for their <hi>revenues</hi> and <hi>expences.</hi> And why should not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60725:25"/>
those who would be thought truly <hi>religious,</hi> be as watchfull and observant of their spirituall conditions?</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Method,</hi> though there may be several kindes of it, yet that is to be esteemed the best, wherein these rules are most closely observed. Namely, 1. That it be Comprehensive, and take in all the parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. That <hi>generals</hi> be mentioned first, and <hi>particulars</hi> after. 3. That things of the same kinde and nature be put together; and this should be observed in all the parts of Prayer.</p>
               <p>Now the parts of Prayer may be Generally distinguished into these two kinds.</p>

               <p>The first thing in a form of Prayer is the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> which does chiefly consist of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1.

               <p>Next unto the Preface, any one of the three principall parts of Prayer may succeed, either Confession, Petition, or Thanksgiving, according as severall occasions shall require. But in general, and common use, 'tis most convenient that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>

The <hi>Conclusion</hi> should consist of some such <hi>Doxologies</hi> as may help to strengthen our Faith, and leave some impression upon our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>This may serve for a Scheme of <hi>Method,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all the <hi>chief parts</hi> according to a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting order, for the regulating of our thoughts in this duty.</p>
               <p>If there be any that should deny the use of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> and the like helps, as being humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; such persons will not deserve an answer. They may as well account the rules of reasoning and dispute to be unlawful, reducing all to their own Enthusiasmes; and so are not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dealt with in any way of debate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing to be enquired into, is <hi>Expression,</hi> which will of it self naturally follow upon such a preparation of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>method.</hi> But because the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the stile of the holy Ghost is undoubtedly the fittest for holy and spiritual services; with which, for divers reasons we should labour to be familiarly acquainted; therefore we should rather chuse, (where we may) to speak in Scripture-expression. To which purpose, there are divers instances for each of the foregoing heads, that may be observed and collected from severall books in Scripture. All <hi>prohibitions</hi> and <hi>threats,</hi> will administer both matter and phrase unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Deprecation</hi>: All <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> unto <hi>comprecation</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving.</hi> Besides that, it is easie to reduce the usuall expressions of other kindes, to be proper and helpfull unto this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60725:29"/>There are two extreams to be avoided in our <hi>Expression.</hi> Namely,

                     <item>Affectation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negligence,</hi> when men vent their thoughts in a rude, improper, unseemly phrase; as if they had no awe upon their spirits, and did not care how they spake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Affectation,</hi> either of too much neatnesse and elegance, or else of a mystical kind of phrase, not to be found either in Scripture, or any sober writer (though much in fashion amongst some men in these times) which, it may be, sounds well to vulgar ears; but being reduced into plain English, will appear to be wholly <hi>empty,</hi> and to signifie nothing, or else to be <hi>full</hi> of vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Each of these extreames will be apt to nauseat an intelligent hearer, and is very unsuitable to the solemnity of this duty.</p>
               <p>There are some Rhetorical ornaments and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in the manner of expression, which may be very proper, and powerful, both for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and exciting our affections, such are these four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Exclamations</hi>; which serve to set forth an affectionate wonder, Psal. 31.19. <hi>O! how great is thy goodnesse which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am! who shall, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Expostulations</hi>; which are fit to expresse any deep dejection of minde. So Psal. 77.8.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60725:29"/>
                  <hi>Will the Lord cast us off for ever, and will he be no more intreated? Is his mercy clean gone?</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Option,</hi> Fit to set forth serious and earnest desires, Job 6.8. <hi>O that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! that it would please him, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 119.5. <hi>O that my wayes were so directed, that I might keep thy statutes!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ingemination</hi>; which argues eager and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed affections, Psal. 94.1, 2. <hi>O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thy selfe, lift up thy self thou Judge of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 9.19. <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken and do: deferre not for thine own sake, O my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that will seriously endeavour and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome himself to deliver his thoughts in a proper, full, significant expression, and to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with those many examples, which the Scripture does afford to this purpose, such an one may by practice and experience arrive to a good ability and readinesse in this kinde.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Concerning the most proper materials for the <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving in the former Chapter laid down some directions in reference to the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>disposition of parts</hi> to be observed in this duty, I come in the next place to treat concerning the <hi>amplification</hi> of these severall parts; and to shew how the Scripture will afford various matter for the enlargement of each of them. So that any one, who will be but carefull to collect any other apposite matter, or observation that he shall meet with, and amongst these to refer it under its proper head; such a one may quickly be furnished with a very copious Treasury to this purpose.</p>
               <p>The first thing to be thought of in composing a form of prayer, is the <hi>Preface.</hi> The most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and chief materials for a <hi>Preface,</hi> were formerly specified to be four.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">I.</note>I. The titles of Invocation, or the stile of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, wherein we bespeak the person whom we pray unto; who should be expressed by such divine compellations as may excite in our hearts either some, or all of those affections that are more especially required in this duty.</p>
               <p>These Compellations may consist either of. 1. Gods Names, or Titles. 2. His Attributes, or Properties. 3. His Promises, or Threats. 4. His
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60725:30"/>
Works, or wayes; By all of which he hath been pleased after a more special manner to declare, and make himself known.</p>
               <p>In the choice of these, we should select such as may be most suitable unto that frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of minde, required in that kinde, or part of Prayer, which we have occasion to insist more largely upon. <hi>As the matter of fire is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 28.10.</note> 
                  <hi>so it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> (saith the son of <hi>Syrach,</hi>) so from the divers meditations of God will arise divers affections towards him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The consideration of his infinite Power, Wisdome, Holinesse, Justice, Omnipresence, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, &amp;c. is apt to produce in us reverence, shame, fear, sorrow, and the other affections of this nature, which are most suitable to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Confession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The thought of his Mercy, Truth, Patience, is fit to excite Faith and Hope, and consequently is proper for the duty of <hi>Petition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The meditation of his bounty and goodness, will provoke Love and Gratitude, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to prepare us for <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According as our thoughts are severally fixed upon any of these; so may our affections be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and qualified in our prayers unto him. To this purpose 'tis convenient that we take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of those divine Titles and Attributes in Scripture, which may be most suitable to such various occasions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the first kinde are such as these.</p>

If there be any particular sin which we have not fallen into in our <hi>lives,</hi> 'tis not for want of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles and dispositions in our <hi>natures,</hi> which do incline us to all, but by reason of Gods <hi>restraining</hi> or <hi>renuing</hi> grace, which hath as yet with-held us from them; without which we should break out into as great abominations, as were ever committed by the vilest of the sons of men.</p>
               <p>All that pravity and basenesse, which fils up every part and power about us, are but diffusions of our Original corruption: what a world of mischief is there in our several parts, our Wills, Affections, our Tongues, Eyes? And yet all these are but as little <hi>rivulets</hi>: The <hi>fountaine,</hi> or rather the <hi>Sea</hi> that feeds them, is our corrupted nature.</p>
               <p>'Tis this that fils us with enmity against all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual truths and Ordinances; makes us (what we should tremble to think of) haters of God, though he be the God of our life, and of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse; in whom we live, and move, and have our beings.</p>

               <p>The Arguments to strengthen our faith and fervency in this desire, may be such as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>fitnesse</hi> of it in respect of his glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60725:72"/>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From our own <hi>impotency</hi> for it evil, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes present with us, and sin so easily besetting us. And of our selves we are no more able to lay aside these weights, and to cast off our sins, then an Ethiopian is to cast off his blacknesse, or a Leopard his spots.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the <hi>facility</hi> of it to God, he is stronger then the strong man,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21</note> and can <hi>subdue all things to himself.</hi>
               </p>

Another evil to be prayed against, is <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> according to that in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Lead us not into temptation</hi>; That we may be freed from <hi>Trials</hi> themselves, so farre as may stand with Gods good pleasure; especially <hi>the evil</hi> of them, that we may not be overcome by them, nor faint under them.</p>
               <p>Temptation is of three kindes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From our own corrupted natures, by which we are very apt to be <hi>drawn aside and inticed</hi> to all manner of sins;<note place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> there being no kinde of impiety, but what this does make us <hi>capable</hi> of; and will (without Gods restraining or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace,) at some time or other <hi>dispose</hi> us unto. And herein more particularly, the blindenesse of our understandings, our wicked imaginations and fleshly reasonings, the perversnesse of our wills, the hardnesse and earthinesse of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the insensiblenesse of our consciences, the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60725:72"/>
depravation of all our faculties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The malice and subtilty of the Devil, who <hi>as a roaring lyon walks about,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>seeking whom he may devour</hi>; and is still provoking us to those evils which are most suitable to our particular occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dispositions:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11. Luk. 22.31</note> 
                  <hi>Watching for advantage against us,</hi> desiring <hi>to fift and winnow us as wheat</hi>; and therefore we had need to pray, that we may be <hi>sober and vigilant,</hi> having upon us,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.41 Eph. 6.11.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole armour of God, whereby we may withstand the wiles of the Devil</hi>; that we may constantly <hi>resist him,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The allurements, or terrours of the world, either by profits, pleasures, honours on the one hand; or losses, dangers, troubles, disgrace, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on the other. <hi>The rain descending, the floods coming, the windes blowing, and beating upon us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.27.</note> The evill customes and examples of the generation wherein we live, the slavish hopes and fears of men.</p>
               <p>Besides these <hi>kindes</hi> of temptation, we are likewise to pray against the <hi>degrees</hi> of it, suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, consent, practice, delight,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> habitual custome and necessity.</p>
               <p>That God would enable us always <hi>to watch and pray, lest we fall into temptation.</hi>

               </p>

observe and finde out, and more fully to inlarge himself in his deprecation against that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last sort of evil to be prayed against, is that of <hi>Punishment</hi>;<note place="margin">3.

               <p>In the <hi>general,</hi> we are to pray against all those judgements which may be inflicted upon us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our bodies, friends, names, estates. Against those more eminent miseries of <hi>Sword, Famine, Pestilence,</hi> (which three being of a publike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, concerning the Nation and community in which we live, may be more particularly insisted upon under the head of Intercession) against distraction and sorrow of minde, trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the losse of Gods holy Ordinances, and eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That no evil may befal us, neither any plague come nigh our dwellings.</hi>

               <p>Those judgements ought to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deprecated, with which we are at any time frighted or afflicted.</p>

               <p>The duties enjoyned by both these, may be easily collected from those vices, and failings mentioned in our Confession.</p>

               <p>The first <hi>Commandment</hi> doth enjoyn us to have <hi>Jehovah alone for our God</hi>; that is, in all respects to behave our selves towards him as our God. So that by this we are directed to pray for these graces and duties, <hi>viz. Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> of him, <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in him, <hi>Love</hi> towards him, <hi>Zeal</hi> for him, <hi>Rejoycing</hi> in him, <hi>Gratitude</hi> towards him, <hi>Patience</hi> under him, <hi>Obedience</hi> to him, <hi>Fear</hi> of him, Being <hi>humble</hi> before him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. Concerning Thanksgiving by enumeration of Temporal favours.</head>
               <p>THe third, and last part of Prayer is <hi>Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>: This (according to the method propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) may be connected with the former, by some fitting Transition, which for the matter of it, may consist of some such considerations as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our confidence of obtaining the things we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for, by our experience of former mercies; though they are many and great things, which we are suiters for, yet when we reflect upon Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual bounty towards us, and how much we do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day receive from him, we have no reason to doubt of his favour, but still to depend upon him in every condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The danger of ingratitude, in hindering the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of our petitions: He that is not careful to pay
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60725:112"/>
his old debts, cannot expect so much credit, as to run upon a new score. Under the Law, when any one came before God, to make any special request for himself, he was to bring with him a peace-offering, that is, an offering of thanks for the favours he had already enjoyed, thereby to prepare himself for what he expected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>matter</hi> of our Thanksgiving is reducible to these two general heads. 1. The <hi>Enumeration</hi> of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. 2. The <hi>Amplification,</hi> or heightning of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In our <hi>Enumeration</hi> of mercies, those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars before mentioned in our <hi>Confessions, Deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Petitions,</hi> will each of them administer some help, both in respect of <hi>matter</hi> &amp; <hi>expression,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our conditions may be in respect of <hi>freedom,</hi> or <hi>deliverance</hi> from those <hi>evils</hi> which we confesse, or deprecate, or the enjoyment of those <hi>good things</hi> which we have petitioned for, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I shall not need to be so large upon this head as the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Amplification or heightning of mercies may be either in <hi>General,</hi> by their multitude, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, continuance, which is capable of a distinct enlargement by its self. Or else in <hi>particular,</hi> by their circumstances, degrees, contraries, which are to be insisted upon in the mention of those particular mercies to which they belong.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Private,</hi> or personal favours, which we are to acknowledge, do belong, either <hi>Generally</hi> to the whole man, in respect of his being, nature, birth, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, preservation; or more <hi>Particularly</hi> in regard of his Soul, Body, Friends, Name, Estate.</p>
               <p>In the recital of the mercies which we enjoy, we are not to be unmindeful of those common favours which are bestowed upon us; in respect</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of our <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Beings,</hi> that God did not suffer us to beswallow'd up in our primitive nothing</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our noble <hi>Natures,</hi> that we were not made sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse things, but endowed with living souls, Men, and not beasts.
