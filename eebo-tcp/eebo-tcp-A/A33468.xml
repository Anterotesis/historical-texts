            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Was moved to goe to the Steeple-houſe to <hi>Hampton,</hi> upon the firſt day of the week, and there I ſtood peaceablie amongſt the people, for the ſpace of an hour, or thereabouts, in which time <hi>Samuel Heirne</hi> was praying and preaching, as he ſo called it: and he ſeeing me, he ſeemed to be in great rage; and after he had entred into that called his prayer, he commanded the Officers to take me away, or elſe he could goe no further, as he ſaid, or words to this purpoſe; ſo according to his deſire the Conſtable did; thronged me out of the houſe, and abuſed me in words and actions, and put me in the Stocks, although I ſtood peaceablie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did not diſturbe him in word nor action, although I was thronged and abuſed as I ſtood amongſt them; and after a while they let me out of the Stocks, and told me, I might goe about my buſineſs; but before I came out of the Town the Conſtable came and took me again, and kept me priſoner in an Inne, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46571:2"/>
deſired me to promiſe him not to trouble him for keeping of me in the Stocks, he being condemned in himſelf, that he had done me wrong, for putting me in without breach of any Law, or without any Warrant or command of any Magiſtrate, but onely through the Prieſts words, and ſo it did appear that he kept me priſoner in the houſe, to ſee whether I would promiſe him not to trouble him; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing to ſatisfie his will for to promiſe him, although I did not intend to do it: but at length he did let me goe, and about a month or five weekes after I was taken by a Warrant of <hi>Iohn Stevens,</hi> and brought before him, and when I came before him, he asked me, whether I was at <hi>Hampton</hi> at Church, as he called it, at ſuch a time or no? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and told him, I was at the houſe at the time; he asked me, whether <hi>Samuel Hierne</hi> did pray or preach while I was there, and I told him that he might call it praying or preaching: And he asked me, whether I kept on my hat while I was there? and I told him, I did buy my hat to wear it: Then he ſeemed to be in a great rage, and ſtruck me two or three blows, although he being one ſet to keep the peace, he broke it himſelf, and commanded his man to make a Mittimus to ſend me to priſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out I would give Bail for my good behaviour for diſturbing of <hi>Sam.
