            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>OF Things in which Mankind does most excell,</l>
               <l>Nature's chief Master-piece is writing well;</l>
               <l>And of all sorts of Writing none there are</l>
               <l>That can the least with <hi>Poetry</hi> compare;</l>
               <l>No kind of work requires so nice a touch,</l>
               <l>And if well done, there's nothing shines so much,</l>
               <l>But Heav'n forbid we should be so prophane,</l>
               <l>To grace the vulgar with that sacred name;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48320:3"/>
'Tis not a Flash of Fancy which sometimes</l>
               <l>Dasling our Minds, sets off the slightest Rimes;</l>
               <l>Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done;</l>
               <l>True Wit is everlasting, like the Sun;</l>
               <l>Which though sometimes beneath a cloud retir'd,</l>
               <l>Breaks out again and is by all admir'd.</l>
               <l>Number, and Rime, and that harmonious sound,</l>
               <l>Which never does the Ear with harshness wound,</l>
               <l>Are necessary, yet but vulgar Arts,</l>
               <l>For all in vain these superficial parts</l>
               <l>Contribute to the structure of the whole</l>
               <l>Without a Genius too, for that's the Soul;</l>
               <l>A Spirit which inspires the work throughout,</l>
               <l>As that of Nature moves this World about;</l>
               <l>A heat that glows in every word that's writ,</l>
               <l>That's something of Divine, and more than Wit;</l>
               <l>It self unseen, yet all things by it shown,</l>
               <l>Describing all men, but describ'd by none;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48320:3"/>
Where dost thou dwell? what caverns of the Brain</l>
               <l>Can such a vast and mighty thing contain?</l>
               <l>When I at idle hours in vain thy absence mourn,</l>
               <l>O where dost thou retire? and why dost thou return,</l>
               <l>Sometimes with powerful charms to hurry me away</l>
               <l>From pleasures of the night, and business of the day?</l>
               <l>Ev'n now too far transported I am fain</l>
               <l>To check thy course, and use the needfull rein;</l>
               <l>As all is dullness, when the Fancy's bad,</l>
               <l>So without Judgment, Fancy is but mad;</l>
               <l>And Judgment has a boundless influence;</l>
               <l>Not upon words alone, or only sence,</l>
               <l>But on the world, of manners, and of men,</l>
               <l>Fancy is but the Feather of the Pen;</l>
               <l>Reason is that substantial useful part,</l>
               <l>Which gains the Head, while t'other wins the Heart</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48320:4"/>
               <l>Here I should all the differing kinds reherse</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Poetry</hi> with various sorts of Verse;</l>
               <l>But who that task can after <hi>Horace</hi> do?</l>
               <l>That mighty Master and Example too?</l>
               <l>Ecchoes at best; all we can say is vain,</l>
               <l>Dull the design, and fruitless were the pain;</l>
               <l>'Tis true, the Ancients we may rob with ease,</l>
               <l>But who with that sad shift himself can please,</l>
               <l>Without an Actor's pride? a Players Art</l>
               <l>Is more than his who writes the borrow'd part.</l>
               <l>Yet modern Laws are made for later Faults,</l>
               <l>And new Absurdities inspire new thoughts;</l>
               <l>What need has <hi>Satyr</hi> then to live on theft,</l>
               <l>When so much fresh occasion still is left?</l>
               <l>Folly abounds, nay flourishes at Court,</l>
               <l>Where on its sphere it finds a kind support;</l>
               <l>But hold, <hi>White-Hall</hi> has nothing now to fear,</l>
               <l>'Tis Wit and Sence that is the Subject here.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48320:4"/>
Defects of witty Men deserve a Cure,</l>
               <l>And those who are so, will the worst endure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First then of <hi>Songs,</hi> that now so much abound,</l>
               <l>Without his Song no Fop is to be found,</l>
               <l>A most offensive Weapon which he draws,</l>
               <l>On all he meets, against <hi>Apollo's</hi> Laws:</l>
               <l>Though nothing seems more easy, yet no part</l>
               <l>Of Poetry requires a nicer Art;</l>
               <l>For as in rows of richest Pearl there lyes</l>
               <l>Many a blemish that escapes our Eyes,</l>
               <l>The least of which Defects is plainly shewn</l>
               <l>In some small Ring, and brings the value down;</l>
               <l>So Songs should be to just perfection wrought,</l>
               <l>Yet where can we see one without a fault;</l>
               <l>Exact propriety of words and thought?</l>
               <l>Th' expression easy, and the fancy high,</l>
               <l>Yet that not seem to creep, nor this to fly;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48320:5"/>
No words transpos'd, but in such just cadance,</l>
               <l>As, though hard wrought, may seem the effect of chance;</l>
               <l>Here, as in all things else, is most unfit</l>
               <l>Bawdry barefac'd, that poor pretence to Wit;</l>
               <l>Such nauseous Songs as the late Convert made,</l>
               <l>Which justly call this censure on his Shade;</l>
               <l>Not that warm thoughts of the transporting joy,</l>
               <l>Can shock the Chastest, or the Nicest cloy;</l>
               <l>But obscene words, too gross to move desire,</l>
               <l>Like heaps of Fuel do but choak the Fire.</l>
               <l>That Author's Name has undeserved praise,</l>
               <l>Who pall'd the appetite he meant to raise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next, <hi>Elegie,</hi> of sweet but solemn voice,</l>
               <l>And of a Subject grave, exacts the choice,</l>
               <l>The Praise of Beauty, Valour, Wit contains,</l>
               <l>And there too oft despairing Love complains.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48320:5"/>
In vain alas, for who by Wit is moved?</l>
               <l>That Phoenix she deserves to be beloved.</l>
               <l>But Noisy Nonsence, and such Fops as vex</l>
               <l>Mankind, take most with that fantastick Sex.</l>
               <l>This to the praise of those who better know,</l>
               <l>The many raise the value of the few.</l>
               <l>But here, as I too oft alas have tryed,</l>
               <l>Women have drawn my wandring thoughts aside.</l>
               <l>Their greatest fault, who in this kind have writ,</l>
               <l>Is neither want of words, nor dearth of wit;</l>
               <l>But though this Muse harmonious numbers yield,</l>
               <l>And every Couplet be with fancy fill'd;</l>
               <l>If yet a just coherence be not made</l>
               <l>Between each thought, and the whole model layed</l>
               <l>So right, that every step may higher rise,</l>
               <l>As in a Ladder, till it reach the Skies;</l>
               <l>Trifles like these perhaps of late have past,</l>
               <l>And may be lik'd awhile, but never last;</l>

'Tis Epigram, 'tis Point, 'tis what you will,</l>
               <l>But not an Elegie, nor writ with skill,</l>

               <l>Are <hi>Odes,</hi> the Muses most unruly Horse;</l>
               <l>That bounds so fierce, the Rider has no rest,</l>
               <l>But foams at mouth, and speaks like one possest.</l>
               <l>The Poet here must be indeed Inspired,</l>
               <l>And not with fancy, but with fury fired.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cowley</hi> might boast to have perform'd this part,</l>
               <l>Had he with Nature joyn'd the rules of Art:</l>
               <l>But ill expression gives too great Allay</l>
               <l>To that rich Fancy, which can ne're decay.</l>
               <l>Though all appears in heat and fury done,</l>

               <l>Which makes a Satyr differ from a Scold.</l>
               <l>Rage you must hide, and prejudice lay down,</l>
               <l>A Satyr's Smile is sharper than his Frown.</l>
