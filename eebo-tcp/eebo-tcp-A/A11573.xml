            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
                  <p>Trulie that Gumme is marueillous, for it digeſteth, mundifieth, and incarnates, and that ſpecially in wounds of the head.</p>

                  <p>Drawing forth is by drawing to, that belongeth to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of round and long making, or is done by thruſting from or puſhing further: by this meanes weapons with barbed heades are drawne out, for when they cannot bee drawne backe, they muſt needs be thruſt out on the contrarie ſide.</p>

They that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Oyles out of flowers, doe firſt drie the Flowers in the winde, and after they are dryed: In each pound of Oyle of Oliues they put v. handfull of flowers therein mixed togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Stillitorie well ſtopt for two naturall dayes, are digeſted in <hi>Balneo Neptuni</hi> with a ſoft fire: namely, in the firſt degree. After theſe daies they take it out of the veſſell and ſtraine it, and if it cannot quite be ſtrained, they wring it out with a preſſe, as we were wont to doe while we preſſe Oyle out of Almonds.</p>

                  <p>Trulie ſpoken indeed: but it is the part of Philoſophers to conſider thoſe things: For a Chirurgian it is ynough to know Choller, Flegme, Bloud, and Melancholie, with their heating and cooling qualities,</p>

                  <p>It is not to the end a man may haue the nature of an Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer throughlie knowne, becauſe a man is compounded only of water and earth, and with them alone is nouriſhed, it is behoofull to know the differences of earths and waters, for according to the diuerſities of theſe, diuers Vlcers ſpring in man.</p>

                  <p>We feed on bread, hearbes and fleſh, we drinke water, Ale, or Beere, and wine. It is certaine that in theſe watery or earthy, impurities, lurke that which for their vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Nature cannot be altered into our bodies: Whiles therfore the pure cannot by the benefite of Nature bee ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the impure,<note place="margin">Note.</note> there is made an interchangeable com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mixture of both. Mallowes with Nettles, and Arſnick with Violettes is mingled, which tempered of mutuall mixture ſo long, doe remit or ſlake their egreneſſe, till they ſhall be ſeuered.</p>

                  <p>This earthie or watery impuritie, free from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of purity is exalted by reaſon of its ſaltiſhnes, ſharpnes ſweetneſſe, or ſowrneſſe corrodeth the fleſh and ſkin, and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth calidities, humidities, and other accidents.</p>

                  <speaker>Chirurgian.</speaker>
                  <p>That is leaſt of all true: For the Oyle of holy wood is more effectuous, and hee is holpen more eaſily, ſo that it be well prepared of the Chimiſts, and the naturall collour not eqanged into a fierie, by reaſon of an immoderate heat.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>There are truly: for otherwiſe his nature that is diſtilled ſhould be corrupted: for as all things are not hot in the ſame degrees, but either drie, cold, or moiſt, ſo likewiſe diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of fire are to be obſerued in diſtillations, for that both the nature of the hearb, and the diuerſities of the operation requireth it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>

                  <p>You ſay true: but the handling hereof would require a great volume, if we ſhould ſet it down according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe thereof: heer it ſuffiſeth vs to ſhewe in what degree the fire ought to be kept, whiles we draw the oyle out of the wood <hi>Guiacum,</hi> or holie wood.</p>

                  <p>Trulie it is: But the better to get this oyle it is needful to haue a large great retorte well luted with clay, called the Lute of wiſdome, the <hi>Guiacum</hi> ought to be turned ſmall, and in light peeces, and alſo a veſſell of cold water muſt bee prouided, through which a braſen and hollow pipe muſt paſſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Chirurgian.</speaker>
                  <p>Then the retort muſt be filled with <hi>Guiacum,</hi> being ſmal cut almoſt to the necke.</p>

                  <p>Being fild and luted (as we haue ſaid) we ſet it in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace following. So that the necke of the Retort bee left out three handfulles emptie, and ſo to bee let into the pipe that paſſeth through the water.</p>

                  <p>Well ſaid: it hath no difficultie, but the operation is ſomewhat harde, but if thou art deſirous to practiſe, firſt make a furnace with a veſſell full of cold water.</p>

                  <p>It is true: Therfore after all things be finiſhed acording to that order which we haue ſpoken of principally, it is to be wrought with a gentle fire, leaſt that veſſel hauing the forme of a teſticle breake.</p>
