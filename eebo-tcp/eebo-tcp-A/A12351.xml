            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is remembred of <hi>Caius Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> (that wicked and incestuous Emperour) that he was a notable scorner and contemner of God,<note place="margin">Sueton in calig. 1.51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dion in caligula.</note> &amp; made no reckoning of any other to be God but himselfe, yet this abhominable and wicked Atheist, as God left him not vnpunished (for by his iust iudgement hee was slaine by some of his owne officers) so whilest he liued he was woont (as the Historiographers report of him) at the terrible thundering and lightning, not onely to couer his head, but also to get himselfe vnder his bed, and there to hide himselfe for feare. Whence I praie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And heereof it is that some say, that God is called <hi>Deus,</hi> of the Greeke word <hi>Theos,</hi> which signifieth feare, because the feare of him is planted and engraffed in the verie natures and conscience of all reasonable creatures, yea

And whence I pray you commeth shame in men after an offence committed? Or why should men (by naturall distinct) put a difference betwéene vertue and vice, good and euill, if there were not a God, who because hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the one, and hateth the other, hath written that difference in euery mans heart? Therefore conclude, that euery mans knowledge, conscience, and féeling, is in stead of a thousand witnesses to conuince him (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be) that there is a God which is to be feared, which hateth iniquitie and wicked waies, and which in time of trouble and déepe distresse is to be sought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for refuge and reliefe (as the acts of the very heathen themselues do plainely demonstrate.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Moreouer, as God is to bee felt sensible in euerie mans conscience, so is he to be séene visibly (if I may so speake) in the creation of the world, and of all thinges therein contained: for that this world had a beginning as all the excellent Philosophers that euer were haue agréeed, except <hi>Aristotle</hi> for a time, who helde a fancie,<note place="margin">Vide Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch de placit phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.

This then being so, that the worlde had a beginning, it must néeds follow, that it had an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause or maker thereof. I demaund then who it was that made it? If you say it made it selfe, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, for how could it make it selfe before it selfe was,
<pb facs="tcp:20633:6"/>
and when it had no being at all? If you say that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within the worlde made the world, that is, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Now then lette vs sée whether Iesus Christ our Lord did come of the séed of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as was foretolde the <hi>Messias</hi> should.

<pb facs="tcp:20633:15"/>
And therefore the Euangeliste s shewing the lyne of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> doe thereby also declare the lynage and stocke of <hi>Marie</hi> (the mother of Iesus) as béeing a thing then sufficiently knowne vnto all, though they speake no more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is confirmed by their repayring vnto Bethleem (when commaundement was giuen by <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2.1.2.3.4.5.</note> that euerie one shoulde repayre to the head Cittie of their Tribe and familie, to bée tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or sessed for their tribute) for by their going thither it is shewed, that they were both of the lynage of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> in as much as Bethleem was the proper Cittie onely of them that were of the house and linage of <hi>Dauid,</hi> for that king <hi>Dauid</hi> was borne therein.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it may appéere by this, for that the Iews who sought out all exceptions they could agaynst him, yet neuer excepted this, nor alleadged agaynst him that hee was not of the house of <hi>Iuda,</hi> nor of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which they would neuer haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if they might haue done it with anie colour, for such a spéech (if it could truly haue béen spoken) would easilie haue conuinced our Iesus not to bée the true <hi>Messias.</hi> But it appeared they neuer doubted of this.

            <p>A number more such Oracles there were where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the world was deceiued, that trusted them, but I néede not recite them, for (as it appeareth) the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and answers which their wicked spirits gaue forth in matters future and méerely contingent, were such as might be taken and construed two waies, and therefore their worshippers (if they had béene wise to haue noted their cunning and deceitfull answers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>containing no certainety at all) they had béene as good neuér to come at them to inquire of any matter

Lastly, the Gentils might haue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Christ the <hi>Messias</hi> by the Hebrew scriptures, which were in the Gréek language diuers ages before Christ was borne. For <hi>Ptolomy</hi> king of Egipt, which had the famous library, was studiously inquisitiue to search out the originall of all nations &amp; religions, &amp; he found that the people of the Iews was the most ancient, and that they onely had the most certaine and vndoubted historie of the creation of the world, &amp; therfore he sent vnto them to send to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:20633:26"/>
Ierusalem seuentie men, by whose helpe the sacred Bible might bée translated out of Hebrew into their tongue, which was doone accordingly: as also the Gentiles might haue knowledge of this <hi>Messias,</hi> ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by accesse into the Iewish cuntry, or by the access of the Iewes into their country: as namely by their long bondage in Egypt, as also their long captiuitie in Babylon, &amp;c. But I conclude this matter thus: Sith the Prophets of both Iewes and Gentiles (that is to say, the Prophets of all the worlde) haue giuen full, plaine, &amp; euident testimonie of Iesus Christ the sonne of God, that therefore his religion is the onelie true religion, and all other to be reiected and detested.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That religion which is most ancient is the true religion (for truth was first, insomuch as error is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the corruption of truth, or wandering from truth:) but the religion whereof Christ is the author is the most ancient (in as much as Christ the author thereof is the most ancient of dayes, béeing the Sonne of God, as also because hée is testified of by the Hebrew records, which are the most ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the world:) <hi>Ergo</hi> the Christian religion is that which must néedes bée the onely true religion in the world.<note place="margin">Tertul. con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For hee was promised to <hi>Adam</hi> the first man that euer God made, vnder the name of the séede of the woman, that should breake the Serpents head: hée was fore-tolde to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that hée should come of his séede, in whom all the Nations of the earth should bée blessed.</p>

               <hi>Iacob</hi> fore-tolde of him, calling him <hi>Shilo,</hi> and that hée should bée the expectation of the Gentiles. God telleth <hi>Moses</hi> of him, and fore-sheweth to him that he should be the Prophet whose voice all should heare and obey, &amp;c. Considering then that hée is come, and that hee is the very same that was fore-tolde by the writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and by the Hebrew records, which are the most ancient recordes of the worlde, I conclude, that his religion (whereof hée is the author) is the onely true religion.</p>
            <p>The antiquitie of the Hebrew historie to bée long before al other, is acknowledged by the heathen them selues, and therefore I néed not to proue it: only this I say, that <hi>Eupolonius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> also doe say,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 10. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. Euang</note> that letters (which are the beginning of words that should bée written) were first found out by <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; by him deliuered to the Iewes, and that the Iewes taught them to the Phenicians, and that lastly the Grecians receiued them of the Phenicians: and therefore the Hebrews most néedes bée they, amongst whome the first and most ancient records of the world were to be found, as <hi>Ptolemy</hi> also king of Egypt did find, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and therefore made much of the Hebrew scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now then for as much as the Hebrew wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and histories bée the most ancient, they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so néedes bée supposed true, in as much as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they all agrée in a swéet harmony, and no other records are able to disproue them: yea, if men will be so incredulous as to doubt of <hi>Moses</hi> historie (because it is so ancient) why may they not (with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also) doubt of any other historie which is ancient, and long before their times? But because some are of so little beléefe (although the historie doo sufficiently giue credite to it selfe) yet for better setling of their
<pb facs="tcp:20633:27"/>
minds in this behalfe, I will briefly shew, that euen the heathen historiographers &amp; writers doo confirme the same, that so the credite and reuerence due vnto <hi>Moses</hi> may be reserued, &amp; wicked tongues that barke against him may bée stopped.

And therefore it is manifest that <hi>Moses</hi> history, (as also all the rest of the sacred and canonicall scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) is no fable or feined matter (as the deuil would make vs beléeue) but a true; certaine, &amp; most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted historie in all points. All which matters be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and substantially shewed also euen by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens writings, which are too tedious to hée héere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed.</p>
            <p>But the great wonders and miracles which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did, béeing acknowledged to bée doone not by his owne power, but by the power of God, doo sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue credit vnto him: of whom and of whose actes doo beare witnesse, not onely the fore-named (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Artabanus</hi> in his booke of the Iewes) but manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also (especially <hi>Eupolemus</hi>) out of whome <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>histor</hi> reciteth very long narrations of the wonderful and strange things done by <hi>Moses</hi> in Egypt.

And <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiry</hi> adioineth more for proofe thereof, namely, that hée found the same thinges confirmed by the storie of one <hi>Sacontathon</hi> a Gentile, who liued (as hée saith) at the same time with <hi>Moses</hi>: but all those myracles (say those two his great enemies) were doone by Art Magicke, and not by the power of God. But first where could <hi>Moses</hi> a simple shepheard learne so much magicke? or why could not then the great Magitians of Egypt either doo the like, or at least wise deliuer themselues from those plagues that were in Egypt, (especially since their study was in Art Magick from their infancie) yea why did they crie out <hi>The finger of God is heere,</hi>

            <p>All which thinges doo shewe (and many more too tedious to rehearse) that <hi>Moses</hi> both in his writings, in his wordes, and in his works, was no man of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or of worldly spirite, but of a méeke, humble, dutifull, obedient, and faithfull seruant of God in all matters.</p>
            <p>The historie of <hi>Moses</hi> therefore béeing the most ancient, and the same béeing most vndoubted and certaine true, insomuch as he and his history do plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully testifie of Christ, which was to come, &amp; should
<pb facs="tcp:20633:30"/>
bée heard in all that he should say and teach, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that his religion which hée hath taught vnto the world, is the onely true religion, and all other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (not grounded of the like antiquity and truth) to bée abandoned.</p>
            <p n="6">6 None can discredit <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the Psalms, nor any of the Prophets amongst the Iewes, but they must withall discredit Christ: for Christ saith thus of himselfe,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.44</note> that <hi>All must be fulfilled which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him in Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalmes.</hi> And againe hée sendeth such as would knowe of him whether hée were the true <hi>Messias,</hi> to the scriptures of the Iewes, saying thus: <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they that testifie of me.</hi> So that Christ, <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 5.39.</note> the Psalmes, and the Prophets, and in a word the whole canonicall scriptures of the Iewes doo got arme in arme, and bée linked together like insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends that will not bée sundred: and therfore the one is alwayes a proofe for the other, as likewise a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the truth of the one, is a disproofe of the other: and therefore is it that though the incredulous Iews be so false in friendship, as that they will not (through vnbeléefe) take part with the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians bée more firme, and will holde with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Iewes to the death. Now if there were no more to proue the diuinitie of Christ, but the great and wonderfull miracles which he did (some wherof were such, as neuer any did before, nor could doe but God onely) it were sufficient to proue him to bee the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nne of God, and that hée came from the bosome of his Father. The great and many myracles that hee did (béeing famous not onely in Iudea, but in all the Romane Empire, and so ouer all the worlde) are and were such as none of the heathen dare doo, or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb facs="tcp:20633:30"/>
but all acknowledge. And therefore I conclude, that the Christian religion, procéeding from so diuine a power, and from one whose workes and wonders is aboue all the world, is the most vndoubted true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Christ did neuer any hurt on earth, but hee did maruellous much good, hée healed all manner of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he caused the dumbe to speake, the halt to goe, the blind to sée, and the deafe to heare: hée stilled the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the windes and seas, gaue sight to him that was borne blind; raised the deade to life againe, cast out deuils, knew mens thoughts, and did such works as no man could doo except God with him, yea except himselfe were God. Moreouer his life was such, as none was able to accuse him of any sinne, so pure and vnreproouable was he. Againe, the doctrine he taught was farre from a worldly spirit, béeing most heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, most innocent, and most diuine, for neuer any man spake as hee spake, nor with such authoritie. Agayne, hée alwaies pronounced that he sought not his owne glorie (which deceiuers are wont to doo) but the glory of his Father, and as hée spake so it was indeede. The whole course of his life and death, resurrection, and ascention doth shewe the same: for when the Iewes would haue made him an earthly king, hee would none of it, but conueyed himselfe away. <hi>Iohn. 6.15.</hi> teaching his Ministers to doo the like also. <hi>Luk. 22.25 26.</hi> for hée proclaimed that his kingdome was not of this world. <hi>Iob. 18.36.</hi> but that hée came to doo the wil of his Father. Ouer and aboue all this, hée was the greatest Prophet that euer was, and fore-told diuers things (as namely, that hee should bée crucified of the Iewes, and the third day rise againe: that Ierusalem and the Temple should bée destroyed ere that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:20633:31"/>
passed: that after his Ascention the holy Ghost shoulde come downe vppon his Disciples assembled at Ierusalem, and diuers others) all which the world doth knowe came to passe accordingly. And nothing which hée hath spoken but it shall bée performed, for there was neuer any fraud within his lippes, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood within his tongue. And therefore I conclude, that the Religion of him (who was most holy in his life, most harmlesse towardes others, most beautifull towardes all, most wonderfull in his workes, most true in his propecies, most heauenly in his doctrine, not sauouring of any carnall delight or worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor by any way or meanes séeking his owne glorie, but the glorie of God, and to doo the will of his Father) is and must néedes bée the onelie true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="8">8 An other argument I frame thus: that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which procéedeth vndoubtedly from God, is the true Religion: But the Christian Religion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vndoubtedly from God: <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi> that it procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vndoubtedly from God, I proue thus. Either it must procéed from God, or from the Deuill, or from men: But it is too holie to procéede either from men or Deuilles, for it ouerthroweth the workes and kingdome of the one, and forbiddeth the reuenging spirite of the other (commaunding men to loue theyr enemies, to doo good to them that hate them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them) it condemneth their wanton eye, and the adulterous thoughts of their harts, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous humour, admitting no vncleannes or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and forbidding all iniquitie and wickednes bee it neuer so secrete or close: Sith therefore it is so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and contrary to mens affections, wherewith naturally they bee carryed, and that it commandeth
<pb facs="tcp:20633:31"/>
to bée holie, euen as God is holie, it is manifest, that it can neither bee of mans deuising, nor of the deuils inuention, it remayneth therefore, that it must néedes bée of God, and consequently the onelie true Religion.</p>
            <p n="9">9 An other Argument is this: that Religion which respecteth onely the glorie of God, is and must néedes bée the onely true Religion. But such is the Christian Religion: for it alloweth not anie man to glorie in himselfe, but sheweth that whatsoeuer gloryeth should glorie in the Lorde. <hi>1. Cor. 1.30.31. Rom. 4.2.</hi> Therfore the Christian Religion is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true Religion.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Lastly, the spreading and preuailing of the Gospell of Christ ouer the vniuersall world, when as all the worlde (both Iewes and Gentiles) were sette and opposed against it, doth demonstrate plentifully and effectually, that the Christian Religion procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from God, and that God is the author thereof: for if it had not had a God to protect and patronage it, and to make it passe currantly through the world, it must needes haue béene vtterly suppressed and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euen in the springing and first rising thereof. For after the ascention of Christ Iesus into heauen, what were his few Apostles (in the iudgement of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men) able to doo, for the spreading and preuailing thereof, against the force and power of all the world, which was then readie bent with all both furie and fraud, violence and vengeance, &amp; with all their deuises which they could inuent to suppresse it? or what elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had his few Apostles to perswade the worlde, or any therein, to the receiuing and imbracing of that Christian Religion which they were appointed to preach: they (as al men know) were reputed &amp; known
<pb facs="tcp:20633:32"/>
to bée vnlearned men, but only that they were taught and instructed by the spirit of God, which (according to the promise of Christ their maister) at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed descended downe vpon them, béeing assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at Ierusalem, by which spirite they were enabled to speake all languages, and imboldned to preach his Gospell and religion, in such sort and with such puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and diuine wisedome, as none should bée able to resist that spirit they spake by, howsoeuer their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might bée hindered, molested, vexed, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>This, euen this is a wonder of wonders, and an infallible demonstration of the diuine vertue of the Christian religion, that it hauing so few to publish it, and such as they were, and beeing encountred by all the Princes and Potentates of the worlde, it shoulde notwithstanding so strangely preuaile, as within a short time to bée vniuersally spread ouer the face of the whole earth. Who can now say but that it was protected and preuailed by the power of God: for the power of all the world was against it: and if the Christian religion had béene no better protected by God than by men, alas it had perished long ago, yea, it had neuer liued vntill this day, but it had béene cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euen at the first vprising, &amp; as it were in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or infancie thereof. Let all wittes therefore throw downe themselues, and let all tongues fréely confesse the diuine vertue of the Christian religion, which could not bée stopped or suppressed, but was so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as that the power of all the worlde, and of all the deuils in hel ioyning with them, was not able to stay the course and passage thereof, but that it did preuaile, and that within short space ouer all the earth. And therefore the Christian religion (without al doubt) is
<pb facs="tcp:20633:32"/>
the onely true religion, which came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, béeing brought by Iesus Christ the true <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> from the bosome of God his father. Of which (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so many and so infallible arguments to prooue to euery mans sence the truth thereof) none can doubt except hée will also doubt whether the eye dooth see, the eare doth heare, and the heart dooth vnderstand: the euidence thereof is so cleare and manifest, as that it is able, if not to conuert, yet to conuince all gayne-sayers whosoeuer, and to make vs that alreadie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, firmely to hold the same, knowing for certayne, that the Christian Religion is the onely true religion in the world, and that saluation is no where els to be sought. For run ouer all the religions of the worlde, and where shall you finde any so pure, so diuine, so powerfull, so miraculous? It hath all the signes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, argumentes, and proofes that may bée, for the splendent truth thereof, and to demonstrate that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it came from God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20633:40"/>
the true Church could there be in those daies, either of <hi>Achas, Manasses,</hi> and other kings being Idolaters, when the Temple it selfe (where onely by the law of God, the Iewes were to offer the sacrifices) was polluted and defiled with heathenish Idolatry? What Church or Congregation could any man (in this case) haue resorted vnto to haue performed a true and acceptable sacrifice vnto God in those times, when the Temple of Ierusalem (which was the place to worship at) would admit no true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but onely Idolaters? It is therefore manifest, that a true Church may be, though they know not a congregation of God to resort to, yea though it bée close and not séene or knowne one to the other, nor yet to the world. And consequently visibility (which the Papists make a marke of the Church) is no perpetuall marke thereof. Yea, if such visibility should be a marke of the true Church, then were the Idolatrous people in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> in the time of <hi>Achas, Manasses,</hi> and many other kings of Israell that were Idolaters, the true Church, who indéede were the false Church: And then were <hi>Elias</hi> and all other the true worshippers of God, who had in those times no places left to sacrifice in, the false Church, which is absurde. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. 24.</note> that in the times of <hi>the abhomination of desolation</hi> (spoken of by Christ Iesus in <hi>Math. 24.</hi>) that is, in the time of wicked heresie which is the armie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (as he expoundeth it) <hi>Nulla probatio potest esse Christianitatis, neque effugium potest esse Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aliud volentium cognoscere fidei veritatem nis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Church was then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in those times when it could not be séene, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then like constant Martyrs, endured the tyranny of that Romish religion, so that some were banished, others fled into other Nations, some indured Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome at home, some other hid themselues, but the whole Church generally was vexed, and oppressed. And therefore when our Church was thus persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is a good argument (I thinke) to say, Wée had our Church then and alwaies, though a persecuted Church, though a Church chased and pursued, though a Church scattered, though a Church not séene or visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, yea, though in it selfe it were inlightened from God many ages together.

            <p>Secondly, Another erronious position, whereby they are miserably deceaued is this: <hi>They hold the Church cannot erre</hi>:<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2, 3, 4.</note> And therefore suppose because
<pb facs="tcp:20633:41"/>
the Church of Rome was once the true Church of God, therefore it is so now and euermore. As though there might not be an Apostacie in the Church, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth there should. Or as though a perticular Church (for the Church of Rome is but a perticular Church) could not erre? Yea, as though general Counsels (which represent the whole Church) could not erre? for so they affirme, but how truely let the world iudge. And if it may be shewed that generall Counsels haue erred, or may erre, then they yéeld their cause in this behalfe. I wish they would for their owne sakes: for false Iesuits &amp; Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries doo but deceaue themselues &amp; others to their owne confusion in this world, and except they repent in the world to come.

Insomuch therefore as it is vsuall in Sacraments so to speake, it is not against reason, but standeth with verie good reason to thinke, that Christ Iesus in instituting this Sacrament, which to the Christians is the same that the Paschall Lambe was to the Iewes, did likewise call the bread his bodie, in such sort as the Paschall Lambe was the Passeouer: that is to say figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as the Paschall Lambe was called the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and yet was but a signe and remembraunce of their Passeouer, so the bread was called his bodie, and yet it was but a signe and remembraunce of his bodie.</p>

Will hée claime it by reason of his keyes, and in his Apostolicall right? That hée cannot doo: For hée must remember that the keies giuen, <hi>were the keies of the kingdome of heauen, Math. 16.19.</hi> And therefore by authoritie of the keies h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Yea, Christ himselfe said, his kingdome was not of this world, <hi>Ioh. 18.36.</hi> Himself likewise refused to bée made a king, <hi>Ioh. 6.15.</hi> Himselfe paid tribute vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and commaunded others to giue the same, and all other dueties of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and obedience vnto <hi>Caesar, Math. 22.21.</hi> If hée were subiect to <hi>Caesar,</hi> it is a shame for the Bishop of Rome to exalt himselfe aboue <hi>Caesar.</hi>

For Christ hath expressely forbidden his Apostles, and in them all the Ministers of his Gospell, all such dominion, and ciuill iurisdiction, saying thus vnto them, <hi>The Kings of Nations raigne ouer them, and they that be great amongst them, beare rule or dominion: But it shall not bee so with you.

            <p>The Bishop of Rome dooth further holde, that hee hath authoritie from God to forgiue sinnes: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hee sendeth foorth his Charters of pardon, his Buls and Indulgences, to such as hée meaneth to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyle. The Scribes in the Gospell could say, <hi>None can forgiue sinnes but God. Mar. 2.7. Iob, 14.4.

            <p>I néed not recite any particular places, the whole booke of God is plentifull héerein. I doo not denie, but Ministers of the Gospell haue power to binde and to loose sinners (as Christ himselfe sheweth, <hi>Math. 16.</hi>) but how, and whome? They can neither iustifie the vnrighteous whom God abhorreth, nor yet condemn
<pb facs="tcp:20633:51"/>
the godly and faithfull, whome God dearely loueth: In as much therefore as they cannot pardon such as God condemneth, nor yet condemn such whom God acquiteth, <hi>Rom. 8.33.34.</hi> it is manifest that al their power of binding and loosing sinners, is limited and bounded within the compasse of Gods word, which they may not passe: for if they doo, they goe beyond their warrant, and so all that they doo will bée of no force. The incredulous and obstinately wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they may by warrant of Gods word pronounce condemnation against, except they doo repent, and to the assuredly faithfull repentant and godly persons, whose centinuall care is to please God and walke in his waies, they may pronounce the sentence of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and certaine saluation, because the worde of God doth affirme as much: and this all the binding and loosing of sinners which they haue. For in all their pronunciations of pardons, and forgiuenesse of sinnes, they must bée sure they speak not in their own names, nor their owne wils and pleasures, but they must doo it in the name of God, béeing first assured that it is his word, will, &amp; pleasure which they vtter. But the Bishop of Rome obserueth not the rule of Gods word to sqare &amp; measure his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by: but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth whom he lift, &amp; as hee list, as if he were a God himselfe, hauing absolute power in himselfe (without respect of Gods word or will) to doo what he list. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as Traitors &amp; rebels against God and their lawfull Princes, he will not only pardon without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but he will abette them in their deuilish deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and perswade them forward in their damnable courses, till at last (when it is too late for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) they will (if they take not good héed in time) féele the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Wee can call vpon none but we must consequently also beleeue on him: But we are to beléeue none but God, therefore wee may pray to none but God; and therefore the Church of Rome calling vpon Saints departed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth grosse Idollatry, for the Scripture sheweth that God onely is to be prayed vnto. Besides, They that in their Idolatrous <hi>Masse</hi> or Sacrament of the altar (as they tearme them) after a certaine mumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of wordes by the Priest, there is no bread nor wine remaining but the very bodie &amp; blood of Christ, and that péece of bread which is showed (for bread it still appeareth to be, for al their magicall mourning) they commanded to bée adored and worshipped. To adore or worship any creature (such as bread is) is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie: the Papisticall Church doth the same: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is Idolatrous. I haue proued it before, that it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth bread after consecration, and that Christ cannot possiblie bee there as touching the bodilie substance because in that respecte he is ascended vp into heauen and there sitteth on the right hand of God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill he come to iudge the quicke and the dead, &amp; if they will not beléeue Diuine testimonies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Yet the authority of <hi>Cicero</hi> a heathen man might somewhat moue them, for in one place he saith: <hi>Que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tam Amentemesse putas qui illum quo vescator De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um credat esse?</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Cicero. lib de natura.</note> 
               <hi>Whome doe you thinke so
<pb facs="tcp:20633:54"/>
mad as to beleeue that which he eateth to be God. Insomuch therefore as the Church of Rome doth worship bread, as if it were God,</hi> It is manifest they be grosse Idollaters. And consequently their Church cannot be the true Church of God on earth.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> The Papistes doe not denie Christ in wordes, but if we examine them by perticulars we shall finde that in déede they doe: as for example, we know that the right faith beléeueth Christ Iesus to be both God and man, which the Church of Rome in wordes will so affirme: But vrge them in this point of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and then they bewray themselues, that they beléeue not Christ to haue a true bodie: for when they are preassed with this, that the bodie of Christ cannot be both in heauen and in earth at once, and the selfe same time, because it is against the nature of a true bodie so to bée: then they become <hi>vbiquitaries</hi> and say, that because the Godhead of Christ is euerie where, therefore his humanitie is euerie where. But this is no good consequent, for the Godhead and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie are of seuerall nature. And if his bodie and flesh were euerie where as his Godhead is: howe is that true which the Angell spake saying <hi>surrexit non est hic. He is risen he is not here.</hi> For these wordes sheweth that his bodie and flesh is not euery where.<note place="margin">Mat 28.6.</note> Againe if he were euery where in respecte of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, how is it true that he ascended into heauen? For that word ascention doth shew that his bodilie presence did remoue from one place to another, and then was it not in that place from whence it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue.</p>
            <p>Lastly it is the propertie of a Diuine nature to be euerie where, and therefore whilest they defend this vbiquitie <hi>of the flesh of Christ</hi>: It is as much as if
<pb facs="tcp:20633:55"/>
they should say <hi>that the flesh of Christ</hi> is turned into God (which is a groosse Herisie. And thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Papists doe with the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> deny that Christ hath a true bodie when they holde that (contrarie to the nature of a true bodie) it may be in diuers places at once: yea, euerie where: and therefore denying Christ to haue a true bodie, they are not the true Church: and somuch for their error concerning the person of Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> Now for the office of Christ, (for his person &amp; his office bee two chiefe thinges which we are all to regard.) The Papists will yéeld with vs that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in these thrée points, namely: that he is both a Prophet, a Priest, and a king. This I say in words they will acknowledge, but in déedes and veritie they doe not, for in respect that Christ is our Prophet which should and did reueale his Fathers will vnto the world, wee ought to bee content with his voice, and search no further then hée hath reuealed in his Scriptures. But the Papists are not so contented, but they holde that their vnwritten traditions and Popish Cannons, must also bee receaued vpon like perill of damnation, as before it shewed concerning the Priesthood of Christ. It consisteth in two things, namely <hi>the offering vp of himselfe</hi> once for a full perfect and sufficient Sacrifice: <hi>And his intercession with his Father,</hi> which yet remaineth also and shall doe to the worlds end.

But the Papists hold that Christ hath obtained by his passion, remission for our sins going before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: but sinnes committed after Baptisme, that his passion hath taken away only the guiltines, but that the punishment remaineth notwithstanding, which is to be paide in purgatorie (as they say) and to be redéemed by our owne satisfactions, and so they make the punishment due to sinne (which is indéed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in hell) to bee but temporarie in purgatorie vpon satisfactions (as they haue deuised). But what can a man giue for the ransome of his soule?

First to claime it as successor to <hi>Peter,</hi> is impossible for that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had any such title, prehemince, or authoritie ouer the rest of the Apostles.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that Christ sayd to <hi>Peter</hi> (after hée had confessed Christ to be that Christ the sonn of the liuing God.) <hi>Thou art Peter and vpon this rocke will I build my Church.</hi> These wordes hitherto giue no superioritie to <hi>Peter</hi> aboue the rest: only they shew that the Church is builded <hi>non super Petrum sed super Petram: not vpon the person of Peter but vpon the rocke</hi>: and vpon what rocke? namely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that Christ Jesus whom <hi>Peter</hi> confesseth to bée the sonne of the liuing God. For that confession of <hi>Peter</hi> concerning Iesus to bée that Christ the sonne of the liuing God, is the rocke whereupon the Church is builded: for (as Saint <hi>Paull</hi> expoundeth and affirmeth.) <hi>Other foundations can no man lay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11</note> 
               <hi>but that which is laid already,</hi> namely Iesus Christ: And in another place hée saith expressely:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.4</note> 
               <hi>that that rocke was Christ</hi>: And Christ himselfe affirmeth likewise,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24.</note> 
               <hi>that he that heareth his wordes and doth them is likened to one that buildeth his house vpon

a rocke, shewing thereby that he, and his words, &amp; Doctrine be the rocke, against which the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile.</hi> Agreeably whereunto speaketh Saint <hi>Paull</hi> againe,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.20</note> when hee saieth that the Church is builded vppon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Christ Iesus himselfe beeing the head stone in the corner. Where then shall wee finde that <hi>Peter</hi> was made Prince of the Apostles to rule ouer all the rest,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19</note> as the Pope now doth: The Papists answeare that in the next wordes, when Christ gaue vnto <hi>Peter</hi> by speaciall name, the keyes of binding &amp; loosing, he thereby made <hi>Peter</hi> the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ince &amp; vniuersall Bishop of the whole Church. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I say, that Christ therein gaue no authoritye more to <hi>Peter</hi> than to the rest, that is at this time: The keyes were not giuen to him nor to the rest, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a promise that they should be giuen: for the wordes be not in the present tense, <hi>Do tibi I giue vnto thee</hi>: But in the future tense, <hi>Dabo tibi I will giue vnto thee,</hi> which promise of Christ was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward truely performed, and when it was performed, the keyes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.22.23.</note> that is the power of binding and loosing sinners, was giuen not onely to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to <hi>Peter</hi> and all the rest together, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell cléerely declareth and avoucheth. Now because <hi>Peter</hi> was the man that gaue answeare for himselfe and the rest, and so both <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> doe expound and declare it: And therefore neither in the promise of the keyes, nor yet in the receit of the keyes, by <hi>Peter</hi> did he receaue any more authoritie or supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritye than the rest of the Apostles did. I grant he was called <hi>Primus</hi> because he was of the first that was called to the Apostleship, or because hee was the first of all the Apostles that confessed Christ to be the
<pb facs="tcp:20633:58"/>
               <hi>Messias</hi> and Sonne of the liuing God, or because hée was readiest alwaies to speake and answere. But all this, doth not proue that hee had authoritie ouer the rest, or a larger Commission than the rest: Yea the words of their Commission doe shew the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, namely that they had all equall authoritie, for it was thus made vnto them all indifferently, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting a difference, namely, <hi>Goe ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to obserue all things whatsoeuer I haue commaunded you, Math. 28.19.20.</hi> Runne ouer all that remaineth written and you shall finde that <hi>Peter</hi> was one of the twelue equall with the rest, and their fellow but not their Lord: Where was <hi>Peters</hi> superiority, when <hi>Paul</hi> reprooued him to his fate? <hi>Gallathians,</hi> the second Chapter, and the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verse, when béeing accused, hée pleadeth no priuiledge, but for the clearing of himselfe, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of others, hée aunswereth to that accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>Where was <hi>Peters</hi> authority ouer the rest, when the rest sent him and <hi>Iohn</hi> into Samaria? <hi>Acts,</hi> the eleauenth Chapter, the third and fourth verses: and also in <hi>Acts,</hi> the eighth Chapter, and the fourtéenth verse. In that hée went at their sending, hée plainely sheweth that hée had no principalitie ouer them.</p>
            <p>Where was his preheminence or authority, when in a Councell held at Ierusalem, where the Apostles were, yet not <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Iames,</hi> ruled the action, and according to his sentence was the Decrée made, <hi>Luke, 22.25.26. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, I say moreouer, that when there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb facs="tcp:20633:59"/>
amongst the Apostles, who should bée chiefe amongst the, Christ told them plainely, <hi>that kings of Nations might beare rule ouer their people, and that great men vnder those kinges might likewise exercise authoritie ouer other, but so might not they doe one ouer another, Luke 25.26. &amp;c. But the greatest amongst them should be as the least, &amp; as a seruant: yea, should bee the least, and should be a seruant,</hi> as it is declared in <hi>Matthew, 20.25, 26</hi> and in <hi>Marke, 10.42, 43.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the greatest must be as the least, what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath hée aboue the least? For then hath the least as great authoritie as the greatest: That is, they bene all equall authoritie. I meruaile therefore what the Pope and Papists meane, contrary to the tenour of the Commission of Christ, contrary to the practise of <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, and contrary to this decrée made by Christ of their equallity, to say notwithstanding that <hi>Peter</hi> was Prince of the Apostles, and had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer them all, when as indéede, it is manifest by all the Scriptures and course of his life, he neither claimed nor had any authoritie ouer the rest, more than the rest had ouer him, and consequentlye the Pope of Rome can neuer claime that as successour to <hi>Peter,</hi> which was neuer in <hi>Peter</hi> his supposed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour.</p>
            <p>The Papists perceauing that the scriptures make nothing for them, but against them, (because they would haue the matter coloured with some Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or shew of Antiquitie at the least:) haue deuised some counterfet and forged Authors, (as <hi>Amacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and Amissetus</hi> and such like) to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge for them. But the falsehood of all those, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by other writers (if they bee well marked.)
<pb facs="tcp:20633:59"/>
In <hi>Cyprians</hi> time it was déemed a matter odious for any to take vpon him to be a Bishop of Bishops, as appeareth by that voice which he cryed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of <hi>Carthage.</hi> It was likewise decréed in the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi> Counsell that none should be called Prieste of Priests, or Archpriest, or any such like. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>Nice</hi> did decrée that the Bishop of Rome should kéepe himselfe within the compasse of his prouince and not excéed his bounds, as likewise the Bishop of Antioch, Ierusalem, and Constantinople were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> doo the like. Other Councells did affirme as much, (which because they are sufficiently knowne I néede not to recite. But they all shewe that at those times the Bishop of Rome had no greater Jurisdiction than within his owne Prouince, and that hée coulde not meddle within the Prouinces of other Bishops. And <hi>Ierome</hi> of his time sayth,<note place="margin">Hierome ad Euagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> that the Bishoppe of Engubium, or any other the least Sea, is equall to the Bishop of Rome. The Title of Uniuersall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, was much desired of John Bishop of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, and much contention there was about it. But it was neuer obtained of the Bishop of Rome vntill the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who procured that Title of <hi>Phocas</hi> that wicked Emperour of Rome: after which, the Bishops of Rome neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed still to augment their dignitie, and increase the pride of their Romish Sea: And euen at that very first time when John Bishop of Constantinople, sought to get that Title of Uniuersall Bishop to his Sea, <hi>Gregorie</hi> then Bishoppe of Rome,<note place="margin">vide Greg. lib. 4. epist. 32.34, 36, 38.39. &amp; lib. 6. epist. 24.28.29, 30.</note> did himselfe stand against it mightily, and affirmed that hée could bée no lesse than Antichrist whosoeuer did take vnto him that Title. First therefore it is manifest, that vntill the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> Bishop of Rome, an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
<pb facs="tcp:20633:60"/>
Bishop was not heard of in the Church, and <hi>Boniface</hi> the thirde was the first Bishop of Rome that got this title which was aboue <hi>600.</hi> yeares after Christ. And besides how will the Bishop of Rome that now is, avoid himselfe to be Antichrist, Sith by the expresse determination of <hi>Gregorie</hi> Bishoppe of Rome his predecessour, hée is condemned for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, in as much as hée hath this Title, and is not ashamed thereof. For what is this else, but to come in the place of Christ, and consequently to bee Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, vsurping the prerogatiue Title of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus?

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20633:60"/>I conclude therefore that for all these causes the Church of Rome can not possibly be the true Church.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7</hi> The Church of Rome doth not ascribe Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to faith in Christ Iesus onely, but saith that mens works be meritorious, and to them partly is Iustification to bée ascribed, and so they make mens imperfect works to be causes of saluation, which is a grosse errour euen in the foundation or fundamental point. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That all are iustified freely by his grace, Rom. 3.24.</hi> If they be Iustified <hi>gratis, freely,</hi> (as hée affirmeth) then are they Iustified withoot any desert of theirs. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> setteth downe the Axiome in the Conclusion, <hi>VVee holde that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the Law, Rom. 3.28.</hi> And the Apostle in very many places (whereof mention shall hée made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) doth expressely exclude Weekes from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny causes of our Iustification: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> indéede they are the effects thereof: And therefore it appeareth to bée a true position, that Faith onely doth Iustifie, in as much as Iustification is (in the sight of God) impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Faith, not to our Workes: For <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> beléeued God, and that was imputed to him for righteousnes, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh <hi>Rom. 4.8.</hi> And hée sheweth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by Works before God, for if <hi>Abraham</hi> were iustified by works, then should hée haue wherein to glory, but not before God, and because hée had not wherein to glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, therefore hée was not iustified in the sight of God. I graunt that saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his seconde Chapter doth say that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified by his Works, when hée offered vp his Son <hi>Isaac</hi> at Gods commaundement: And likewise that hée saith, that a
<pb facs="tcp:20633:61"/>
man is iustified by Works, and not by Faith onely: But before whom is hée iustified by Works? Not before God, but before men, that is to say, his works doo declare vnto men that saith whereby hée is iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God: And that this is the meaning of saint <hi>Iames</hi> may appeare by that his saying, where he saith, <hi>Shew vnto me thy Faith by thy VVorks, thou saiest thou hast faith, that is not inough, thy words doth not proue it, thy works will, therefore (saith hee shew me thy faith by thy workes.</hi> This word (<hi>Shew mee</hi>) doth manifest what manner of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification hée speaketh off, namely, that he speaketh of a iustification before men. For it is God that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the faith of a man, whereby onely hée is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in his sight: And it is men which respect the workes, whereby indéede they testifie vnto the world their faith to be good before God. For (as saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith truely) faith without works is but a dead faith, and not good, nor found, nor auaileable. But faith and works must goe together, and indéede where a true faith is, there good works will shew themselues as the fruits thereof. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> are to bee reconciled, which thing <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> a schooleman of the Papists doth himselfe plainely testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie saying, that Christ Iesus doth iustifie <hi>effectiuè ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually</hi>: Faith doth iustifie <hi>apprehensiuè,</hi> by taking hold of Christ: and good works doo iustifie <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè,</hi> that is, doo declare vnto men their iustification before God: And so it is cleare, that howsoeuer, a true faith cannot bee without workes, as fire cannot bee without light and heate, yet our iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is to bee imputed to our faith, not to our works: as warmth is to bee imputed to the heate of the fire, not to the light of the fire. For so saith saint
<pb facs="tcp:20633:61"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> expressely, <hi>That God imputeth righteousnes without works, Rom. 4.6.</hi> And againe, <hi>That it is by grace not of workes, Rom. 11.6.</hi> And againe, <hi>Not of workes, Rom. 9.11.</hi> Againe, saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Saints at Ephesus, that God hath ordained men to walke in good workes, yet he saith that they may not trust to be saued by them, for he affirmeth, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them, <hi>That they are saued by grace, and not by their works, Eph. 28.9.10.</hi> Againe, he speaketh in the person of himselfe, &amp; of all the children of God, and saith, <hi>that wee are saued not by workes, but by his predestination and grace,<note place="margin">Hilláry in Mat. cap. 8</note> 2. Tim: 1.9.</hi> And againe, <hi>God is our Sauiour, not for any-workes which wee haue done, but according to his owne mercie hee hath saued vs, Tit. 3.5.</hi> And diuers other like places bée: Wherefore saint <hi>Hillary</hi> hath these very words (which we hold) <hi>Sola fides iustificat, Faith only doth iustifie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amb. in Rom. 3.</note> And <hi>Ambrose</hi> among other sentences hath this, <hi>Non iustificàri hominem apud Deum nisi per fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, That a man is not iustified before God but by Faith.</hi> Which is as much, as <hi>Faith onely doth iustifie before God.</hi> Saint <hi>Basil</hi> doth say, that this is perfect and sound reioycing in God, when a man doth not boast of his owne righteousnes, but knoweth that he wanteth in himselfe true righteousnes, and that he is iustified by faith onely. And <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> saith, that to beléeue onely, is righteousnes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is euident both by the expresse testimony of the Scriptures, and of the Fathers, that wee holde the truth in this behalfe, and that the Church of Rome is in a maruellous errour. It is true which is written, that euery man shall bee rewarded according to his works: because the faith of men is estéemed and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by their workes, as the frée is knowne by the
<pb facs="tcp:20633:62"/>
trust: But there is no Text of scripture to shewe, that any man is saued <hi>propter merita,</hi> for his works or merits, but many Texts of scripture to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as before appeareth. For when we haue done all that we can, yet we must say (as Christ commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) <hi>Wee are vnprofitable seruaunts, Luke, 17.10.</hi> And therefore the Papists which teach workes meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, yea workes of supererogation availeable to saluation, as well for others as for themselues, holde not the right faith, and consequently are not the true Church.</p>

               <hi>8</hi> But if I should shew all the corruptions of the Ró<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, I should be infinite, neither am I able to number them. I will therefore conclude all this discourse onely with this argument following. The Pope of Rome being the head of that Church, is that famous Antichrist that was foretold by <hi>Paull</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and that is presignified in the reuelation of Saint <hi>Iohn, Ergo</hi> it is impossible that the Church of Rome, should be the true Church, for the Church of Antichrist (though it boast neuer so much) cannot bée the true Church though it would faine bee so accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as many an harlot desireth to bee reputed an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest woman, one marke of that Antichrist, <hi>Paull</hi> sheweth to be this: <hi>2.

any such God of the Earth, namely aboue all Princes and Magistrates is a thinge so well knowne as I néede not to prooue it: himselfe by his wicked practises, and his Iesuits Seminaries, and Patrons doe in their bookes manifest the same vnto the world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> An other marke of Antichrist <hi>Paul</hi> setteth downe to be this, namely: <hi>2.

For these men were not content with that which <hi>Angelicus</hi> wrote in his Poetry (the beginning whereof is, <hi>Papa stupor mundi, the Pope is the wonder of the world.

Againe héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifest that he exalteth himself aboue God, inasmuch as there is lesse danger and punishment, for any that breaketh any of Gods lawes, than for one that breaketh any the least constitution of the Pope. Moreouer, He claimeth authoritie in three places: Heauen, Earth, and Purgatorie, and that is the reason he weareth a triple Crowne: so that by this account and claime, he hath more and larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended authoritie than God himselfe: for such a third place as purgatorie is, hee knoweth not of. And what do these things but manifest him to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen aboue God and all that is worshipped?</p>
