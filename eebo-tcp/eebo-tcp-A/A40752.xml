         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It was proved moreover, by <hi>Cecil</hi> and <hi>Mydhope,</hi> that Sermon being ended, all three of them viz. he the ſaid <hi>Cecil, Sindercomb</hi> and <hi>Boyes,</hi> went into the yard of the Houſe next the Abbey, to ſhoot his Highneſs; as he paſſed from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey to meet the Parliament, in the painted Chamber, and to that end, he the ſaid <hi>Cecil</hi> ſtood on the wall with his Piſtoll charged, and <hi>Sindercomb</hi> walked in the Yard, but other Company coming in thither, they were prevented, and <hi>Boyes</hi> went out of the Yard into the throng of people.</p>
               <p>It was further proved by <hi>Cecil,</hi> that this enterprize not

ſucceeding they reſolved to murther his Highneſs ſome other way, to wit, to furniſh themſelves with fleet horſes to kill him as he rode forth. That <hi>Sindercomb</hi> engaged <hi>Toope,</hi> who conſtantly gave him notice of the life-guards going abroad, or of the ſadling of the Pad Nags.</p>
               <p>That the firſt time they rode forth to kill him, was the latter end of <hi>September</hi> laſt (viz the Suturday after he had left going to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court.</p>

               <p>The fifth time, when he rode into <hi>Hide Park,</hi> where his Highneſs alighting, asked him the ſaid <hi>Cecil,</hi> whoſe horſe that was he rode on, <hi>Sindercombe</hi> being then on the outſide of the Parke; and then <hi>Cecil</hi> was ready to have done it but doubted his horſe, having at that time, got a cold.</p>

               <p>During the daves alotted him for his preparation, he made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall attempts, with promiſe of a good ſumme of money (700 pounds firſt and laſt) to perſwade his Keeper to permitt him to eſcape and that not being yielded to, he tempted him to procure him ſome poyſon; and not prevailing with him, he ſollicited his own ſiſter (who was permitted to attend him) to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 13 inſtant, betwixt ſeven and eight a Clock at night, the writ being brought and read unto him for his execution the next day, he trembled and quaked very much at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion

               <p>He having diſcourſed a little with the men in his Chamber; (which were about four or five to attend him) called for a Bible, and having read a little while, he then deſired them to withdraw out of the Room for about half an hour, that he might have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pray alone. The Attendants withdrew, and putting the door to, they ſtood there at the top of the ſtairs; but before the half hour was over, he came himſelfe to the door and pulling it open, bade them come in, in a cheerfull manner, rubbing his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then about his mouth and his noſe, ſaying, I have done, and now pray you come in. Not long after he undreſſed himſelf, and ſpringing lively into Bed, well (ſaid he) this is the laſt night that ever I ſhall lye in Bed. Being in bed, he had ſome diſcourſe a while with the company, without any ſign of ſickneſſe. Then drawing his Curtain, and lying a while ſilent, and afterwards ſnorting, one of the Company obſerving ſo, went and drew the Curtain gently to look on him, and found him in a dying ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe condition.

But after a while, by following his doctors preſcription, he was recovered out of that diſtracted condition by application of Medicines, only he continued diſconverted in minde, and uſed many ſubtil ſhifts and wiles to have the Guards taken from him, and was ſomthing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, becauſe he could not effect it, although he was in a great meaſure recovered from his bodily weakneſſe for ſome ſeaſon, till about the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> that he complained of ſomething riſing in his throat, and had ſtoppages that he could ſcarce breath, and feared an Impoſthume to be gathered in his throat, and broken, and that he ſhould not have ſtrength to bring it up.

The Lievtenant of the Tower being made acquainted in what a dangerous condition he was, ordered another Doctor and a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion to be ſent for to view him, and to adviſe with Doctor <hi>Brooke</hi> what they judged of him, and what was beſt to apply to him, who judged that he was in a very weak condition, and that it did ariſe from the Malignity of his Diſeaſe as aforeſaid, in a way of naturall cauſes; in which weak condition, he continued a day or two more under violent inflamations and Sweatings, which ſo weakened him, that by reaſon thereof upon Wedneſday morning the 13 of this inſtant January, having ſaid, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, I am very ſick;</hi> about five of the clock he breathed out his laſt, and died; after which his wife deſired his body of the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to bury it; to which the Lievtenant anſwered, ſhe might have it to bury, within or out of the Tower, after the Coroner and his Jury had enquired of his death according to the cuſtome of the place; whereupon the Coroner ſummoned a Jury to view the body, and to give in their verdict concerning the manner and cauſe of his death accordingly, and the Doctors and Chirurgions having viewed the dead body together with the ſaid Jury, found blackneſſe and ſetling of blood about his ſhoulders which they judged to come from the violence of the Fever and the inflamation of thoſe parts; which great diſtemper the ſaid Jury was by them fully ſatisfied in, as alſo of his former condition; and alſo having examined ſeverall other perſons upon oath beſides them, as his Keeper, his Nurſe, and his Uncle, (who was often with him in his ſickneſſe) his Apothecaries and a Souldier that guarded him the night he dyed, his wife being preſent before them alſo, (who was conſtantly attending upon him in his impriſonement, except when ſhe lay in, and then were none with him but Nurſes of her own appointment.)

            <p>They had there five or ſix Galleons (whereof were Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admirall, with their Standart and Flags aloft) and other conſiderable ſhips making up the number of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, ſome having Goods brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> ſtill on board them, others had taken in Goods and Proviſions to carry back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Moſt of them were furniſhed with braſſe Ordinance, and (as we have been informed ſince) had their full companies of Seamen and Souldiers kept continually on board them, from their firſt coming thither, which was about the beginning of <hi>February</hi> laſt, their Generall himſelfe in all the time lying but one night out of his Ship: they were moared cloſe along the Shore, which lies in the manner of a Semicircle, commanded, as far as the Ships rid, by the Caſtle, and ſurrounded beſides with ſix or ſeven Forts, with almoſt a continued line for muſqueteers and great ſhot, as the Ground between admitted; And we were forced to come ſo near to doe our worke, that many of the men we have ſlain and wounded, were ſhot by the Muſqueteers from the ſhore; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it pleaſed God that in four hours time their men were beaten out, and all the Ships put a ſhore, except the Admiral,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106799:15"/>
and Vice-Admirall, who made the moſt conſiderable reſiſtance. About two of the Clock the Vice Admirall was ſet on fire, and the Admirall, by ſome happy ſhot, or other accident, ſuddainly blown up; having as we perceived juſt before) many men on board her; by the evening all the reſt were fired, only two that ſunke down to rights, and had little but their Maſts appearing above water.</p>
            <p>It remained to compleat this Mercy, that our own ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſhould come off well, wherein the greateſt hazzard and difficulty lay; for ſome riding near into the ſhore and being ſorely maimed, did require to be warped off, others when we came to weigh, drove with the wind all the while blowing right into the bay, and one of our beſt Frigates ſtrook: The enemy in the mean time ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freſh men into his Forts for thoſe we had killed and beaten out in the heat of the Action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from them and the Caſtle continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plying upon us, till about ſeven of the Clock at night, every Ship and Veſſell belonging to our Fleet, were by the good hand of God got ſafe out of Command.</p>
            <p>In this ſervice we had not above fifty ſlain outright, and one hundred and twenty wounded, and the damage to our ſhips was ſuch as in two days time we indifferently well repaired for preſent ſecurity. Which we had no ſooner done, but the Wind veered to the Southweſt (which is rare among thoſe Iſlands) and laſted juſt to bring us to our former Station neer <hi>Cape Maries,</hi> where we arrived the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> following: For which mercifull appearance all along with us, we deſire the Lord may have the praiſe and glory, to whom only it is due, And that all thar hear of it may turne and ſay (as of a truth we have found) that among the gods there is none like unto him, neither are there any workes like unto his workes.</p>

FRiday the 26 of <hi>June,</hi> 1657. being agreed upon for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of his Highneſs the Lord Protector, and a large place being raiſed and prepared at the upper end of Weſtminſter Hall, for that purpoſe, there was in the midſt thereof under the great Window, a rich cloth of Eſtate ſet up, and under it a chair of ſtate placed upon an aſcent of two degrees; covered with carpets, and before it a Table with a chair appoynted for the Speaker of the Parliament, and on each ſide of the Hall upon the ſaid ſtructure, were ſeats raiſed one above another, and decently covered for the Members of Parliament, and below them, ſeats on one ſide for my Lords the Judges of the Land, and on the otherſide for the Aldermen of the city of London.</p>
            <p>About two of the clock in the Afternoon his Highneſſe came from Whitehall by water, and Landing at the Parliament ſtairs went up into the chamber called the Lords houſe, where having retired himſelf a while, Mr. Speaker and the members of parliament being come to the <hi>Painted Chamber</hi> his Highneſs attended by his Councell, the Officers of State, and the Judges met them, and gave his conſent to the <hi>Additionall and Explanatory Petition and advice</hi> of the Parliament, and all ſuch other Bills as were then preſented to him.</p>
            <p>From thence the Speaker, with the Members of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the great Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the places provided for them.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſe after a ſhort retirement in a Boom, near the Painted Chamber, returned into the Lords Houſe, the Lords Commiſſioners of the great ſeale, the two Lords Chiefe Juſtices the Maſter of the Rolls, and the Judges, in the interim, placing themſelves on one ſide of the ſaid Houſe, and the Lord Major, Recorder, and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> on the other. From the ſaid Houſe, his Highneſſe paſſed towards the Hall in manner following.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, went his Highneſſe his Gentleman, and other perſons of quality? next an Officer of Arms going before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> in their Scarlets; next, another Officer of Arms went before Maſter Attorney Generall, and my Lords the Judges in their Robes and Order; next them, <hi>Norroy,</hi> King of Arms; then four Searjants at Armes with their Maces,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106799:17"/>
going before the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and of the Great Seale, (the Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Fiennes</hi> bearing the Seal) and the Lord Preſident of his Highneſſe Councill; Then came Garter, principall King of Armes, before the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> who bare the Sword before his Highneſſe: on whoſe left hand went the Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> by his Highneſſe ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour bearing the City ſword: After whom came his Highneſſe, being attended by his Councill, the Principall Secretary of State, and divers of the Nobility, and other perſons of great quality.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs being entred on the place, and ſtanding under the Cloth of Eſtate, Maſter Speaker did in the name of the Parliament, preſent ſeverall things (ready laid upon the Table) to his Highneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> A Robe of purple Velvet, lined with Ermine, being the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit anciently uſed at the ſolemn inveſtiture of Princes. Next, a larg Bible richly guilt and boſſ'd; next a Sword; and laſtly, a Sceprer, being of Maſſy Gold: which being ſo preſented, Mr Speaker came from his Chair, took the Robe, and therewith veſted his Highneſſe, being aſſiſted therein by the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lord <hi>Whitelock,</hi> and others. Which being done, the Eible was delivered unto his Highneſſe; after that, Mr Speaker girt about him the Sword; and laſtly, delivered his Highneſſe the Scepter.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being performed, Mr Speaker returned unto his Chair, and adminiſtred the Oath to his Highneſſe, prepared by the Parliament, the form whereof is as followeth.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The occaſion of this great convention and intercourſe, is, To give an Inveſtiture to your Highneſſe in that eminent place of Lord Protestor: A name you had before, but it is now ſetled by the full and unanimous conſent of the People of theſe three Nations aſſembled in Parliament. You have no new name, but a new date added to the Old Name; The ſixteenth of</hi> December, <hi>is now changed to the</hi> 26 <hi>of</hi> June.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I am commanded by the Parliament, to make oblation to your Highneſſe of Four things in order to this Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Firſt is a Robe of Purple an Embleme of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and imports righteousneſſe and juſtice: When you have put on this Veſtment, I may ſay (and I hope without offence)</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106799:18"/>
                           <hi>that you are a Gown man. This Robe is of a mixt colour, to ſhew the mixture of Juſtice and Mercy, which are then moſt excellent when they are well tempered together. Juſtice without mercy, is Wormwood and bitterneſſe; and Mercy without Juſtice is of two ſoft a temper for Government. For, a Magiſtrate muſt have two hands,</hi> Plectentem <hi>&amp;</hi> Amplectentem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Next thing is a Bible, a Booke that contains the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; in which you have the honour and happineſſe to be well verſed. This is the Book of life, conſiſting of two Teſtaments, the Old and New. In the firſt we have</hi> Chriſtum velatum <hi>Chriſt in Types, ſhadows, and Figures; in the latter, we have</hi> Chriſtum revelatum, <hi>Chriſt revealed. This Book carries in it the Grounds of the true Chriſtian Proteſtant Religion; its a Book of Books, it contains in it both Precepts and Examples for good Government.</hi>

                        <p>That his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren; and that he turn not aſide from the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the right hand or to the left, to the end he may prolong his dayes in his Kingdom, he and his Children in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

Its of antient uſe in this kind; its ſaid in Scripture, in reference to</hi> Judah, <hi>the Royall Tribe,</hi> That the Scepter ſhall not depart from <hi>Judah. It was of like uſe in other Kingdoms and Governments:</hi> Homer <hi>the Prince of the Greek Poets, calls Kings and Princes Scepter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.</hi>

This Sword is an embleme of Juſtice.

            <p>This day his Highneſſe the Lord Protector was proclaimed in the City with great ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>About ten a clock in the morning at <hi>Whitehall</hi> Gate, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons met who were to give attendance upon this Ceremony.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Meſſengers belonging to the Councill; next Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petters; next them the lifeguard of his Highneſſe; after them other Trumpetters; next, his Highneſſe his Gentleman; after them more Trumpetters; next, divers officers of the Army, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly mounted; then Trumpetters again; next the Searjants at Armes, and the Heralds of Armes, and <hi>Garter,</hi> principall King of Armes betwixt two Gentlemen-Uſhers, before his Highneſſe Councill in their Coaches, proceeding in this order to Temple-Bar.</p>
            <p>At this place they were met by the Lord Major mounted on horſeback, in his Crimſon Velvet Gown, and his Colle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From thence an officer of Arms proceeded before the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then next before the Lord Major his Mace-bearer, the Sword-bearer, with his cap of maintenance, and a Herald of Armes.</p>

            <p>The fury of the Jeſuited popiſh party in Poland; having of late, with all violence, been executed in a barbarous manner upon the reformed profeſſors, who are of the Bohemian confeſſion in thoſe parts, inſomuch, that the Churches are diſperſed, and the poor chriſtians forced to fly into forein parts for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their lives; divers of their exiled Paſtors being come into England to ſeek for reliefe, the caſe of the poor exiles ſtands referred by his Highneſſe and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106799:22"/>
Councill, to the conſideration of thoſe worthy and pious perſons (Miniſters, and others) who are the Committee for Piedmont.</p>
            <p>The moſt inhumane perſecutions lately acted by the Papiſts and their party in Poland, againſt our Brethren of the Reformed Religion are ſome of them) as followeth.</p>
            <p>The firſt remarkeable is that of Leſna, a populous wealthy city, and the great refuge of the Reformed, who frequently came thither from other parts for ſhelter. The church there was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three congregations, the Bohemian, the Polonian, and the German. This City they firſt ſet upon, intending to put all to the Sword, and deſtroy it with fire; but the Citizens having notice of their coming on, quitted the City leaving all their wealth behind, flying through Woods and Boggs into Sileſia: ſo that the enemy entring without reſiſtance, found none but aged and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid perſons, whom they barbaroufly flew; and after they had plundered the City, they reduced it to aſhes.</p>
            <p>In other places, they cruelly murthered divers Miniſter; of the Word, and people of all ages and Sexes, making them to end their lives by exquiſite tortures. The Paſtor of the Church of Czvirzin had his eyes firſt pulled out, becauſe he would not renounce the faith; then they pulled off with Pincers, the Joynts of his fingers; but he ſtill remaining conſtant, they poured moulten Lead into his mouth; and laſtly putting his head between the ſhuts of a door, they ſevered it from his body.</p>
            <p>The Paſtor of the Church of Dembnick, and two others, after many vilanous abuſes offered to their perſons, had their throats cut. Finding alſo a young Miniſter in the field, they cut off his head with a Sithe, and afterwards mangled his body. The like cruelty they acted alſo upon a citizen of Leſna, and worſe upon many others, not ſparing even the weaker ſex, nor children.</p>
            <p>A pious Matron of Leſna, with her three children, not getting quick enough out of Town, was murthered in the open ſtreet, her hands and feet cut off, and two of her children with their heads cut off laid upon her breaſts, the third by her ſide.</p>
            <p>Another alſo having her hands and feet chopt off, and her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106799:22"/>
tongue cut out, being afterwards tied up in a Sack, lived ſo two dayes in a moſt lamentable condition, Nay, their cruelty extended to the very carkaſes after perſons were dead, haling them out of their graves, and dragging them up and down the ſtreets; ſome of the carkaſes they chopt in pieces, and ſome they expoſed naked for ſpectacles, as the dead body of the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> who was firſt ſlain at <hi>Kotzchi</hi> in a Barbarous manner, but buried at Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and by them taken out of the grave. The like uſage had the body of <hi>Arciſſenski,</hi> heretofore Admirall of the hollanders in Braſile.

               <hi>Some Heads of the</hi> Speech <hi>made by His Highneſſe;</hi> January 1657.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HIs Highneſſe ſaid, He met them there in that Capacity, by the Advice and Petition of this preſent Parliament after ſo much Expence of Blood and Treaſure, to ſearch and try what Bleſſings God hath in ſtore for theſe Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he could not but with gladneſſe of heart remember and acknowledge the labor and induſtry that is paſt, which hath been ſpent upon a Buſineſſe worthy of the beſt men, and the beſt Chriſtians. That it was not unknown unto them all, what difficulties we have paſt through, and at what we are now arived, and that he hoped it might be ſaid, we have arived at what we aimed at, if not at that which is much beyond our expectations. That the ſtate of this cauſe, and the quarrel at firſt, was, the maintaining of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Nations, our Civill liberties as men, and our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberties as Chriſtians. That it was well known, the firſt Declaration after the Beginning of the late Warr that ſpake to the life, was a ſenſe held forth by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that for ſometime before, Deſignes had been laid to Innovate upon the Civil Rights of the Nations; to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in matter of Religion; and thoſe perſons who a man would have thought ſhould have had the leaſt hand in med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106799:24"/>
               <hi>with civill things, did juſtifie all irregular Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſastions in Pulpits, Preſſes, and otherwiſe, which they thought would be a means to ſhelter them while they inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated upon us in matters of Religion alſo, and proceeded ſo to Innovate, as to eat out the Core, and power, the heart and life of all Religion, by bringing on us a company of poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Popiſh Ceremonies, and impoſing them upon thoſe that were call'd and accounted the</hi> Puritans <hi>of the Nation, and profeſſors of Religion among us, driving them to ſeek their bread in a howling Wilderneſſe; they were forced to fly into</hi> Holland, New-England, <hi>almoſt any whither, to find liberty for their Conſciences. That if this thing hath been the ſtate and ſum of our Quarrel, and of the late ten years Wars, and the good hand of God hath brought this Euſineſſe thus home unto us, as it is ſtated in the</hi> Petition <hi>and</hi> Advice, <hi>then that He and they have all cauſe to bleſſe God, and the Nations have cauſe to bleſſe him. And if the enjoyment of our preſent peace and other mens Mercies may be witneſſes for God, we feel and we ſee them every Day. That the greateſt Demonſtration of his Favor and love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in this, that he hath given us peace, and the bleſſings of Peace, to wit, the enjoyment of our Liberties ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Spirituall. That when we were plunged in the midſt of our Troubles, it could not before-thought that ever the people of God ſhould have had liberty to worſhip God without fear of Enemies; yet this is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God hath given us, and he hoped we ſhall for ever heartily acknowledge it, it being our glory that we have a free poſſeſſion of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That notwithſtanding this, we are not without the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings of many people, who turn all this Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into Wormwood, who indeed are diſappointed by the Works of God, and thoſe men are of ſeverall ranks and</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

great ones, leſſer ones, men of all ſorts; men that are of the Epiſcopall Spirit, who gave themſelves a fatall blow in this place, when they would needs make a Proteſtation, That no Laws were good which were made by this Houſe, and the Houſe of Commons, in their abſence; and ſo without injury to themſelves, they cut off themſelves. That we have now a Godly Miniſtry, a knowing Miniſtry; ſuch a one, as (without Vanity be it ſpoken) the World hath not the like, Men knowing the things of God, and able to ſearch into the things of God, by that only which can fathome thoſe things in ſome meaſure, to wit, by the Spirit of God. That the reaſon why men ſlip in this age is, becauſe they underſtand not the Works of God, and conſider not the operation of his hands: They conſider not, that God reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brake in pieces the powers that were, that men might fear him, might have liberty to do and enjoy all that he had been now ſpeaking of. Thence it is, that men ſlip, and engage themſelves againſt God; and for that very cauſe (as it is in the 28 <hi>Pſalm) He ſhall break them down, and not build them up.</hi> That if we would know upon what foundation we ſtand, we ſhould own our foundation from God; he hath ſet us where we are; he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us in the enjoyment of our Civil, and of our Spirituall Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. That upon this foundation of a cauſe and Quarrel thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and wherein we are thus eſtated; he told the Parliament he ſhould be glad to lay his bones with theirs, and would have done it with all heartineſſe, and cheerfulneſſe, in the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity that he ever yet was in, to ſerve the Parliament. His Highneſſe concluded, That he had been ſpeaking of but what they had done; and that if God ſhould be pleaſed to make this Meeting happy upon this account, They would be called the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Lord; the Generations to come will bleſſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That having ſome infirmities upon him, he had not liberty to ſpeak at large, but had deſired an honorable perſon preſent, to diſcourſe a little more particularly what might be more proper for this occaſion, and this meeting. Which particulars were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards delivered in a Grave and Eloquent Speech at large, by the Lord <hi>Fiennes,</hi> one of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal.</p>

            <p>This afternoon, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councill of the City of <hi>London,</hi> came hither in a Body, to attend his Highneſſe; as alſo the Commanders and Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And being admitted to his preſence, his Highneſſe was pleaſed in a Speech at large, to repreſent unto them the danger, wherein they of the whole City, and the whole Nation, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved at preſent, by reaſon of the new deſignes of the old Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> and his confederates abroad, and his party here at home, who have been at work ſecretly to imbroil the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again in Blood, as ſoon as he ſhould be able to make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended invaſion. His Highneſs alſo told them, that he knew this to be true; That he knew it by Letters of theirs intercepted, by certain intelligence from abroad of their proceedings, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from the mouths of ſuch perſons as had been engaged to act with them. He acquainted them likewiſe, that the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> whom ſome now call the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> in perſon had been lately here for three weekes together, being come over on purpoſe to promote the deſign, by encouraging and engaging as many as he could in and about this City; and that he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again on Tueſday laſt. Alſo, in order to this invaſion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106799:27"/>
               <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> was waiting in <hi>Flanders,</hi> having about eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men quartered in ſeverall places near the water ſide, as at <hi>Brugges, Bruſſells, Oſtend,</hi> &amp;c. And that two and twenty hired Ships, were in readineſſe to tranſport them, waiting only for the opportunity of ſome darke night to ſlip by our Fleet; which they may the more eaſily perform, ours being ſhips of great burthen, drawing much water, and ſo not able to ride upon the Flats. And therefore ſeeing a reall danger ſo near at hand, and that the peace and ſafety of the City; and the whole Nation is Highly concerned in it, he deſired the Citizens might be ſenſible of it, and how much it behoves them to provide for their own and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſecurity. And to that end, his Highneſſe recommended to the Lord Major, and the Body of the City, the ſetling of their <hi>Militia:</hi> and that it might be ſetled in the hands of Pious and ſober men, well affected to the preſent Government and ſuch as are free from diſcontent and faction; perſons that may carry on the worke with alacrity and diſcretion; to put the City in a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of defence, that they may be in a condition to ſuppreſſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and inſurrections, deſigned by the Enemies of our Peace and Proſperity, Many other particulars his Highneſſe inſided on, to give them an account of the preſent ſtate of affairs, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſt tranſactions; but having no notes to help my memory, and being afraid leſt I may already have faln ſhort in relating the Heads of what was more copiouſly and much better ſpoken, I have only this to adde. That the citizens expreſſed much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in the preſence of his Highneſſe; and departed with very great ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>THe All wiſe and Holy God, whoſe wayes of Providence are alwayes righteous, though often ſecret and unſearchable, hath made it the conſtant lot and portion of his people in this World, to follow the Lord in bearing his Croſs, and ſuffering perſecutions, thereby holding forth and verifying that irreconcileable Enmity between the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent, which was viſible betimes in the Blood ſhed of righteous Abel, whom Cain (though his Brother) ſlew being of the wicked one, yea and for this cauſe, for that his own works were evill, and his Brothers good: Thus they that are born after the fleſh, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them that are born after the Spirit to this day, and ſo will do while the World laſteth. In which Cauſe and Quarrell the Lord hath very many glorious ends. But ſcarcely have any ſort of the Churches Enemies more clearly followed the pernicions wayes of <hi>Cain</hi> herein, than hath the Anti-Chriſtian Faction of <hi>Rome</hi> done, that Mother of Harlots and abominations, whoſe garments are died red with the blood of Saints, which they have alwayes cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhed, and made themſelves drunk with, even the blood of thoſe holy Followers of the Lamb, chiefly who would not receive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts mark, nor worſhip his Image, nor drink of the Golden Cup of his Fornications, but rather come out from them, and witneſſe againſt them, though they did it in ſack-cloth, and were ſlain for it. Among thoſe choſen and faithfull Witneſſes, the Lord ſeemed very ſignally to have raiſed up thoſe Chriſtians, who (though diſperſed in divers Countreyes) have been commonly known by the name of <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who for ſome Centuries of years have lived among their enemies as Lambs among Wolves, to bear their Teſtimony for the truth of Chriſt, againſt the Apoſtacies and Blaſphemies of <hi>Rome,</hi> for which they have been killed all the day long, and appointed as ſheep for the ſlaughter. Nevertheleſs the Lord, the great Shepheard of the ſheep, hath made their blood thus ſhed, to become a conſtant ſeed of faithfull and Valiant wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106799:28"/>
for him; which is indeed, the more marvellous in our eyes, that this Buſh hath ſo long burned, and is not yet conſumed. This little flock and remnant which the Lord hath left and reſerved, are ſcattered in the <hi>Valleyes of Piedmont,</hi> of whoſe tragicall ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings we have not long ſince heard, and have drawn forth our bowels to them, whereof a very faithfull accompt is given to the World, both for ſatisfaction of Brethren and Friends, and for ſtopping the mouthes of all Calumnies. The other part of this poor, yet precious Remnant, hath been diſperſed in the Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> whoſe ſufferings, together with the Lords ſignall providences about them have been very eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as hath been made appear unto us by three godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, delegated by thoſe perſecuted Churches, which are now the ſad Monuments of their Enemies rage, and of the Lords ſparing Mercies. Theſe have made their addreſſes to his Highneſs the Lord Protector by Petition, declaring the deplorable eſtate wherein this perſecuted Remnant now lieth, and with loud cryes importuning the Chriſtian Bowells and Bounty of this Nation, which cannot but be moved to mourn over them, and to ſhew mercy to them. And indeed upon a due ſenſe and conſideration of this lamentable ſubject, even common humanity, but much more chriſtian charity ſhould provoke us to a fellow feeling of their preſent diſtreſſed condition. Theſe ſomtimes flouriſhing churches, where by degrees worn out by the conſtant underminings and open out rages of the Antichriſtian party, being firſt driven out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> then after their taking root and ſpreading in <hi>Poland</hi> unto a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous company, were forced out of the chief Cities there, and now at laſt by the Jeſuited and inraged Poliſh Army perſecuted in their few hiding places, with fire and ſword. Their Miniſters were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to death by moſt exquiſite and unheard of Barbariſm, by cutting out of the tongues of ſome, pulling out the eyes, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly mangling the Bodies of others; nor did their rage and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Cruelty reach only to Miniſters, but to others, yea even to women and young Children, whoſe heads they cut off, and them at their dead mothers breaſts. Nay, their rage brake out, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the living (not one of whom they ſpared that fell into their hands) but alſo upon the dead, plucking the bodies of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons and others out of the graves, tearing them to pieces, and expoſing them to publick ſcorn.</p>

But the chief Eye ſore and object of their Fury was the City of Leſna, which (after plundering and murthering all whom they found therein) they burned to aſhes, and laid in rubbiſh, only the Lord in his mercy having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd the City of their enemies approaching March, the greateſt part of the Inhabitants (being three famous Churches) ſaved themſelve by flight, and are now wandring up and down in Sileſia, the Marguifate of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Luſatia and Hungary, poor, deſtitute, afflicted and naked. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Councill having referred unto this Committee the Teſtimonials and Petitions ſent by the ſaid Churches, We finding upon examination thereof, their caſe to be thus deplorable, which is more at large ſtated and declared in their own Narrative, have cauſed the ſaid Narrative to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, and here with publiſhed, thereby to ſtirr up the Lords people in theſe Nations to put on bowels of mercies toward theſe their exiled and afflicted brethren, refreſhing their hearts by your love, and the tokens of it in a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and liberall ſupply; which will not only preſerve this holy ſeed from periſhing, that hath a bleſſing in it, but alſo uphold among them the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion and power of the Goſpel. The rather conſiderng the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent freedome from theſe bloody outrages, we the people of theſe Nations do by the bleſſing of the Lord enjoy, the continuance whereof we may the more comfortably hope for, by how much our compaſſions are more freely extended to thoſe in miſery. And if a cup of cold water given to one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as ſuch ſhall not loſe its reward; how much more when a bountifull relief is given to more then five thouſand diſciples? Which we ſhould be the more forward to advance, becauſe they acknowledge they have received much confirmation in the Religion for which they ſuffer, by light received from our Country man John Wicklof, that famous witneſſe of Chriſt againſt Antichriſt, even in the darkeſt times of Popery. And I doubt no: but that God who hath lately opened your bowels to ſo large and eminent a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution towards the perſecuted Proteſtants at <hi>Piedmont,</hi> for which many Thanksgivings have been made to God on your behalf will again draw out your hearts upon this like ſad occaſion, to the like bountifull liberality, it being our duty to caſt our bread upon the waters, and to give a portion to ſix and alſo to ſeven, not being weary of well-doing, becauſe in due time we ſhall reap if we faint not.

               <head>The ſubſtance of Sir Henry Slingsby's ſpeech, at <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> June 8. 1658.</head>
               <p>THat he ſtood condemned by the court of juſtice as contriving and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to withdraw divers officers of the gariſon of <hi>Kingſton upon Hull</hi> from their duty, and perſwading them to a ſurrendring and yeelding up of that Gariſon, and one that held correſpondence with ſome beyond Sea to that end. That it was true, he had conference upon that account with the officers of that Gariſon; and that he gave Major <hi>Waterhouſe</hi> a commiſſion ſigned <hi>Charls R.</hi> but that it was but an old one that had lain by him, though he thought fit to make uſe of it to the Major. Many paſſages he ſaid there were which he would not inſiſt on, That ſome friends of his had made application to his Highnes for the ſaving of his life, but it ſeemes it was thought fit not to be granted, &amp;c. and therefore he ſubmitted and was ready to dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſpake but low, and very little, and kept himſelfe in a very even temper, both in words and behaviour. Then addreſſing himſelfe againe to his friends, he called for the executioner, who having received his reward by the hand of a friend, came to him, placed the block in the middle of the Scaffold, which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> beheld with his armes folded, and a ſetled countenance; an officer ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by with the Ax. Then the priſoner declaring he had no more to ſay, ſtripped himſelfe. Before he put off his band, he deſired a friend ſtanding by; to take off a Ring which hung in his Bandſtring, 'twas in the form, and about the breadth of an ordinary ſeal; but inſtead of a ſeale engraven, it had the Picture of the late King done in little and very exactly. When the Gentleman had taken it off, he ſaid theſe words to him, <hi>Pray give this to Harry.</hi> His doublet being off, he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106799:30"/>
kneel'd down before the block, and lifting up his hands as before, he again pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privately to himſelf, but was very ſhort. Then riſing up, and embracing his friends one after another, tooke his leave of them all. After this kneeling down, and placing his neck upon the block, the executioner ſtruck off his head at one blow. The Head was immediately taken off the Scaffold, and put in a black Scarff, the Body into the Coffin, and the Head with it; which being nailed up, and covered, was conveyed off the Scaffold into a Herſe drawn by ſix horſes, which ſtood ready to receive it.</p>

                  <hi>The ſum of Doctor</hi> Hewet's <hi>Speech</hi> on the Scaffold;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That he had never been in ſuch a Pulpit as this was; and that he came thither, within a few minutes to ſuffer death for the Truth, and to bear teſtimony thereto, according to that ſaying of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, For this end was I born, and for this end came I into the world, to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Truth. And that in two reſpects; Firſt, as a Clergy-man; and ſecondly, as a Member of the community in which he lived. As a Clergy-man, he bleſſed God that had called him to the office of the Miniſtry, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; and that he had been baptized into the true faith and doctrine of the Goſpel, and thereby made a member of the Catholique Church, eſpecially of that part of it, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he looked upon as the pureſt for ſound doctrine and orderly diſcipline, of any in the chriſtian world; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned all others walking contrary thereunto. <hi>[Here the Reader is to obſerve, that the Doctor was not queſtioned for any poynt of</hi> Faith <hi>he held, but for being a</hi> Traitor; <hi>and ſo he dyed not for</hi> truth, <hi>but for</hi> Treaſon.] In the ſecond place, as one of the community or civill ſtate, he looked upon himſelfe as borne a free Engliſhman, and in that capacity had a right to the Liberties and priviledges of this Land, and to the Laws thereof. Here he tooke occaſion to ſpeake of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages at his tryall before the Court of Juſtice ſaying that having been adviſed by perſons learned in the Law, and being furniſhed with ſome books of Law caſes and reports, he was thereby inſtructed to make ſeverall demands in court; as that he might be ſatisfied about the juriſdiction of the court; then that he might have counſel allowed; afterwards being told in court that they were to try him in matter of fact, to which he ought firſt to plead; he in the next place ſaid he deſired that the matter might be heard by the Judges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon appealed to them; which would not be admitted; he being told the court had a full Juriſdiction by Act of Parliament; That he had alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that he might have a Jury to be tryed by, but that was not granted him, but the court being erected according to Act of Parliament; they ſupplyed a Jury. Theſe things he inſiſted on as the Rights and Priviledges of an Engliſh man, and being denied him, he thereupon refuſed to plead.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106799:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That the Preſident of the Court, did indeed read the Clauſe in the Act, which declared, That in caſe he ſtood mute, he muſt be taken as guilty upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of anſwer; and that he having made three defaults, was at laſt taken from the bar, then when he intended to have pleaded. <hi>[One would wonder ſuch words ſhould proceed from a dying man, whereas all perſons preſent, and at his tryall, do know that the Court had patience with him ſome hours, and in a great deale of tenderneſſe towards him, cauſed the Clauſe in the Act which concerns default of anſwer to be read to him ſeveral times, and to the very laſt adviſed him to plead, but he ſtill refuſed, and never uttered ſo much as one Syllable that he would plead.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he ſaid, he the next morning made application to the Court, ſitting in the Painted Chamber, by Petition, that he might have liberty to plead; which being preſented, and found to be defective as to the due Title, it was laid aſide: Then another petition was drawn up, with the Title amended, which himſelfe

ſubſcribed, but that the return made to this, was, That he ſhould have his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in Court: Which anſwer was, that Sentence of condemnation which brought him to this place; and that being now to dye, he might ſay, <hi>He was to dye the Martyr of the People,</hi> and that he did from his very ſoule freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe that were the occaſion of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Here I cannot but obſerve, that this dying mans Charity was greater then his memory; becauſe, what he ſayes here, claſhes with what he ſaid before, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing by his own very words, That if he were a Martyr for the people, it was</hi>

That having declared what paſſed upon his tryall in Court, he would next proceed to cleere himſelfe of ſome imputations laid upon him: one whereof was, That he was one engaged with thoſe, who were ſaid to have deſigned the firing of the City: to this he proteſted, That had he been engaged amongſt ſuch perſons that ſhould have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another was, That it was reported he ſhould entertain the Duke or Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and harbored him in his houſe, when lately here in England: to which he proteſted, That (to his beſt remembrance he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw his perſon, A third was, that it was reported he ſhould be preaching at St. <hi>Gregories</hi> one Sunday, and that the next after, being abſent, he ſhould be at <hi>Brudges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there have communication with him whom he called the King, and kiſs his hand: In anſwer to this he ſaid, That for theſe three yeares paſt, he had not been threeſcore miles from this City, and I am ſure ſaid he, that <hi>Brudges</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> is a great deale farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[This pains the Doctor might have ſpared, ſeeing none of the particulars he was pleaſed to dilate upon, were ever charged upon him by any Authority, but it is very obſervable, that in all his diſcourſe upon the Scaffold, he never made any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His prayer conſiſted of ſeverall parts.</p>
               <p>After which the Executioner asking him if he were ready, he anſwered <hi>Yea,</hi> and his head was ſevered from his body at one blow and a little raſe of the Ax upon a ſmall piece of the skin.

As concerning them that are my enemies, I pray God forgive them their ſins, I freely forgive them all that have done me wrong. As for the late Plot, I was never but once in company with them concerned therein: I did know of ſuch a thing, but deny that I acted therein. Shall I damne my ſoule at this inſtant? I will ſpeake the truth. I doe acknowledge I offended God in it, and wronged this Nation in hearing it, and not diſcovering it. One <hi>Brandon</hi> that was one of them, drew
