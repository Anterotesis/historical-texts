            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And again, when I call to mind these Times, and how the Manners of Men are corrupted, there arifeth in my mind a doubtful wavering, distracting me several ways, not without some fear joyned therewith, That which causeth me to

               </gap> is this, lest the greatest part of our People (as the minds of Men are apt to catch at the smailest occasious) Should contract Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from this mild and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctrine of Evangelical Iustification, to grow the more bold in Sinning. From whence I do therefore partly apprehend, what the Silent Thoughts of Some Men may object against me; who, though they will not deny the things which we say of Christ to be true, yet they will judge them unseasonable for the Times and Manners of Men now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-days, being so corrupted and infected. Nay, that they are rather hurtful, and open a door to greater boldness and security in sinning.

thunder out something from the severe Law of God, which may terrifie the minds of the People with the healthful Fear of God, and the dreadfulness of Divine Vengeance, which maytake away the furious Lusts of Life, and restrain unbridled Boldness, and reduce Men into a course of more severe discipline, and reclaim them from Wickedness to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Repentance, and drive all Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by all means to endeavour the best things. But what other thing do I drive at in these Treatises throughout, though not with the same dexterity of Speech, and excellency of Wit as many Men, yet aiming altogether at the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. For if we look at the End of things with a right Iudgment, what is the Design of all the Doctrine of the Sacred Gospel, concerning Faith, Christ the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Free Iustification by him, but that by setting before Men the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bestowed upon us by Christ, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his Special Favour, the winds of Believers being so much more easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the admiration of heavenly things, may be won over to a contempt of this World? Though in the mean time I am not unsensible, that there be some perhaps of a contrary Opinion: to wit,
<pb facs="tcp:95561:4"/>
that no other way or Medicine for rooting out of Vices, and reforming Manners should be used, but to stupifie the Ears of simple Men with perpetual inculcating of Laws and Precepts, and dreadful Threatnings to stir up Terrour. Unto whose Opinion, as I would not oppose my self, so also I cannot but greatly commend their Labour.</p>
            <p>But again, neither should they be blamed, who teach Christ, nor the promulgation of the Gospel neglected, because many abuse it. Before the Father sent his son into the World, he was not ignorant that the World would not receive him, and yet he sent him nevertheless. Though he knew there were many that loved Darkness more than Light, notwithstanding the true Light shined from Heaven, which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into this World.</p>
            <p>There hath never been so happy a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but the worser part hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in number, and always the fewest were pleased with the best things. But I doubt whether ever such abominable Impudence in sinning came to so great a height in any Age. Wherefore I confess, that so much the more their Endeavours should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, who give all diligence for this purpose, and rebuke with sharpness, that
<pb facs="tcp:95561:4"/>
wickedness may be purged away out of the Christian Common-wealth. For what can they do more agreeably? But yet Christ Should not therefore be expelled from the Church. Yea, if I may be allowed to speak freely, I know not whereunto this so great depravation and overflowing of all most abominable iniquities should be imputed, but that Christ the best Instructer of Life, doth not so reign in the minds of Men, as in right he ought. This World hath its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers. But Christ also hath his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and afflicted Elect in the World, the care of whom should not be neglected. Therefore they that are angry at the filthy Manners of this Life, do well therein; but yet they do not ill, that are angry at the corrupt Errours of Doctrine, about which, according to my Opinion, no less care should be taken then about Manners. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is commanded to declare unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their sins. True indeed.</p>
            <p>But again, the same Prophet is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to comfort his People. Also the Voice of the Prophet is commanded to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie with a loud Cry to the Cities of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> concerning the Saviour their King, and his Reward, and the Saving Grace and Glory of God, which was to be
<pb facs="tcp:95561:5"/>
revealed in that People: So then, the Church hath her Prophets, I know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>
            <p>And again, the Divine Bounty so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth its Gifts, that the same hath also its Evangelists. But now, where is there one of all the Prophets that came before Christ's Time, but he is found frequently to Evangelize something of Christ very sweetly with joyful Proclamations? We bear the same testified by <hi>Peter;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> To him, faith he, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets bear witness, That as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him shall receive remisfion of sins: Wherefore as those are not to be defrauded of their own praise, who do all they can to bring the brutish minds of the People to a deteflation of their own evil deeds: So again it should be inquired into, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this is all that must be done? Thou callest them back to Repentance, who are running on headlong into their sins, and thou dost well, for it is a great thing. But what will this so much avail, unless Christ also being received by Faith, come together with thy Repentance: For thou art not pardoned only upon the account of thy remorse at the remembrance of thy by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past Life, but because Christ, who never sinned, died for thee.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95561:5"/>
            <p>Though again, neither doth he forgive any, but him that repents truely, and from his Heart. Therefore these two must be joyned together, and always retained in the Church: But so that Salvation and Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication should be understood to consist prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, not in the Life of Men, if it were never so Holy, but in the Doctrine of Faith rightly taught.</p>
            <p>In which Matter, this whole Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Papists, seems to me not a little deceived, who look upon this our Christian Religion, to be nothing else, but a Moral Doctrine of framing the Life, according to the right Rules of Living; which when a Man hath strictly observed, and thereby gained the Reputation of Vertue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Honesty, they think nothing further is wanting to the compleat Perfection of Christian Philosophy; which if it be true, I scarcely discern what difference there is between us and the Ancient Philosophers. For what Sect of Philosophers was ever so grosly absurd, but that they esteemed it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to contemn those things, with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Desire whereof we Christians are so much transported, that we are in the next degree to Madness? That Money ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes any Man Happy. That the
<pb facs="tcp:95561:6"/>
end of good, should by no means be placed in Honours or Pleasures. The Stoicks were not ignorant, that no Man is wise, but a good Man. They saw that nothing was good and honourable, but true Vertue, and nothing should be accounted Evil but only Filthiness. <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> Disputes, that Injury should not be revenged by an Injury: And that the Soul should by all means be drawn away from the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body. Moreover that, the Soul being Immortal, they are not in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition, who after having passed their Life honestly, depart hence into more blessed Habitations. What shall I say of <hi>Plato,</hi> or of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, denies that any thing can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant unto Men in Life, except Vertue, in which only Pleasure consists. How holily doth <hi>M. Cicero</hi> write of Offices? Yea those Men did not only teach such things, but not a few of them, did also perform great part of their Doctrine, both amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latins,</hi> especially <hi>Socrates, Aristides, Diogenes, Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the <hi>Curij,</hi> the <hi>Fabij,</hi> the <hi>Fabricij,</hi> and the <hi>Scipio's.</hi> Whose Life, Vertues, and famous Acts, if we look into, and compare them with the Catacatholicks in
<pb facs="tcp:95561:6"/>
our Days, O how ashamed may they be at so great a difference as is between them! And yet as all these things, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent, profited them nothing to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without Christ, so also we should suppose, that in all our Vertue, and good Deeds there is nothing, that distinguishes us before God from their Paganism, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less besides the Condition of Life, there be added another Doctrine, and Profession of Religion, which doth not, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers of old, Dispute about Vertues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Moral Duties, or about placing the chief Good in the Excellency of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Charity, nor makes enquiry about legal Righteousness, and civil Iudgments: But calls us forth unto deeper Mysteries, and instructs the Minds of Believers soundly and solidly, concerning the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudgment of God, his Will, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement by Covenant, concerning the Son of God, and our Eternal Redemption by Christ, Peace, Iustification, Faith, the Hope of our Calling, the largeness of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace of God, Salvation and the Crown of Immortality.</p>
            <p>These seem to me to be the Principal Heads, in which all the Strength and Nature of our Religion, all our Peace

and Tranquility, and all the way of our Salvation and Doctrine is contained: Which manner of Doctrine, I think all means should be used, that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church sound and entire.</p>
            <p>And this was the chiefest Cause, that stirred me up to undertake this Defence, wherein I am now engaged, not that I might open a Door of Licentiousness to Men of unclean Dispositions: But that I might lay open unto all Godly Brethren, and especially to those that are afflicted, the boundless and eternal Riches of the Grace of God in Christ purchased for us, the Glory of the Kingdom, the Stable and undoubted good Pleasure of his reconciled favour.</p>
            <p>What if some are of such a perverse Mind, that they design to abuse this our peaceable and healthful debate, about Faith and the Grace of Iustification, for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their own Uurighteouness, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Licentiousness, I give them notice now before hand, that these things were neither written, nor thought upon by me for them, but only for the Godly, whose Consciences in this World are burdened and afflicted, (to whom I would peculiarly Dedicate this Work, such as it is) that I might ease
<pb facs="tcp:95561:7"/>
and refresh them in Christ, in the great straits of their Agonies with some Lenitive of Evangelical Doctrine, against the ensnaring assaults of Satan.</p>
            <p>And likewise, that I might strengthen and preserve them, as with an Antidote against the Malignity of the Pseudocatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Adversaries, and the subtile deceits of Sophisters: Who by an infinite number of Books already published, and by hurrying new ones daily into publick view, keep no measure, and make no end of Writing, that they may subvert the right ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I have nothing at present that I can say of that our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Stapleton,</hi> but that it troubles me much, his Book so prolixely Talkative, came no sooner to my Hands. Now because this so tumultuous a noise of twelve Books, which he seems to have armed against Christ, and his twelve Apostles, to conquer the simplicity of Evangelical Doctrine, requires more leisure to examine his so many, and so great Authorities heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of <hi>Augustin;</hi> I must beg a Truce of Him, until I can bestow requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Pains on so great a Doctor, if so be God will furnish me with Strength,
<pb facs="tcp:95561:8"/>
that I may be able to perform it.</p>
            <p>Now I pray the Lord Iesus, who was crucified for our Sins, that according to the unspeakable greatness of his Power, whereby he can do all things with his Father in Heaven and in Earth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his great loving Kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that he would fructifie our Minds daily more and more, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Grace, nourish them by his Presence, confirm them by his Power, that he would defend the afflicted cause of the Gospel, against the Plagues of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, disappoint the attempts of malicious Persons, endeavouring our Destruction, still disorderly Tumults and vain Iang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Church, grant Peace to our Times, Pardon to our Sins, Strength and Victory to our Faith, Skilful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Church, and Dexterity in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teaching to the workmen; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that he would refresh and Comfort with the Gracious Favour of his Divine Majesty, the pious and perplexed Consciences of Believers, combating with Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or exercised with sharp Affliction, for the Glory of his own Name, to whom with the Father, and the Holy Spirit all Glory is due for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

            <head>OF Free Iustification by Christ.</head>
            <p>In Reading your Books, <hi>Hierom Osorius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Righteousness, though I had not leisure accurately to trace every particular, on which you have enlarged, yet by what I have here and there collected, I think I do well enough perceive whereat you drive, what you design, and what you endeavour: For, according to my apprehension, you are endeavouring, not to strike at some part of Christian Doctrine of smaller concernment, but to cut the very Throat, and extinguish the Breath and Spirit of the Gospel, and to besiege the whole state of our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and the Castle and chief City of Christian Liberty, and to pluck up from the very Foundation all the Munitions of <note place="margin">The necessity of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against <hi>Osorius.</hi>
               </note> Peace and Life: For what other thing dost thou in all these ten Books, whereby thou snatchest away out of the Hands, Studies, Minds and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, and out of the Earth. as the Sun out of the World, that most glorious Light of our Free Iustification, purchased by the great bounty of Christ, and confirmed by the Eternal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95561:10"/>
Covenant of God: Which being taken away, I see not what thou leavest remaining to us, but <hi>Cimmerian</hi> and <hi>Osorian</hi> Darkness, in which we may grope like blind Moles: Which endeavours of thine, though of themselves being vain and frivolous, there is no great cause, why they should be feared in their opposition against the invincible force of Divine Truth; yet because they strive to with-hold from us that which is most excellent in all Religion; therefore I thought it was necessary to write these things unto thee, not being provoked by any Enmity or Hatred against thy Person, that I might vex thee, but that I might admonish thee both friendly and freely; and so much the more freely, in how much greater danger I see thou art entangled, unless thou return back, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walk more uprightly according to the Gospel of Christ. For what think you, Sir? That by your deeds performed as well as can be imagined, and by the steps of your vertues, you can lay for your self a passage into the Kingdom of God? Or think you that any man living in this slippery condition of Nature, can root out all his Lusts, and utterly cut off all their entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so contain himself within the bounds of his duty, that he can equalize those habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eternal Glory, with a proportionable dignity of Righteousness, or dare promise them to himself upon such an account, unless the bounty of God had freely put this honour upon us? O be not of such an opinion! This is not the way to Heaven. Either you must change your mind, or lay down this hope.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95561:10"/>
            <p>Howbeit this opinion seems not to be yours only, but common to you with many, to wit, the late School-Divines, especially those, who have a greater veneration for the authority of the Pope, than the Writings of the Apostles, who being all infected <note place="margin">The Enemies of the Grace of God under the Title of righteousness.</note> with the same contagion of error, do boldly profess the same, that you affirm. But yet all of them do not proceed in the same manner and method. Those do so frame their notions, that all men may understand, they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Enemies of Divine Grace, and our Free Iustification in Christ, which they hiss out of the Schools, and openly anathamatize. Your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings are somewhat different, though you have undertaken, obstinately to maintain the same thing, that they do, but you hide the same ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom with a more subtile artifice, so that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates more easily, and lies less open to rebuke. For I see you <note place="margin">The Books of <hi>Osorius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</note> write Books concerning Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and those not a few, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished. When I look on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I see it is honourable and plausible. When I look into your manner of Speech, your painted eloquence, and laudatory amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, wherewith you adorn the Glory, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Beauty of Righteousness with a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedian-like sublimity of style, I confess this is not unworthy of praise; For who should not deservedly praise him, whom he sees so inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the praises of Righteousness? But if any man look more inwardly, and consider
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95561:11"/>
with himself according to right reason, with what mind, for what end, for what pretence, and with what arguments you maintain those parts of righteousness so much praised, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the Gospel of Christ, he will be forced to acknowledge that you are defective in many things. If you will permit me briefly to give my opinion of the whole frame of this work, (though you have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to what my censure is) yet if you will allow me to speak freely to you as becomes me, I will do it according to my duty, and I will so do it, that you your self may perceive that there was nothing less in my design in writing to you, than a perverse inclination to find fault with other mens writings. And thus I judge, you have so handled this subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that you appear to be a Philosopher Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick enough, and no bad Ciceronian Orator, but not a very Evangelical Divine, I can assure you nor skilful enough to plead the cause of Christian Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <note place="margin">The Title of the Books concerning righteousness.</note> First, As touching the Title of the Book, concerning Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, I find nothing blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Though the frailty of our Nature might persuade you rather to discourse some thing to us of Mercy. Yet seeing you chuse rather to discourse Philosophically of righteousness, you are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">The image of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Osori us.</hi>
               </note> unworthy of your own praise; For being about to treat of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, you have undertaken a very honourable subject, and I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95561:11"/>
doubt too weighty for your Shoulders to bear: and a work indeed very difficult and excellent. For what is more excellent than righteousness in the whole nature of Divine and Humane things? Which seeing it comprehends within its circumference all kinds of vertues, the whole praise of Piety, and not only the highest perfection of the Law, but also the perfect Image of God: indeed it may be found in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but on Earth it cannot be found, when you have said all you can. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ready the more to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">The praise of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and consider with my self, what secret design you had in your mind. that you have composed Books so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately exquisite concerning righteousness. If it was that by the Trumpet of your commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you might make it more acceptable to us, you have therein lighted on a matter, suitable to your wit, and large enough for setting forth the riches of your Eloquence, that I may confess the truth to you. But I wonder for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or end you did that, will you say, that men may the more evidently behold the beauty of righteousness, and admire it the more? But this hath been formerly attempted by <hi>Plato,</hi> and many Academicks and Peripateticks, and that with no bad success. And who is so void of all natural sense, but, though he is not himself endued with the excellency of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, yet he apprehends in his mind the Divine brightness thereof, and greatly admires it, and wishes for it with all his heart? If wishes in this case could do any good.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95561:12"/>
               <head>Inherent Righteousness unto that perfection which Osorius describes, can no where be found in this Nature.</head>
               <p>AND I could wish that the Integrity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein we were of old Created, had continued unto the compleat exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">The Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> of all righteousness: But now in this ruinated and disabled nature, why do you seek after that which we have lost? rather bring forth something, if you can, whereby we may make up the loss: What can it profit a man already dead to know the danger, whereby he perished? Verily there is more need of a medicine, if you have any, by which you may either comfort him being destroyed, or restore him to the Life that was lost: Yea, this is the thing, say you, which I endeavour in these Books disputing of righteousness. For righteousness, as you say, is the only remedy for restoring Life, and regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Health; Yea, this is the very thing, <hi>Osorius,</hi> that I chiefly find fault with in these Books; not because you write of righteousness, for I commend the argument in which you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised; I commend also your praises of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which are high and copious: righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness cannot be praised enough by any Man-But there is another thing for which all good Men should be angry with you: What that is, if you please, I will tell you freely and openly;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95561:12"/>
for in these Books you represent unto us a spectacle, not very much differing from that, which <hi>Origenes</hi> relates of <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Antipho;</hi> who though they did write very contrary to truth, yet they recommended those very Books, that were against the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Osorius</hi> in Writing of Righteousness doth greatly oppose Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> Truth, with the title of (a true saying.) After which manner you do in a case not very unlike it, whilest you write indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning righteousness, but at such a rate, that nothing can be said more maliciously against true righteousness.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>A twofold and different Account of Doctrine; one of the Law, and another of the Gospel.</head>
               <p>FOR as there is a twofold manner of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, so also there is, of righteousness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Scriptures: The one consists in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and works, under the weight whereof we all of necessity fall down to destruction. The other is that of the Gospel, which is safe-guarded, not by works, not <note place="margin">A twofold manner of righteousness.</note> by observance of the Law, not by any peformance of duties on our side, but by the sure and only Faith of Christ the Son of God. Verily whosoever rejecting the righteousness of Christ, whereof I speak, leads us aside unto any other manner of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I say, that he pleads not for righteousness,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95561:13"/>
but against it, and doth not undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Law of God, but is a professed Enemy of the Grace of Christ, and his Cross, and therefore doth not open, but wholly shuts up all passages to true Salvation, and all Gates and Doors of Divine Grace: For I beseech you, if we are willing to confess the truth with the Sacred Scripture, what is it else, in <note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law.</note> which all the fountains and causes of our destruction are contained, unto which, as the principal head and spring, we may attribute all our calamity, but this very manner of righteousness placed in God and his Law; by whose infinite immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity not only our faults, but also all the Poizes of our righteousness are weighed down to the destruction of damnation. If there is nothing but the righteousness of Works, that may help our too scanty and short Obedience.</p>
               <p>But perhaps these things, that have been said hitherto are enough concerning the Title of the Book. By which your prudence may lead you easily to suppose, what should be judged of the rest of the Work, In which, when I contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the external form and countenance of the Workmanship, verily I see that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beauty, nor unworthy to be looked upon; when I number the Books themselves, I take notice they are both many and large enough. When I look on the Words and Pages, I see whole Rivers and Sands that cannot be numbred; but when I turn to the things themselves, when I consider the Reasons and force of Arguments, when I compare the Words and Sayings of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95561:13"/>
Scriptures, at a strange rate quoted, with the true sense of Scriptures not rightly understood by you; and also when I take notice of the end and scope of the whole disputation, I am not willing at present to discover to you what I find here, lest in what I say, I should seem to exceed the bounds of that modesty, which here I profess.</p>
               <p>But yet that I may say something for the sake of Truth, to which I am more obliged. because of necessity something must be said, I will speak, but in a few words; If any other Man had Published these Books concerning Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness amongst the common People, except your self, I should say to him openly, and to his face, that no Man could ever have brought in a greater plague into the Doctrine of the general Salvation of Christians, nor a filthier blot upon Religion, nor have done a greater injury to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Scriptures, and the Prophets, than is manifest in these Books. But in writing these things to you, I restrain my self for your sake, lest I pass the bounds of modesty, which I have set to my self: What then, should the cause of Truth therefore be deserted? You your self do not require that of me, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Wherefore that I may, as much as I can, observe that which is my duty in both respects, I have laid hold on this way of prosecuting this design, which you see, and which necessity hath laid upon me, whereby I might both less offend you, and likewise perhaps more benefit the cause I have undertaken to defend.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95561:14"/>
               <p>Therefore, seeing I judged it necessary to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your attempts in this matter, so I thought it most convenient, not that I should in this Book answer to all the small scraps of Reasons in the order that you observe (which indeed is none at all) in a tumultuary confusion in those Ten Books; but that I may by choice touch upon, and confute the chief of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How easie it is to err in the Doctrine of Iustification.</head>
               <p>SEeing these things and others like unto them, contain the principal Heads, of all Christian Doctrine; therefore Divines should take a special care lest they err in these; which care, unless they take, there will follow a most grievous ruin and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all things, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not the Doctrine of Free Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> being as it were put out of their places. And yet I know not how it comes to pass that error is no where more easily committed than in these Points. Neither is it so strange; for so it comes to pass, that this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal nature we call Human Reason, when consulted with about the things of God, is most blind, and sees nothing, unless it be Illuminated with the better Light of Divine Knowledge shining in upon it: For the right understanding of Divine things comes by the Spirit of God, and not by Human Capacity; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95561:14"/>
though the Law, and the things of the Law, were in some sense born with us, and cleave unto our Nature; Yet the Mysteries of the Doctrine of the Gospel are not apprehended so easily, because the Nature of both is very different. Moreover, you may see many, who following the guidance of Nature, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts more than is meet, do teach and dispute of things belonging to the Gospel; just as if a Philosopher should discourse of the Principles of Nature, or a Moralist of the perfection of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in which they place their chiefest good; or as if a <hi>Pharisee</hi> sitting in the Chair of <hi>Moses,</hi> should dispute about the Righteousness of the Law.</p>
               <p>But there will be another occasion of treating of these things, (if opportunity be granted.)</p>
               <p>In the mean while, that I may speak ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of thee, O <hi>Osorius;</hi> with how much the greater natural parts God in his bounty hath adorned thee, and heaped upon thee, it is the more grievous to me that thou art violently drawn aside with others into that blindness of error:- That though you teach us many things in your reasoning about Righteousness, yet you scarcely teach any thing that makes much to the purpose, and nothing at all that is profitable for Salvation, but rather on the contrary that which is very hurtful. For, I beseech you, What assurance can there be of Salvation, if you shut out Mercy, and send us to our own Righteousness as the only way, which conveys us to Heaven? for all your Doctrine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95561:15"/>
looks that way. To wit, when discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the hope of remedy, you affirm <hi>there is no other way, but that only, of becoming like unto God, and being united unto him; and that this is the only way of a Blessed Life, which consists wholly in Righteousness; which whoso do observe, those you affirm do abound with Divine Riches, and Eternal Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if there were no hope remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Osorius <hi>de justit. lib.</hi> 1. pag. 3.</note> for him, that turns a little aside from these footsteps. Than which what could be said or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented more repugnant to the Gospel? yea also elsewhere, repeating again the same thing, tho' in different Words: <hi>How should a Man be saved, say you? Is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <p>And again in another Book, as in all your Books reasoning about the Works of the Law; you assert, <hi>that Righteousness is purchased by these, that Men go up to Heaven by these as by steps, that eternal <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. p. 44.</note> rewards are appointed for these;</hi> and you plead that this is the only way we have to Heaven, which is paved with renowned Works, &amp;c. Moreover you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. pag. 148.</note> yet with more open Mouth. <hi>Wherefore, say you, it must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested with greater freedom of Speech, that the ascent into Heaven is given to the Merits of the greatest Vertues, and that the Mansions of the</hi>

               <p>It would take up a long time, and be much more troublesome to rake together out of every one of your Books, every one of those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful sayings, which are more than Paradoxes, whereby you plead that all the safeguard of our Salvation, should be placed in nothing else but in the observance and care of Righteousness: which if you could as well perform in effect and reality, as you set them forth in Words magnificently; I should esteem that none were more happy, none more worthy of Heaven than you. But now let us suppose that, which I see you would so fain have granted, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is only due to perfect Men no other ways, but upon the account of Righteousness, and that there is no other way of coming to those blessed mansions, but that which is trodden by the most pure footsteps of good men, and settled in the perfect integrity of Works. Now we are not against the deserved praises of righteousness, neither do we with-hold from it its rewards: Be it so indeed. But where shall we find this Righteousness? <hi>Dic quibus in terris, &amp; erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> Tell me in what Country (and I <note place="margin">All have fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and come short of the glory of God.</note> shall esteem you to be a great Oracle,) This man of righteous life dwells, who will so direct the course of his Life according to this Idea of Vertue proposed by you, that he fails no where, who Roots out all manner of wickedness, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frains himself from railing with his Tongue,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95561:16"/>
Suppresses the Haughtiness, Insolency, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of an Ambitious Spirit, and the rashness of a Headstrong Mind; who Crucifies the Flesh with its Lusts, who suppressing ungodly lustings, by frequent meditation upon Death, brings himself over from all Impurity and Impiety to the resemblance of Christ; who separating his mind from the Contagion of the Body, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it wholly to the Imitation of Christ, who resembles the humility and meekness of Christ, his bounty and benevolence; and his excellent Holiness in all respects, and also cuts off all defilements of the mind, and all the roots of filthiness and impurity. I say, where will that man be found, who performs these and all other duties of true Piety, and so performs them, that nothing in his Life seems superfiuous, nothing is unequal in his duties, nor defective in his manners? I think he may be found in the Books of <hi>Osorius:</hi> but not in the <note place="margin">The Idea of the <hi>Osorian</hi> righteousness, can be more easily found in his Books, than in his Mauners.</note> Life, in the daily Confessions, or in the Holy Absolutions of <hi>Osorius.</hi> There was of Old, I confess the Image of this most perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness seen and known upon the Earth: But that Phoenix hath long since left the Earth, and departed hence to Heaven, and now sits at the right hand of Majesty, drawing all to himself: and I wish that at length he may draw <hi>Osorius</hi>

If <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> in a very serious debate confirms the same, and stops the mouths of all men, that he may bring men over, having called them away from a vain trust in their own works, and convinced them of the vanity thereof, to the help of the Son of God only, which is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Oso. 1. 5. p. 21.</note> in the faith of him: If <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, yea and if that powerful proclaimer and defender of humane righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness could not himself deny but that in many things we offend all, I pray you, O <hi>Osorius!</hi> Will you now rise up after them, not the eighth but the ninth <hi>Proclaimer</hi> of Righteousness, being a mortal and sinful man, who dare affirm to others, that which you cannot perform your self after this manner: <hi>That it is either righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or nothing, which obtains us the favour of God, and makes us acceptable and like unto him?</hi>

Do you so place
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95561:17"/>
all righteousness in works, that you think there is no righteousness of Faith?</p>
               <p>Then you think perhaps that the <note place="margin">

Do you not perceive here <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> It is one thing to be justified by faith, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to be justified by the Law.</note> a manifest opposition between these two: To be justified by the Law, and to be justified by Faith, yea and those very things which <hi>Paul</hi> removed far away from him as Dung in respect of obtaining Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Will you pave that only way for us to Heaven? And in the mean while disputing about works, I discourse of these things with you, as if there were any such strength of so great vertues, in this life, as could deserve not only the reward of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but also the name thereof. What will you say, if the most holy performances <note place="margin">There are no performances of the most perfect men, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the sight of God.</note> and endeavours, undertaken in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever manner by the most perfect men, in this corrupted nature, are so unprofitable to the immortality of Life, that they are rejected by Christ as things without profit, yea
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95561:17"/>
that they are despised and utterly <note place="margin">We are all as unclean, and all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness as a menstruous cloth. <hi>Isa. 64.</hi>
                  </note> contemned in the sight of God, like a menstruous cloth, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah</hi> witnesseth, unless they be underproped with better Grace, and the commendation of Faith? What if in <hi>Isaiah</hi> we are all said, and that truly, to have gone astray like Sheep every one in his own way, from whom so great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth not separate himself: What do you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should be judged of our virtues and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?

But how frivolous this cavilling is, it appears evident by the context of this Prophetical Prediction.</p>
               <p>Whereby you see, (<hi>Osorius,</hi>) being convinced by Sacred Testimonies, that those merits of our greatest vertues, if they be looked upon in themselves, are far from the perfection of that righteousness, which your Philology Cloaths with very beautiful Colours; Which yet I would not have to be so said by me, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slood by you, as if those that live vertuosly, did nothing aright and praise worthy in this life: Or as if the Godly Works of the Saints were not acceptable to God, which

God himself hath commanded to <note place="margin">The Papists do not clearly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain why Works are called good.</note> be done; for thus you reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Works, that they come not indeed without Faith, and the Grace of God, but yet so, that when they come, you affirm, that the Kingdom of Eternal Salvation is due to them by the best right, not only as a recompense and reward, but also as a lawful Patrimony: as if the promise of Salvation depended not on Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Faith, but on the Righteousness of the Law, and not on Christs merits only, unless a Covenant of Works be joined together with it: or as if faith it self profited nothing for the obtaining of Life upon any other <note place="margin">What good works do es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> account, but that it may procure Grace, which may stir us up to the praise-worthy performances of works, by which works we attain unto eternal Life.</p>

               <p>But what if having observed all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God exactly, so much as one tittle of the Law is neglected by thee?

               <p>But now how will you teach that? by what Scriptures, by what Masters shall this appear evident to us which you assert? by <hi>Paul,</hi> I trow.

Moreover that should not be denied, which you do well assume accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mind of <hi>Paul,</hi> that we obtain this Grace from God by Faith. Likewise that is not ill said, which you add concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was never the Man that disapproved Pious endeavours of Exercising Charity; seeing he every where extols those very things with wonderful praises For who knows not, that the excellent Sermons of <hi>Paul</hi> are exceeding full of very serious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <note place="margin">

                  </gap>for necessary uses.</p>
               <p>Suppose this to be most true, as it is indeed; yet that was never the meaning of the Apostle,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95561:20"/>
to place our Salvation principally in the Law, as if he thought that the Kindom of God, and the Righteousness thereof should be measured by our worthy Deeds and Charity; or proposed Heaven to us as fit to be paid for, or sold for the commodities of our Works, as by a kind of Auction. Yea, when I read <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles of a far different sense, this seems to me to be the only scope and mind of the Apostle, that he transfers all this <note place="margin">Not Charity, but Faith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4.</note> Righteousness, which you attribute to the Law, unto Faith, and so transfers it, that he shuts out all mixture of Works; and leaves only Faith in the Son of God, which lays open for us a way into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>For I beseech you, he that affirms, that we are justified by Faith, without Works, and who again says, but now without the Law the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God is made manifest, being testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law and the Prophets? with what Words could he more evidently shut out the endeavours and merits of all our Vertues from the Divine gift of Iustification?</p>
               <p>These things being thus agreed upon, and concluded by the weighty authority of <hi>Paul,</hi> of necessity from thence follows, That there is a twofold manner, or <note place="margin">A twofold manner of Righteousness of the Law: and of the Gospel, or Faith.</note> way of being righteous to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, as I said, according to the different conditions of both Covenants; of which the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Law, the other is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95561:20"/>
peculiar to Christ. Then both the Law and Christ <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>have their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; for as the Law, which is wholly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in works of righteousness, endures no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, and renders the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness plentifully to those, who persevering in that which is good, have filled up all the parts of perfect Innocency. Likewise Christ also hath his own righteousness, both much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and also not a little differing from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though not so much differing in respect of the matter, yet exceeding much in the manner of dispensing; for the Law communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates only to them that Work, but Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to them that believe, perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and often also to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and underserving, by a <note place="margin">The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith.</note> singular grace of dispensation. Therefore this Righteousness, is properly called the Righteousness of Faith; Which is necessarily to be distinguished by us from the other, which is called the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law: Which they who do not, verily they do a great injury to the Scriptures, and quench all light of Doctrine, confounding both their own Consciences, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of their hearers, with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <note place="margin">The necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry distinction of Legal and Evangelical Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> kind of disturbance, so that scarcely any Man can certainly know what should be hoped or feared; for they who dispute thus concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteousness of the Law, and draw all things to that alone, as if there remained no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to hope for Salvation, but that which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95561:21"/>
the strict and severe observation of the Law brings: I beseech you, what else do those Men do, but leave the Souls of Men in a doubtful wavering? And by what way those Men encourage us to hope, by the same they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to fear and utterly to despair of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: seeing there is no Man in the World, to whom the daily offences of his Life gives not much more cause to fear, than his vertues give him to hope.</p>
               <p>And what remedy then shall remain for the perplexed consciences of Men, if the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ being hid from their Eyes, you leave nothing for hope or consolation, but the righteousness of the Law? Or with what comfort will you raise up the Spirit of a fallen and afflicted Sinner, when the Law useth to shew what every Man should do aright, but can pardon no Man what is done amiss? must you not here of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <note place="margin">The Office of the Law.</note> be compelled to leave the Righteousness of the Law, and presently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Righteousness of Christ? And, I think, you will not at all deny that, but, say you, seeing this righteousness of Christ is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that which is the righteousness of the Law, yea and the very perfection of the Law, therefore it is not necessary that we should make a twofold Righteousness, but one only both of Christ and of the <note place="margin">How the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law and Christ is one, and not one.</note> Law. But 'tis not a difficult thing, to answer to this objection. Indeed it must be confessed, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the things by themselves,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95561:21"/>
and compare the one with the other by a mutual relation, there seems not to be any difference between the Righteousness of Christ, and of the Law. Because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Law so Holy and perfect; but it appears as evident in the Life of Christ: But if you consider the efficacy and manner of working; which the Righteousness of Christ and of the Law exercises in others; if you consider the effect and end of both, there is a great difference: For though Christ is no otherwise just in himself, than the Law it self is Holy and Iust: But yet this which is called the Righteousness of Christ, acts in us much otherwise, than that which is called the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law, so that nothing seems more unlike or more contrary.</p>

               <head>The difference between the Righteousness of the Law and the Gospel.</head>
               <p>FIRST, as touching the Law, what the Nature, Vertue, and <note place="margin">The strength and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law.</note> Efficacy thereof is, it is unknown to no Man: To wit, that it is of it self a Holy and Perfect Rule, and Mistress to teach how to lead the Life; made for this purpose by the most Holy God, that Creatures might certainly know, what they should fly, and what they should follow, as it contains in it self the very Rule of all perfection in all respects compleat; so it requires perfect obedience in all respects and upon all accounts:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95561:22"/>
upon this condition, that he that doth these things, shall live in them. But on the contrary, he that doth otherwise, and abides not in all, the Law pronounces a Curse against him, and inflicts the vengeance of Death, and heaps up anger and indignation upon him. For by the Law the Wrath of God is declared from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being justly kindled against all Men that are wicked and unjust upon any account.</p>
               <p>Whereby it comes to pass, that the Law indeed, being it self Holy and Good, was not given for this, that it should bring Destruction, but Salvation; but yet the same being hindred by the infirmity of our flesh, it cannot but kill us, but cannot at all save us by its own means; not for any default, or tyranny of its own; but by taking just occasion from the refractory rebellion of our flesh, which as it naturally hath an enmity against God, so it cannot avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to his Sacred Will, and Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions. And hence break forth so many, and so great calamities, that fall upon this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nature of ours; hence so many proofs of the Divine Indignation and Anger; hence also that dreadful and unavoidable necessity of dying, which when it passes promiscuously through all ages and kindreds, which none of the most Holy Men could ever drive away from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, verily that one thing proves us all to be guilty of unrighteousness, and that there is not any perfection of righteousness in our most righteous works; for <note place="margin">The Law as out of Christ is confidered what it doth.</note> if the Wages of Sin be Death, it cannot be that there should be any
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95561:22"/>
extinction of Life there, where no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is seen. Therefore, O <hi>Osorius!</hi> if the Law cannot defend thee in this Life with all thy works from Death, will the same save thee after Death, and restore thee to Life, when thou art Dead?</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95561:23"/>
Churches. There is therefore no Controversie remaining between us and our Adversaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author of Salvation. Nevertheless there remains here another ambiguity or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, perhaps not yet cleared enough by all Divines. For whereas there is no man but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that Righteousness is in Christ in its highest perfection: And we have already heard from the Law, that there is no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Righteousness with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness; <note place="margin">A question by what righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness can Christ deliver the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> here some difficulty comes in, how it comes to pass, that the Lord Christ, all whose Iudgments are most just, can or ought against Righteousness favour those, who having forsaken their duty, have turned aside to Unrighteousness? For if the Law of God according to the nature of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, cannot avoid condemning of those that are guilty of wickedness, some perhaps may ask, What way Christ, who doth not any thing, but what is most righteous, can procure Salvation to those without the violation of his Righteousness, whom the Law of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness justly condemns? Or if he do it, how, for what cause, and in what manner he does it, by Faith, or by Works? If by Faith, whether by Faith only, or by the <note place="margin">What way, and in what manner the benefits of Christ are derived to us.</note> help of Works joyned with it; if upon the account of Works, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before Works, or after Works, or in the very Works? But if by Faith only without Works, hence ariseth a threefold question; 1. What then do good
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95561:23"/>
Works avail? 2. What Faith that is, and of what sort it is, which is said to justifie? 3. Whom this Faith justifies? for they must be either sinners or righteous; if <note place="margin">A threefold question.</note> sinners, they are either penitent or stubborn; if you say both, you will speak against Righteousness, which cannot be well called Righteousness, unless it reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every mans deeds and merits. But if they are righteous and not sinners, whom Christ helps: What need have the Righteous of a Redeemer? What need have the whole of a Physician? Moreover, how will that saying of <hi>Paul</hi> hold true; whereby Christ being made Man, is said to have come into the World, not to save the Righteous <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 1.</note> but Sinners.</p>
               <p>I beseech you now, O ingenuous Man! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Modesty, that I may deal very modestly with you: If any Man treat with you on this manner, in disputing about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Iustification, what would you answer him, if he should ask these things of you? If any such Man should come to you, who being affrighted in his mind, and astonished at the greatness of his sins, and burdened with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conscience, and almost dead with the fear of the Iudgment of God, should ask the help of counsel and comfort from you? of which sort there are found not a few Examples in the Folds of the Lord's Flock; what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy would you reach forth unto him? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will send him to those Books of yours concerning Righteousness; and what will he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95561:24"/>
find there, whereby his afflicted and cast down Mind may be refreshed and recover it self? what? will you send him to the Law? but what will he draw from thence fit for healing his wounds? especially seeing that Law of Righteousness can only bring us in guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have not kept the Law, and oblige us thereunto, as by bond; at least it cannot by any means restore Righteousness that was once lost, or satisfie the Iudge. It remains then, that you should bring over the miserable Soul of a Sinner from the Law, in which there appears no hope of defence, unto Christ, seeing it is He only by whose Wounds and Stripes we are healed; and <note place="margin">In a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can help.</note> who hath taken upon himself all the <hi>Impieties</hi> of us all, that he might communicate unto us his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. That is very true indeed, and upon that account I think you and yours are to be commended, who, though you seem not to have a clear enough sight of the genuine Office of Christ, and his Divine Greatness in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our Salvation; yet ye refuse not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his Name, and a certain external reverence of Faith. But because at present you have to do with men that are troubled, and to whom it is not sufficient to retain only the Name of a Saviour, unless we have also a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Efficacy of his Death which he suffered for us, and <note place="margin">It is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Christ only, unless also we learn the Greatness of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and his Power to save.</note> of the Power that he hath to save,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95561:24"/>
and the great benefits he hath bestowed upon us, and his exceeding great Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards us, and the infinite Riches that are promised to us in him.</p>
               <p>Therefore you must proceed further, and help the afflicted Minds of the Godly, as much as may be, that they may know and believe not only that there is eternal and durable Life in Christ, but also that they may be taught the way, and means, and manner how that Life comes to us, and to whom it belongs, and what we must observe in attaining unto it.</p>

               <head>What the power and efficacy of Faith is; whom it justifies, and how.</head>
               <p>IN which matter there is great variety of Sentiments and Opinions amongst Divines. For, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> proclaims with a very audible Voice, That Man is justified by Faith without the Works of the Law: <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> Those Men by the additions of their <hi>Comments,</hi> do not explain the most evident meaning of the Apostle, but render it obscure; they do not expound, but cavil: So that some take the word Faith, not as <hi>Paul,</hi> for that Faith only which is in Christ Iesus, but which is formed by Charity and Works. Others interpret that, which <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The various Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith.</note> saith of Faith without Works, to be understood concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Works. Some interpret it of the Works of the Law in this sense,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95561:25"/>
that those works are undertaken not by Faith, but by the command of the Law without Grace. Others expound it otherwise; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out antecedent works only: Some think it should be understood of the first Iustification only, which they attribute to Faith alone, as in little Children that <note place="margin">Roffen. contra lut. Articul. 31.</note> are Baptized, but the second in men come to years, they attribute to Faith indeed, but not without Works.</p>
               <p>The scope of all which dispute is, that Faith being adorned with Works, may do something; and on the contrary, that, if Works are not joyned with it, it may seem a kind of rude matter, void of life and form, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to purchase Righteousnes, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dead and destructive thing. Which if it be true, I would know this of them, and chiefly I would ask of you, <hi>Osorius,</hi> in what Common-wealth, in what Church, in whose Kingdom, do you coyn this new piece of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? If it is the Church of Christ, that is not yours, It is his Kingdom, in which you are only a servant. What? Shall not Christ have a free power permitted to him of administring his own affairs, as in his own lawful Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
               <p>And whence is this your great boldness in anothers Dominion, in a Church that ye never founded, to alter and change as you list, the appointments and institutions of your Prince, contrary to Law and Right? Or by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you oppose your selves, but that every man may act in his own possession accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95561:25"/>
to his own right, and freedom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? What if it seems good in the Eyes of Christ to communicate freely the glory of his Kingdom, to whom he will? Will ye forbid him? What if the most Gracious Lord will pay a full reward to those that come to work at the last hour of the day, and make all equal by making the like agreement with them all, should your Eye therefore be evil because he is good?</p>
               <p>But now the Lord himself, the Prince and Author of the Church professes in very evident words, that eternal life shall be given to them that believe in his name. What can be said more evident in signification, or more clear to be understood? He that believeth in me, saith he, hath eternal life. And again repeating the same, in the same words. He that believeth in the Son hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. Ioh. 3. Ioh. 11.</note> life. And <hi>chap.</hi> 11. He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet he shall live. And lest he should seem to testifie this of himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of his Father, he <note place="margin">Only Faith in Christ is proved to jastisie by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</note> adds, This is, saith he, the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the Son and believeth in him should have life eternal. Who doth no less most evidently confirm these things by performances, which he expresses in word, adding also miracles thereunto. For how great a multitude do ye meet with every where through all the Evangelists, whom you see saved and healed by no other thing but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95561:26"/>
faith only, which relied on Christ. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we hear from the mouth of the Lord in the Gospel: thy Faith hath made thee whole, without hearing any <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. Proof by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> mention of works? And what Christ performed to faith, will <hi>Osorius</hi> attribute that to Works: Christ invites unto himself Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences that are afflicted and burdened with sin: <hi>Isaiab</hi> calls all that are athirst to come without price or any exchange to the Fountains of Christ, that they may be refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Osorius</hi> will bestow the Kingdom, which God hath promised, upon none but righteous men, and eminent good works. I beseech you, Sir, according to your righteousness, what excellent good work brought that sinful Woman with her in the Gospel, out of whom seven Devils were cast? What righteousness appeared in the Thief on the Right Hand of Christ except faith only, why he should after the commiting so many evil deeds enter in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ on the same day into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise? what other thing did the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was a stranger, bring to Christ, but an importunate cry of faith, so that she carried home, not Crumbs, but whole Loaves of Divine Grace? What deserved the miserable Woman with the bloody Issue, or <hi>Iairus</hi> the Governour of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.</note> or <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> or other Publicans with them? why they being perferred before the Pharisees, who seemed so much more righteous, should
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95561:26"/>
obtain the benefit of free favour, being so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and exposed unto them? There is almost an infinite number of others of the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may be discoursed of after the same manner, in whom you can find nothing worthy of so great bounty of Divine Grace, but faith only: Blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> cried, the Lepers cried, Iesus, Master, thou Son of <hi>David</hi> have mercy on us, and they were heard. For nothing cries louder than faith, nothing is more effectual to prevail. Let <hi>Osorius</hi> also cry, and let us all cry with the like noise of Faith, and we shall be heard alike. I speak of that faith, which is in Christ Iesus, besides which, there is not any passage into Heaven, nor access unto God, nor way of prevailing with God. Therefore that we may be heard, let us come, and knock, but let us do it aright, to wit, by Faith and in the name of only begotten. Otherways it is in vain to cry to God, who hears not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but drives them away, who regards not servants and guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <note place="margin">How Prayers are heard.</note> unless they come to the Son, or in the name of the Son. Now by what way we are heard, by the same we are Iustified: <note n="*" place="margin">From whence is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to be sought.</note> For the Divine reward is always joyned with righteousness.</p>
               <p>Seeing then all of us, mortal men, are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sinners, and servants of sin, therefore we must see what that is, which makes us of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants free men, of guilty persons sons, of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners righteous. For this is the whole subject matter of the debate, this is the question, on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95561:27"/>
which the whole controversie depends, which is not so difficult to be <hi>judged</hi> of, if the authority of Sacred Scripture may prevail upon impartial judgments. For the testimony of the Gospel remains sure and eternal, which no mortal man can weaken at any time, instructing our faith thus. As many as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.</note> him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, and that he may teach what it is to receive him, he presently explains the same, to them, saith he, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his name, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appears evidently what it is, to which we are beholden for all that splendor and dignity, wealth and riches, yea and the possession of Heaven and Life. I know that in those excellent offices of good works, which you so much cry up, in the exercise of charity, and observance of Righteousness, there is great weight and also great <note place="margin">Wherein consists the use and scope of the Law.</note> benefit; as I consess also that the law it self hath great efficacy, if a man use it lawfully. Now the use of the law consists in this, that it should bring us to Christ, and be subservient to his glory. But when you have heaped all these things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one, whatsoever were by God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prescribed to us in his Law, or written within us, they are far from restoring perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a mans deeds that are altogether imperfect, or to a mans person that is wholly destroyed and ruinated. They are far from making us of servants freemen, of Slaves of Satan, Sons of God, heirs of his Kingdom, co-heirs of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95561:27"/>
Christ, fellow Citizens of the Saints, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks of the highest Father. Verily that is not the Office of the Law, but of Christ: And it is not righteousness, but grace that does this. This is not the efficacy of works, but of Faith: which relying not upon <note place="margin">Charity is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Faith, not Faith by Charity.</note> works, but being strengthned only by the promise of God brings us from bondage to liberty, from death to life, adopts us being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God, makes us Sons of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which is so far from being joyned with Charity and Works, that it reconciles Charity it self, and all works of life unto God, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies them, without which they could not have place in Heaven, in the presence of the great God.</p>

               <head>An Answer to the Accusations of Osorius, in defence of <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUT now passing by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, let us consider the <note place="margin">The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of <hi>Osorius</hi>
                  </note> matter it self, and the strength and finews of your Discourse. For this is your Opinion; that, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of righteousness the godly fruits of good works should by no means be removed from a Communion with faith, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cannot be lively and saving, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charity. And because <hi>Luther</hi> does this, you conclude after this manner, <hi>that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all works of good men; that he is an enemy and destroyer of all honest Discipline, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of prophane impurity and licentiousness, a plague of his Countrey, a troubler and disturber of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yea, and a Monster, and what not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I beseech you, Sir, bethink your self, and have a care what you belch forth against any man with an unbridled rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; the Law commands you to <note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> shun leasing. And do you, who are so great an extoller of righteousness, against
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95561:31"/>
all righteousness tear honest and innocent men in pieces with false accusations? for if a Man doth not attribute unto works the chiefect effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and preemince in the point of Iustification, is that sufficient cause to suppose that therefore he utterly condemns good works? Verily it is unreasonable so to do, as if a man disputing concerning <hi>Osorius,</hi> should thus conclude, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath no power of governing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luther</hi> sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates charity from faith, and the Law from the Gospel, not simply, but in such a manner as things should be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished each by their own bounds. Where and how Faith works by love</note> in the Kings Chamber, therefore he hath nothing he can do at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his own family: Or because he is not at all excellent in military vertue to gain a victory, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath no faculty or dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in managing the affairs of his own business. <hi>Luther</hi> separates charity from faith, and the Law from the Gospel, and does it not without cause. But it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered where, in what place, and for what cause he does it: Not to cause the godly works of good men to be despised, nor to discourage the exercise thereof, but that the power of justifying should not be attributed to <hi>the performance of them.</hi> Not that faith should not work by love before Men, but that it should not work before God. For it is one thing to work before Men, and another thing to work before God. Therefore one and the same faith acteth both ways, but one way before God, and another way before men; for before men it works by love, that it may perform obedience to the will of God, and be serviceable for the benefit of our Neighbour;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95561:31"/>
but before God it works not by any love, but by Christ only, that it <note place="margin">What is the union of Faith with Charity, and again what is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of both.</note> may obtain the pardon of sins, and eternal life.</p>
               <p>By which you see, what is the difference between faith and vertue, and wherein they both agree; and how different the working of both is; How faith is alone without works, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain how the same is not alone; for in the mean while Godly works are not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, because they are not admitted to the justification of life, but the trusting in works is only overturned: Here then a wise and suitable division should be used, <note place="margin">Trust in works is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> that things may be distinguished each by their own places and bounds lest one thing should rashly rush into the possession of another, and disturb the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its station. Therefore let the praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy merits of the greatest vertues have their own honour and dignity, which no man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from them: Nevertheless by their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they will never be so available in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Heavenly Iudge, as to redeem us from our sins, to satisfie Iustice, to deliver us from the wrath of God, and everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to restore us that are so many ways ruinated, unto grace and life, to <note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be opposed to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God but Christ only.</note> unite us as Sons and Heirs to God, and to overcome Death, and the World. These things cost a far dearer price, than that we should ever be able to pay so many and so great debts by any works or merits,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95561:32"/>
or means of our own. For so great is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Iustice, that there can be no reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, unless Iustice be satisfied by suffering the whole punishment that was due. The wrath is so very great, that there is no hope of appeasing the Father, but by the price and death of the Son. And again, so great is the mercy, that the Father grudged not to send his own Son, and bestow him on the World, and so to bestow him, that he gives Life Eternal to them that believe in him: Moreover, so great is the loving kindness of the Son towards us, that he grudged not for our sakes to bring upon himself this infinite load of wrath which otherways our frailty, however assisted with all the help of moral vertues, had never been able to sustain.</p>

Therefore that is false, and worthy to be rejected with disdain,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95561:32"/>
which some unhappy and wicked School-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines affirm in discoursing of Charity, to wit, that it is the form of Faith, and that it must not by any means be separated from faith, no more than the vital Soul can be separated from the body, or the essential form from matter, which otherwise is a rude and unweildy Mass. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of whom, I think there is no need of many words, seeing the whole meaning and drift of Scripture, if rightly understood, the very end of the Law; seeing Christ, and the instruction of the Apostles, and the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gospel seem to be manifestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and wholly to overturn that most absur'd Opinion by so many Oracles, so many Signs, Examples, and Arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Now if that be form, which gives sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence to a thing, how much more truly must it be said, that faith is the form of charity, without which all the works of charity are base and contemptible; as again the form of faith is not charity, but Christ only, and the promise of the word.</p>
               <p>But what, say they, are not the pious works of Charity acceptable <note place="margin">Objection.</note> to God, being so many ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto us, and commanded by him? Are not these also remunerated with plentiful fruits of Righteousness, and heaped up with manifold Rewards in the Gospel? I was hungry, says he, and ye fed me, I thirsted and ye refreshed me with drink; so that not so much as a cup of cold water shall want a reward, when it is given in the name of Christ, besides an infinite number
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95561:33"/>
of other things of that kind, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Scriptures are enlarged upon to the praise of Charity.</p>
               <p>Indeed no man denys that pious and holy works of Charity are <note place="margin">Answer.</note> greatly approved of God, and it is an undoubted truth, that the love of God and of our Neighbour, as it comprehends the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of both Tables, and is the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the whole Law, so it hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promises annexed unto it. Neither is there any Controversie between us about that. But when we affirm that Charity pleases God, we ask this, how it pleases, whether simply of it self in respect of the very work, or upon the account of faith, and the Mediatour? and then whether the same Charity so pleases, that it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us before God, and obtains the pardon of sins, and overcomes the terrours of death and sin, that it may be opposed to the judgment and anger of God? Moreover, whether it hath the promises of Eternal Life annexed unto it? If without a Mediatour and the faith of him, there is nothing which can please God, and it is impossible that works should please him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the person of him that worketh be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; it follows that Charity depends on Faith, and not Faith on Charity: But that it rather goes before Love, and is so far from being joyned with it for justification, that it also ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies Charity, and makes all the works of Charity acceptable to God. <note place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> The matters appear more evident by Example. Suppose a <hi>Iew</hi> or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95561:33"/>
Turk does daily bestow great gifts upon the poor with very great cost, and damage to his estate: and again, that a Christian gives only a cup of cold Water to a thirsty man in the name of Christ: in the things themselves, if merits only be valued; there seems a very great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion. But there is much greater inequality in the distributing the reward. Though a Turk bestows many thousands of Talents upon the poor, he gains not any thing at all thereby with God. A Christian by one Cup, not of Wine, but of cold Water loses not his reward, yea he finds Life. What is the cause? What should you think, O <hi>Osorius,</hi> but because those things are not valued by merits, but by faith: not by the condition of the work, but of the worker; not by the price of the thing, but by the dignity of the person.</p>

               <head>In Iustification not so much the Condition of the Deeds as of the Persons is regarded.</head>
               <p>SEE, I beseech you, of how great concernment it is, that a person <note place="margin">One conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sons, another of Servants.</note> should first be reconciled to God, which unless he be received into his favour, it is not possible that his works should please him at any time. As in the civil and politick nature, it is of no small concernment, whether a Son or a Servant acteth upon the account of reward: in like manner in the Heavenly generation there is a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95561:34"/>
great difference between Sons and Servants. The Heirs of God and Mercenaries. For one thing is regarded in Servants, and another thing in Sons, and their condition appears to be far different. It belongs to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be compelled by fear, but <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Sons and Servants.</note> they that are Sons are drawn by love, and they do so much the more in the performance of their duties, how much the more gladly they endeavour to please their Father.

Who when they have done all, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main nothing but Servants and unprofitable, they never do any thing worthy of an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. On the contrary, they who are Heirs and Sons, though they shew themselves no less obedient, and observe the will of their Father, yet they do not therefore obey, that they may be made Heirs by Works, but because they are Heirs, Therefore they work.</p>
               <p>Again, they that are in a servile condition, do not come, but when called by their Master, and perform his commands by the impulse of the Law. But the case is contrariways in Sons, who have always access with boldness into the presence of their Father, and cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, performing much more of their own accord, than by the incitement of anothers prescription. Servants, after they have done their task, have their wages paid them according to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but they receive no reward of Inheritance. But they that are Sons and Heirs; an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

Moreover in those that are Sons, it is only the dignity of the person, and not the merits of good life; it is the birth, and not the works that are regarded: But the case is contrariways in Servants; for it is not regarded what the person is, but what the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life. In short, the Servant (as Christ wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth) abides not in the house for ever. But the Son, to whom the House is delivered wholly and for ever, is never driven out of the House.</p>

servants into sons, is not so much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in us, or in the change of our qualities, but chiefly in the love of God to us. For he hath so high an esteem, and puts so great a value on Christ his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that with a fatherly love and affection he embraceth all those of mankind throughout the world, that believe in this Son of his; and looking upon them now as Sons adopts them for his Sons out of their servile estate, yea and makes them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs <note place="margin">The cause why God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts us for Sons. <hi>Gal. 4.</hi>

               <head>The Absurdities that arise from the <hi>Osorian</hi> Righteousness.</head>
               <p>WHich things, seeing they are guarded with most sure confirmations of Evangelical Scripture, hence it necessarily follows, that all this Discourse of yours about righteousness falls down from the foundation. For if there is no union with God the eternal father <hi>but to those, who by on exact observation of the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and direct all their actions to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Osorius.</hi> The servile and mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine of the Papists.</note> will of God, which is the law of equity and rule of Iustice:</hi> you make us not now to be Sons, nor Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promise, but merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries according to the condition of the law: Moreover by this means also it will come to pals. that the promise is sure to no man in his life time, which is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite not only to the mind of <hi>Paul,</hi> but also to the genuine condition of Sons. For who in the time of this life lives so exactly according to the commands of God, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath never passed the limits thereof, or knows what he will do in the remainder of his life? Whereby it will come to pass that the mind must needs waver hither and thither, with a perpetual uncertainty. Moreover if that be accounted sure by the word and promise of the Gospel, that they are heirs as many as are ingrafted into Christ, then the Kingdom of God must of necessity be an inheritance,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95561:36"/>
If an inheritance, then it is not a recompence nor a reward, but a <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Sons, therefore not to Servants. <hi>August. lib. de haeres.</hi>
                  </note> Patrimony, which is not due to deeds, but to the spiritual birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. If to the birth-right, then the bestowing of the Inheritance goes before all deeds. Afterwards <hi>Pious</hi> deeds follow, according to the saying of <hi>Augustine,</hi> which is no less true than firm: Good works follow him, that is justified, but go not before him, that is to be justified. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if that most pure and eternal Nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us for Sons, as it was proved above, in which there sticks not any stain of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon the like account it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <note place="margin">The cause which makes us the Sons of God, the same also makes us Iust; but faith only makes us Sons, therefore the same also makes us Iust. The cause which justifies on God's part is his Predestination. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.</note> that the cause which joyns us to God as Sons, the same also makes us just in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>But that we may rightly examine, what that cause is, first the degrees of causes must be distinguished, of which some are related un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and others to men. On Gods part in the first place comes his infinite Mercy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, Election, the Grace of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Vocation, of which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in more places than one: Who hath Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us, saith he, unto the adoption of Sons by Iesus Christ, whom he hath Predestinated, that they should be conformed to the Image of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95561:36"/>
his Son, them he hath also called, whom he hath called, them he hath also justified, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the next order follows the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Vocation, the Donation of Christ, his Obedience, Death and Merits,</note> Donation of his Dear Son, his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Death, Sufferings, Merits, Redemption, Resurrection, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sin: As for those things which proceed from God, there is no great controversie between us. But our Opinions differ concerning those things, which are called causes on Man's part; to wit, whether there is one cause only or more? Whether Faith only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">What the cause of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is on Man's part. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de just. Osorius.</hi>

And this is the thing about which now we contend, O <hi>Osorius,</hi> for in these Books you do dispure about the righteousness of works at such a rate, that you suppose Faith, only without these additions, so Insufficient to perform any thing towards the purchasing Salvation, that it is your Opinion, <hi>That this Faith of Christ only, if it be separated from the help of Works, deserves not to be called the Faith of Chrit, but a head-strong rashness, an insolent confidence, an impudent boldness, an outragious madness, an execrable Wickedness:</hi> Which sort of Words, how little modesty they savour of, it is needless here to inquire. But how far they differ from truth, and the inviolable authority of Sacred Scriptures, it will be requisite to take notice; because at present this is the matter of debate between us.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95561:37"/>
               <p>And first, if you understand it concerning this common Fellowship of Men with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and Offices of mutual obedience between Man and Man, there is no man so unreasonable as to separate Faith from the operation of Charity in that sense.

Herein <hi>Paul</hi> in Disputing against you, doth so far take away all righteousness from works, and leaves Faith alone, that he judges him that mingleth any thing besides for the obtaining Salvation, to be a destroyer of Faith, an Enemy of Grace, and consequently an Enemy of <note place="margin">

And also elsewhere: If righteousness comes by the Law, then Christ dyed in vain. Thus you hear <hi>Paul</hi> manifestly asserting, what it is, that makes us heirs of the Inheritance and Salvation, not the Law, but Faith: And that these two are so contrary in the Office of Iustifying, that if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95561:37"/>
the Law be admitted, Faith is wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Death of Christ is made void, the grace of the promise fails.</p>
               <p>Now let us compare <hi>Osorius</hi> disputing of righteousness with <hi>Paul,</hi> He affirms, that Man is justified by Faith without Works. Your opinion on the contrary pleads that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth so much consist of Works without Faith, that Faith doth nothing else but prepare for Holy Works. He asserting a twofold righteousness of Works and of Faith, of Grace, and of Merit, so distinguishes between both, that he sets the one against the other, by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual opposition; as if they were things, that could by no means consist together, but the one destroys the other: And he makes that evident by the example of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> of whom those grasping at righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by Works, fell from true righteousness: These, because they sought after righteousness by Faith, <hi>solely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> obtained it.</p>
               <p>You on the contrary being neither deterred by their fearsul example, nor regarding the Apostolical Instruction; and making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between these so different kinds of righteousness, you seem to comprehend all in that one righteousness of the Law, as if the righteousness of Faith were none at all. The Words of <hi>Paul</hi> are very manisest: To him that worketh, the reward <note place="margin">Roman. 4.</note> is reckoned to be, not of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is imputed unto him for righteousness.

               <head>The Arguments of Osorius, whereby he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes Righteousness to Works, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</head>
               <p>NOW it must be enquired, by what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <hi>Osorius</hi> pleads for his opinion.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95561:38"/>
                  <hi>And first he brings that out of the Psalms:</hi> The Lord, saith he, is Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <note place="margin">Osor. lib. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> and loveth Righteousness, his countenance beholds the upright: And again, The Wicked, saith <hi>David,</hi> shall not dwell with thee; the Unrighteous shall not remain before thy eyes: and thou hatest all those that work Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; thou shalt destroy all them that speak leasing, &amp;c. <hi>And now what is gathered from these testimonies? To wit,</hi> That the Wicked have no society with the goodness of God. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is himself the very Law of Equity and Rule of Righteousness, according to which all our actions should be directed, therefore it is his opinion that it is not possible, that he who puts away the rule it self from him and hates it, should be joined to the same. <hi>But what do you drive at in all these florid expressions? it is this;</hi> He then that asserts it to be possible that God should approve the wicked, and join them to himself, asserts it to be possible for God not to be God.</p>
               <p>These things need no prolix an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: <note place="margin">Answer.</note> For though we grant this to be very true, which you mention from the Scriptures, that the rule of Divine Iustice is perfect, and that eternal light cannot endure any thing that is wicked, or not agreeable to equity: but you have not yet proved that those should be called wicked; who flying to Christ by Faith, receive from him the Pardon of their Sins, who having their Sins blotted out, and all Iniquity forgiven, are written by the same Psalmist among the number of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95561:39"/>
whom God himself purifying <note place="margin">Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi>

               <p>And such we were all formerly, as your Oration describes, wicked sinners, and all void of the glory of God, before Christ washed us with his blood: but <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> now after we are washed from our former filthiness, sanctified and justified in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, and by the spirit of our God, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Elect? Those whom God Iustifies, who shall condemn? <hi>Then you go on, and deny that it is possible, that God should be unlike himself, to favour wickedness, or make friendship with wicked men of an unclean life. And therefore you conclude we must needs be first righteous, before we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the favour of God.</hi> Right, but who are they, whom you call by the name of Iust? You must teach us that.</p>
               <p>If you judge they are such, as are defiled with no pollution, or can <note place="margin">Whence this righteousness of <hi>Osorius</hi> shall be found.</note> say with Christ: Who amongst you will prove me guilty of Sin? Verily, I confess it seems not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to truth; what you prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conformity of the Righteous unto. God, and that we must needs be all of us such, if we would with acceptance have to do with that most pure Nature of the Divine Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95561:39"/>
without a Mediator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>But if you take those for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <note place="margin">Who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led righteous in a Gospel sense.</note> who are Righteous by Faith not by Life, that is, those whom daily forgiveness received by faith, brings as righteous in the Presence of God, in that sense this debate of yours about Righteousness does us no diskindness: For by this means it comes to pass, that whom Faith dayly absolves, you your self cannot hold them guilty of any crime: Therefore if they are not unrighteous, nothing hinders them from being admitted with bold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <note place="margin">Osor. de just lib. pag. 39, &amp; 40.</note> into the presence of the Divine Majesty, through the benefit of their Redeemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you deny that it is agreeable to the nature of God, to account any man worthy of his approbation, except him, whom his countenance beholds to be righteous: Therefore it is necessary</hi>

You seem to acknowledge no righteousness but that which the perfection of life procures. We place all our righteousness in Christ, not in our selves, in the faith of him only, not in our own works. <hi>What? say you, can any man obtain favour from that highest goodness as long as he hates not wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, as long as be puts not away Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from him, which hath a perpetual</hi>

                  <hi>into the friendship of God, must first hate wickedness.</hi> Verily there is no man that denies it. For though we should grant that a wise and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som <note place="margin">Repentance. Repentance proves a man to be a sinner, but takes not away sin, it causeth not remission, nor satisfies ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> (or) sound sorrow, whereof you speak, makes the first part of our conversion, and that the true righteousness of faith, doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, except some trouble of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent mind go before, it doth not therefore come to pass, that the very cause of justification should be attributed unto repentance; for if repentance be nothing else, but a grief of mind at the remembrance of sin, it proves indeed that sin went before, but takes not away that which was committed. It declares perhaps some change of mind in him that committed it, but takes not away the punishment, that is due to justice. Moreover repentance testifies that justice is lost, but repairs not the loss thereof: As pain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a wound inflicted makes not a medicine to it self, but receives it from some other thing. In like manner, repentance goes before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, but doth not cause it, just as <hi>Seryphius</hi> did not cause the recovering of the City of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> who unless he had first lost it, <hi>Fabius</hi> had not recovered it. How many may you see in a common-wealth, who having
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95561:40"/>
violated the publick Laws, or been guilty of Treason against their Prince, being overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief and shame, with all their heart lament the wickedness of their crime, and they do not wickedly that they are ashamed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. But yet they do not escape the due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Law. Therefore the detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sin proves them guilty, but doth not free them from condemnation. But if there is so great severity of Laws and <hi>Iudgments</hi> in humane offences, which no deploring of ill life can wash away, what then should be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of these that are committed against the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and infinite Majesty? Which Angels offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one thing were not unpunished, having been thrust out of Heaven, and whom no sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row could restore again, what should be said to us in this frail condition of sinful nature, in which dwelleth no good thing, who offend by a daily, either negligence of duties, or filthiness of deeds? Is it sufficient to turn away the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of so great a God, to say, I have erred, unless there be some other thing besides the sense of grief to help guilty and wounded na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may defend this weak part of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with a stronger safe-guard, and may be sufficient to appease <note place="margin">The violation of Infinite majesty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but by an infinite price.</note> and reconcile offended justice with a proportionable price, and, (so to speak,) can contend with Divine Iustice by <hi>opposing a righteousness equal thereunto?</hi> For as the wound is infinite, that is inflicted on our nature, so it is just, that a remedy of the like nature
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95561:41"/>

               </p>
               <p>For, that we may openly confess the truth, what else is this whole life of Godly Men, but a continual repentance, and a perpetual detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condemnation of sin, whilst we are forced by the Gospel with daily groans to breath forth this Petition? Forgive us our sins, as if we were conflicting in a continual place of wrestling, in which sometimes we stand by the Spirit, sometimes we fall through the infirmity of the Flesh, and sometimes we again make new repentance, yet we always overcome and triumph by Faith, to wit, obtaining the pardon of our faults, and we obtain true righteousness for ever. Therefore away with impudent slanders; let just judgment be exercised, and let things be comprehended each in their own places and bounds.</p>
               <p>Pious tears, a serious deploring of former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and a just care of living a better life, with all other pious exercises, are things, which we do not thrust away, nor put out of their place, only we search what is the place, what is the peculiar office of those things. And in the first place this is a thing that <note place="margin">What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth by it self, what to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Faith.</note> should not be doubted of by any Man, that Repentance, as it is an excellent gift of God, so it brings forth fruits not to be repented of, according to its Office; the Office

or duty whereof I reckon to be <note place="margin">Repentance consistsof two parts.</note> twofold. The first is, that which duly detests the sins committed. The other, that which diligently endeavours the Reformation of the life, from which follows both great praise, and greater fruits, and also very great incitements to vertue. For he that being weary of his former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness applys his mind wholly to amend his ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life by a future reformation; verily he hath made a great progress towards Salvation, but he is not therefore as yet put into a certain possession of Salvation, or because of that, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the Penitent Malefactor into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise. For it is one thing to weep for the things that one hath done amiss, and another thing to obtain the pardon of them. Verily he that seriously purposes with himself to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his life, I judge that he ought justly to be praised; but yet that is not enough, as I suppose, to turn away the anger of an offended God, to put away the heinous nature of Sin, to procure a clear tranquility of <note place="margin">How far the fruit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore Repentance with Charity, and other Offices of that kind, have a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with faith; not that they may give form
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95561:42"/>
to this as to a dead <hi>matter,</hi> but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may receive life and Spirit <note place="margin">Faith in Christ justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Charity, but Charity doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie Faith. <hi>Augustin in quinquage, Prolo.</hi> Psal. 31.</note> from it: not that Faith hath need of these for justification, but that they themselves may be justified by the value received by Faith in Christ, which unless they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended upon the account of that Faith would all be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the sight of God; and though they may be call'd works, yet cannot be call'd good works in Gods account, unless they are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Faith. Whence <hi>Augustin</hi> admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not without cause, commands us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him that justifies the Wicked, that our very good works may be good works; for those deserve not to be called good, as long as they proceed not from a good root, &amp;c. But here you object approved Testimonies and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, rehearsed out of the Sacred Oracles of Divine Scripture, in which, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, Salvation is assuredly promised to them that Repent, as in <hi>Ezekiel, I de sire not the death of a Sinner, but</hi>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95561:43"/>
there is no hope of Salvation shewed unto any, but only those, who are with their whole heart brought back from an unclean and wicked life to the practise of Holiness, &amp;c. <hi>And presently concluding with this Opinion, you teach us</hi> that there is no other way at all either to avert destruction, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure salvation.</p>
               <p>Lest I should speak many things in vain, there is one Answer abundantly sufficient for all such Objections; that there is indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required a sincere reformation of heart and life, in these who are to obtain life; as in an Heir, for whom there is appointed the possession of an Inheritance to be enjoyed, there is necessarily required dutifulness towards his Father, which dutifulness, nevertheless, when it is most exactly performed, is not any cause of obtaining the inheritance. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is nothing that can be more certain, than that Repentance and Renovation do much commend the life of Christians to God; yet it makes them not Christians, neither doth it so much commend the person of the Penitent, as it is it self commended by the dignity of the man: who, if he is a Christian, his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is approved. But, if he be an Alien from the faith, the lamenting of sin doth not at all profit for the obtaining of Righteousness, neither doth it take away Sin. But as you <note place="margin">Ier. 11. Ezek. 33. Ezek. 18.</note> say, Repentance hath Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and indeed I am not against your Opinion in that, for God doth not desire the death of a Sinner, promising also life to him that repents. That's right. But let
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95561:43"/>
us see how he promises it, and by pondering the Circumstances of things, times, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, let us consider what is promised, and to whom, and what is the true cause of promising. Indeed the old Law hath dark promises, the Gospel also hath its own promises, as both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants have likewise their own atonements. I do not deny it, but this I ask what manner of promises hath repentance in the Old Law? God promiseth life to them that return from their wickedness. What? doth he signifie an eternal or a temporary peace and felicity of this outward life? If you answer an eternal, I would then know what difference there will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Legal and Evangelical Promises? but when I do stedfastly contemplate upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind of both times and testaments in the holy word of God, and compare the vertue of one Kingdom with the other, this seems to me to be the difference between <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ; that I suppose all his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Rewards promised by God <note place="margin">Legal Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> to those that lead their life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prescript of the Law, go not beyond the bounds of a certain earthly blessedness and recompence. In which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we think there are contained no small benefits of God. For what could happen to any man in this mortal state, to which we are all of necessity subject, not only more desirable, but also of a larger extent by the wonderful power of God, than when you are by the singular gift of God placed in such a Commonwealth, which by a wonderful fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and plenty of all good things, excells all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95561:44"/>
other Nations whatsoever; you should then pass your life in it, being compassed about with the Divine Protection, that you may not only your self live long in the Land, which the Lord your God hath given you, but that it should also be well with your Sons after you, through all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: that you may maintain your state with dignity, and abundance of all the best things, that the adversity of common fortune may have no power over you, that no Enemy may annoy you, no tempest may cloud your tranquility, that no storm of evil things may shake you: that at home and abroad, whether you are in the field, or in your house, going out or coming in, all things may happen suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully to you, according to your hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; and moreover, that God should so bless all your wealth and works of your hands, and that at no time the powerful providence of God should forsake you unto the utmost bounds of the most aged life; unto these add the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous fruitfulness of the Land, the incomes of Fruits and Corn, the continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases <note place="margin">Blessings proposed in the Law.</note> of wealth, the constant fruitfulness of Cattle, besides other very plentiful Promises and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the like kind, whereof there is a long Catalogue described in the Law, which are appointed for those, who inviolably obey the most holy Precepts of God, and turn from their Sins to Righteousness. All which Promises being by the Prophets set before the Penitent, seem to me to be of such a sort, that they either signifie temporary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95561:44"/>
in this World, and mitigate outward punishments in this Life; or if they be referred to eternal Life, they do <note place="margin">The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance belongs to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> at least imply the faith of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, by a certain silent condition. And therefore among Divines there are learned and famous men, who do rightly and learnedly prove, that the Preaching of Repentance belongs peculiarly to the Gospel and not to the Law. For the Law Preaches Damnation to Sinners. The Gospel Preaches Salvation to the Penitent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Lord says, return and ye shall be saved, I desire not the death of a sinner, &amp;c. It is not the Preaching of the Law, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the Sentence of Condemnation without mercy: but it is the very voice of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And this seems to me to be the chief difference between <hi>Moses</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was a certain earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christ, Christ is a certain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </note> Christ, that like as he being as it were a certain earthly Christ, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures an earthly liberty to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and sets before them the duties that are incumbent upon them in leading their lives; so all the doctrine and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Christ are peculiarly and chiefly directed unto life eternal, and calls us thereunto espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from this world. But if we suppose that these legal promises should notwithstanding be referred to eternal life, yet when they did not pass the bounds of that people only, and reached not to other Nations, but to those peculiarly, who waited for the Seed promised to them, therefore the promises of the Law
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95561:45"/>
included faith at least by a certain silent condition. Wherefore as touching those le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal promises, in which the holy Prophets held out unto them, that repented and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, pardon and many other benefits, in these must be considered, not only what is promised, but also, to whom the promise is made, as being such, as belonged not to others, but those only, who being descended from the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were contained in the Convenant, and had a right to the Lamb slain from the beginning. Therefore according to the authority of <hi>Augustin,</hi> we ought always to look to the root in such promises, and the mind should always be raised up to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant, in whom alone all the Promises of God are yea and <hi>Amen.</hi> Which seeing it is so, and seeing all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Eternal Life are contained in this only Mediator Christ, as in the only Ark of the Covenant, neither is there any faculty given us by God, which attains to the knowledge of Christ and the understanding of his benefits, but faith only; therefore it is, that this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated faith, which only leads us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, claims to it self only <note place="margin">The object of Faith. We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the same manner, that the Hebrews were healed, when they were stung by the Serpents.</note> all power of Iustifying without any other means, not so much because of the dignity of its act, or upon some account of charity joined with it, whereby it should be formed,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95561:45"/>
but only upon the account, and by the vertue of its object, unto which it is bent, from whence it receives all this power of healing, just as the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, when they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed with deadly Poison, regained their health, not because they had Eyes and a power of beholding, but because they fastned their Eyes at the command of God upon the Serpent, that was set up before <note place="margin">

Unless ye believe that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins.</note> their Eyes. In like manner also it comes to pass to us, that whereas it is Christ only, that bestows ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life and Righteousness on them that behold him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a Saviour, unless he be received by Faith, hence the inward sight of Faith being fixed upon him, brings Salvation. Whence by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration, an argument is framed from principles and causes, issuing into conclusions by necessary consequence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scriptures. As this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma.</hi> The only beholding of the Serpent set up, without any other condition being added, healed the wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mi.</hi> Christ is the Serpent set up for us; Therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl</hi> The only beholding of (that is, faith in) Christ set up for us, without any additions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever brings healing to our wounds.</p>
               <p>And I know the adversaries will <note place="margin">The Papists deny not Christ to be a Saviour, but they do not well agree in the manner how he Saves. The Council of <hi>Trent, Hosius, Andradius, Canisius.</hi>
                  </note> not deny that Christ is the only
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95561:46"/>
Serpent, who being made a Curse for us, makes a Medicine for our Wounds. But if you ask, how? They will answer one thing, and the holy Scriptures another: they affirm that this is <hi>performed</hi> on this account, because Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punished for us on the Cross, hath by his Merits obtained for us the infusion of Charity. Which because it is the perfection of the Law, therefore being acquired by the Merit of Christ, and received by our free-will, it brings forth righteousness, not that, <note place="margin">A typical si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent healing wounds. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.</note> whereby we are accounted for just, but whereby we are both truly just, and deserve life. But verily this Sophism neither agrees with the History of the Israelites, nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the argument propounded. For if those that were then wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Serpents, by only behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Serpent without any other intermediate cause, received present health: verily either this type bears not the similitude of Christ, or Christ heals us by faith in his name only without interposing the remedy of Charity. Otherways the mutual proportion of similitude between us and them, between Christ and the Serpent, will not rightly agree. They lifted up their outward eyes, we our inward, they to the serpent, we to Christ. Both by beholding obtain health through the Promise of God; they the health of their Bodies, we of our Souls. They presently in beholding at the first sight, were healed in the same moment, by no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of their own, but only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95561:46"/>
of the Object, and by vertue of the Promise. And what other thing doth this mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal adumbration signifie, but Iustification freely prepared and promised to us, by the sole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Object, whereby we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Christ by Faith? Will you hear the Promise? That every one who seeth him may not perish, but have eternal Life? And elsewhere. And this righteous servant of mine by his knowledge shall Iustifie many. But what is it to see him, but to believe in him? What is the knowledge of that righteous one, but the Faith of Christ, which Iustifies from sin? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what external aspect was to them, that the light of Faith is to us. What Health was to them, Iustification is to us, whereby we are delivered from the Curse of sin, and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved without punishment. But if you ask, what way? There is an answer in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to wit, according to the very simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Serpent, not by any labour of ours, but by contemplation of the Object only, and by vertue of the Promise. I pray you what is more evident? What more agreeable? And what then should be said to those ill-employed men, who by their new doctrine translate Free Iustification, which is due only to Faith by vertue of the Promise of God, unto works of Charity.</p>

               <head>Of Sin and the healing thereof by Christ.</head>
               <p>FOR <hi>Andradius, Hosius, Vega</hi> the Spaniard, and those others of the same Faction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with these, seem so to contend about the Righteousness of Charity, that having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most banished Faith out of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> they place all the parts of our Salvation, or at least the chiefest in Charity and Sanctification. And now by what Scriptures will they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that? What, say they, doth not Christ heal us just as the Brazen Serpent healed the Wounds of those that were hurt? Were we not all healed by his stripes? Is not <note place="margin">

Is not he the Life-giving Serpent, who gives cure for our wounds? And what are our Wounds, say they, but Sin? What is the healing of Wounds but the puting away of Sins? What then, shall the Serpent be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in fixing his sting, than Christ in taking it out? Shall <hi>Alam</hi> be more powerful to infect Nature, than Christ to cleanse it? But how is nature purged, if yet the contagion of sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains? As in a diseased body, unless the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humours are purged off, health is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and as the Air being surrounded on every side with black darkness, begins not to shine, before the brightness of the Sun being returned the darkness vanishes: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95561:47"/>
in the inward diseases of minds, the causes of maladies must first be taken away, before health is restored. But the causes of evils are sins, which if they are taken away by Christ, how can they remain in the Saints? But if they abide not, by necessary consequence then it follows, that the roots of all sins being cut away, they are righteous <note place="margin">Inherent righteousness.</note> in the sight of God by that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, not which is imputed, but which properly inheres in them, which is free of all spot of sin, which carefully observes the Law, which informs the mind with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and beautifies it with Divine Ornaments, and makes us partakers of the Divine Nature. But let us put all these together for brevities sake into the exact form of an argument.</p>
               <p>Sin abolished doth not remain. <note place="margin">Argument.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the Baptized, and in those that are come to years, who are converted, sin is abolished. Therefore,</p>
               <p>After Baptism and in those that are come to years after true conversion, there remains no more sin.</p>
               <p>This argument having a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, <note place="margin">Answer.</note> doth evidently destroy it self. First, there is no man that denies that actual sin is not abolished in Baptized Infants, in whom it is not committed. In those come to years, if all sins are so extinguished, that no relicks remain, what need is there of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95561:48"/>
For what place is there for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where nothing is committed contrary to duty? What if the Life of the Saints is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but almost a daily conversion and mourning for sin, how can a daily frailty of sinning be wanting there? But let us look upon the parts of the Argument. Sin abolished, say they, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. <note place="margin">The Material of Sin. The Formal of Sin.</note> That is true indeed if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat abolishment of sin be understood, both as to the Material of Sin, and as to the Formal, as the Schools speak. Therefore as touching the <hi>Major,</hi> in so much I acknowledge, sin doth not remain, in how much it is abolished in the Saints. But after what manner, and in what order it is abolished in the Baptized and in the adult, it follows next that this should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into in the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I answer to the <hi>Minor</hi> with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, that sin is said to be abolished in the Adult that are Regenerate, it is partly true and partly false, with <note place="margin">How sin in this Life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, and how it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</note> a different respect had to divers circumstances; But how that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it must be explained, first; as touching the death of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, which brings Salvation, there is no defect in that, but it hath abundantly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatsoever perished by <hi>Adam:</hi> yea it hath brought us much greater benefits, than the evils which <hi>Adam</hi> procured unto us. But if it be asked how, and in what order the Death of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95561:48"/>
Christ effects this? I answer, not <note place="margin">The guilt of sin. The frailty of sinning.</note> by denying, but by distinguishing. For seeing two things are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in every sin, the guilt oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the punishment of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>Lombard</hi> calls passive corruption: and then active corruption, or the very act of sin, or the infirmity of corrupted nature. Therefore there is again a twofold remedy prepared for this twofold evil, guilt Obliging to eternal punishment, is not only taken away in the life to come, but also in this life, by the holy laver, and continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins for the sake of a Mediator. But the infirmity of sinning, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence in the flesh, and ignorance <note place="margin">Hugo.</note> in the mind, (that I may speak with <hi>Hugo</hi>) it also is abolished in the regenerate, but yet after its own order, and by its own degrees. For it is daily diminished in this Life by the renewing of the Spirit, and it shall be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the Life to come, by the Resurrection of the Flesh. In the <hi>interim</hi> the relicks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity stick yet in the Flesh, as both Death and Temporal punishments stick yet in the Flesh, to exercise the Saints unto Combat; not to condemn them to destruction. Iust as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was promised to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> a great while before, which yet they did not suddenly take <note place="margin">A similitude.</note> possession of: Neither was the frame of this World made immediately in one moment, but the Works of God were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in distinct intervals of Days: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95561:49"/>
is the whole Flesh suddainly renewed, but by degrees, and daily increases, it is going on unto perfection.</p>
               <p>An example may be conveniently taken from him, whom being Wounded, the <hi>Samaritan, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Luc.</hi> doth not suddainly cure, but first pours Wine into his Wounds, washes off the Blood, afterwards he adds Oyl, that he may mitigate the grief, and the Wound may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to cleave together: Afterwards the Wound being bound up, he puts the Sick-man upon the Beast, and afterwards commands him to be cured in the Inn. Iust so Christ suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the punishment of our Sins in his Body, by remission immediately takes away the guilt from us, pouring into our Wounds the gladning Oyl of the Gospel, joined together with the Wine of serious Repentance; whereby what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is deadly in the Wounds, is washed away with a health restoring Pardon: But the Wounds are not yet altogether healed. But health will be compleat in Eternal Life. In the <hi>interim</hi> he will have diseases cured in the Church by Godly Exercises, the Cross, and constant Prayer. Briefly, if those Men desire to know what that is, which Christ hath abolished in us by <note place="margin">Argument.</note> his Death, I will say it in a word.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever was laid upon Christ on the Cross, to be carried away for our sakes, that is taken away from us in this Flesh.</p>
               <p>Only the guilt and punishment of Sin, not the matter it self of our actions was laid upon Christ to bear upon the Cross.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:95561:49"/>
               <p>The act or substance of sin, is not wholly abolished by the Death of Christ in this flesh, but only the guilt and punishment of sin.</p>
               <p>Or more briefly let them take it thus: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Christ by dying did bear for us, that only he took away by <note place="margin">Christ by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Cross did bear only the punishment of Sin, but not our Sins: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by raising us up again, he will destroy both the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the whole matter of Sin in due time.</note> his death in this Life. Christ by dying did bear only the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sins, not the Sins themselves in his Body, whereof he had none. Therefore Christ in this Life took away only the punishment, not the matter it self of sin by his Death. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by his power he shall also take away the whole matter of Sin in the Glory of the Resurection to come.</p>

               <head>Concerning the necessity of the practice, and care of good Works.</head>
               <p>THerefore in this place something hath been said of Faith, and all that manner of Righteousness; which the Divine Authority attributes to Faith only without Works. More things elsewhere have been explained by us in other Books: From which things just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions being drawn, it evidently appears, if I am not mistaken, wherein all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness consists, not in Works without Faith, nor joined together with Faith, but wholly in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95561:50"/>
Faith without Works; that is, without the merits of Works, or any condition of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For if Faith, which is nothing else but an internal and illuminated contemplation, and receiving of Christ the Son of God, receives a free promise of Life in him; I do not well see what the good deeds of our Life, thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, can perform in this part of justification. Yet it doth not <note place="margin">Works, tho' they do not justifie, yet are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</note> follow from hence that the Holy practice of good Works <hi>for necessary uses,</hi> that I may speak with <hi>Paul,</hi> is not upon any account necessary. Neither is it a reason forcible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if any Man teaches that no trust should be put in Works, that therefore there is no need of any care to do good: For what Logick is this? Works should not be trusted in when they are performed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need to endeavour <note place="margin">The calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Adversaries against Pious Doctors.</note> to perform Good and Holy Works. We are no other ways justified but upon the account of Faith which is in Christ Iesus: Therefore Offices of Piety are not necessary in those, who are justified by Faith. Faith only, not upon the account of Love, but of the Mediatour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes us to righteousness; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">

being most holy, and most pure, and which can endure no filthiness of Iniquity, it behoveth him therefore that would enjoy the presence thereof, to conform himself unto the same Image: for there is no Communion between light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there is no union between the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness <note place="margin">Osor. l. 2. p. 31.</note> of righteousness, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of unrighteousness. <hi>Which seeing it is so, he therefore concludes that</hi> Luther, <hi>&amp; they of</hi> Luther's <hi>Party do err,</hi> first in this, that they dare assert that sin in those, whom that infinite <note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 34.</note> purity hath united unto it self, by a most Holy Love, is not wholly removed, nor altogether abolish'd and pluck'd up by the roots, nor all its fibers quite extirpated.

               <head>Concerning Righteousness, and its definition given by <hi>Osorius,</hi> and others.</head>
               <p>THou hast, ingenuous Reader, the whole Model of <hi>Osorian</hi> Righteousness described in a short compend: in which, what is true and what is faulty, it remains that we should exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with like brevity according to the Rules of Evangelical Doctrine, beginning first at the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95561:53"/>
very definition of righteousness, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depends the substance of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. For so <hi>Osorius</hi> defines Righteousness, <hi>that it is a state of Soul founded on the Law of God,</hi> and that bears a clear resemblance to the immutability <hi>of the Divine Vertue.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner also <hi>Andradius</hi> not much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. <hi>Righteoufness, saith</hi>

                  <hi>he, is an unmoveable equity, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of mind, which measures all its actions and counsels by the Law of God.</hi> And the same again presently: <hi>Righteousness is a habit of mind fashioned by the Divine Law to obey that Divine Law and Will, as it perswades to perform the Offices of every vertue,</hi> &amp;C. So that I need not here gather together the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of others of the Party, of whom I find so many to be of the same Opinion, that they think a Righteous Man should be defined from works of Righteousness, just as a wise Man from Wisdom, a Musician from Musick; and other Artificers are formally denominated from the internal Skill they have in those Arts, and wherewith they are endued, as saith <hi>Tapperus;</hi> which would not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tapper.</hi> Artic. 8. de justit. pag. 18.</note> seem very blame-worthy to me, if they understood this of the Divine Righteousness, whereby God is Righteous, or wherewith Angels are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. But as touching our Righteousness, who are Men, and Sinners, this definition hath no place here at all.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95561:54"/>
               <p>Therefore that I may answer you, <note place="margin">An Answer whereby the definition of <hi>Osorius</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> 
                  <hi>Osorius,</hi> and yours to these things, first I think you are not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in examining the nature of Righteousness, not that any thing is put in the definition that I call false, or that it doth not agree to the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. For he that governs all his actions with such constant reason and equity, that in no part of his life he starts aside from truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, him I do esteem to be truly Righteous, yea to be God rather, or next to God; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I find no mortal man such. Therefore herein is your errour, <note place="margin">A two-fold sort of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> that whereas there is a two-fold and divers sort of Righteousness set before us in Scripture, the one which is of the Law, and peculiar to God; the other which is of Faith, and peculiar to us; you are only so taken up in defining the one, that you do not at all touch upon the other, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the chiefest matter of Controversie is here: And so you proceed in setting forth the perfect excellency of the Divine Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and justly so indeed to be accounted of, that in the mean while you leave no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to Man at all. For what Righteousness shall Man have, if Righteousness be so strictly defined, that it cannot consist, but of works of perfect Righteousness, nor be communicated but only to perfect men? For now seeing no men are so perfect in this World, but that this miserable depravation of our Nature
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95561:54"/>
is far from this exactness, and there is none (as <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth) as long as he is in this life, who pretends <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> de tempore Serm. 49.</note> himself to be just in the sight of God. By necessary Consequence it follows, that either there is no Righteousness of ours at all in this life, or it must be another than that which your defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus circumscribes to us; for thus you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it.</p>

                  <hi>upon Divine Prescription, free from all wickedness, and coming near in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to the Divine Nature,</hi> &amp;C. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in that state we were Created in the beginning. But we have lost it long since, neither are we yet perfectly restored, but we shall be restored at length by the Divine power and bounty of Christ, on the day that this our corruption shall put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall rise again to immortality. In which state of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> de tempore, Serm. 49.</note> Resurrection we believe with <hi>Augustin,</hi> that we shall fulfill Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that is, we shall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Righteousness. In Comparison of that Resurrection, saith he, the whole life, that we now live is but dung, &amp;c. And where now is that excellent habit of mind, coming so near in its resemblance to the Divine Nature? Where is that constant equity of reason, and moderation of mind free from all sin? Or what do you think
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95561:55"/>
of this life, which <hi>Isaiah</hi> calls a menstruous cloth, and <hi>Augustin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isaiaeb 1. 64.</note> calls dung, if it be compared with that which is true Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Whereby you do evidently discern, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, what comes of this your famous Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Theory of Righteousness; for if there is no way of entring into the Kingdom of life but by Righteousness, and no Righteousness (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Opinion) can consist but of a perfect observance of the Divine Law, and dignity of works, what follows then? You must either deny that we are sinners in this life, and assert that we are righteous by works; or if according to Scripture you confess us to be sinners, you must despoil us of all righteousness, and shut us out of the Kingdom of God? And what will you say to <hi>Augustin,</hi> who esteems all the Righteousness of this life as dung? What will you say to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 64. Phil. 3.</note> who says, it is as a menstruous cloth? What will you say to <hi>Paul,</hi> who accounted it as loss? What will you say to Christ, who calls them that acquit themselves most righteously, not only Servants, but also unprofitable Servants, if <note place="margin">Luke 17. Psel. 115. Romans 3. Iohn 1. Iames 3.</note> the Scripture evidently testifies that every man is a Lyar: If the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Evangelist condemns him for a Lyar, who would seem to himself to be free from sin: If (according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Paul</hi>) we have come short of the glory of God. If, as <hi>Iames</hi> testifies, in many things we offend all; if most holy Men in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95561:55"/>
Prayer cry daily, forgive us our sins; if <hi>Augustine</hi> doth manifestly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> de perfect. ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiae.</note> deny that any man, after he hath obtained the remission of sins, hath lived so righteously in this flesh, or that he doth live so righteously, that he hath no sin at all: If with one mouth the publick consent of the most approved Fathers testifies the same; if moreover continual private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, if Conscience it self, which is as a thousand Witnesses, convince even thy self to be a perpetual sinner, darest thou, who art a sinful man, confuted by thy own works, dream yet of the righteousness of works, and promise Heaven to thy self, and others by works? And doth not <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> the example of the <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the Gospel affright you, who having been deceived by a false Opinion of his own Righteousness, and who whilst flattering himself, he thought he was not like other men, &amp;c. He was yet so far from that which he perswaded himself concerning himself, that he went away worse than those whom he most despised in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of himself. But how much more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly would you behave your self, if with a humble meekness restraining that insolency of Spirit, you would either frame your self to the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who durst not come forth into the presence of God, or would put on that most humble mind of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who comparing his Life with another Man, thou art a Sinner, saith he, like me, yea, a less
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95561:56"/>
Sinner than I, for I acknowledge a pre-eminence in my sins, &amp;c. At <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul.</hi> lib. de paenitentia.</note> least you might and ought to be admonished by the sharp rebuke of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who when they had highly flattered themselves with a false perswasion of their own righteousness, which they took upon them by works; They did not in any other thing more displease the <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> Divine Iudgment; therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> said right, let no man flatter himself: Let Man take Sin, which is his own, and let him leave Righteousness to God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But what is that, let him leave Righteousness to God; but aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>August.</hi> in <hi>Iohn,</hi> Hom. 48</note> all Righteousness of works, to confess our selves to be that which we are, sinners, and God only to be just? Which also Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently confirm in these words; to declare his Righteousness, that he may be just, and the justifier of him who <note place="margin">Romans 3.</note> Believe in Iesus. In which a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner of Righteousness presents it self unto us; of which the one is Divine, and is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God only; the other is only referred to men. That therefore is peculiar to God, this is called our Righteousness; but what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is between this and that, there is no great difficulty to discern. For that which is the Righteousness of God, appears evident in all his works, and the perfect exactness of his holiness. But that which is the Righteousness of men, is received by Faith only; not that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95561:56"/>
faith in acting is wholly without works, but because in justifying, works do nothing before God, and that is it which the Apostle seems to to intend in these words: saying, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he may be just, and the justifier of him, that is of the faith <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> of Iesus Christ, &amp;c. For this purpose, saith he, that he may be just; how is he just? by faith? no, but by works; that thou mayest be justified in thy say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalm</hi> 51. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. God is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied one way, and men are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way.</note> and mayest overcome when thou art judged. But now what way are we justified? by works? not at all, but by Faith. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Apostle: A justifier of him who is of the faith of Iesus Christ, &amp;c. He said not, him that behaved himself well by working, but him that is of the faith of Iesus Christ Whence a Disciple being witness, whosoever shall believe in Christ with a direct and intent faith, it follows by necessary consequence that this Man is esteemed Righteous, and is justified before God. For otherwise, to what purpose should God be said to justifie us by Faith, or what need would there be here of any mention of faith at all, if holy works of themselves were sufficient to make up a Righteousness?</p>
               <p>By all which, things being thus deduced and confirmed, it is easie to understand what should be judged of this your definition. For if there is no other Righteousness, but that which by your definition is placed in holy works, and a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95561:57"/>
perfect obedience to the Law of God: it thence follows, that either <note place="margin">Nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us to be both Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners insa dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Sinners in our selves. Righteous in Christ.</note> we are not tainted with any sins at all, or that we must necessarily confess that we are excluded <hi>from all possession of Righteousness.</hi> Both of which are false; for though Sin and Righteousness, in respect of one and the same thing, through a mutual <hi>Antithesis,</hi> whereby they are opposed one against another, cannot come together, yet nothing hinders, but we may be both Sinners, and also Righteous upon a different account. You will say, how can that be? If you know not, (my good Friend,) I will tell you, and in a word, that you may understand the more expeditiously. We are Sinners in our selves, we are Righteous inChrist. Hereunto belongs the Mystery of Christ the Son of God given to us by his Father, that he with all his works and benefits may become wholly ours, for our right, and for our advantage. So he is said by the <note place="margin">Isaiah 9.</note> Prophet to be born; so he is said to be given, not to himself, but to us: So he was Righteous, so he fulfilled the Law, so he died and rose again, that his life might be to us Righteounsness, his death might be Redemption, and his Resurrection might be Life and Glory. Moreover, whatsoever is Christ's, yea, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Christ. is, is not so much his own as yours; O <hi>Osorius!</hi> as mine, <note place="margin">Whole Christ is ours.</note> and as it is all ours that by Faith are Iesus Christ's. Therefore our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95561:57"/>
Salvation consists of the Redemption purchas'd by another, and not of our works. For herein shines forth the more than stupendious mercy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Grace of a most tender hearted God, that he even dedicated his only begotten Son wholly to our advantage, that so whatsoever was performed by him, was performed not for his sake, but for ours; neither had it respect to him who had no private need, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds as a publick good to us all, <note place="margin">Christ bears our publick person before the Father.</note> because he sustains the publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of All before his Father. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you desire to know, what is our Righteousness! <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> will shew it to you much better than it was defined by you. For our Righteousness is Christ, our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord, through whose name, as <note place="margin">What is our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> many as believe in his name, receive Remission of sins. What more, I pray you, would you require unto perfect Righteousness, than that sins may never be imputed, and that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due to your sins may never be inflicted on you?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Concerning Inherent and Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</head>
               <p>BUT perhaps it is not enough to you, that the sins you committed are not imputed to you, but that nothing may be committed, which may be justly imputed. And for that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95561:58"/>
cause you think no man should be reckoned among the Iust, but he, whose life being upon all accounts untainted, is conformable to the perfect rule of the Law, having abolished the foot-steps of all sins. And indeed <note place="margin">Osor. de just. lib. 2. lib. 7. p. 187. lib. 9. p. 228.</note> that should be wished for, if wishes in this case could do any good: But you will say that it is not difficult <hi>to the Infinite Power of the Almighty God, to give strength to perform it to those that ask it of him: And again there is not any thing more unsuitable to his Infinite Equity, and less</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But in answer, First, If those things cannot be kept by us, which are commanded by God, that comes not to pass through any default of his, but through our default: who being at first created by him, <note place="margin">God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not any thing which cannot be observed by men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Osorius</hi> it is no fault in God, if he command those things which cannot be kept by us.</note> very good, brought this disability upon our selves, and threw our selves into that necessity of sinning. And then what if it so seemed good to his Omnipotent Wisdom, to do thus for a Declaration of his own Righteousnes, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, for this purpose that he should be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? that is, that his Righteousnes might by this means become the more evident through our unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have been, unless he only had, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:95561:58"/>
been declared to be Righteous, and we upon the same account Unrighteous according to Works. Which if it had not been so, what need had there been, why <note place="margin">There had been no need for God to Iustifie us by Faith, if we could be justified by works, <hi>de justit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 90.</note> he should justifie us by Faith, whom he had seen to be righteous and perfect by Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, you say there is very great need of faith, and you add a reason:</hi> Because all the means of destroying and restraining Lust consists in the Grace of God alone, which must be obtained by Faith: and there is no other way shewed to extinguish and destroy it.

               <p>What? And does Faith nothing but prepare us for Righteousness? But now, what way does it prepare? Because, say you, the Grace of God is obtained by Faith and the merit of Christ. But proceed; what follows after? <hi>For it is God only, by whose Almighty Power and Bounty we break the force of Lust, and restrain all its importunity, and maintain the perfect Offices of Vertue,</hi> &amp;c. Who ever denied, that it is God only that can do those things? But what say you. O good friend? Is our whole Salvation and Righteousness in the sight of God, contained in that only, in driving out of the Mind those <hi>little Heats</hi> of all evil Lusts, whereof you speak,

What if you think there is no difference between his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and ours, and you suppose there is no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness but what proceeds chiefly from Works; either let your life shew to us the same Works, which Christ wrought, or if you cannot, let him only have the honour of this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that Christ only may be righteous, and <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> may confess himself to be unrighteous and à sinner, that now that saying may truely have place here, which just now I cited out of <hi>Augustine.</hi> Let man take sin, <note place="margin">Aug. in Io.

               <p>But, you will say, what then, is there no Righteousness which belongs to men? I do not deny that there is, but it is such a righteousness, as must be sought elsewhere than in works. But you may say, where then? Not only I, but also St. <hi>Paul</hi> will tell you, the Righteousness of God, saith he, to all, and upon all that believe. And again in the <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> same Epistle: The Gentiles which followed not after Righteousness, laid hold on Righteousness, to wit, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95561:60"/>
Law of Righteousness, attained not unto the Law of Righteousness. Why so? Because they sought it not by Faith, but as by the Works of the Law. And writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> knowing, saith he, that a man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> Faith of Iesus Christ, we also believe in Iesus Christ, that we may be justified by the Faith of Iesus Christ, and not by the Works of the Law, because no flesh shall be justified by the Works of the Law, &amp;c. who is so dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted but he may clearly see what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostle is in these words? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I the more wonder with my self, how great a stupidity darkens the minds of some of our own Country-men, and especially those Iesuits, who in a thing so perspicuous yield not unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Authority, so that they seem to have sallied out of some Trophonian Den, for no other purpose, but that waging War with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they may differ wholly from him in their opinion. For what things can more fiercely encounter than such <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. Rom. 4. Rom. 11. Hab. 2.</note> an opposition as this, Christ is our Righteousness? Faith is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Righteousness: If of Work, then Grace is not Grace. The Iust lives by Faith. And after this manner doth the Apostle and Prophet instruct us. What, say they? We are Iustified by <note place="margin">Rom. 4. Gal. 3. 2 Tim. 1. Ephes. 2.</note> Works, and yet Grace is no less Grace. The Iust doth not live by Faith, but the Believer Liveth by the righteousness of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95561:61"/>
Works. And whereas <hi>Paul</hi> doth so attribute our Righteousness to <note place="margin">Tit. 3. Rom. 11. Phil. 3. Rom. 4. Rom. 9.</note> Faith only, that he attributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Works, so often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these exclusive words, without works, apart from works, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to works. If it is Grace, then it is not of Works: That I may be found in him, not having my own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is of the Faith of Iesus Christ: To him that believeth in him that Iustifies the Ungodly, Faith is imputed unto Righteousness: also placing Iews and Gentiles as in a Scheme, that by experience it self it may be evident how hazardous it is, to seat the hope of Salvation any otherways than in the Faith of Christ only. On the contrary, those men overthrowing all these sayings of <hi>Paul,</hi> endeavour this only by all the means they can, that they may measure the whole sum of our Iustification by the performance of Works, and not by Faith; that they may take away all imputation of the Righteousness of another from us, that Faith may no more contribute any thing to Righteousness, but that it may render us worthy and fit, on whom the Divine Grace should. confer freely for the Merit of Christ, the first infusion <note place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Sess. 6.</note> of inherent Righteousness. By which new qualities being received for the Merit of Christ, now man himself by that inherent Righteousness (as their words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it) merits a greater and fuller righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, reconciliation and adoption, and at length
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95561:61"/>
Life Eternal. Moreover, they proceed so far, that they assert, there is no Righteousness at all, but that which is peculiar to every man, and they so define it, that in all the nature of Righteousness there is no place at all for faith, and there appears not <note place="margin">A definition of rig hteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits of <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.

We have read it, Say they, in the Topicks of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> That is true indeed. But have ye not also at any time read in the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> these forms of speaking, Christ is our Righteousness? We are made the righteousness of God by him? faith is imputed unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? <note place="margin">Answer to the Iesuitical quibbles.</note> the Iust shall live by faith?

And should we translate our Faith, which we owe to God with faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> unto men that are Sophisters? But now, lest those Iesuits should say, that they are not answered, let us look more nearly into the force of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pierce them through with their own Dart. <hi>They deny that ever this external attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was heard of since the World was; that a thing should receive a name extrinsically from qualities, that can be within, so that they should be accounted righteous before God, not by inherent qualities,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:95561:62"/>
                  <hi>but the righteousness of another, to wit, Christs, which is applyed to us by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Reason taken out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> might perhaps be of some force, if they had omitted these words (before God.) But now seeing there is a twosold and divers righteousness, the one which is called the righteousness of the Law, the other which is called the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith; and seeing the judgments of God and the judgments of men do differ, they do foolishly and ridiculously argue from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things to divine, from the righteousness of the Law, to the righteousness of Faith; for men are not justified in the sight of God upon the same account that they are esteemed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before men. Yea, oft-times it happens otherways, that those whom this World does most cry up, and judges just by their inherent qualities, God condemns the same men chiefly of unrighteousness out of those very same qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: and so on the contrary part, <note place="margin">Men judge by qualities, but God judgeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</note> This may easily appear evident by the Example of the <hi>Pharisee</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> either of which if they were to be valued according to the inherent merits of their life, what cause was there, I beseech you, why the <hi>Publican</hi> should go home more righteous than the <hi>Pharisee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even as with a like diversity the Scripture sometimes names them dead, whom humane Philosophy would judge to be alive, and in perfect health. Suffer ye, Saith he, the dead to bury their dead. But pray how dead? who,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95561:63"/>
unless they were alive, they could not bury their dead? What shall we then say? that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lyes, in calling them dead, which were alive? Or does that Iesuitical Rule rather lye, which judges those alive by reason of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent qualities, whom the Scripture calls dead? How shall these things, so contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, agree together? But that it is one thing to live, to be dead, and to be righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and another thing before Men. The Books of Holy Scripture are full of such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and they have been often heard of and seen by Men; and yet after all these things, those pleasant Gymnosophists <hi>deny, that this external attribution was ever heard of since the World was, that a thing should receive a name extrinsecally from qualities, whose nature is to be within.</hi> Is it so indeed that this was not heard of since the beginning of the World? what do I hear? have ye not then, good men, read these words of the Apostle in the Holy Scriptures of God? By the disobedience of one man many were made sinners; and again, by the obedience of one man many shall be made Righteous. I pray you, what is the meaning of these words, by the disobedience of one many are sinners? Again, by the obedience of one many are righteous? Does this attribution seem internal to you, or rather external? was that rebellion peculiar to <hi>Adam,</hi> or was it ours? If it was ours, how was it ours, but by external impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? What? when you hear these words of the Apostle: He made Christ to become sin
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95561:63"/>
for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God through him, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> &amp;c. Did either of us receive from qualities that can be said to be within; he, that he was made sin, or we, that we are called and made righteousness through him? Moreover, what is that, when the Publican in the Gospel is said to have gone to his house justified rather than the Pharisee? what was the cause why the one went away justified, and the other went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unjustified? I think it came not so to pass by a habit of inherent righteousness, but upon this account rather, because the Publican con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his own unrighteousness, therefore of wicked he is made righteous; the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he seemed righteous to himself, through a false opinion of his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was manifested to be unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <note place="margin">

And <hi>Bernard</hi> spake no less to the purpose, who bids us consider the Pharisee praying; he was no Robber, said he, nor unjust, nor an Adulterer, nor careless of Fastings, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the poor, nor unthankful to God, what then was wanting?</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:95561:64"/>
               <p>This one thing was wanting, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> in Dominic.

On the contrary, the Publican, who emptied himself, and took care to bring an empty vessel, received the more plentiful grace.</p>
               <p>By these things I suppose it is <note place="margin">By what Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by Christs, or our own.</note> sufficiently evident, what this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is, and of what sort, which makes us righteous before God, whether it is Christs or ours? If it is Christs, it is not ours? How then of works of our righteousness? If it is ours, it is not Christs: how is a man of wicked made righteous? If of wicked he is made righteous, that I may speak in the words of <hi>Augustine,</hi> what are the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> in Psal. 31.</note> works of wicked men? Let the wicked man now boast of his works, I give to the Poor, I take nothing away from any man, &amp;c. then thou art in this thy boast wicked, and thy works are none. These things said he, therefore it is a false Opinion, which men plead for, to wit, that a man cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led righteous by an external righteousness. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it less Ass-like which those <hi>Balqamites</hi> do bray, <hi>who say, that it is the same thing for a man to be thus Righteous; as if a man should say, an Ass with the form of an Ass is a Mon; for by Faith we are called faithful, and by righteousness weare called righteous,</hi> &amp;c. Be it so indeed, that no Man should rightly be called righteous, but upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95561:64"/>
the account of Righteousness; what then, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ is our righteousness, is there not sufficient cause upon that account why we should be called righteous? should any man require a better righteousness than that which is Christs? And what form of expressing, though external, can hinder, but that the righteousness which is peculiar to Christ, may also be called ours, and may be common both to him and us, especially seeing he is wholly ours with his merits, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, benefits, and all his goods? <note place="margin">Christ is wholly ours, with all his good things.</note> which qualities, though they are not properly in our selves, yet being received from him, they pass like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise into our possession. As the Bodies of the Stars and Planets, though dark of themselves, yet they shine and are made bright, not with their own, but anothers light, to wit, being inlightned with the light of the Sun; just so it comes to pass to us, that we are made Righteous, Kings, Priests, Sons and Heirs of God, not by any property of our nature or condition of works, but because the Son and Heir himself is said to be made Sin and a Curse for us, not for any sin inherent in him, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument.</hi> But here again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain those impure Sophisters object, <note place="margin">As Christ was made sin, so we are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. But Christ was not made sin by inherent sin. Therefore we also are not made righteous by inherent rightcousness.</note> that this was never heard from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> and that it is not agreeable to reason, that he should be called
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95561:65"/>
learned, that hath no learning, or righteous, that is not endued with righteousness. And perhaps that may seem true in moral vertue: Now seeing there is a twofold righteousness, as I have said, one which they call Ethick, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother which is Theological, that consists in manners, this in faith; we must judge far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of this than of that. For the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> treats, as it is a moral vertue distinguished from prudence, courage, and temperance, thus it is referred to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of the mind and internal qualities, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which men are denominated of what sort they are by Philosophers.</p>
               <p>And though we confess this to be true in some respect, it doth not at all hurt our cause nor discourage our enterprize in clearing this point.</p>
               <p>For all this Controversie undertaken by us drives at this, that we should search for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which is no moral humane vertue, but which is a Spiritual Grace and gift of God, which is not ours, but which is proper to Christ; whence he only is called holy and just, and we are called justified in him, not upon the account of works, but faith, which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes for righteousness unto them that believe in his name. And hence it is rightly called the righteousness of faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith.</note> faith it self is righteousness; whereby we are accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, being endued not with that external righteousness, about which those men Philosophize, but being beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95561:65"/>
and adorned with a peculiar and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal righteousness, which being so, who sees not that it is false and sophistical which those men take out of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> that we are justified by works, or should upon no account be called just? why so? <hi>because no man can be called just but upon the account of the righteousness, which every man possesses for his own in himself.</hi> For thus do those sharp-witted Men argue, who cannot endure the free justification of Faith. To whom, that I may make answer, let us hear this first from them: Whether faith, whereby we believe in Christ, seems to them a vertue or not? If they judge so, <note place="margin">Internal and inherent righteousness whereby we are justified according to the Gospel.</note> I ask whether it is a moral vertue, or a theological? And then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is internal, and inherent, being inwardly placed, or whether it should be called external? If faith is an internal thing, and the same is our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in the fight of God. Why then should not this seem an allowable form of arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iesuites, who deny that we are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise justified than by internal and inherent righteousness?</p>

                  <p>And these things we have said by the by, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the objections of the Iesuits; who seeing they so strictly examine the Divine Theorems of our Religion, according to the Logical forms of arguing, it is reasonable that we also should keep them entangled, and expedite our selves out of their nets, as much as may be.

First then as touching Faith, though that is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Vertue, yet they plead that it doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways justifie, but upon the account of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But thus they dispute concerning the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ: Because it is not our own,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95561:67"/>
but is peculiar to Christ. There is no cause why a Man should take upon him the Name of Righteous, from that Righteousness, <note place="margin">

               <p>PErhaps the thing will appear more evident by Example. Let us look upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him let us behold the publick calamity of our Nature: And also let us contemplate Salvation restored again by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> from the ruine received by the first.</p>
               <p>For, if the Doctrine and Force of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be the same, according to Philosophers, it will be more easie by that means from the Evil of the one, to judge of the advantages of the other.

Who though in their whole Nature they are most different one from another: Yet by the singular Wisdom of God, it so comes to pass, that there is a wonderful resemblance between things that differ very much and the reason of our Salvation being restored,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95561:68"/>
agrees most aptly with the reason of the ruine received.</p>
               <p>First, in this, that both were Originally Princes, and Authors of our Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of the Earthly and the <note place="margin">The former <hi>Adam,</hi> a Type of the second. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> other of the Heavenly. And then afterwards there was added another thing in which he was a wonderful Type and Image of Christ who was to come a long time after. How that came to pass we shall very well learn of <hi>Paul</hi> himself. As, saith he, by the Disobedience of one Man many were made Sinners: So by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, many shall be made Righteous: and doubling the same again and again in many words: As, faith he, by one Man Sin entred into the World, and by Sin Death came upon all Men, in that all have Sinned, &amp;c. And presently: If therefore by the Sin of one Man, Death came upon all Men to Condemnation; in like manner by the Iustification of one Man, good is propagated unto all Men to the Iustification of Life. What is more clear than these words of the Apostle? The whole force and summ of the Argument drives at this, that the true Nature of our Righteousness is not due to our Vertues, but we must be beholden for it to the merit of another. Setting before us such a sense as this by Argument.</p>

                     </note> seeing they are of themselves clear and conspicuous, the Point calls us to return to you, O most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Osorius,</hi> who seem either not to head carefully enough, or else perniciously to deny that which <hi>Paul</hi> Discourses of Imputation, so copiously and weightily: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore again, and again beseeching you, I appeal to this sacred Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whereof you write, and also to the equity of your own humanity; that having somewhat cleared your Eyes, you may search more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly into the meaning of the Apostles debate, and the force of his reasons. And first, I would have you see, into this, what it is the Divine Apostle chiefly treats of here, what he breaths after, what he drives at by this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whereby he compares <hi>Adam</hi> together with Christ, and proposes him as a Type and Figure of Christ. But where there is a Type, it is necessary there should be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Adam</hi> a Type of Christ.</note> something, which by certain agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of similitude may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Type. On the contrary, where there is no agreement, there is no Type: Where there is no significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no similitude discerned. Now whereas the former <hi>Adam,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Wherein the similitude of <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> bears a type and resemblance of him that was to follow; let us consider in what this similitude consists. What, in propagating sin?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95561:70"/>
Not at all in the very Nature of the Persons? What is more unlike? Where then is similitude? To wit, not in the persons, nor things themselves, but only in the manner of the thing. But it must be explained what that manner is: For herein lyes all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between us and the Papists. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as touching the things themselves, and the Persons, we are well enough agreed in that, for there is no Man who is asked concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> and concerning Christ, but will answer concerning both, according as the thing is in truth, that he is by nature earthly, and in his life a Sinner, and that he brought upon us not only an Example, but also a cause of sinning by a certain venomous contagion of Nature. And on the contrary, that Christ is from Heaven Heavenly, and most pure from all defilement of sin, and that he only is the Saviour of the World. Concerning which, if I am not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, there is an agreement between us and our Adversaries: But concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how these either good or evil things, come to us from these two Originally, herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists all the matter of controversie between us. for as there are many who think we are no other way guilty, but that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of sinning; we imitate <hi>Adam</hi>

                     </note> the first Author of Sinning; So you may see many, who think we are upon no other account righteous and acceptable to God; but that being helped by Grace, we attain unto Christs most Holy Works, and his most pure Innocency of

Life, or do very nearly resemble the same. Who though they seem to say something, yet is not all contained in that: For though good Education, and imitation wisely used, hath no small influence <note place="margin">Imitation of Life.</note> for the becoming Vertuous, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may come to pass, that some perhaps may seem less wicked than others, and in some respect to excel others in the praise of Piety: But imitation, or any instruction of discipline will never perform this: In short, nor any way besides will be sufficient for this, that you may shake form off your neck that which you drew from <hi>Adam,</hi> or that you should attain that which is in Christ, that is, that you should appear righteous in <note place="margin">Christ to be seen in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note> the sight of God; unless Christ come in to your succour another way, than by any of your endeavours how great soever You will say, After what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is all this? No Men can tell you that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than St. <hi>Paul:</hi> For after what manner the former <hi>Adam</hi> ruin'd you, after the same manner the Second <hi>Adam</hi> Christ restores you. That first Author of your kind, whilest thou was not yet born, killed thee in the root by his, not by thy rebellion. and drew thee into misery and destruction. In <hi>Adam</hi> behold Christ, for in like manner, being born and having dyed for thee, by his won Innocency, not by thine, hath restored thee again to true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and Paradice. As therefore the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to thee, who didst not Sin, after the similitude of his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95561:71"/>
So the Righteousness of Christ is imputed unto thee, who didst not Work after the similitude of Christ. In the <note place="margin">The severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Iudgment of God in <hi>Adam</hi> again the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Mercy in Christ.</note> one of whom behold the severity of Iudgment, in the other the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Grace. What if this perhaps seems hard and strange to any Man in <hi>Adam,</hi> that I should suffer the punishment of another Man's Sin, and that those should be punished for the crime of another, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing. (For it must needs be another Mans crime; seeing I am deprived of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness not for my own fault, but for the fault of my Parent.) Let this same Man again, leaving <hi>Adam,</hi> cast back his Eyes upon Christ: In whom the bounty of a most plentiful cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency makes amends, by a counterpoize for the severity of the former Iudgment: For from one Man Death passed upon all, on them also who sinned not: And justly, Though I do not so much regard merit here, I only consider the manner of the thing. Come then, let us compare the Type with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type; from the disobedience of one Man, as I said, death passed upon all Men, who sinned not after his example; which is a thing that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. After the same manner again, from the Righteousness of one Man, Life is communicated unto all, who did not like him work Righteousness, which is agreeable by the like reason; for otherways Christ could not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95561:71"/>
agree to his Type. Here now <note place="margin">The Type is compared with the Archetype.</note> consider, whosoever thou art, Christian Reader, whether the judgments of God in <hi>Adam</hi> should be more dreaded by thee, in which the severity of God imputed unto thee, being not yet born, that which thou hadst not committed, or mercy in Christ the Lord, should be more loved, who, tothee, not working, but believing in him, that justifies the wicked, imputes the Righteousness thou didst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
                  <p>By which you see, worthy Man, if <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle should be credited, how unworthy of any credit your Doctrine is, whereby you take away the Grace of all Imputation, and leave no Righteousness besides to miserable Sinners, but what every Man purchases by his own good deeds; which how true it is, let us examine by that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which convinces you of a Lye, and a shameful Error by this most evident Argument.</p>

Do you not see that you are tyed on every side with Bonds that are Apostolick and wholly of Adamant? Now what Turning, what Hole to escape at can you find? Christ is made sin for us. Wherefore? That we might be made the Righteousness of God by him, saith the Apostle: Will you deny it? I suppose you will not: What way then was he made sin? Will you say by committing it? No, By Imputation then? Certainly it is so: Right indeed; What if he who knew no sin, is made a sinner before God, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the sin of another? What, and shall not we who are by nature unrighteous, in like manner be made Righteous before God by the same dispensation of mercy and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What can hinder but that as the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of one was imputed to us all to destruction, after the same manner the obedience of one may be imputed to us all for Salvation? Let your Wisdom consider what you should answer in this case, not only to me, but also to <hi>Paul.</hi> But now, that this may be more clear, first, you see this common and fatal necessitv of Dying, whereunto all mortal men are liable: which with the same Foot beats at the Gates of Kings Palaces, and at the Doors of Poor mens Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Now I would know of you. whence this cause and necessity of dying had its first original, and began to make havock? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through our fault, or the fault of another?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95561:72"/>
You will say, not through our fault. What if Death had snatched your self away in your Infancy, you had then deserved nothing your self: And yet was you not then born on that condition that you could dye? Verily many Infants and Innocents are dayly snatched away, who deserved nothing themselves, yet they were born on those very <note place="margin">Death took its beginning of making havock from the Sin of one, not of many.</note> Terms that they were Mortal and lyable to dye at some time. Why so I beseech you? Unless it be because they proceed from him, the Transgression of which one Man was imputed to all, to suffer the punishment of Death; so that that <note place="margin">The heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Iustice was again made amends for, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-balanced by as great mercy. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> is cause sufficient why you should dye, because you are propagated from him, who deserved Death; you will say by a hard enough Law. I also would fay the same with you, unless the same Iustice of the Eternal Deity had opposed an equal remedy to this great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, making amends for, and alfo over-balancing just severity with a like kind of mercy. You will say, what way? That way which St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in this place, he that knew no Sin, saith he, was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God through him. What is that, I pray you, to be made sin for us, but to undergo what was due to our Sins? Which if the most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father condescended to Translate unto his only begotten Son, not for any demerit of his,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95561:73"/>
but for our sakes only. Verily it cannot be, neither is it agreeable to the Iustice of God, nor to reason neither, that he should punish both his own Son, and us also for our Sins; so that one of those two must needs follow, that if Christ hath made satisfaction for us, either Iustice hath nothing now in us, that it may accuse us of: Or if it have, it is false then, which is mentioned in this place by <hi>Paul:</hi> Christ was made Sin for us; and that is false, which we hear in the Prophet. And he shall bear their iniquities, &amp;c. For how did he bear them, if they remain <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53.</note> yet tobe born by us? Whence the Apostle concluding very well, he reasons to this purpose: That we might be made, saith he, the Righteousness of God through him, as if he had said; as Christ did bear our Sins, so also we do bear his Righteousness. He was punished not for his own Sins, but ours; in like manner we are endued with Righteousness, which is not ours but his.</p>
                  <p>In which thing the admirable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice <note place="margin">The Blood of Redemption encountering with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, yet not violating Righteousness but Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> of our Redemption is seen: Where Mercy encountering with Iustice doth so contend that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes also, and yet so overcomes, that in the mean while there is not made any violation of Iustice, but a just recompence for sins. For as unjust as it is, that he, who was free from sin, should suffer the punishment of sin for the guilty; It is again as unjust, that our sins already expiated in him for us, should again
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95561:73"/>
be punished in us by the judgment of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And upon a different account how just it was, that the sin of one, who sustained the person of all nature, should be propagated unto all that came of him, and should be given to publick condemnation: Again, it is as agreeable to Iustice, that the obedience of one man, who undertook the cause and person of all men, should be likewise communicated to all rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of him, to the imputation of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>But you on the contrary plead, that it seems not to be just at all, that any man should seem just by another mans righteousness, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous himself. I answer to the contrary, and thus I plead; neither <note place="margin">An Answer.</note> was it just that Christ being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> into the condemnation of Death, who was in himself free of all spots; You object to me the definite nature of Iustice: Which because it is a vertue, giving to every man according to his desert, therefore you argue that it cannot be, but it must measure unto all men by equal right, whatsoever is due to their merits: Be it so, and why then doth not this same justice, my good friend, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Christ the Son of God according to his deserving? Why is the innocent beaten with stripes? Why is he torn unjustly with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments? wherefore contrary to his deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contrary to Right and Iustice is he drawn to the judgment of Death, and being innocent, is stretched forth upon the Cross? What can you answer me in this case? What say you?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95561:74"/>
What have you, whereby you may defend this distributive Iustice? What will Iustice it self bring for it self, which is the most exact and perfect of all things, so often proclaimed by you, and in so many books; Which it may probably make a pretence for the receiving of so great an injury? Except that it may say this only: That we, and the sins of us all, came under punishment in this one most innocent body of his, and there were with deserved punishments most justly recompensed by God.</p>
                  <p>Which unless it were so, Iustice <note place="margin">The singular providence of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God in governing the business of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> it self had sinned against him most unjustly. Now the singular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Most High Artist hath governed the matter with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that he did both wisely look to the glory of his own Son, and our Salvation, and also to his own justice, so that there is nothing wherein his Iustice may be accused, neither is any thing found in us, in which the very Law of Iustice may justly <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> condemn us: Whence it is rightly said by the Apostle, that there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>For otherwise, to what purpose did Christ dye, if he died not for sins and sinners? or how did he dye for sins, if the punishment of sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be suffered again by us? How was he made sin and a curse for us, if we yet fall under the Curse? Or what fruit will redound to us from this most Holy Sacrifice, if Christ by the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95561:74"/>
right of Redemption hath not taken away that which is due to our sins by the Law <note place="margin">Christ Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Sinners, but what Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</note> of Iustice? But if he took it away, where is then the condemnation due to Sinners? I speak of those Sinners, who being turned from their sins by serious Repentance, fly to Christ by Faith. But methinks I do already hear what your Divinity in this case will mutter against us: you will not deny that Christ died for us, and that our righteousness is placed in him, <hi>but yet so, that these benefits of his, and rewards of justice, come not to us by Faith, nor by imputation, but by the study of Works and Holiness, which being given to the Merits of Christ, we receive in this Life by the free gift of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Oso. dejust. lib. 7.</note> that we who were of old, shut up in darkness; And even extinct by the strength of death, now we do escape the tyranny of Death, that we do now recover the gifts of divine righteousness formerly lost and slipt out of our hands: and that we obtain the reward of life proposed to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, all that consists in this, that we should wholly abdicate and forsake whatsoever we have from our first Father, and transfer our selves wholly to the similitude and imitation of our second Father, and so it will come to pass that we shall purchase immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and divine riches, and eternal glory and true righteousness, with everlasting praise, not by our merits, but only by the vertue of Christ,</hi> Who works all these things <hi>in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:95561:75"/>
                  <p>Therefore according to this sort <note place="margin">The whole nature of our Salvation consists in nothing else but in the imitation of Christ, and expressing a resemblance of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Osorius.</hi>
                     </note> of Divinity the merits of Christ do nothing else in Heaven, but that they obtain unto us Divine Grace, whereby we may by way of imitation more easily resemble the most holy footsteps, and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Christ our second Father, and lead our lives well in this World according to his Laws. But now what if we cannot exactly follow the footsteps of his holiness? What if imitation falter sometimes and stagger? What if the servency of charity, and the care of our most holy Religion, and the observance of Iustice becomes too remiss? Yea, what if somewhere a defilement of sin creeps in, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity may occasion? Or, what if, that I may use the words of <hi>Hierom,</hi> he that rows a Boat against the stream, slacken his hands a little, doth he not presently slide back, and is carried by the stream whither he would not? and who is not remiss sometimes? Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> also confesses that he is sometimes drawn thither whither he would not: And then where is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which was hoped for by Works? where is the immortality proposed to vertue? Verily unless the greater mercy of our most gracious Father, had so taken care for us, that our whole Salvation should be laid up in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his Son, and if faith and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not help us more than imitation of life, our condition had stood on a miserable enough, and too broken foundation. But
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95561:75"/>
eternal thanks be to Almighty God the Father of all mercies, who, according to his unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wisdom, which reaches from end to end strongly, and disposes all things sweetly, hath not settled our estate by any law of works, but by faith, that according to Grace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise may be sure to all the Seed, that though we our selves are weak, and void of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, yet it is sufficient, that there is one in our Nature which hath fulfilled all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that he only is righteous for all. How, say you, for all? Why not, as well as the unrighteousness of one <hi>Adam</hi> of old was sufficient to bring ruine upon all? Therefore let us behold Christ in <hi>Adam,</hi> and compare the one with the other. Who, though they are very unlike to one another, yet agree in this, that both being First Fathers of Propagation, by an equal similitude something came from both as Progenitors, which hath spread abroad upon all Men. To wit, Death and Life; Sin, and justice. Therefore one <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Christ and <hi>Adam</hi> agrees.</note> Man destroyed all Men: And in like manner one Man saves all Men; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you your self deny this. But let us see how the one destroys, and how the other saves those that <note place="margin">Death and Sin from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note> are destroyed: <hi>Through his fault, say you, not our own, we contracted the pollution of Sin in our Birth,</hi>

                     </note> these are your very words. Which, as I entertain willingly, so if they are true, and if he in this respect was a Type of Christ, which is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95561:76"/>
shewed out of <hi>Paul,</hi> what hinders but that we also in like manner in Regeneration may obtain the reward of Righteousness, not for our own Obedience, but his? The one sinned, and by his wickedness ruinated all Men; the other obeyed, and by his righteousness saves all. You say, it is true, if so be we lead our Life well according to the Imitation and Example of him. And where then is the agreement of similitude between Christ and <hi>Adam?</hi> if the one destroyed us in our being Born, as you your self confess, but Christ cannot save us in our Regeneration, except Imitation be joyned. And where now is the Grace of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and the Imputation of Faith unto Righteousness, so oft repeated in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, taught by the Apostles, testified by the most Ancient Fathers, received and delivered by the Church? Shall it be sufficient cause to inflict Death upon thy Body that thou wast propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> and shall it not have cause enough for the justification of thy Soul, that thou art born again in Christ? What say you? Do none dye, but they that Sin after the Example of <hi>Adam?</hi> Are none saved but those that by a due imitation attain unto the most Holy Vertues of Christ? And what then doth Baptism, the <note place="margin">Only by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Adam,</hi> we perish: And why are we not as well saved by being born again from Christ?</note> Sacrament of Faith in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Salvation is purchased by no other thing but by treading in the Footsteps of Christ?</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95561:77"/>
Father; I think it is unknown to no Man. Whose acts for us if we consider, what is more excellent? If the greatness of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, what more Divine? If his Life it self every way perfect with all purity of the greatest Vertues, what more admirable? Unto whose example, as the most perfect rule for imitation, seeing you invite us so earnestly; I must needs both willingly approve of your Piety therein, and also give you thanks upon this account for your diligence. And so much the more, upon the account that the unhappy calamity of these times does so greatly need such incitements, which I know not by what means, having obliterated the footsteps of the Heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> seem to have degenerated again unto the Earthly Father, with a perfect conspiracy. Wherefore, I could the rather with to these manners and times, that those things which are very well discoursed of by you, concerning following the Example of Christ, concerning the resembling of his Death, concerning imitating his Divine Life; may pierce not only the Ears of Men, but also the most inward parts of their minds. For what is more solid for Advice, or more seasonable for the Time, than that which you so much enlarge upon, with a plentiful am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of Words; that every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power should propose unto himself Christ the chiefest Example of all Vertue, and Master of Life, for Imitation and Resemblance: That having rooted out the filth and relicks of the Old Nature;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95561:77"/>
                  <hi>He may drive away very far from him with a resolved and magnanimous Spirit all Taints of impurity:</hi> And because, <note place="margin">The imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all.</note> as you say, we cannot be in the middle between the two, therefore it remains, that having forsaken the party of the body, we should so fight under the banner of Christ our Prince, we should so subdue the body it self, by the power of his saving Crosi; all rebellion of the body should so be overcome in us, that this unbridled lust, which maintains ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting enmity against God, may at length yield to his command; and that we may not lessen any endeavour, or labour howsoever great in this most holy observance of Iustice, and imitation of Christ.</p>
               <p>As these things are proposed by you, most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Osorius,</hi> no less Holily than Eloquently; so I would that in like manner your Rhetorick might make a suitable Harmony concerning the Imitation of Christ, in the Ears of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops and Cardinals: That these Men, having abdicated the perishing and transitory Wealth of this World, with which they overflow beyond all measure of their own profession, and also above royal magnificence, may at length think of the poverty of Christ, that they may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish their Possessions, and large Inheritances heaped together, their Diadems, and their other regalities; I say, not according to the example of the Ancient Philosophers, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the contentation of the most Holy Apostles; that seriously rejecting the luxury, and superfluity of this Life, their vain glory,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95561:78"/>
their needless vanities and trifles may at length cease to be conform to the wicked fashions of this World: And that laying aside all haughtiness and pride of Life, they may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to the humility of Christ, and restrain and compose the exorbitancy of their Minds and Spirits: And laying down this Popish Cruelty and Tyranny, learn to become meek of Christ, that most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pattern of meekness, Learn, saith he, of me, because I am meek <note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> and lowly of Spirit. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that those <hi>Roman</hi> Priests should wash the Feet of the Poor according to the example of Christ, but that they should not embrue their cruel Hands in the Blood of their Brethren; neither do I require that they should give Water to refresh the Disciples of Christ, but that they should not heap up Flames and Faggots to burn their Bodies, nor lay Snares for them, or devise to entrap them privily, design their ruine and destruction, furnish Darts and Weapons to slay them, for whom Christ was Sacrificed, and by whom they themselves were never hurt.</p>
               <p>If Example should be taken from Christ, I pray you, what doth the Divine Father and Creator commend more unto us? what else doth his whole life breath but mutual Charity, both towards Friends, and also towards Enemies? Who not only doth not break the shaken and bruised Reed, but upon the Cross <note place="margin">Charitv the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.</note> prays for his very Crucifiers.</p>
               <p>Therefore we have an example singularly excellent, which we may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95561:78"/>
imitate. We have also together with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a commendation by the mouth of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, by whom Charity is called the bond of perfection. Moreover there is not wanting the Preaching of Divines, who in their Books, in their Exercises, in their Sermons, do attribute so much to Charity, that they call It the form, the perfection, and the very life of faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no other vertue, that can be helpful to Salvation: And now I need not here in many words declare what agreement there is between the Doctrine of those great extollers of Charity, and the practice of their lives; seeing there are so many proofs before our eyes, so many ten thousands of men slain do witness it, and so great abundance of Christian blood shed; there is so great outrage of Persecution every where; there is nothing safe from slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fury, tumult, snares, contentions, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, articles of Inquisition, bonds, <note place="margin">How no sign of Charity appears in the Roman Tyranny.</note> and imprisonments. In some places the <hi>Turk</hi> makes havock with the Sword, and elsewhere with flames and smoak. And the Fathers of the Roman Court exercise Cruelty. First, they make Laws written with blood, which afterwards they commit to Political Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs to be promulgated, and to the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to be executed by Law. On <note place="margin">The Laws of the <hi>Popes</hi> are written with blood.</note> the sudden, Citizens of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and Learned Ministers are violently haled to examinations, and afterwards to death, if any Man dare but open his mouth against the manifest
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95561:79"/>
abuses of errours, they spare neither Age, nor Sex, nor Condition. Thus (forsooth) those perfect Roman Catholick Nobles imitate the Charity of Christ, so they follow his Divine Life, so they resemble his death, so they shew forth his meekness, so they bear the Image of the Divine Father, so they wholly and more than wholly form and fashion themselves from the imitation of the earthly Father, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Heavenly. Who justly deserve to hear from the Lord: ye are those that justifie your selves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is of high account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, is abominable before God. What if the most Holy <hi>Popes,</hi> and purple Cardinals, those Chiefest Dignitaries of the Church, with all this your Order of Bishops, and the most strict Orders of Monks, who by Place, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Profession seem to approach nearest unto Christ, and to supply his place upon earth, differ so much from him, what cause is there why we should hope better of the whole body of the common people, or that any Man should promise himself Salvation in following the footsteps of Christ? but (God willing) I shall elsewhere make enquity into this just matter of complaint.</p>
               <p>Now let us return to you, <hi>Osorius,</hi> whose so godly and eloquent exhortations about putting on and imitating Christ, I am so far from slighting, that I desire they may remain most firmly fixed in the minds of men; for as nothing appears in the most holy manners of Christ, which is not very worthy of imitation; so no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95561:79"/>
part of duty seems more agreeable to every Christian, than that all of us should endeavour with all our might to resemble the image pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto us; especially seeing <hi>Paul</hi> so gravely, and that in more places than one, calls us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, who making a Comparison of both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> declares what we received of both. By Man, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> saith he, came death, and by Man came the Resurrection from the dead. And presently after, proceeding on that matter, the first Man was of the earth earthly, the second Man is the Lord from Heaven. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concluding with words to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and exhorting us to imitate the example of his obedience, he subjoyns; as we have born, saith he, the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly. And the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> not differing much from <hi>Paul,</hi> proposes Christ for an Example of all long suffering; for, saith he, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> Christ also suffered for us, giving us an Example, that ye should follow his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, who did no sin, who when he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reviled not again, when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed all judgment to his Father, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that you contend so earnestly with the Blessed Apostles for following the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Christ, herein we do very willingly both hear you, and assent unto you. But that you place all the dignity of our Salvation in this, that you refer all the promises of God to this one head, as if there were no cause of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95561:80"/>
but that which is placed only in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and instructions of Life, herein your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course seems to pass far beyond the bounds of sound and Apostolick Doctrine.</p>
               <p>For though it is a thing of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that we should frame all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and Offices of Life to <note place="margin">The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God are not tyed to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ofChrist, but to Faith.</note> the imitation of him; yet Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not therefore promised, because our actions agree to this rule of Righteousness, neither is the title of Righteousness given us, because we live vertuously, but because he was made Righteousness for us: For we do not become just before God by imitation, but by Regeneration. As of Old, not through our fault, but <hi>Adams,</hi> not by Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but by Birth and Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the pollution of his Sin <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the First and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> was imputed to us unto Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So by vertue of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> not by any power of our own, by being born again, not by imitating, is Righteousness imputed to us unto the Iustification of Life: Neither doth it therefore follow, that the examples of Christ are not proposed to us for Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95561:80"/>
               <p>It is one thing to reason from causes to effects, another thing to reason from effects to causes. What if the cause is enquired into, that makes us righteous before God? <hi>Paul</hi> will answer, That Christ is the <note place="margin">Christ the external cause of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Faith in Christ the Internal. Effects, causes.</note> external cause, who was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God through him: But the Internal is our Faith in Christ; which is imputed to them that believe, forRighteousness.</p>
               <p>But if you ask, what are the the effects of this cause? Who knows not that they are the Fruits of Pious Works, and this very imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, which you so greatly (yea and so deservedly cry up and) extol? For who can rightly call himself a Christian, as you say very well, who doth not apply his mind as much as he can. to separate himself from all society of the Earthly Father, and frame and conform himself wholly to the example of the Heavenly: I grant this, to be very true, as indeed it is. For, I do not disallow of that which you do rightly assume, but I confute that, which you would falsly gather from hence. For thus you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; <hi>To wit, that the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De just. lib. 7. pag. 186.</note> 
                  <hi>of our Salvation is placed in this, that by our Pious Labour and Industry, we should purchase the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God for our selves: That they, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Faith only is sufficient for Salvation, are mad, and singularly serviceable to the Old Serpent; and that every action we undertake, is wholly</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95561:81"/>
                  <hi>unprofitable, if Faith only is sufficient.</hi> This is the summ of the Epilogue of this whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of yours. In which, what do you else, but by an unskilful huddle of things, and without order in disputing, turn causes into effects, and again effects into causes? What? when the Apostle Admonishes that Wives should be subject to their <note place="margin">An argument from like things.</note> Husbands, and acknowledge their Authority, as the Church is subject to Christ her Husband, shall she therefore, that is by a Lawful Covenant Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to her Husband, not be a Wife before there is added a testimony of due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
               <p>So Children, born of Creditable Parents, use to resemble them not only in the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Bodies, but also in the likeness of their Manners, of whom they are begotten: What, if in some part their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance fails? What if their <note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> manners are dissolute? What if they have such a Son as the parable of the Gospel represents to us: Who leaving his Father, doth no part of his duty, shall he therefore cease to be a Son? Or, shall any Man by the merits of his Life attain to be a Son, who is by nature a Servant?</p>
               <p>You may say, to what purpose are these things? That by these examples you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that effects depend on causes, and causes are not governed by effects. An honest Matron, carries with that subjection to her Husband that becomes her, and he on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95561:81"/>
performs his duty in cherishing his Wife. These things follow the Conjugal bond, but they do not make it; just so it is in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual descent, which, like another nature, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates us to Christ, and transforms us as new Creatures into the Sons of God. Of which thing, if the cause be enquired, not Works, not Hope. not Charity, but only Faith in Christ: Not any Imitation, but Baptism being the Sacrament of <note place="margin">Baptism a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Faith. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.</note> Faith performs it. Concerning which, let us hear <hi>Paul</hi> testifying in very evident Words. All of you, saith he, are the Sons of God through Faith in Christ Iesus. Whosoever of you are Baptized in Christ, have put on Christ. He that walks being Cloathed with Christ, What can be wanting to him, unto all Glory and Beauty of Righteousness? What can any Man desire more for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Eternal Life? What is more bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less than Sublimity? What is more Sublime than Nobility of Birth? What is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the dignity of high degree? Than to be received not only for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Dependents of the <note place="margin">what Faith in Christ performs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Paul. Galas.</hi> 3.</note> Mighty God, who comprehends all things by his Power; but also as Sons. yea, and Heirs? But if you design to be taught how these so many, and so great good things come to us, <hi>Paul</hi> makes Answer: By Faith, saith he, ye are all Sons: If Sons then Heirs according to promise. And if
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95561:82"/>
you ask when that comes to pass, whether after the merits of Works, or before Works; the same <hi>Paul</hi> will teach you: As soon as you are Baptized, saith he, you have put on Christ.</p>
               <p>To which also <hi>Chrysostom</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing, saith, as soon as a Man <note place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> Belives, he is presently also Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Which if it be true, then it is false, which you assert. <hi>For you affirm that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Salvation consists wholly in this, that we should transform our</hi>

                  <hi>selves entirely into the similitude of Christ. And again youn say, there is no other way of Salvation estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for us, but that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law of God.</hi> And the same you affirmed elsewhere, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving openly asserted: <hi>That ascent into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is given to the merits of the greatest Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that the Mansions of the Eternal Kingdom, are given justly and deservedly to Holy and Pure Men. For so, Say you, it comes to pass that the Immortal Kingdom is due by the best right to Iust Men; not only as a recompence and remard, but also as a Lawful Inheritance, being founded upon the Wisdom and Bounty of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which things, as being represented gloriously by you, seem at a distance to have some shew of Truth, if they be referred to that <hi>Platonick</hi> Righteousness of yours, or to the state of our First Innocency. But now in this wounded and destroyed Nature, they have no place at all, but that they may wholly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95561:82"/>
prelude from us all passages into the Eternal Mansions of the Kingdom. I know indeed that the Everlasting reward of Righteousness is due by best right to Pure and Holy Men, as you say, and those that observe the Law unblameably.</p>
               <p>But, I know likewise that the Eternal Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments of Hell are due to those, that do not perform the Royal Law accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures. What would <note place="margin">Iames. 2.</note> you do in this case, good Friend? What good can your <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophy do here? I am not Ignorant, what the Lord said to the Rich <hi>Pharisee:</hi> If <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> you will enter into Life, keep the commands: That indeed is true. Do you then perform what he was commanded to do; Sell all that you have, and give to the Poor, and follow Christ Naked: But if you do it not, what else can you look for, but to perish together with him? But now the goodness of God hath found out another way to consult our Infirmity, who hath not only put upon us the beauty of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but whole Christ, so that you may not only, being Naked, follow Christ, but that whole Christ may live in your self, and Cloath you, and also may make you a Son of God by Faith.</p>
               <p>What then, may some Man say, is not the Holy Spirit given to them that trust in Christ, to Illuminate their minds with new light, to renew their Hearts, to enrich them plentifully with the Riches, Gifts, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments

Therefore when we have the Law of God put into the most inward parts of our mind; it comes to pass, that Lust being subdued, Evil concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence extinguished, the pravity of a stubborn mind taken away, the mind becomes on a sudden, a Temple of the Holy Ghost, and is stirred up with all its might, to the study of the Law of God: And that I may express it in one word, such a Man contains the Magnificence, and Glory of Divine Righteousness comprehended in his mind, And a little after you say; Therefore it is of Faith, Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> that according to Grace, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise may be firm.

               <p>BUT now, because here there is a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entoccasion of speaking concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, it remains that we should hear from you, who treat of these things so sharply, what that is, which God hath promised, to whom he hath promised, how, and for what cause he doth it. Now there are both many and great Gifts of God and Ornaments partly bestowed upon us, and partly promised through the singular bounty of his Grace; yea, seeing there is nothing in this Workmanship of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor in the meanest things, but what we ought to acknowledge to be his free Gift, if we would be thankful: And also amongst all these things, which being so many and so great he hath conferted upon us with so liberal a hand,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95561:84"/>
I esteem that nothing is more glorious nor more admirable, than this large honour of his Kingdom, which the Lord himself promises us in the Gospel. Fear not, saith he, little Flock, for it is the good will of your Father to give you the Kingdom. Which <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">We are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the grace of God for all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and what that is which his singular favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us is ehiefly seen. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.</note> also makes mention of, writing both elsewhere, and also to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians:</hi> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated us unto the Kingdom of his dear Son, &amp;c. Of which also <hi>Daniel,</hi> a most famous Prophet, hath given an ample Testimony; The Kingdom, saith he, and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the largeness of the Kingdoms under the whole Heaven shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the People of the Saints of the most High, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which one benefit, seeing the whole Sum of our Felicity is comprehended; to wit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, remission of Sins, Peace with God, access with boldness, hope, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Romans 5. Romans 4. Titus 3.

For he that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted unto the possession of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what more can be added to him, unto the highest splendour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95561:85"/>
of Glory, and the degree of the most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dignity?</p>
               <p>Therefore we have, as you see, O <hi>Osorius,</hi> the hereditary Mansions of the Eternal Kingdom promised to us, and that not of Works, but of Faith; not according to Bargain, but according to Grace, and therefore according to Grace, that the Promise may be firm and sure to all the Seed.</p>
               <p>It is a very weighty Cause, and Authority not to be contemned: For what is more firm for all manner of security, than that which relies on the certain faithfulness of God, and a free promise? On the contrary, what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable than that which depends on the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain condition of our Works, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the most part evil, or always uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Why then wilt thou cast us again out of the most firm safeguard of most sure confidence proposed to us, which rests most safely in the free bounty of God promising, as if thou dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest us out of a Haven of Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity procured for us, to be tossed in <note place="margin">Theassurance of confidence and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the free promise of God.</note> the tempestuous Waters and Straits of Diffidence and Desperation? And do you make those things doubtful and uncertain, which through the bounty of God, we do as it were hold in our hands with a most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Faith, so that now there is not any thing certain which a man may satisfie his own Soul about touching Salvation? for, I pray you, what can be certain, if so be the Grace of the Promise being taken away, if Imputation of Righteousness being neglected, which is placed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95561:85"/>
in Christ for us, the whole matter is brought to the account of our actions? and you plead that we are not otherways righteous before God, than by performing the Offices of the Divine Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> But (<hi>you will say</hi>) What, hath not God promised in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As touching the promise of the Spirit of God, it is very true, what you cite out of <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> For God in his bounty hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he will write his Law not only in Tables of Stone, as before, but in the inward Tables of their minds, and indeed accordingly he hath performed, and doth perform daily what he hath promised. And what doth your Logical reasoning gather <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 233.</note> thence?</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>say you,</hi> seeing we have the Law of God put into our inward <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. p. 232. Two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes of <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> both of which are false.</note> parts, it comes to pass, that giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the promises of God, we do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently obtain the help of God, that we may very easily do all things that are commanded us, and so be saved, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95561:86"/>
               <p>Therefore by these many things, which have been hitherto mentioned by you concerning the Law and its Office, I perceive you have two Opinions, both of which are false. First, That you affirm that we being supported by the Grace of God, and guarded by his help, can very easily perform all things, whatsoever are commanded by the Law of God. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you plead that all the nature of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Salvation consists in performing God's Commands; and that there is no other way to Heaven but that which is contained in the Law of God: Both which Reasons of yours, how absurd they are, how contrary to the Grace of God and the Gospel, and how much disallowed and confuted, not only by all Authority of Divine Scripture, but also long since contradicted by the sayings of the most Antient Fathers, and how void of all support of reason and experience, there is no Man that hath so little Reason or Religion, but evidently perceives it, and clearly takes notice of it. For, though we do not deny that by the help of the grace of the Divine Spirit there are wonderful, various, and manifold effects produced, and great gifts are shed abroad in the minds of the Regenerate, for governing all parts of Life piously and holily; but whence, I pray you, will you teach that so great strength, and so great power to observe Righteousness is given by God, and committed unto mortal Man, which may be sufficient for performing all things that are prescribed in the most holy Law of God?</p>

                  <hi>You proceed to press again and again that Antient Song out of the Prophet;</hi> I will put, <hi>saith he,</hi> my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: <hi>And also out of the other Prophet;</hi> And I will give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my Precepts, and keep my Iudgments, and also may do these things, which are just, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I hear the Oracles of the Prophetical Promise, uttered with great evidence, from whence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly works of New Obedience do proceed, which necessarily follow Faith; so that if any Man do now enquire for the cause of good works, presently he learns hence, that it should not be attributed to the strength of Man's Will, but the Gift of the holy Spirit; but now whence does this Gift proceed, but from the Merits of Christ? or to whom is it given, but to them that believe in Christ? For the holy Spirit is received by Faith, according to that of <hi>Paul;</hi> That we may receive the promise of the Spirit by Faith. Wherefore <note place="margin">No man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the works of new Obedience proceed from the fountain of Divine Grace, and the Merits of Christ.</note> seeing Faith is the only thing, which procures unto us the holy Spirit,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95561:87"/>
therefore it cannot otherways be, but that having received the Divine Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a new Life, and spiritual motions do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the hearts of the Regenerate. For a mind rightly qualified with the Faith of Christ, and being now reconciled to God, as it cannot be destitute of the favour of God, so being stirred up by his holy breathings, begins now to be a Law to it self, whereby it fears God, and according to its power honours him with due Reverence, cleaves unto him with all its might, refers its actions and counsels to him, calls on him by prayers, adheres to him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, celebrates his benefits with a thankful remembrance, lays its hope and confidence, and its whole self upon him, and also for his sake loves and cherishes all the Brethren.</p>
               <p>And as there is no Man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">Every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man that is truly born again in Christ, is a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or ought so to be. Works of Faith. <hi>Osor. de Iust. lib. 3. p. 71.</hi>
                  </note> these Offices of necessary Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, performed by the help of the Spirit of God are fruits of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instructed Faith: So there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between us and you in that matter, especially seeing you your self also together with us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <hi>That these are not works of the Law, but of Faith, and that they should not be referred so much to the Law, as to the holy Spirit, and Faith relying upon his help, as you say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greatest difference that is between us consists in this; that whereas we assert, That the Obedience of Man born again by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, is but begun and imperfect in this
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95561:87"/>
mortal infirm state: You on the contrary dream of I know not what perfection of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in works, the Spirit of God so working in us, that whosoever is qualified therewith, needs nothing that belongs to compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of righteousness; for all your debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, seems to drive at this, as being concluded with this one Syllogism.</p>

For though God hath promised to his Saints, that the Assisting grace of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall not be wanting, which may help forward pious attempts in his Elect, and stir up their endeavours after more holy obedience; but where hath he at any time promised, or on whom hath he bestowed that happiness in walking, which turns no where to the right hand, nor to the left? which stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not through the whole life? which in all kind of vertues, by a constant perseverance so conforms the course of life to compleat inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that it never fails in any thing? The Adversaries use for the defence of their own cause, to catch at the words, that were just now cited out of <hi>Ierem.</hi> chap. 31. and <note place="margin">Ier. 31. Ezek. 36. Deut. 30.</note>

Another that is perfect, which is compleated in the life to come. It is not difficult to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in what sense the perfection of Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation should be understood in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: To wit, not simply and absolutely, but according to the measure and capacity of this Life. Therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> says well, that a Man is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Aug. de peccat. merit. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. lib. 2. cap. 15. Aug. de peccat. merit. &amp; remis. lib. 1. cap. 7. Aug. ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. lib. 3. cap. 7.</note> called perfect, because he hath profited in a great degree. And the same again. But, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Men are called Saints, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and perfect in the Scriptures, I say to this, that it is a certain manner of perfection, whereby Holy Men acknowledge their own imperfection. They are also called perfect, who in any respect imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the perfection of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, who rains on the Iust and Unjust, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And again the same <hi>Augustine</hi> writing to <hi>Boniface:</hi> The Vertue, saith he, which is now in a Righteous Man, is called perfect upon this account, because it belongs to his perfection, both to acknowledge in Truth, and confess in Humility his own Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95561:89"/>
Moreover, <hi>Hierom</hi> not much differing from him answered wittily: To whom, when that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was objected: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of us are perfect, we understand this: To this <hi>Hierom,</hi> says: What then <note place="margin">Hierom. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. pelag. lib. 1.</note> do we understand, yea, what ought we to understand, that we who are perfect, should acknowledge our selves to be unperfect, and that they have not yet comprehended, nor yet attained unto perfection. This is, saith he, the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Man, to know himself to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that I may so speak, the perfection of all Righteous Men in the Flesh, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, &amp;c. And afterwards again in the same Book.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, we are Righteous <note place="margin">Hierom. ibid. Prover. 18. Hierom. ad Ctesiphontem.</note> then, when we confess our selves to be Sinners For our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness consists not of our own merit, but of the mercy of God, as the Scripture says: The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man is an accuser of himself in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Speech: And again to <hi>Ctesiphon;</hi> This is Mens only perfection, saith he, if they know themselves to be imperfect, &amp;c.

                  <p>This reasoning, as it differs not much from the former, so there <note place="margin">Pelagianism.</note> is implied in it a certain kind of fallacy not unlike it: Which, of what sort it is, if I may with your allowance, <hi>Osorius,</hi> I will declare.

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95561:90"/>
                  <p>First, as if the Question be, by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>August.</hi> of the Perfection of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. By whom Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> whom a Man may attain unto such perfection, that he may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin; He answers, that comes not to pass by the strength of Free Will, but by the Grace of God: And so far there is no debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweeen us, and the opposite party: But if there be enquiry made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time, when such a perfection is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: <hi>Augustine,</hi> speaks expresly, that this comes not to pass in this Life, but in that which is to come. <note place="margin">When Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Aug.</hi> of the Spirit and Letter.</note> And this same <hi>Augustine,</hi> no less oppositely, in another Book dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the mists of this Argument with very evident Words. This precept of Righteousness, saith he, concerning loving the Lord with all the Heart, and with all the Soul. And also; that of loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we shall fulfil in that Life, where we shall see Face to Face: But here some will object, wherefore is it commanded, if it is not fulfilled here? <hi>Augustine</hi> Answers: To wit, That we may be Instructed, what we ought to ask by Faith, and whither to send Hope before; and unto what things, that are before us, we should press forward, not being satisfied with any thing that is behind.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, according to my opinion, saith he, that Man hath made a great progress in this Life, in that Righteousness, which is to be perfected, who by profiting knows how
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95561:90"/>
far he is from the perfection of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What is that? Which wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> he thus reasons <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug ad. Bonifac. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. Begun Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> about Divine Grace: The Grace of God, saith he, gives in this Life, an endeavour to keep the commands, (And here you have the Obedience begun, as we call it) and the same, if any thing is not fully observed in the precepts, Pardons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And so all commands of God are reckoned as performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Imputation of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                     </note> whatsoever is not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is pardoned. By which, as I suppose, you see, that our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in this Life is of such a sort, that it consists rather of the remission of Sins, than the perfection of Vertues, which perfection must be looked for by us in the Life to come.</p>
                  <p>Moreover there is another thing, that must not be paffed by in this place, that the same <hi>Augustine</hi> writing to <hi>Hierom</hi> (in the 29th Epistle,) saith, Charity <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> to Hierom.</note> is a Vertue, whereby that <note place="margin">Epist. 29.</note> which should be beloved, is beloved. This in some is greater, in others lesser, in others none at all. But the fullest that cannot be increased, as long as Man lives here, is in no Man. But as long as it can be increased, verily that which is less, than it ought to be, is faulty; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which default, there is not a just Man
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95561:91"/>
upon the Earth, that doth good, and sinneth not: Because of which default no Man living shall be justified in the sight of God. By reason of which viciousness, if we say that we have not sin we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us, because of which, how much soever we have <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cpprian</hi> cited by <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                     </note> profited, it is necessary for us to say, <hi>For give us our debts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Books of the Antient Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are full of very Authentick Testimonies confirming this Opinion. It is an excellent and grave saying of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> speaking of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; Let no man, saith he, flatter himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of a pure and unspotted heart; that trusting to his own Innocency, he should suppose that his wounds need no medicine; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is written, Who shall glory that he hath a chast heart? or who shall glory that he is clean from sins? But if no Man can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sins, whosoever shall call himself unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is either a proud man, or a fool &amp;c. For this, saith <hi>Hierom,</hi> shall every one that is godly pray unto thee; if he <note place="margin">Hierom. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Pelagi.</note> is godly, how doth he pray for pardon of iniquity? if he hath ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, how is he called holy?</p>
                  <p>There is not so great a Harmony found in any one man, saith <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that the Law, which is in the Members <note place="margin">Ambros. lib. 10.Epist. 84. Aug. lib. 10. Epist. 84.</note> doth not oppose the Law of the mind Therefore that which the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> said, is true of all Saints in the general. If we say
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95561:91"/>
that we have no sin, we deceive <note place="margin">Bernard super Cantic. Serm. 50.</note> our selves, and the truth is not in us. I may also add that of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> which is very agreeable to this matter.</p>
                  <p>Who dare arrogate to himself, saith he, that which <hi>Paul</hi> himself confesses he had not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto? Indeed he that gave the command was not ignorant, that the weight thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the strength of men; but he judged it useful, that by this very thing they should be convinced of their own insufficiency, and that they should know what end of <note place="margin">Why God commanded things impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</note> Righteousness they should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with all their might to attain unto. Therefore by commanding things impossible, he did not make men transgressors, but humble, that every mouth might be stopped, and all the World might lie under the Iudgment of God.</p>
                  <p>I can bring innumerable Testimonies of the like sort out of well approved Authors. But why do I take up my time in rehearsing the Names of Men, or reckoning their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? when, that I may speak it in one word, all the Antiquity of former Ages, the publick consent of the former Church, and the choicest Writers out of all Eldest Time, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ever rejected the Antient Pelagianism; all those with one mouth agree in this matter against you, That there is no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity <note place="margin">Hieron.

Where are the Mansions of the Everlasting Kingdom, which you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert are justly and deservedly given to <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> holy and pure men? Where is also that Immortal Kingdom, which you conclude is due by best right, not only as a Recompence and Reward, but also as a Legal Patrimony founded by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and bounty of the Father?</hi> What if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Discipline, there is no other way laid open to Salvation, but by keeping the Commandments; and if according to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Bernard,</hi> the Law is of such a weight, that it wholly exceeds humane strength, (which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95561:92"/>
was just now shewed) what hope of Salvation does there now remain for us?</p>
                  <p>Verily, say you, if any man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Osor. de Iust. lib. 9. p. 131, 132.</note> his own strength, in so great a frailty of humane strength, it will be most difficult to attain unto a divine state of righteousness; but if you consider in your mind the divine riches, which, if you will, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be present with you, nothing is more easie. Hence, as <hi>Moses</hi> says, this Commandment, which I command thee this day, is not above thee, nor far off, nor placed in Heaven, that thou shouldest say, who of us can ascend into Heaven? Neither is it placed beyond the Sea, that thou shouldest say, who will pass over the Sea. Neither do you bear it now engraven on stones, but engraven upon the heart by Faith. <hi>For if we believe</hi> the Promises of God, we presently obtain the help of God, that we may very easily perform all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, and so be saved.</p>
                  <p>Must we be thus saved, O <hi>Osorius,</hi> in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Commands? is this your harangue, and think you this so easie to be performed? <hi>Why not, say you, when the Spirit of God helps?</hi> How little does this Saying differ from that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient one of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which <hi>Augustine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearses in a certain place, writing against <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> for thus they said. By an easie endeavour after holiness, which God helps, a Man may be without <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>cont.</hi> Iulian <hi>Pelagia</hi> l. 4. c. 3.</note> sins. But let us hear <hi>Augustine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, both them and you: We deny not, saith he, that the help
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95561:93"/>
of God is so powerful, if he will, that at this day we might have no evil concupisences, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which we should fight, though with the greatest certainty of Conquest. And yet you your self deny not, that it doth not so come to pass, but why it comes not to pass, who hath known the mind of the Lord? Yet I know not a little, when I know, whatsoever that cause is, that it is not the iniquity of a just God, nor the insufficiency of an <note place="margin">A hidden counsel of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding those things which cannot be done by us.</note> Almighty God. Therefore there is something in his deep and hidden Counsel, why as long as we live in this mortal flesh, there is something in us, against which our mind should fight: There is also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing why we should say, forgive us our sins; and a little after, that Man understands these things who being hunger-bitten, returns to himself, and says, I will arise and go to my Father, and presently he subjoyns, therefore it comes to pass in this place of infirmity, that we should not live proudly, and that we should live under the daily remission of sins: But whether that be the cause, or another; which I am much more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, yet that which I cannot doubt is, how much soever we get forward under this burthen of a corruptible body, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, &amp;c. This he said, but why should I urge you with humane Authority, seeing the matter it self carries against you with a very strong voice, and the whole Scripture gives this honour only to Christ, and the Universal experience and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95561:93"/>
example of Men, and the practice of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your very own retired Sense, the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Witnesses of your Conscience, do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish a manifest Testimony against you? <hi>You say, we presently obtain the help of God, <note place="margin">De just, lib. 9. pag. 231.</note> whereby we may most easily perform all things, that are commanded us,</hi> &amp;c. Is it so? all things? what then if I ask you of that first Command of Love, which you owe to the Lord your God with all your heart, and all the endeavour of your mind? or of that, whereby you are commanded not to covet at all? do you perform it? I know what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction the talkative Schools of the Sophisters use here, according to the substance of the act, and according to the intention of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. But I do not value these Fables of subtleties. We know this by the <note place="margin">A Sophistical Distinction.</note> writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Law is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, we are Carnal and sold under sin. I ask if thou thy self being compassed about now with this frailty of the flesh, dost fulfill this Spiritual Law of God, with that sincerity of Spirit that thou oughtest? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer ingenuously, are you silent? <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> What I my self do by my own strength, say you, I do not dispute here, yet I can by the help of the grace of God. O cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning device: After all your debate it comes to this, that you plead the commands of God are easie, and you would have nothing appointed by him, which cannot be observed by us. Now after a most heavy dream (that I may speak with <hi>Hierom</hi>) to deceive ignorant Souls, you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95561:94"/>
in vain endeavour to add, (not without grace.) But I enquire not what the Almighty Grace of God can do of it self, but what it does in you, or in any other mortal Man? You make the Precepts of Righteousness easie, which when the Divine Grace assists, do not exceed our best endeavour; and yet you cannot produce one Man that hath fulfilled them all. Now what an Argument is that, that <note place="margin">It is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what grace can do, but what it doth.</note> a thing can be which hath not been? that that can be done, which you bear witness none hath done; and to attribute that to I know not whom, which you cannot prove to have been in the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle himself complains of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory rebellion of his Members, who was not able to do the good which he desired, crying out that he was both carnal and miserable, and captive. <hi>Augustine</hi> testifies that sins may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished in this life, but that they cease not until death. And the same <hi>Augustine</hi> writing to <hi>Petrus</hi> concerning holy and righteous Men, bids him hold that most firmly, that righteous and holy men themselves, except Infants that are Baptized, none of <note place="margin">Hierom <hi>to</hi> Ctesiphom.</note> them all do live without sin in this World. And do you think that all the roots of Unrighteousness are so plucked up in the Saints, that you can say, it is most easie by the help of God, which is never wanting to them that desire to pass the life without sin, and so obtain Salvation?</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:95561:94"/>
                  <p>But <hi>Hieron</hi> is of a far different <note place="margin">Hieron. contra Pelag. Dial. I.</note> Opinion; for I judge, saith he, thus: That no Creature can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, according to true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteousness: That one differs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that there are divers righteousnesses in Man, no Man doubts; and that one is greater or lesser than another; and that according to their state or measure they may be called just, who in comparison of others are not just. Briefly, that there is none <note place="margin">I <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> of the Saints, nor Prophets, nor Apostles, that possess'd all Vertues; for now we Prophesie in part, and we know in part: for all things cannot be in any one Man. And to <hi>Ctesiphon.</hi> This should be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him only, concerning <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>ad</hi>
                     </note> whom it is written as peculiar to him, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth. Wherefore that I may bespeak you with <hi>Hierom,</hi> and in the same words. <hi>Hierom,</hi> if you would have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to you with Christ, that you can be without fin, what do you leave him, that is peculiar to him? But if not, what remains then, but that those high Mountains of righteousness with which you are so puffed up, should not only fall, but also vanish into smoke?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You proceed yet, seeking as it were a knot in a rush, which yet is broke through with no difficult wedge.</hi> You ask to what purpose the Law was prescribed by <note place="margin">Osor. <hi>de just.</hi> lib. 8. page 197.</note> God with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

What then, <hi>say you,</hi> did God make a jest of the Law? did he mock Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <note place="margin">Page 168.</note> commanding them to do those things, which they could by no means perform? <hi>and then concluding the matter with a merry Sarcasm,</hi> you cry, O what a jesting God, if to mock Mankind he hath bestowed so much pains in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and instructing that Generation, which you say is just as if a Man should bid one that is a Cripple, run a Race, <hi>or one that is blind, view things exactly, that are done afar off.

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>To the major, I Answer two ways: First, That it holds indeed in these Laws, which are given only for this end, that they may be exactly fulfilled by the Subjects, that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation might be obtained by the same act of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But now, though God willed this very much, that his Laws should be performed most exactly by all, yet besides this end, there are other, both many and weighty causes, why the Law, which is a rule of perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, though it could not be kept by us in respect of perfect Obedience, yet it was necessary that it should be promulagated, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there might be a publick Testimony of the Iudgment, and Anger of God against Sin, or that we our selves might be brought more easily to the knowledge of our Sins and Frailty. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The end and Scope of the Promulgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> which <hi>Paul</hi> said, when the Law came, Sin revived: Or that taking notice of the frailty of corrupted and ruinated Nature, being more strongly driven by this necessity; we might be pressed forward, as by the Ferula of a Pedagogue to Christ, who is the end of the Law, as also the Law is called a Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95561:96"/>
to Christ: Or that we may be taught, as it were by this same Pedagogy, whither we must go: That if we cannot attain unto a full obedience of the Law, yet we may profit in the Inchoation of obedience as much as we can.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore seeing there are so many and so great causes of making a Law, it appears evident enough from hence, that there is no cause why the Law should seem to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon us by God in vain: And yet it doth not therefore follow, because the Law of God, after the fall, is impossible to Human Nature, as to the compleat obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that therefore it is unprofirable, seeing the same hath advantages so remarkable. Therefore the major of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument implies a fallacy: Which <note place="margin">A fallacy from that which is not a cause, as if it were a cause.</note> by the Logicians is called Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form that which is not a cause, as if it were a cause. But let us proceed to the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in your arguments, which are not reasons, but deceits and fallacies; For so you argue against <hi>Luther,</hi> whom you bring forth most unjustly, as a certain most bitter Adversary of Eternal Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>What is more contrary to Iustice and Equity, say you, than that one should be punished upon that account, because he hath not performed those things which he could by no means so much as begin? <hi>I hear you; and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Oson. de just. lib. 8. pag. 8.</note> You proceed also to represent the matter as it were before the Eyes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95561:96"/>

                  <p>Then if the same Lord afterwards returning, should whip and torture the same Servant, who could by no means free himself from the bonds, because he had not performed his command; should we suppose that Man, who is so cruel to his Servant, to be a Man, or rather a cruel Beast, hid under the shape of a Man, &amp;c?</p>

But when this weakness was not at first created with Nature it self, but crept in some other way against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Sin, we must therefore see not only what this corrupted Nature now can do, or cannot do, but also what it ought simply to do: Therefore I answer to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, <note place="margin">An Answer to the <hi>Major.</hi>
                     </note> and freely own that punishment is not unjustly inflicted for those things, which there is no cause but they might have been observed, either in regard of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver himself, or in the nature of the things themselves, but only by reason of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Subjects themselves, an impotency contracted through their own default; as if a

Now if in performing the Commands the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador wants ability, is there cause why this impotency should be imputed to the Prince, and not rather to the Ambassador, who depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself of his own soundness?

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that representation which is brought in by you of a Servant in Bonds, is nothing to the purpose, unless you likewise prove this, that this impediment was cast upon him, not thro' any fault or cause in himself; which seeing it cannot be denied by you, what cruelty should there be reckoned to be in it, if a Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire just punishment to be inflicted on a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that is corrupt and flagitious? Yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold rather singular Clemency in the Lord, who is so far from inflicting upon the Servant the punishment which he deserved, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him into favour without any merit; yea moreover, exposes his dearly beloved Son to undergo punishment for the Servant?

                  <p>If you understand it of the perfect help of of Grace, which is hindered by no difficulties, but that the infirmity of Nature may be taken away; so the <hi>Major</hi> is true, but the <hi>Minor</hi> false. For though I confess that the Riches of Divine Grace are infinite, and that the Gifts are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95561:99"/>
excellent, which God bestows upon his own, yet this grace of God doth not so perfect any man in this Life, but that oft in small things we offend all, and pray daily, that our debts <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iames</hi> 2. Hieron. contraI Pelag. Dial. 3.</note> may be forgiven us. Yea, what is all the discourse of the Saints to God but a continual praying and deprecating, as <hi>Hierom</hi> witnesses, whereby it extorts the Clemency of the Creatour, that we who cannot be saved by our own strength, may be saved by his Mercy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there is also heard <note place="margin">Psalm 32.</note> a Mystical Song of the Psalm. For this, saith he, shall every Saint pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found. Whence <hi>Hierom</hi> infers not without reason. If he is a Saint, saith he, how doth he pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin? If he hath iniquity, upon what account is he called holy? to wit, after that manner whereby it is elsewhere <note place="margin">Proverbs 24. Proverbs 28. My strength is perfected in weakness. 2 Cor. 12. 1 Cor. 12.</note> said, A just man falleth seven times a day, and riseth up again. And again, A just man is an accuser of himself in the beginning of his speech, &amp;c. Therefore the Grace of God helps our infirmities, that they may be diminished: But we deny that he so helps them, that they are wholly taken away. It helps indeed infirmities, as hath been said, but yet it leaves us infirm, that it may always help us. No man is ignorant how great power of Christ appeared in the holy Apostles, which yet did not fully compleat their strength, but it was rather perfected by their infirmity. We
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95561:99"/>
know, saith he, in part, and we prophesie in part: But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. We now see darkly through a Glass, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know as I am known.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that I may answer in a word: If you suppose there is that help of Divine Grace, which makes Obedience in this Life to be wholly unblameable and perfect; <hi>Augustine</hi> will presently deny that. Who discoursing of the first Precept of Righteousness, whereby we are commanded to love God, with all our heart, and our Neighbour as our selves: We shall fulfil that, saith he, in that <note place="margin">Aug. cte spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu &amp; litera, cap. 36.</note> Life, where we shall see face to face; and presently; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that man hath profited much in this Life in that Righteousness, which is to be perfected, who by profiting knows how far he is from the perfection of Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that which is argued from the power of Divine Grace, is not sufficient to exclude the necessity of sin. They say indeed, that by the perfect Grace of God it is possible that a man may not sin at all in this life: Be it so; Yet all things are not made which can be made by the singular power of <note place="margin">God can do the things that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but he wills not all things that he can.</note> God. So by the power of God helping us we could flie, yet we do not flie: For God willeth not all things, which his power is able to do: <hi>But,</hi> you say, <hi>he willeth and commandeth with great Authority,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:95561:100"/>
                     <hi>that we should observe his Precepts, which he would not command unless he knew them to be possible.</hi> It is true indeed, if they be understood according to that Nature, which he first created in us, So that in him there is no cause but that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as they should be judged right, so also they should be judged possible. But hearken to <hi>Hierom</hi> answering you, and aptly untying this Knot. God hath commanded things possible, saith he, this no man doubts of. But because men did not possible things, therefore all the World is become subject to God, and needs his Mercy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I know that there is not any <note place="margin">For it is not the fault of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, but the frailty of the Hearer, that all the world should become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God.</note> thing so difficult in humane things but infinite Omnipotency can do it by a word of his Power; to whom it would not be difficult to restore this frailty of Fallen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to its Antient State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, if he would. And there is no doubt, but he would do it, if <note place="margin">

Now therefore either prove, that all infirmity of the flesh is taken away in the Regenerate, and that they are restored to their former Innocency, which is without all sin, and also freed from a necessity of dying, or cease to dream of that Perfection of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in this Life, which hitherto hath not been found in any of the Saints, whether Apostles (that I may speak in the words

Is not this Grace promised to be obvious and prepared for all that are willing to obtain it, which frees Mankind from all Wickedness, which immediately imprints the form of Divine Righteousness upon the minds into which it enters, and furnishes them with most invincible strength, whereby it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to destroy Lust, to drive away all the pollutions of the Mind, and extirpate all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What then, when the Majesty of the most high God hath all things in his Power, and under his Command, and his goodness is no less Infinite than his Power: Do we suppose he will at any time be wanting to help the Creature, or shall we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust

                  <head>An Answer.</head>
                  <p>God forbid. But pray tell me, where hath God so engaged his faithfulness, whereof you speak, that the remainders of all Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, and all Infirmity of sinning being taken away, he would so heal Mankind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so thoroughly purged them from all Sin, that evil concupiscence being subdued, and all matter of the Antient Contagion being blotted out, no relicks of Sin should remain in this Life, but that it may be most easie to obey the commands of God, and so obtain Salvation?</p>
                  <p>By what Author, by what Witness, by what Doctor, by what Testimony, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, do you prove this to be true, which you Preach?</p>
                  <p>First, You say, is not this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <note place="margin">A confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Osorian</hi> Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that Sin is hateful to God, which necessarily through its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and outragiousness divides us from Union with God? And how can it be that the Lord, who is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture just, and a Lover of Righteousness, should not take away all Sins out of the minds of them, whom he designs to unite unto himself by Love? Moreover he that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; How, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> will he not with him give us all things? If then the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95561:101"/>
Testimony of <hi>Paul</hi> be true, it is thence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that those are delivered from all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, whom that infinite purity joins unto it self by most pure Love.</p>
                  <p>For, otherways if God did not take away Sin, be would be so far <note place="margin">Osor. de just. lib. 2. pag. 34.</note> from giving us all things, that he would suffer us in the chiefest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to be miserable, unhappy, and wretched. And so it would come to pass, that God would seem to have conferred upon us no great benefit by Christ, if he left us in the bondage of Sin, if he did not throw off the servile Yoke from our Necks, as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised of Old. Moreover the Blood of Christ poured forth on the Cross had yet brought us no advantage: For yet we are in great misery, we cannot but be miserable whilest we are held in the bonds of our Sins: There are also very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Testimonies of the Holy Scriptures confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Assertion: To wit, that by the Divine Power of Christ, Sin is extirpated, Lust is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, Evil Concupiscence is restrained, and the minds of Men being freed from Sin, put on a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine form.</p>
                  <p>For so it is recorded to us by Holy <hi>David.</hi> As far as <hi>East</hi> is from <note place="margin">Os. lib. 2. p. 35. Ps. 103. Ps. 51. Isa. 61.</note> the <hi>West,</hi> so far hath he removed our Transgressions from us.

                  <p>And <hi>Isaiah</hi> foretold that it should come to pass, that all that live in the Church by Faith, should be called Holy: And he hath blotted out as a Cloud thy Iniquities, and thy Sins as a thick Cloud. Likewise <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> At that time, saith the Lord, the Iniquity of <note place="margin">Ierem. 50. Ezek. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>Israel</hi> shall be sought, and it shall not be, and the Sin of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and it shall not be found. And in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he saith, I will pour clean Water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your defilements. Also <hi>Micah:</hi> He will cast all our <note place="margin">Micah. 7.</note> Sins into the depths of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Zechariah</hi> declares that Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain, which was to be opened, to wash away the filth of all.

                  <p>Which Testimonies being so many, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with these infinite others; what do they all drive at, but that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that by Christ, all the pollutions of our sinful Nature are done away, &amp;c.

                  <p>Unto which being so many, there is one Answer, and a well fitted one out of <hi>Augustin:</hi> Distinguish the times, saith he, and you will reconcile Scriptures.

                     </note> For Iniquity is taken away and Sin receives an end, as is evident by the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But if you ask how in this Flesh? <hi>Augustin</hi> will answer you: None, saith he, takes away Sin, but Christ, who is the Lamb of God that takes away the Sins of the World: And he takes them away, both by removing the Sins that were done, and by helping, that they may not be done, and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">August lib. de perfect. just.</note> to the Future Life where they cannot be done at all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in this Life, there is only a race to Righteousness, and <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> in the other Life will be the prize. This then is our Righteousness now whereby we run Hungering and Thirsting to the perfection, and fulness of that Righteousness, wherewith we shall afterward be satisfied in the other Life. Hence the Apostle saith: Not that I have already attained, or am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect. Brethren, I do not think that I have apprehended, but one thing I do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the things that are behind, and being stretched forth to those things that are before, I press forward to the mark of the high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in Christ Iesus, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore according to <hi>Augustin</hi> here is the Race, here is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, <note place="margin">Aug. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu &amp; litera.</note> there will be the Perfection. Here as running in a Race, we
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95561:103"/>
proceed from Vertue to Vertue. There we are perfected.</p>
                  <p>Now we have only the Seeds of Vertues begun, then in that <note place="margin">August. de perfect. justitiae.</note> fulness of Charity, when that shall be perfected in us, which now is imperfect, that precept shall be fulfilled, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul. For whilest there is yet any Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concupiscence, which may be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by continency; God is not in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects loved with all the Soul, for the Flesh doth not Lust without the Soul, though the Flesh is said to Lust, because the Soul Lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Carnally, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95561:103"/>
of sin, that being freed from Sin by Christ, yet we are not without sin, for these two things come always together, being tied to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a very near connexion. That where sin is, there by necessary consequence <note place="margin">Therefore fits also after the same manner is taken away by Christ.</note> death follows; wherefore if the flesh is yet held in bonds by the cruelty of death, by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is proved, that the relicks of sin remain also in the flesh. But now where is then that righteousness which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us? Would you know, O <hi>Osorius?</hi> where our life is, there is also our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Not in this flesh which we put off, but in that body which we shall in due time put on uncorrupted. For such are all the benefits of Christ purchased for us, that the promise of them being shewed afar off, as of old the Holy Land to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is apprehended by Faith, and the Spirit in this life, but the full possession belongs only peculiarly and in the whole to the other life.</p>

               <head>Christ begins his Benefits in this Life, and perfects them in the Life to come.</head>
               <p>Now these great Benefits of the Son of God consist chiefly in this, that sin being totally abolished, death being destroyed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores us, being plucked out of the Kingdom of the Devil, unto the possession of eternal Life, in which God communicates himself wholly to us, and is wholly all in all. And this most glorious work of his, most full of the highest dignity, he begins in this miserable life, and will compleat it in the other life, when that shall come to pass, which is written <hi>Death is swallowed up in Victory: O Death where is thy Victory? O Death where</hi>

                  <hi>is thy Sting?</hi> Howbeit these things are not said upon this account, as if there were nothing in the interim, or but little in this life, which the help of the grace of Christ does for us. As of old the help of the Eternal God was never wanting to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the waste Widerness, whom he was to bring into the habitations of promise; so verily neither are Christs benefits towards us little, and the riches of his bounty are not small, which the present Grace of Christ pours
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95561:104"/>
daily upon us with a full hand, when in this sinful Nature he often helps our infirmities, forgives our sins, instructs us with his word, refreshes us with hope, supports us by Faith, feeds and strengthens us by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and refreshes us by his own <note place="margin">The Land of Promise the figure of our inheritance. What and how great benefits the grace of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life.</note> Spirit, adorns us with his gifts, renews our hearts, and stirs them up to spiritual motions of better life and obedience, restrains vitious affections, by whose guidance there increase in us the beginnings of eternal life, the knowledge of God, invocation, fear, faith, true repentance, a new law, and the image of him, who Created us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And seeing Christ works these things in us with continual care, daily more and more, promoting and bringing unto maturity that which he hath begun in us; there is therefore no cause why the Graces of Christ here should seem needless to any Man.</p>
               <p>But these beginnings of Divine Grace must be distinguished from <note place="margin">The grace of Christ is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver idle in his own.</note> that perfect and compleat reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Nature, which shall be seen in the glorified after this life. For though it should not be doubted but great advantages are communicated to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by the Divine help of the Holy Spirit, both to shun those things that are grievously offensive, and also to exercise the Offices of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95561:105"/>
Piety; of which <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>They</hi>

                  <hi>God, are the Sons of God.</hi> Yet there is not given to the regenerate in this life a compleat conformity to the Law of God, but it is reserved for the other life; for the life of the Saints in this World should not be called a life of the flesh but of Faith rather, not a life of perfect, but of begun love and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as being not so much discerned in justice as in justification, not in perfect holiness, but in sanctification; not in perfect purity, but in purification, not in perfection, but in going forward.</p>
               <p>But this good Friend ours thinks this should by no means be suffered: Who so fights against us, as if all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Salvation consisted not in <note place="margin">

               <p>O miserable condition of Mortal Men, if those things are true, which you Evangelize to us. But by what Authority of the Gospel do you confirm those things, which you assert?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95561:105"/>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> There is no reason that any Man should be joyned to God, unless <note place="margin">Osor. de just. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. pag. 96.</note> he be a Friend to him. <hi>I hear you. What then?</hi> But no Man can be his friend unless he be like him. <hi>That is harder: Let the induction proceed.</hi> But the Divine similitude consists wholly of the study and exercise of true Vertue. From all this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is concluded. That there is no other way, that joyns us to God, but what consists in the performance of Vertue, and in worthy Offices.</p>
               <p>And now what will become of those, who being Iust Men fall <note place="margin">Proverbs 24. 1 Iames 3.</note> seven times a Day, and yet rise up again? What also will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all those, concerning whom <hi>Iames</hi> speaking, saith, in many things we offend all? Moreover, what will become of those, whom Christ bids Pray, Lord forgive us our debts.</p>
               <p>Moreover whereas you say, that no Man is joyned to God, or received into favour, but he that is his Friend: If that be so, How then doth God agree to his own Law, which commands not only to love Friends, but to pray for Enemies? <note place="margin">Iob. 3.</note> I beseech you, when God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, what else was this World then, but an Enemy to God, which yet he had so great a favour to? Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> expresly testifies, that we were reconciled to God, not when we were Friends, but Enemies; and therefore he says the love of Christ is commended in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95561:106"/>
this, that he dyed for Enemies. And again, if, whilst we were <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Enemies, we were reconciled unto God, by the Death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</p>
               <p>See. I beseech you, how great a difference is between <hi>Paul's</hi> Assertion and yours, <hi>Osorius.</hi> He affirms we were reconciled to God when we were Enemies, you admit no Man unto favour, but him that is a Friend to him, and conform to him in the whole fimilitude of his Life. And how then will that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ consist, concerning loving Enemies, and that by the example of his Father's bounty, who bestows the benefit both of Sun and Rain, not only on Friends, but also on Enemies; if so be the Grace of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour is accessible to none but Friends. and those that are like himself.</p>
               <p>And that I may by the by touch some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of the Mysteries of Prophetical Scriptures, tell me what else is pointed at unto us by the reception of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his Sons into the Land of <hi>AEgypt. Gen. chap.</hi> 47. Whom that very loving <note place="margin">Gin. 47.</note> King being brought unto him, to whom they had not been so much as known before, received for Inhabitants of Foreigners, and for dear Subjects of Men unknown; not only into the Common Wealth, but into Friendship, not at all for their own sakes, who brought nothing with them but hunger and poverty: But only for the sake of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:95561:106"/>
whom the King had a very dear love for. What else doth <hi>Ioseph</hi> represent to us, but the sublime Son of God, dearly beloved of him? What else should you understand in the Brethren, Father, and the whole Kindred, but us miserable Sinners, whom being dead in Sins, Christ hath quickned, and of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies reconciled us in Friendship to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not for any merit of our Works or Conformity, but only by that favour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is powerful with the Father.</p>
               <p>But now let us briefly bring the <hi>Osorian</hi> Argument into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <note place="margin">Osor. de just. lib. 9. Nu. 96. lib. 8. nu. 20.</note> form, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter view each part thereof.</p>

                  <p>And thence on the contrary sense it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that it must be concluded by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence, that all spots of Sins being abolished; <hi>That man who desires Union with God, should agree with him by a certain eminent resemblance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:95561:107"/>
                  <p>I Answer, First, to the major which is not always true. Though the similitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hath oftimes no small strength to procure Friendship in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that so much allures unto Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as simili tude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to pass that good Men love good Men. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in <hi>Lelius.</hi> The like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cleaves to the like. <hi>Plat.</hi> of Love.</note> use of Life, as <hi>Cicero</hi> says; yet all things that are any way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like are not so opposed, that they cannot consist together without fighting one against another. As there are many differences in things, yet every difference doth not unty the bond of love. As again neither do all Men every where cleave to one another by a firm bond of Friendship, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever do some way agree in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and Ingeny. Verily in the Divine Love, this agreement of Conformity hath no place; That they should be received into favour, who came nearest to his Image. For so it would come to pass that all other Creatures being excluded, Almighty God would embrace only Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vertues, with his Divine Favour.</p>
                  <p>Though neither here, if you look to Angels themselves, doth any proportion of similitude unite into one with the Divine Holyness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Testimony of <hi>Rof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensis:</hi> Who says that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <note place="margin">Roffens. <hi>cont.</hi> Luther. Articul. 38.</note> of Men is another than that of Angels; and again, that their Righteousness is another than that of God. As therefore this Righteousness of Angels, if you compare it with the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95561:107"/>
of God, will seem imperfect, and beyond all comparison coming short of that highest Righteousness, and which yet perhaps is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin: So if you compare Human Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Angelical, it will have some Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yet so, that all its works are not subject to Sin. Hitherto spake <hi>Roffensis. Augustin</hi> also comes to this Point, who comparing our Righteousness <note place="margin">Aug. de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore: Sermone 49.</note> which now is with that which is to come, hath these words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its dissimilitude; when that Righteousness, saith he, according to which they live, shall be, and where no evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence shall be, let every Man measure himself what he is now and what he shall be then, and he will find in comparison of that Righteousness, that all his works now are loss and dung, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And presently after: In the Resurrection we believe we shall fulfil Righteousness, that is, that we shall have full Righteousness. In comparison of that all the Life we live now is dung, &amp;c. And now, <hi>Osorius,</hi> what Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of similitude will you find between this Life of dung, and that highest Author, and Prince of all Holiness.</p>

               <head>The Assertion of <hi>Osorius,</hi> whereby he proves that there can be no Reconciliation to God, unless all the Relicks of Sin be utterly cut off.</head>

                  </note> here again object; Though dissimilitude doth not divide the connexion of friendship; but yet things that are so different, that they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to one another by a mutual repugnancy, it cannot by any means be, that those things should be joyned together; of which sort are Virtue and Vice, Righteousness and Sin, Love and Hatred. Therefore seeing God is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so just in his own Nature, that he cannot but hate Sin; and on the contrary, Man is so wholly drowned in sin, that in every good work, according to the Opinion of <hi>Luther,</hi> the Saints themselves also do sin, in this so great dissimilitude of things that are opposite to one another; <hi>how can it be that Infinite Holiness can be joyned by any Communion with Man, if he is such a one as</hi> Luther <hi>describes him?</hi> For so <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> from things well said by <hi>Luther,</hi> but badly understood by him, and worse wrested for the occasion of cavilling, doth very ill argue, not because it is true, but because it seems so to him. But let us first oppose the frivolous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and then let us take <hi>Luther's</hi> part, as well as we can, against the cruel Incursions of his Adversaries, And first indeed it cannot
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95561:108"/>
be denied that Iustice and Sin are repugnant to one another by the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Romans</hi> 1.</note> opposition. Likewise we must confess that it is no less true, that all impurity of sin is hateful and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God: For the Anger of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who ditain the Truth in unrighteousness; as the Apostle speaks very evidently. Which being so, what remains then, but that the Life of the Godly should either be free of all sin in this World, as <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> contends; or if that cannot be, as <hi>Luther</hi> affirms, all must be liable to the <note place="margin">A Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cavil. All Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Son, <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</note> Wrath of God. I answer with the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> That indeed would follow, unless there comes a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, who may interpose himself against the Anger of God in the sinners behalf; who may satisfie for sin, who may obtain pardon, who may mollifie the rigour of Iustice; yea, who may transpose all the Iudgment given against the guilty upon himself, and that now he himself may be Iudge of the Cause, who is the forgiver of the Crime. For so we hear in the Gospel; My Father judgeth no man, but hath given all Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son. And again; All things are delivered unto me by Father. All which benefits, seeing we receive from Christ, the most bountiful Mediatour, in such plenty as exceeds all belief, there is no cause, O <hi>Osorius,</hi> why in such great abundance of grace, you
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95561:109"/>
should press us with such strict weights of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as if we were now under the Law, and not under Grace? But how much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able would it be both to your Duty, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you should by a submission common to you and us, give place to the Grace of God, and acknowledge the benefits of the Mediatour, and apply your self with all gratitude of mind to his everlasting praises, that are worthy to be celebrated through all Generations.</p>
               <p>Therefore that we may expedite a matter not very difficult in a few words: Whereas you say sin is hateful to God, nothing is <note place="margin">Sin is one thing, and a man that is a sinner is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in the sight of God.</note> more true. But it is one thing to speak of sin, and another thing to speak of Man that is a sinner; he indeed hates sin, and the Physician also hates the disease, but yet not so, that he should destroy the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased person, but that he should heal him. Concerning which thing, if you do not trust me, hear <hi>Augustin;</hi> he is not a God that condemns some sins, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <note place="margin">Aug. Tract. 41. in Iobannem.</note> and praises other sins: He praises none, but hates all, as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician hates the disease, and by curing endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to drive away the disease: So God by his Grace procures that sin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed <note place="margin">Sin is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in this life, but not taken away.</note> in us. But how is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed? It is diminished in the life of them that are going on to Perfection: it shall be consumed in the life of the perfect, &amp;c.</p>

But if it needs Mercy, then it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily joyned with pollution and sin, so that now the Praise belongs to the Mediatour, and not to Man; to Imputation, not to Action; to Grace, not to Merit; to Faith, not to Works; that God accepts of the Works of the Regenerate and most holy men. Neither is the rectitude of our good things any thing else but the forgiveness of God, and the remission of his just severity. Whence the Apostle rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that those who are of the Works of the Law (not speaking of evil works, but the most perfect Works) are under the Curse, and upon this account it is true, which <hi>Luther</hi> says, that a righteous man

sins in every good Work. Not that the Work it self being appointed by the Law of God is a sin; but because, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Augustin,</hi> whatsoever is less than it ought to be, is faulty: From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evidently, that in this Life there is no Work so perfect, but something is wanting in it, that is there is Sin in it, if it be judged according to the strict rigour of the Law.</p>

                  <p>I answer to the minor by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying; for that which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">An Answer to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> definition of Grace, doth not agree to Righteousness, seeing the things themselves do very much differ from one another, both as to their Effects, and as to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95561:113"/>
their Causes. For, if we believe <hi>Thomas,</hi> Grace is the Principle, and Cause of Iustice, and of all Vertues. Iustice is not the cause of Grace, but rather an effect thereof. Yea, <hi>Albertus Ratisponensis</hi> does not much <note place="margin">Albertus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in Sentent. lib. 2. <hi>Dist.</hi> 16. <hi>Ar.</hi> 4.</note> differ from the opinion of <hi>Thomas;</hi> who commenting upon the same sentence, in the same <hi>Dist. Ar.</hi> 4. saith thus.</p>
                  <p>Grace is a habit of Life universally well ordered, not according to the degrees of things ordered, but as it is called a Relation of the whole Life to the obtaining of the End. But Iustice doth not this, nor Vertue; for Iustice doth not necessarily make worthy of Eternal Life, upon the account that it is Iustice, or Vertue, &amp;c. What if the proper and true cause which reconciles us to the love of God, and makes us worthy of Eternal Life, should be searched for. We shall find, that it lyes not in the Works of Iustice, but that it proceeds from another cause.</p>
                  <p>And what that cause is, Christ himself the best Master will teach you in the Gospel. Whom I request, and beseech you not only to hearken unto, but to believe. For these are his words in the Gospel: For the Father himself loveth you, because <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> ye have loved me, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that I came from the Father. By which you see that it comes to pass not for the sake of our Iustice or Vertue, but for the sake of his own dearly beloved Son, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cares for us, and loves us.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:95561:113"/>
                  <p>What then, say you, doth not Iustice make Men that live holily and justly in this World acceptable to God? Which if it is so, <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> whereby Iustice is proved to be nothing but Grace.</note> it cannot be judged to be any other thing but Grace. For whatsoever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us acceptable to God, is justly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed to be Grace. Iustice makes us acceptable to God, therefore it is Grace. As touching the minor, I deny not that Iustice, as it is very acceptable to God, so it renders acceptable to God, if it is perfect and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Divine perfection; which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to us in this Life, another altar must be sought, there is need of other helps. Therefore if we would find any favour in the sight of God, we must betake our selves to Christ, and embrace him by Faith. Though I am not Ignorant what this good Disputant drives at, and what Masters he follows, and on what foundation he builds. For he builds upon that <note place="margin">

To wit, into grace freely given, and that which makes acceptable. And again they subdivide this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it were by an Anatomical Dissection into more Veins, into Operative grace, which again they divide into three Rivulets, Preventing, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95561:114"/>
delivering, and afterwards into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating, which likewise is threefold: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, promoting, assisting.</p>
                  <p>O holy Christ! with what study, with what labour, what Cobwebs do these Praters here weave, that they may darken the wholesome Doctrine of Grace with Smoke and Soot of their idle Talk; for if we <note place="margin">What the word Grace fignifies in the writings of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists and Apostles.</note> speak of that Grace, unto which our whole Salvation is referred, who is there but understands by the Writings of the Evangelists and Apostles, that it is thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed? to wit, that it is the only thing, which being placed in the free Indulgence of God towards miserable sinners, doth with dear Love in Christ the Son of God, embrace all that believe in him, and forgive their sins, and for the sake of his own Son bestows his Spirit and Eternal Life and Felicity upon them, tho' otherways they are unworthy: And tho' the Operation of this Grace is not one, and the Effects are divers, and the Gifts various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of donations; yet the Divine Grace it self is only one, which is both freely given to us for Salvation, and makes those acceptable to God, whom it saves, and is one and the same Cause both of Salvation and Renovation: Wherefore their distinction is justly found fault <note place="margin">Against <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Thomas, Scotus,</hi> and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> with, who by grace making men grateful or acceptable understand habits, and gifts communicated by God; and they do most frivolously
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95561:114"/>
conclude, that men are made acceptable to God by these; whereas it is only Mercy in Christ the Mediatour, which doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account us dear to it self, but also chose us, before we were adorned with any Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gifts. Moreover, if the matter be so as those men define, that not only Faith in Christ, but gifts and habits of vertues infused by God make us acceptable to God: What then shall be said of those, who also out of Christ have possessed many such excellent gifts as well as we, in which many of them are not only equal to us, but some of them also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel us; such as are variety of Tongues, gifts of Healing, Prophecy, excellent Powers, sharpness of Wit, strength of Body, Ornaments of Mind? The Iews have a strong hope in God. The Turks maintain Love towards one another. But what, shall we affirm that those men also are by these things made acceptable to God? which is absurd and unreasonable. Therefore that we may conclude, we confess that such gifts are things which adorn this Life, beautifie Nature, and declare the liberal Bounty of God, but which nevertheless neither regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nor justifie us in the sight of God: For that is due to Christ only by Faith; neither is it convenient to attribute it to any other Creatures whatsoever: According to that of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Being justified therefore by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ. Though in the <note place="margin">Romans 5.</note> mean while I am not ignorant, what they answer here; that they treat not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95561:115"/>
of those Works, which the Heathen perform by the strength of Nature; nor those Works, which are done by the Iews without Faith by the guidance of the Law only, but those Works which are of the Faith of Christ. What then, say they, are not such excellent performances of Works pleasing to God? Is not that very pleasing and acceptable to God, whatsoever is right, whatsoever is joyned with vertue and honesty, whatsoever being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Faith is rightly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Three things to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good Works.</note> according to Duty and Piety? That I may answer this, three things by the by must be observed, First, What manner of Works these are, which are discoursed of, whether perfect or not? And then, how they please, of themselves, or upon the account of Faith? Thirdly, How much they please, whether so much as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Eternal Life, and obtain the pardon of violated Righteousness; and being set against the wrath of God, to turn away all vengeance, and be effectual to satisfie Iustice without any remission of sins? For all these must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with necessary attention. First, Because God the great Creatour of the World, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy in his own Nature, and the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all Goodness; it is evident that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is of it self acceptable to him, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing, which being defiled with any spot of imperfection, doth not <note place="margin">Osor. lib. 5. pag. 119.</note> agree in all respects to the most exact Purity.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:95561:115"/>
                  <p>But now seeing it is most true, <note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 19. c. 27.</note> which neither <hi>Osorius</hi> himself denies, <hi>That there is no man hath led his life so exactly, that in the whole course of his life he hath not been guilty of any gross offence:</hi> And that there is not any state of Mind so framed by Divine Grace, although it abounds with Divine Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, in which nothing was ever violated by perfidiousness, or offensive through errour of mind, or omitted through negligence; or which doth not more consist of the remission of sins, than the perfection of vertues: What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then, but that it should either be false, which this <hi>Osorius</hi> of ours cracks of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfection, or at least it behoveth that something should be searched for, besides the vertues themselves, which may commend these first beginnings of our imperfections to the Divine Perfection, and reconcile them to his favour.</p>
                  <p>And now then this remains to be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into; What it is that reconciles sinners to God, and restores them to his favour? and because this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation <note place="margin">All Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Grace of God only.</note> cannot be perfected by the Righteousness of our vertues; therefore we must confess that all the Office of reconciling consists in the Grace of God only, which the Papists themselves will not deny unto us, who agree with our Party in this, That Man is justified by Grace; for so we hear it testified expresly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95561:116"/>
by <hi>Osorius</hi> himself in these words: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Osor. de Iust. lib. 6. nu. 151.</hi> The Papist would seem to refer all things to the Bounty and Grace of God, though they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less in reality.</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore, saith he, They that give Heaven to the Merits of holy men, do not weaken the Grace of God, as some ignorant men say, but they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the wonderful effect of his Grace with due praises; for we are such as judge all the Morits of the Saints should be referred to the Bounty and Grace of God; so that it should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be said; Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory,</hi> &amp;c. I hear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very good words; if you had not already imposed upon us sufficiently with words, O <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius!</hi> But he that will with judicious attention consider the matters themselves, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and the whole tenour of your discourse, will find it to be far otherways, that you do not at all intend what your words pretend, and that you drive at nothing more in all your endeavours, than to hide under the plausible title of grace so hidden an adversary of grace, (that I may speak with <hi>Augustin</hi>) together with the other Companions of your Society; who being all instructed in the same School, seem to make a Conspiracy about this one thing, as it were giving notice by a watch-word, <hi>viz.</hi> to overthrow all the efficacy of Evangelical Grace, to destroy the assurance of Faith, to oveturn all: For what place is there for Grace, I beseech you, if Heaven is given not by the free gift of the bestower, but to the Merits of holy men, as you say? And what will you answer <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, who denies
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95561:116"/>
that grace is any more grace, if men deal with God by Works? whence that may be brought not without just cause <note place="margin">Aug. lib. depa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienti. 1, cap. 20.</note> against you and yours, which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> of old brought in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with the Antient Pelagians of his time. For thus you plead; <hi>That Heaven is justly and deservedly given to the Merits of holy men.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Augustine</hi> being taught by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Authority, If it is given, saith he, to any Merits; it is not then given freely, but is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as due; and by this means it is not by a true name called grace, where the reward, as the Apostle speaks, is not imputed according to grace, but according to <note place="margin">Romans 4. An Antitlie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis between Grace and Merit. <hi>Aug. de pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia, cap. 20.</hi>
                     </note> debt. But that it may be true grace, that is, free, it finds nothing in Man to whom it should be due; otherways, according to the mind of the Apostle, grace would not be grace, &amp;c. And now with what fair colours cast on them, will those things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to one another, be made to agree? <hi>Augustine</hi> with St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that grace finds nothing in Man, to which it should be due; That it may be free. On the contrary, the Papists contend that Heaven is given as a due debt to the Merits of the Saints. What is more contrary? Grace, saith he, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help the righteous man, but also justifies the ungodly: in which there appears a twofold effect and fruit of Divine Grace, both in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteous, and justifying the ungodly: With the one of which you being contented,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95561:117"/>
ye either unworthily pass by the other, or which is more abominable, ye oppose it wickedly, whilst ye admit no grace of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that which seems to be joyned with Vertue, and the Iustice of Merits.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all these things, whereas nothing more contrary to grace can be spoken, this sweet Oratour would perswade us with his flourished speeches, that they are no such men as overturn the Grace of God, as some ignorant men say; but that <note place="margin">Osor. lib. 6.</note> they celebrate with due praise the wonderful effect of grace, and teach that all the Merits of the Saints should be referred to the Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>Now we acknowledge this to be most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is not any thing, but what should be referred to the Grace of God; whence <hi>Hierom</hi> accounts it for Sacrilege, if any man thinks he can abstain from sinning without grace. But here there is need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what the word grace signifies according to the caution of the Gospel. For grace in the holy Scriptures is not only understood concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the help of the Holy Spirit, but it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both free Imputation, which <note place="margin">The word Grace is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</note> is by Christ (which the Papists can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure) and the help of the Holy Spirit in performing the Offices of Vertues.</p>

all our good works should be referred to the grace of God; which neither the Iews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nor the Turks will deny. But <note place="margin">A definition of Grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> we justly disapprove, that they do not define this grace according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For whereas grace is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by this sort of men, that it is nothing else but a habit infused by God, like his own goodness and love, whereby he that hath it is rendered acceptable to God; and it makes Works acceptable to him and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: It is easily demonstrated both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Reason, how faulty this definition is, because the thing defined is of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than the definition: For the grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God loved <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Esau,</hi> before they did either good <note place="margin">An infused Habit.</note> or evil, was grace; which ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as  not any Habit, either begotten in <note place="margin">The refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the definition. <hi>Iacob, Esau.</hi> The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Thief, Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c.</note> them by the power of Nature, or infused by grace, whereby <hi>Iacob,</hi> that had it, that I may use their words, was render'd acceptable to God. After the like manner the grace which in the midst of his persecution of Saints changed <hi>Paul</hi> into an Instrument in the hand of Electing grace, was not an infused Habit, but went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an infused Habit, and first made him a man acceptable to Christ, before the Habit mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptable was infused. The same should be said of the Thief, the Publican, the Leper, and many others in the History of the Gospel, who were not saved by an infused Habit, but
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95561:118"/>
only by an infused Faith; for otherways what did that word so often repeated in the Gospel signifie; <hi>Thy Faith hath saved thee?</hi> Which word, if it be true, then either Faith is Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or else Righteousness can by no means save us. And the same reason is to be given of the Conversion of the Gentiles; whom of old the grace of God brought from impure Paganism to the Communion of the Gospel; not for any Inherent Righteousness, but for his great Love wherewith he loved the unworthy and the wretched sinners.</p>
               <p>Moreover, what shall be said of the Apostles themselves, whom Christ verily chose not being just, as <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks, but to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when he said; I chose you out of the World? What if Christ chose them out of the World; that they might be just; then they were first unjust in the World, whom he chose out of the World, that they might be just. If they were first just, and not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World, whom Christ chose out of the World; then they first chose Christ, that they being just, might be chosen by him. But it was not so; for he himself says to them; Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These things said <hi>Augustine;</hi> by which it evidently appears how our Election and Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication purchased by Christ is perfected not by any Righteousness of Works, but only by the free gift of Grace; whence it is called by <hi>Paul</hi> the Election of Grace, not of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95561:119"/>
to wit, by this Argument: What if it is by Grace, saith he, it is not now by Works, or else grace is not grace; but if it is of works, then it is not grace; <note place="margin">Romans 11.

                     <hi>the Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>These things said <hi>Hosius,</hi> to whom <hi>Andradius</hi> agrees in a Speech not <note place="margin">Andra. lib. 6. pa. ibi. Orthod.

               <p>What then, such as do not attribute Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to good Works, should they be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore supposed to attribute nothing to Works, or to cast reproach upon the grace of God?

Is not Faith in Christ the Mediatour as singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a gift of God; and does it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Election of Divine Grace? But now let us hear an Argument more than Catholick.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Argument.</head>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Con.</hi> Therefore all our Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">An Answer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> consists in good Works.</p>
                  <p>The deceit of this Paralogism must be drawn forth: And again the word Grace must be explained: Which is <note place="margin">Pardoning Grace, or Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</note> taken one way in the major and another way in the minor; for there it is taken for mercy, and the free good will of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath redeemed us freely, whereby he loves us in Christ Iesus, and forgives us our Sins, and whereby also he imparts his Spirit and Life Eternal to us. And this is peculiarly called Grace of forgiveness, of which the writings of the Apostles speak aloud in many places. It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6, 4. Coloss. 1. Rom. 3.</note> but of God that sheweth mercy: And again: Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law but under Grace. And what the same Apostle cites out of a Psalm: Blessed are they whose Iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whose Sins are covered, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And also that which elsewhere he testified very evidently: They are justified freely by his Grace; moreover that none should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, what is understood by the word Grace, presently subjoining, and as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining himself, he infers next: By the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is in Christ Iesus. But what
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95561:123"/>
other thing does this adding of Redemption signifie, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">Renewing Grace.</note> of all Sins? That this may be the Argument: We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that Grace, whereby we are redeemed. But Grace by renewing us doth not redeem us. Therefore we are not justified by Grace renewing us.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the minor, in which the word grace is taken otherways than in the major. For there it is put for remission or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, here for renovation: That is, for the effectual energy <note place="margin">Grace is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Two parts.</note> of the Divine Inspiration; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Gifts and Endowments, wherewith he afterwards adorns those whom first he hath justified: Whence arises a twofold manner of distinguishing Grace, according to the twofold diversity of effects on this side, and on that side, of which one consists in the remission of evil Works, the other in the operation of good Works. And that is called pardoning Grace, and this is called renewing Grace: From the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceeds the Salvation and the Iustification of the Ungodly, and from the other come the good Works of the Godly; and yet those are not full, nor perfect.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I answer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proposed, which hath more <note place="margin">The Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant with four <hi>Termini.</hi>
                     </note> errours than one. Moreover it is made up of mere particulars: Also in the minor contrary to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Disputants, the case is changed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95561:124"/>
the same case should be kept that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the major, and the minor should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thus: But our good Works are by the grace of God only; or at least, in the major the same case of the minor should have been kept, after this manner: Our Iustification arises twice from the grace of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our Iustification flows from good Works. So that the true nature of this Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosyllogism, belongs not to the first, but the second figure simply concluding both affirmatively and also most <note place="margin">Aparalogism in the second figure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively.</note> absurdly, just as if a Man should argue thus: Our corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made of the slime of the Earth: Earthen-Pots are made of the slime of the Earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our corporeal Nature was made of Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-Pots. What need is there of words? Whatsoever way these Men form their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or reform it, they shall never be able to prove, that the works of the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as we our selves have wrought, or such as the Divine Grace works in us, do contain in themselves any cause of Salvation. For what manner of consequence is this? Because habitual influences of Works, which make us acceptable to God, proceed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways but from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating Grace: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith without inherent Righteousness doth not justifie, neither doth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation consist of any other thing <note place="margin">A twofold sort of Works Rom. 14.</note> but good Works. But because there is a twofold sort of Works,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95561:124"/>
one of those which go before Faith, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those which follow Faith, I would know of which of those rwo parts they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it. If of the preoedent they will not deny those to be Sins: For that which is not of Faith is of Sin: But if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of Works subsequent to Faith, they will say that those are either perfect or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. If perfect, and of such a sort, that they answer the things commanded in the Law, not only according to the substance, but also according to the manner of doing. To what purpose then is that daily saying of the Church made mention of: Forgive us our debts? Or what will they answer to <hi>Augustine,</hi> who evidently confutes <note place="margin">

wherewith he hath loved the World, having given his Son, sent him to us, and so sent him, that he for us hath fulfilled all Righteousness; for there was no need that he should fulfil it for himself, and if he hath fulfilled it for us, what hinders now, but that may be ours, which was done for us? or <note place="margin">Christ fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Law, not for himself, but for us; if for us, then we also fulfil it by him. <hi>Tho.</hi> 12. 109. pag. 259.</note> to what purpose should he do that for us, which he knew was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be done by our selves for our Salvation?

I do not rail at the men themselves, <note place="margin">The sum of all our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is chiefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in two things, Faith and Renovation by Grace.

and after a certain manner subdue it unto humane Philosophy. Which that it may appear the more evidently to the Minds and Eyes of beholders, let it not be tedious to you to hearken a while, first what Divine Truth, and then what Humane Opinions teach us.</p>
               <p>But because there are two things chiefly in which the whole sum both of our Salvation and Religion is contained, Grace, and Faith, of which the one belongs to God towards men, the other agrees to men towards God: It ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much concerns Christians, that their Minds be very well instructed in both. And Grace indeed is discerned in those good things that are given to us, and promised by God. Faith is exercised in those Offices, which are chiefly due from us to God, and are greatly requisite. Therefore that we may rightly apprehend the nature of Grace, we must see what and how great those gifts are, which the bounty of God hath partly bestowed upon us, and partly promised: Concerning which thing it remains that we should examine what the Scriblers of Popish Divinity do hold. Now what they teach about this matter, is for the most part to this purpose. They place the end of humane Life in blessedness, and the School-Divines dispute about this very blessedness <note place="margin">Wherein Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Shcolastick Doctors.

                  <note place="margin">The Papists Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> disputed thus against the Pelagians, that we cannot so much as will good by Free-will without Grace, or merit Eternal Life by any means without Grace. And that is true indeed. But that those same men joyning Grace again, deny not that we can merit Life by Works, and that <hi>ex condigno</hi> according to their worth; I do not see what difference is between these and the Pelagians in that; except that in the manner of working they somewhat differ; for those work without grace, these no otherways but by grace; but both do equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Wherein the Papists agree with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians.</note> err from the scope of true Iustification: For as untrue as that is, that it is in our power to perform any thing aright without the Grace of God: It is again as false, that this grace of working was not given by God for any other purpose, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce meritorious works, whereby we may be justified.

               <p>I Have explained the sayings of some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which differ several ways from one another, yet they are all wonderfully agreed in this one thing, as it were by a common Conspiracy, that they may take away from sinners that saving Grace which only justifies us.

But what that Errour is, lest we should seem to accuse them without cause, let us explain in a few words, but true; to wit, seeing there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Testimony of the Grace of the Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in the Scriptures; the one whereby in a free gift he bestowed his Son upon us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95561:129"/>
that they are both great gifts. He gave his Son, than whom nothing was dearer to him; he bestows his Spirit, than which nothing is higher in Heaven. But for what purpose doth he bestow both? how does he give them for our advantage? for what end? with what fruit? what did he design in so doing? by what Reason was he persuaded? by what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity? by what mercy was the most gracious Father and maker of the World moved? I would very willingly ask this first, either of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> or rather of those Tridentine fellow-Priests; for if Free-will being helped by the grace of the Sprit of God, as they say, could do so much by meriting through the infused Vertues, even as much as was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for obtaining Salvation, what cause then was there why all this charge should be put upon Christ the Son of God? What need. was there of his blood? Why did not the most gracious Father spare his Life? But if so be that all other helps of grace could afford no help to expedite the business of our Redemption; Then it remains to be asked of those men, what they affirm of Christ, whether they acknowledge him the only Saviour or not? And indeed I know that they will not deny that Christ is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour. But in the mean while it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that they should answer me this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner this only Saviour saves his own, whether only by his Innocency and Death, or by adding other helps besides?

And now, what then if those are added? doth then at length full and perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness arise from these together, partly from the blood of Christ, and partly from renovation by new qualities, which may reconcile us being justified unto God.

As for Example, if any Heathen or Pharisee, who is a stranger to the Faith of Christ, should do this same thing, that a Christian does, though he should do also greater things, yet the Works would not please God. And why should his Works displease? Or why should the Works of a Christian please, unless it were for Faith? And that is it which Prophetical verity in old time foretold should come to pass, that the Iust should live by Faith; he says, not that the Faithful should live by Righteousness: By which you see, that this Life whereby we live by the Faith of the Son of God, is not rendered unto the Merits of Works, but consists of Faith and Grace; for grace and the gift of God, is Etrenal Life: If grace, where is reward?

First, it is to be considered by the very Name of Obedience, Debt and Duty are implyed: Now the Obedience we owe, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly deserve no grace: What Man at any time commanding a hired Servant to do his Duty, bestows grace or praise upon him for that which he owed upon the account of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or therefore doth assign unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny portion of his Inheritance? What does the Lord himself an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">That which is due upon the account of Obedience deserves no grace.</note> to such Servants in the Gospel? Say ye, we are unprofitable Servants,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95561:132"/>
we have done that which was our duty to do, &amp;c. Now then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Lu. 17.</note> are those things called by the Name of reward, which God ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto our good Deeds? I will tell you: God proposes rewards: verily so he does: but the same God proposes Dangers and Combats. The most excellent Master of the Wrestlings sees what and how great storms of Temptations must be undergone, how many labours must be endured, how many difficulties lye before them: He sees through how many Casualties and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the strait way to the Kingdom must be undertaken by them, who are planted in Christ: And therefore that they may not faint in their minds, but proceed with the greater courage in their undertaken Warfare, rewards are shewed to them as certain prizes, and recompenses of Victory, to stir up their minds; whereby the most Gracious Father may mitigate the crosses of his own Servants, and comfort them in their Sufferings, with proposing hope of Rewards.</p>
               <p>And hence is that frequent mention of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Recompenses in the Scriptures. Not that those things <note place="margin">Ro. 8.</note> which the Saints suffer in this life, are worthy of rewards.</p>
               <p>For the sufferings of this time are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the glory that shall be revealed in us: But because it so seemed good to the Clemency of God, to esteem those Merits of ours which are none, as if they were Merits indeed, and to Crown them, as if they were very great, which deserve no grace at all. For who hath
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95561:132"/>
thanked a Servant, as the Gospel Witnesses for the Service, which he owed to his Master af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he did his Commands? And would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have punished him if he had not done them? But if he find any praise or reward beyond his Merit, he hath cause to give thanks to his Master, but not to boast of <note place="margin">August. praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in Psal 31.</note> his own Merits. Therefore <hi>Augustin</hi> admonishes rightly and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: If you would be a stranger to grace, saith he, boast of your Merit. And verily <hi>Bernard</hi> was not wholy without sight, though he saw not all things, when he said it was sufficient for Merit, to know that Merits are not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Briefly, that we may express the thing in a word, whatsoever it is, which is called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Mystical writings, is nothing else but Grace proposed in the place and name of reward. What if this present Life, which we enjoy in the Flesh, if the conveniency of Life, and other Ornaments, though transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and temporary, are very rightly accounted, not to be, our Merits, but the Gifts of God, how much more rightly shall that Heavenly and everlasting reward of Life, wherewith the most gracious Father crowns us, seem to proceed, not from the dignity of our Works, but from his singular Mercy and Grace. Which though sometimes it takes the name of reward, yet if we rightly consider the matter, we shall find nothing in all this whole Fabrick of our Redemption, but the only and singular Grace of God.</p>

of Sins only, whilest Charity doth not together with it communicate its influence in the Hearts of the Godly, and that the grace of working well is not joined thereunto, &amp;c. Which if it be true, what should be judged of the Prophets, what should be judged of Christ himself, who are of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? We must either acknowledge that those were destitute of the Spirit of God, or else that those <hi>Tridentine</hi> Sanctions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Divine Grace. The Prophet cries with a loud Voice, the Apostle also cries, that it is not of him that runneth or willeth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>
               <p>And, will the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councellours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate against this; that Man's Salvation consists only in the Favour of God? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then? Running, say they, must be added, and the choice of Free-will must be added thereto. Who denies it? We run all of us, each one for his own Portion, being placed in our Stage by God: For the Christian Life is a race, not a play, an exercise, not a vacuity from business, a warfare, not slothfulness. Be it so indeed, yet in this same race how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily do we oftiems run? How often do we stumble? How many ways do we fall, how blind and traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Free Will.</note> a way do we often go? And so sometimes we run head long, either wandering every one his own way as the Prophet speaks, or with the Sheep of the Gospel wander sometimes out of the Folds? <note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> But we return presently, say you,

into the Way. well: But who, I beseech you, calls you back? Your own will, or the grace of him, that hath mercy? I see that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I praise it, but to whom is this praise due? To the strength of your will, or to free mercy? And now I would have you teach me what this running of yours deserves. You only look at how much you proceed in running, but you do not also take heed how much you fail in your race. And after all these things do you yet boast of your merits, as if the reward of the Everlasting state were due to your Labours? In which assertions I do not drive at this, to dissolve the Pious endeavours of making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, or to dishearten them by desperation.</p>
               <p>For the Admonition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is not in vain; so run that ye <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 2 Tim. 2.</note> may obtain. And again: no Man is Crowned, except he strive Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Let us therefore so strive, that we may be Crowned, let us so run that we may obtain. But we do not therefore obtain, because we run; but we do therefore run, because the promise is made to them that run, not to them that slumber: So that the running is not the cause <note place="margin">The promise is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, because we run: But we do therefore run because the promise is made. 1 Cor. 15. 2 Tim. 4.</note> of the promise, but the promise stirs up to running, and adds ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity to the runners. Therefore the Apostle that he may make them the more valiant in striving, adds this promise, your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. And speaking of himself, I have fought, saith he, the good fight, and a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95561:135"/>
Crown of Righteousness is laid up for me, &amp;c. What then, do you not see that labours well performed, have their own reward due to them?</p>
               <p>Be it so indeed: But we treat not here of the labours of Men, but of the merits of Labours, we do not ask, with what rewards the goodness of God dignifies us, but what we our selves deserve <note place="margin">Difference between Gift and Merit.</note> to receive. For there is no small difference between Gift and Merit. If Merit is called that, to which a recompense of reward is due by reason of its equality, it is certain there is no equality between those things which we do here on Earth, and those things which being promised we expect in Heaven. The Inheritance of the Everlasting Kingdom is promised, not that which upon the account of hire is due to our Works, but which is promised to our Faith by the free gift of God.</p>
               <p>Whence <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said the wages of Sin his Death, he doth not add next there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the reward of them that live Godly is Life Eternal: But the grace, saith he, or the gift of God is Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>And why doth he not as well say, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Righteousness is Eternal Life? But that the difference between gift and reward, between grace and recompence might be evident. For if it is of <note place="margin">Rom. 6.

Riches of Divine Grace towards us through Christ Iesus: He Proclaims openly that we are saved through Grace by Faith. And that not of our selves, it is the gift of God, not of Works, lest any Man should boast. Which also elsewhere inculcating more clearly, He says, not by works of Righteousness which we have done: How then? But according to his mercy hath he saved us.</p>
               <p>And now what is that mercy, but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and loving kindness of God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the rigour of Iustice, spares those that are unworthy, pardons the penitent, receives them that are undone into favour, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or mercy also glories against Iudgment?

By the Law? But that works Wrath? By the works of the Law? But the Apostle expresly excludes those: Not of works, lest any Man should boast. But here I call to mind the ordinary <hi>Glosse,</hi> which doth resolve no difficulty, but makes one, by it's subtile comment, partly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are justified by works, and partly denying it. For thus it says, our works, as they are ours, have no power to justifie, yet consider them as they are not from us, but are wrought by God in us through Grace, they merit Iustification. And for that cause the Apostle would not say, the wages of Righteousness is Eternal Life: But chose rather to say, the grace of God is Eternal Life. Why so? Because, saith this device, those merits, to which Eternal Life is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not from us, but they come from grace, whence they receive the vertue of meriting: O wise, yea rather wild talk to vilifie grace? What if the Spirit of Christ
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95561:137"/>
influencing the Hearts of his own, stirs up the Holy Offices of Charity, and excellent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Piety? What doth not the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit also vouchsafe all other gifts to his Church, bestowing on some gifts of Prophesie, on others divers kinds of Tongues, on others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Vertues of Curing and Healing; and on others of Teaching, for the Edification of the Saints. What shall we therefore place our whole Iustification in those gifts received from Christ?</p>
               <p>I know that there are both many and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vertues, wherewith the Spirit of Christ always adorns his Church; but it is one thing to adorn, another thing to justifie the Church. The gift of Sanctification is one thing, the cause of justifying is another: both whereof, though Christ perform by his grace, yet he Sanctifies one way, and Iustifies another, for he Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies by his Spirit; but he Saves and Iustifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Death and Blood: But you will say, if Salvation is not placed in Grace, why then is the grace of God called by <hi>Paul</hi> Eternal Life? Verily it is certain, and must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, that our Life must be attributed wholly unto grace, to which also it behoves us to attribute all other things. But we must look what way this grace saves and justifies; for it is that on which the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy depends: In which the generality of the adversaries are greatly deceived.</p>

                  <p>It is Demonstrated by the Scriptures, that the grace of God whereby we are Iustified, consists only in the free favour of God, and Remission of sins, not in the Merits of Works, or Infusion of Charity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Aquinas,</hi> and they that follow him, according to the gloss which they call ordinary, do not deny that <note place="margin">Tho. Aqui. lib. 2. sent. dist. 26. q. 6.</note> which the Apostle affirms, That we are saved by the Grace of God: But if you ask after what manner: they answer, that it comes to pass upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">

For these are the words of the Gloss: Grace, says it, is called Eternal Life, because it is rendered to those Merits, which grace hath conferred. And to the same Sense are the Comments of <hi>Orbelius, Bonaventure, Halensis,</hi> and others, because, say they, without grace no Man can observe the Commands of God. And <hi>Thomas</hi> adds elsewhere, that to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Commands of the Law according to the due manner, Grace is necessarily requisite, to wit, to fulfill them with that Charity that ought to be, by which the fulfilling of them becomes Meritorious.

Verily the Christian Doctrine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us far otherways; for though we confess that which is reasonable: That the Divine Grace is never idle, but always stirs up the minds of the Regenerate to the best things; yet these Works are never of so great value, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them unto Eternal Life, which is freely promised by God, not to them that Work, but to them that Believe; or if Salvation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them that Work, it is not therefore promised because they Work: But they that truly believe, do therefore Work, because Salvation is promised. <note place="margin">Salvation is promised to them that Work, not for the sake of the Works themselves.</note> Therefore Iustification first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the most direct Order, as the cause of good Fruits, but that is not effected by these: But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists only of the free favour of him that confers it upon them, not upon the account of them that Merit, but upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account; to wit, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the most bountiful Father of his <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> own Will, hath given to us, Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing, his only begotten Son, who hath fulfilled the Law for us, and hath satisfied the Iustice of God for our Unjustice. For herein consists all our Salvation, and the Efficacy of Divine Grace, and the praise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">In what thing chiefly the Efficacy of Divine Grace appears.</note> appears very evidently, Not that we in the mean while being idle, should do nothing; but that doing all things, we should Attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our selves, imputing all to the Mercy of God.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:95561:138"/>
               <p>Which things that they may be confirmed with the greater evidence and certainty, let us compare them with the most sure Oracles of Sacred Scripture. And <note place="margin">Examples of Divine Grace are produced out of the Scriptures. AdamGen. 3.</note> First, beginning at the very first Head of that Book, let us consider <hi>Adam,</hi> that Miserable Progenitor, and Overturner of our Nature. Who when he had both privately and publickly destroyed both himself and us all, by an abominable Wickedness, received at length the most Blessed Tidings of the promised Seed. What could the bounty of God have promised more firmly, or given more largely to any Man, though he had been most Holy? And what did that first and chiefest sinner deserve to receive? <hi>Abraham</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Abraham. Gen. 12.</note> to leave his Native Country, and to go out whither God called him, thereunto was added a very glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of giving him an Inheritance, and he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed him that called him. The promiser did not fail, he was increased and enriched above measure; but if I ask, by what Merit of his own, what can the Admirers of Works answer me here?

his Brethren, who were in danger to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for Hunger, though they had very inhumanly Conspired his Destruction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he only furnish them with plenty of Corn, but also promoted them to great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

Because the <hi>Israelites</hi> were more in number: I suppose it was not so: was it because they were stronger? Neither was that the cause: What, did they then excell all the other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Vertues? Yea, what Nation was ever

more perverse? But you will say, they obliged God to befriend them by observance of his Worship. Yea, how often and how grievously did they exasperate God with their sins? How wickedly did they murmur against their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and so provoked the anger of God against themselves? How often was the Clemency of God by their Perfidious Rebellion, Wicked Contrivances, Untractable Stubbornness, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Concupiscence and Perverseness, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, but also almost overcome, so that he would have utterly destroyed the Rebellious People with all their Posterity, unless <hi>Moses,</hi> the meekest of Men, by Humble Prayer with hands lifted up, had turned the provoked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God into Mercy? But it is better to take notice, what the <note place="margin">The Land of promise, the Victory of the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> Deut. 9.</note> Lord himself speaks against this People with his own Mouth: Say not, saith he, in thy Heart, when the Lord thy God shall destroy those Nations before thee; For my Righteousness the Lord brought me in, to possess this Land, whereas those Nations were destroyed for their own Abominations: For thou shalt not enter in to possess their Lands, for thy own Righteousness, nor for the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Heart, but because they did wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, they were destroyed at thy entring in: And that the Lord might fulfill the Word which he promised by Oath to thy Fathers, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> Know therefore, that the Lord thy God hath not given thee this Land for thy Righteousness, for thou art a stiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Ye have heard the naked and simple Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but yet true, of the thing that came to pass, and not only true, but also much <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.

If all things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them, as the Apostle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, under a figure, what else should we judge concerning this History, but that under the History, lies hid a more hidden Mystery: For it can not be doubted, that this Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was promised to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Represents those Celestial and Immortal Mansions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance above, which if it be true, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the truth with this figure and shadow, the Antitype with the Type. Iust as they, not being helped by any Merites, of their own, yea, contrary to all their Merits, neither for any peculiar cause in them, but through the singular favour of God promising, and for the sake of the Fathers, to whom it was promised by Oath, received by gift the possession of the Country that flowed with Milk and Honey: So also we should Iudge of the Heavenly Country of Immortality: That it is not due to any Vertues or Works of ours, but that it comes to us by the free promise of God, for the sake of his Son, into whose hands all things are given, that are in Heaven and in Earth.</p>

we may proceed in the Sacred Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Scripture, what shall I now: say of those, who being bitten by Serpents, had no other way of Recovery, but by the Serpent set up upon a pole? Again what shall I say of those in the Prophet <hi>Ionah;</hi> who being in dreadful danger, as soon as they had thrown out <hi>Ionah,</hi> and had committed him <note place="margin">The <hi>Hebrews</hi> recover their Health by looking on the Serpent. <hi>Ionas</hi> a Type of Christ, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lives of his own by his Death.</note> to the mercy of the Waters, the Tempest being presently quieted, escaped safe with the Ship? What else do all these Arguments teach, but that casting away confidence in all other things, and distrusting our selves, we may account that all the help for our obtaining Salvation, is placed in no other thing or vertue, but in his death only, who by his Blood, hath Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled all things both in Heaven and in Earth. How often in the Psalms, in the Prophers, in the Gospel, doth the Scripture, shutting up all under fin, take away from Man not only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but oft-times drives the Holiest unto this by an acknowledgment of his own unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that he acknowledges his Salvation to be placed, not in those things that are given, but those that are forgiven to him by God. For as touching the name of Merit or Reward, if it be found any where (for it is found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) let no Man from hence flatter himself, as if God owed it to any Man: But let him know rather, upon what account he is said to do that: not because the Deeds, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are imperfect, deserve life (yea, which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95561:141"/>
rather stand in need of Pardon:) But because the bounty of God imputes these Works, such as they are for Merits to them who Work: Why so? To wit, because they are the Works of the Faithful; who, if they were <note place="margin">The Pious Works of Believers are impured for Merits, not according to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riess, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Grace.</note> not Believers, their Merits would have no room at all, nor be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny value in the sight of God. As if a Father say to a Son, if so be thou lovest Learning, thou shalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing of me, and be my dearly beloved Son: By this Speech the Father doth not so oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Son, as if for no other cause, but for performing Obedience, he would receive him to himself for a Son, yea, because he is a Son; therefore the Father commands what he will, and the Son performs what he ought. God useth sometimes thus to propose a Recompense and Rewards to the Regenerate, whereby we may be stirred up to do well: And there is no doubt but the Rewards promised, will follow the office performed.</p>
               <p>But in the mean while let us see to whom this promise was made, and for what cause it was made; of which thing let us understand what is the Opinion of <hi>Osorius:</hi> God <hi>hath promised,</hi> faith he, <hi>to all that live <note place="margin">Osor. de Iust. lib. 6. p. 150.</note> righteously, great wealth, exceeding great pleasures, and an immortal Kingdom, very great dignity, everlasting glory,</hi> &amp;c. There are many faults in these vicious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and that is none of the least, which is committed by making a division not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95561:141"/>
sufficient: In which kind <hi>Osorius</hi> offends here: For whereas there are two kinds of promises very much differing <note place="margin">Legal promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Evangelical promises.</note> from one another; the one beliong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, being annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain conditions; the other belonging to the Gospel, being free, without all condition of Law. The whole discourse of <hi>Osorius</hi> is so taken up in that Legal kind, that he doth not so much as make mention of the other. God hath promised, says he, to all that live righteously, &amp;c. That is true indeed, if we look to those <note place="margin">Romans 2.</note> things that belong to the Law: For the Law, as it hath its threatnings, so also it hath its promises proposed to them that live unblameably; in which we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do this and live. Concerning which <hi>Paul</hi> also saith, Peace and life to every one that doth good, &amp;c. So then the Law promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Gospel also promiseth, but upon a different account; for they differ in this; The promises of the Law regard the Desert of Life: But the Grace of the Gospel doth not so much regard the manner of Life, as the Faith of the Person, and measures his dignity, not by the merits of Works, but measures the merits of Works themselves, by the Faith of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and the dignity of the Object only on whom he believes. Wherefore as touching Rewards proposed in the Gospel, it is not enough to look only on the things themselves, which are proposed, but the consideration must be referred to the Faith and Person of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95561:142"/>
of what sort they are, whether plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ by Faith, or out of Christ, to whom the promise is made? If out of Christ they are servants and unbelievers, no promise or expectation of reward belongs to them. But if in Christ they are Sons and regenerate by Faith; then all is due to Faith, not to Works: It is of Grace, and not of Merit, whatsoever the Father either promises his Sons for Love's sake, or imputes unto them in the place of a reward. And indeed this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in which all the confidence of our Salvation is contained, proceeds from the grace and favour of God only; and also it must be considered, that there <note place="margin">Imputation twofold.</note> is a twofold kind of Imputation with God; the one, whereby the Righteousness of Christ is ascribed to us, and when for his sake, our petty duties are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for great, and recompensed with the highest rewards; the other, when he doth not punish, but pardon great crimes in his own that are regenerate: Concerning which the Apostle said, God was <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. Romans 4. Psalm 32.</note> in Christ reconciling the World to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. But the Sons of the Papacy do in no ways endure this Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why so? <hi>Andradius</hi> together with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius</hi> and the <hi>Colognists</hi> think it an unworthy thing, that any man should be called righteous by another man's Righteousness, <note place="margin">Andrad. lib. 6. Orthod. Explic. pag. 477. 454.</note> which is not inherent in himself. <hi>Tiletanus</hi> cries that it is more than

As if a man should call <hi>Cicero</hi> couragious with the Courage which is not in himself, but in the mind of <hi>Achilles.</hi> To whom that I may answer, this cavilling would take place, if our affair were carried on by Nature, and not by Grace; if by Law, and not by Redemption.</p>
               <p>I know that our Debt is infinite, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof the Law doth necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us. Neither do I deny that we are not able to pay, nor will ever be able to pay that debt, if our ability be considered. But what if some rich King intervene, who paying the debt that was owing, gets himself a right to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted Citizens, and having freed them from all obligation, makes them subject to his own command; what will those furious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate pleaders for Works say here? May we not enjoy the bounty of another, because we have no ability of our own? what, will they say that no payment is <note place="margin">By the Law it is reckoned that he did a thing, who does it by another.</note> just, but what is paid with a man's own money. That which is done by a Friend for the sake of a Friend, is it not just as if it had been done by himself? If that which was due from us, be paid by the price of Christ, is there any Law so cruel as to exact the same debt of us again? and what will the Adversaries require more here? that he should be condemned for unjust, whosoever hath no
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95561:143"/>
Righteousness of his own: And indeed I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be true in Iudicatories, if no Redemption intervene, which may satisfie in the room of another. But now seeing our Affairs are in such a condition, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, hath nothing that it can demand of us; I think that is a sufficient Plea for us, which was done by him, who made satisfaction for us. But these men do again cry out against us, saying that it cannot be by Nature, and that it is no less contrary to all natural Reason, that any thing should take its being from that form, which is not its own, but another's.</p>
               <p>I answer, That it is true indeed formally, as to the essence of a thing, but not judicially: For tho' the Righteousness of another, which is not inherent in us, cannot render us essentially just, who are by Nature unjust: But nothing hinders but the Righteousness of another may help our Righteousness, according to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Imputation; just as nothing hinders, but the Riches of another may be cast upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Poverty, by a certain Communion or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of good things; so that he who in himself is poor, yet may be esteemed rich in another: And not unlike unto this is our Communion of mutual Imputation with Christ; for as our sins being imputed to Christ, were hurtful to him, even unto the damage of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; so by the like Mystery of dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Righteousness of Christ being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and imputed to us, though it doth not inhere in us essentially, yet in respect of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95561:143"/>
and dispensation of Iudgment it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to us for a reward of Life, just as if it had been our own Righteousness; for otherways to what purpose is Christ said to have done and suffered all these things for us, if what he did and suffered, serve not for our advantage? But if they serve for our advantage, why cannot those things be justly accounted for ours, which were undertaken in our name, and for our sake? If the name of Imputation doth so greatly offend them, which they think doth not well agree with Christian Piety, wherefore then doth <hi>Paul</hi> so often seem in his Writings not only to use this word Imputation, but to delight in it? But afterwards, Christ willing, <note place="margin">There is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in <hi>Paul's</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> we shall discourse of this matter more largely in its own place.</p>

            <p>YE have heard then of Grace and Merits, of free Imputation and Remission of sins, on which depends all our Iustification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: But now seeing this Remission, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I speak, must be received by Faith only, it remains that we should in this place treat somewhat of Faith, especially for this cause, either that we may confute the Calumnies of Adversaries, or that if it be possible, we may help the Errors of those, that are so great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to this manner of Iustifying, which we affirm to consist of Faith only, without Works.</p>
            <p>Upon which kind of Doctrine, if we only, or first of all Men should stand, I should less wonder at so great Tumults of these Men.</p>
            <p>But seeing Christ himself, and <hi>Paul</hi> and the Prophets and Apostles profess themselves to be not only Witnesses, but also the Authors and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95561:144"/>
Leaders in this Opinion, whereby we are taught, that we are justified only by Faith in the Son; when every one of the most Learned Writers and Interpreters, who were of the Primitive Antiquity, attest the same with unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, from whose Instructions we our selves also have learned the same, what is come to those Popish Wits, why they should <note place="margin">Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, imputed for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> oppofe themselves so unreasonably and so fiercely? And now let us consider what that is which so much offends them. <hi>Luther</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that Faith is imputed unto Righteousness without Works. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle taught the same before <hi>Luther:</hi> What will <hi>Osorius</hi> say to me here? what will the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> himself say? what will the Senatours of <hi>Trent</hi> say? To wit, that good Works must be joyned with it. What, must all good Works be joyned with it, or not; if they shall say all, where will they find those that have compleated this exact cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopedy of Vertues in this Life, except the Son of God only? But if they understand it of most, or some good Works at least, yet that will not be sufficient. For unless every one of the Vertues joyned together as it were in a mutual Bond, are united for Righteousness, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit at all being separate: Who ever lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Neighbour as himself, according to the Prescript of the Law? But suppose there were some such Man: What <note place="margin">Wherefore Worksare se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Iustification.</note> if such a Man rages with Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of the Flesh or Eyes, though the inward mind doth not consent?
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95561:145"/>
what if the mind swells with self-love, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows with the pride of Life? what if it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved unto Covetousness, or some where fails in its duty? what advantage will it be to be observant of Charity? Briefly, what if it be so, that thou aboundest with all other vertues, but only failest in one command, doth not the Sentence of the Scripture condemn thee for the Violation of the Law?

The thoughts of Mortals are frightful, and uncertain of our being provided for, &amp;c. Hitherto hath <hi>Thomas</hi> spoken. From all which it remains, that Iustification confists either in Faith only, as in the next cause: Or that the Accession of our Vertues, which are neither perfect nor intire, do not at all avail to Righteousness before God, but rather to accusation: For Cursed is every one that abides not in all things, <note place="margin">Deut. 27. Galat. 3.</note> that are commanded in the Book of the Law to do them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What is the proper Nature and Definition of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95561:145"/>
Faith, whereby we are justified before God, is enquired into from sure and true Foundations of Scripture.</p>
            <p>By the many things which we have hitherto discoursed of grace, and its gifts, I think there is a sufficient defence made against the assaults of Sophisters, for the guarding of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which assigns all the power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying to Faith only, through the free mercy of God: But because I see it is not clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough amongst Divines, what that Faith is whereof we speak, I thought it requisite to speak something of it in this place: To wit, that having surveyed the Opinions of others, and rightly explained those things which seem to need distinction about the manifold homony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of this Word, we may at length be led as it were by the footstepsof the word of God, to that true Faith, which truly and simply justifies us.</p>
            <p>But because the word Faith is used in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Senses, and there are many things that are believed by us, (for <note place="margin">The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Faith.</note> whatsoever things we find to be true and sure, we presently give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to them) but yet any sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion setled in the mind, though it be true, or any sort of truth about things conceived, doth not therefore upon that account justifie before God.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this so great diversity of things to be believed, we must see what that Faith is, whereof all our Salvation and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before God consists, and what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and simple definition thereof; whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95561:146"/>
its power to justifie, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and in what Notions it differs from that Faith which our Adversaries hold. Which state of Faith, if it had been rightly and definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen into by our Divines, I am either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or else those boasting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of Works would wholly <note place="margin">Errour and disturbauce among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the wrong defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith.</note> change that Opinion, or at least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate themselves more in this matter of disputation. But now I know not how it comes to pass, that whereas no kind of Doctrine either more admirable for dignity, or more excellent for use, or more happy for the Salvation of Men hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned forth, or that moreover appears more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously to the Eyes of all Men by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Testimonies of Evangelical Scripture, yet there is no opinion that hath more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or more bitter Adversaries: Which whence it comes to pass, I can not be satisfied in wondering, unless that whereof I spake, be the cause thereof, because they seem not to have discerned aright by the Gospel, what that Faith is to which free Iustification is proposed: Which may appear evidently by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and such as are not at all obscure unto him that reads- their Writings, Collections, Articles, Councils, and Disputes: And in this very Rank <hi>Osorius</hi> comes first, and next <hi>Hosius,</hi> one of his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">Osorius.

what ignorance is this? What kind of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance? that drawing your pen against your Adversary, whom you cannot run down by true Reasons, you carp at things not understood, and you wound the Innocent with false Accusations? where I beseech you, <note place="margin">Luther is falssy tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Osor. li. 2. pa. 32.</hi>
               </note> did <hi>Luther</hi> either Teach or Dream of this Faith, which you feign he holds: <hi>To wit, that every one obtains Righteousness,</hi> or is justified upon that account only, because he determines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>acceptable to God;</hi> for these are your words, and not yours only: For <hi>Hosius</hi> also harps no less upon the same string, together with you, and the whole hundreds of almost all the Divines of that Class.</p>
            <p>I know that <hi>Luther</hi> hath discoursed many things gravely and excellently of Faith, and freely saving <hi>Righteousness of Faith.</hi> But he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands this Faith which justifies us, much otherways than your accusation pretends. Who was ever so mad, as that he judged Faith to be confined within these limits, and that it is no other thing, but that every Man should have a very good opinion of his own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and should be strongly persuaded thereof in his own mind.</p>
            <p>Though in the mean while, I deny not that there is always joined with Faith a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of good hope, yet if we will rightly examin the proper Natures and Causes of things, we will find that there is no small difference between Hope and Faith. For every Man doth not obtain Righteousness,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95561:147"/>
upon the account that he is very couragious in hoping well. For otherways, what <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Iew</hi> is there, who doth not in his own mind catch at a goodly persuasion about his own Salvation, and the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways joined with Faith a confidence of good hope.</note> favour of God? We may also add unto these the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by a certain Magnifical, but most vain, hope flattering himself doubts not of his being the only Successour of <hi>Peter.</hi> So also the Papists, doubt not but as soon as they have whispered their Sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ears of a Priest by a silent Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that immediately they go away Pardoned after the performance of this Work; and when they put the Innocent Servants of Christ to Death or the Faith, they do not at all distrust that they do God Service, whereas the matter is far otherways.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is requisite to see, not what every Man hopes, but how rightly he hopes: nor how great his hope is, but how true. The same also must <note place="margin">Confidence and hope ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies justifying Faith, but doth not it self justifie. It is requisite to see, not how great Faith and Hope is, but how true.</note> be done in Faith: But that it may appear true, it should not be measured by Human Opinion, but according to the right Rule of Scripture. Neither is it only requisite to look, what any one promiseth, but to whom and for what it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. There are wonderful and infinite things, which the bounty of God promises in the way of free gift. For Salvation and Life Eternal
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95561:147"/>
is promised. Yet these good things are not therefore promised, because they are hoped by us; but we therefore hope because they are promised. So then Hope doth not go before the promise, as a cause, and make it, but follows it as an effect, and it depends upon the promise, and not the promise upon it. By which you see that it is not Hope, no not, when it is most right, that justifies us, and renders us capable of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God: But some other <note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.

What is that, I beseech you, but Faith, to which properly the promise is made? For the Covenant of Eternal Life is made properly with us believing, and not only hoping, that is not for the sake of that which is hoped, but for the sake of that, on which Faith relies.</p>

For every Faith doth not avail for Iustification, because there are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95561:148"/>
many and divers kinds of believing: First there is a Faith, whereby we both know that God is; and fear him: and the Devils themselves are not without this Faith. There is another Faith whereby we believe God and give certain credit to his promises. The Schoolmen add unto these a third kind of believing, whereby we are said to believe in God. And this Faith they divide variously into a formed and formless Faith: into an habitual and actual faith. There is also a faith, that is often taken for hope, and so defined: As in the Epistle to the <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Where Faith is called the substance of things not seen, but hoped for, and the evidence of things not appearing, but future.</p>
               <p>Moreover there are those that divide the use of this Word into many forms. <hi>Andreas Vega,</hi> reckons in the general Nine Significations of the word of Faith. <note place="margin">

                  </note> Put because in these which I have hitherto reckoned, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of that person, from whom all the Vertue of Iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeds, therefore I see not how it can be, that Iustification should rightly agree to the same. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this seems less strange to me in <hi>Osorius, Hosius,</hi> and others of that School; if their Opinion is not so right about the Iustification of Faith, for they seem not to have clearly enough discerned, or at least not to have fitly defined that Faith, which the Evangelical VVritings propose unto us.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:95561:148"/>
               <p>But if this Faith, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, contained no other thing in it, <note place="margin">It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Faith as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Papists does not Iustifie.</note> but that which they pretend to in their Books, I would be of the same Opinion, which they Preach: To wit, That it avails little to the procuring of Righteousness. That this may be the more evident, I would have Pious Readers listen to what those Men teach concerning Faith, and how they define it. And so they define it, that either through blindness they know not, or by dissimulation they make as if they knew not, what is the true Faith proposed to us in the Gospel for Righteousness. And that we may begin first at the <hi>Tridentines,</hi> they so define it, That <hi>it is a firm assent unto those things, that are revealed, and made manifest by God.</hi> And <hi>Osorius</hi> following these Men Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith in <hi>Osor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 46.</note> the Universal Nature of Faith after a manner not much differing from them, That <hi>it is a firm and constant assent of the mind, stirred up by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Speaker.</hi>

               <p>But what this Faith is, which <hi>Osorius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes after this manner, let him look to that. Verily any Man may think it is not this Faith, which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, in disputing of Righteousness, or <note place="margin">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95561:149"/>
whereby, for the Authority of the Church teaching, we believe whatsoever things belong to Religion; which though they are not seen, as <hi>Lombard</hi> says, yet <note place="margin">What Faith is according to <hi>Osorius</hi> and the Papists.</note> they are believed whether they are past, or expected to come. As he that gives credit to the things contained in the Articles of the Creed, and that are expresly mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: He that believes and professes, that the World was made by the Word of God, and that God is, and that he Created all things of no thing.</p>
               <p>

For the things that are seen by an Internal light of Faith are very true, though they are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Senses.</p>
               <p>But yet this is not the Faith, though it be true, that justifies us, <note place="margin">Not every Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending true things justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</note> who are miserably defiled and wretched Sinners, before God. For what Circumcised <hi>Iew,</hi> or hateful <hi>Turk</hi> is there, but believes

all these things, which <hi>Osorius,</hi> with a long multiplication of words, Preaches of God, and his Power, and Iustice, and Immensity? For they together with us confess one God, and rely on his promises with great hope, call upon his Name, observe his commands as well as we, and also flatter themselves with the Title of the true Church; Yea, also they are not Ignorant that the Dead shall be restored to Life, and promise E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life to themselves: Moreover many things, which they see not with their Eyes, they retain. by Faith, and pursue by hope. Briefly, they do no less believe God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and confess God. But if the Christian Faith, according to the Magisterial position of <hi>Lombard,</hi> should be placed in nothing else, but a solid apprehension of things to be hoped for, and a sure expectation of those things, which do not appear, what hinders, but that both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> may be reckoned faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon this account.</p>
               <p>What then, you will say, Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Faith is this which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Verily, I neither reject <hi>Paul</hi> the Author of this Epistle, nor disapprove the definition, neither do I examin that, nor do so much as enquire for it, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for in <hi>Lombard:</hi> Whether this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription be more agreeable to Faith than Hope? But this I answer: That we may
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95561:150"/>
confess this Faith to be true, which is here defin'd. But surely that is not the Faith which properly justifies the wicked in the sight of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Why so? Because there is wanting to the definition, the <hi>Genus,</hi> Property, and difference, which distinguishes Faith from Hope. Also, there is wanting the true and proper object of Faith, which should by no means have been omitted; To wit, The person of him, in whom only all the promises of God, and the whole cause of our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is contained. Who unless <note place="margin">Faith looks upon the promise, but yet not upon this only, but rather ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object, whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> he comes in, in vain other things are either believed or hoped for by us, neither will all that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of things hoped for, avail us any whit unto Salvation. What then, you will say, Hath not the most gracious Father promised us his mercy? Hath he not engaged himself by an inviolable Covenant that he would pardon our Sins? Must we not give credit to those things, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by God? He hath promised indeed, I confess, but how? Only in Christ his Son. To whom? Only to them that believe in the Son. I know and acknowledge that the promises of God are most sure, in which he promises as <hi>Osorius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Osor. lib. 6. Nu. 150. Lib. 5. Num. 21.</note> rehearses; <hi>Infinite Riches, excellent Pleasure, an immortal Kingdom, great Dignity, everlasting Glory.</hi> But yet these good things are neither
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95561:150"/>
so promised or given by God, that in the mean while he exacts nothing of us for the obtaining of these good things which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Therefore this is not the state of the question, whether we should believe God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, which is common to us with the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves and <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do I ask that, what the Lord hath promised: For Salvation is promised, Pardon of Sins is promised: But this is it which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly comes in question here: Upon what account, and for what cause, this Salvation and Pardon of Sins is promised, whether there is no condition interposed? Or whether there is some condition? But I think there is none, can say, there is no condition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains that we confess there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily some condition. Which of what manner it is, let us examin by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But in the mean while perhaps some Man will object: If the promise of God be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to certain conditions, how then shall we with <hi>Paul</hi> make the <note place="margin">A Question.

Yea verily, I both judge and hold that the Mercy of God is most free: Free, I say, in Christ. Otherways without Christ there can be no hope of Mercy, nor promise of Salvation, nor remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins. And the Sons of the Papacy will not deny this that all the riches of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine promise and of our Salvation stand in Christ. And indeed in so much they are in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:95561:151"/>

That is right indeed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I am not mistaken, this is it, which I see those Men drive at; that all our hope of Salvation is placed in the performance of the Law: And that the Summary of the Divine promise, is contained in that condition, if we perform the things that pertain to the Law: Which because they cannot be performed without Supernatural Infusion of <note place="margin">Andrad.

               <head>Concerning the Formal cause of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</head>
               <p>AND that is no less false, which they most vainly dream concerning a formal cause; which is easily confuted after this manner. First, that we may grant this, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity should be reckoned amongst <note place="margin">Charity is in part as the Saints often teach.</note> the chiefest gifts of God, which being so often praised by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, cannot be praised enough by any Man, yet never was there given to any Man in this life so great an excellency therein, that he should fulfill all the Righteousness of the Law. Whence because charity of life, as they call it, is imperfect, (for we love in part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theMagisterial Sentence,) that can neither be called Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sentent. lib. 3. dist. 31.</hi> Charity does not go before Faith, but follows after it, neither doth it form Faith, but it is informed by Faith.</note> nor be the form of Faith. Unto this there is added another reason, because when it is given most largely, yet Charity is never given for this end, that it may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us in the sight of God, nor that it may inform faith, but rather that it self may be informed by faith, and may be subservient to faith, for Works of Charity are fruits of faith, not the cause of faith, they follow, but do not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith.</p>

Where is that grace, which the Sacraments confer upon us, <hi>ex opere oper ato?</hi> By what Argument now will <hi>Andrew Vega</hi> defend this. Axiom of his? Faith, says he, and other good Works, whereby we are disposed unto grace that makes us acceptable, and whereby we are formally justified, and made acceptable to God, are Meritorious by the way of agreeableness of such grace, and of our Iustification, &amp;c. Whence it is evident, that either Christ is not the only Meritorious cause of such grace, or that all the other helps of Merits are of no value. Though in the mean while, I do not deny that the death of Christ is truly Meritorious; but let the adversaries consider diligently what it hath merited: That the spiritual help, say they, of Divine Grace and Charity to perform the Law. might be diffused into us. What then? Dyed Christ for no other cause. but that he might obtain the gift of Charity for Mortal <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. Colos. 2.</note> Men to perform the Law? Did he not rather dye upon this account, that he might blot out the Hand writing which was against us in the Law, having nailed it to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he might take away the Enmity, and might destroy Death for ever; might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess

the Devil of his Kingdom, that there might be food and sustenance for our hunger; that he might make Principalities and Powers subject to his Triumpham Dominion, that he might take possession of all Power in Heaven and in Earth. What, if the power of Charity to perform the Law is so great, as they preach, could not this Charity otherways get entrance, unless the Son of God dyed? Yea, were not the Patriarchs, Prophets, and many others of the Saints adorned with the same supernatural gifts? Moreover, since the Death of Christ, is there so great an influence of <note place="margin">Charity infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of Christ.</note> Grace present with any man, that he is able to fulfil all Righteousness? Because the Merit of Christ is perfect, it is necessary that those things also should be perfect, which he hath merited for us by his most perfect price. But on the contrary, my Opinion is, that I think Christ to be indeed the meritorious cause of our Iustification, and that he is not so much the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <note place="margin">Christ only is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause of Iustification.</note> as the efficient cause of our Renovation, seeing it is he that baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with Fire. Suppose we grant that this Charity flows in upon us by the Merit of Christ, yet I do not therefore call this same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Grace a cause of meriting Iustification, nor any part of a cause thereof; but it seems rather fit to be reckoned amongst the effects and fruits of Iustification, which follow from thence; neither doth it follow, because the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95561:155"/>
works of Grace and Charity come to us by the Merit of Christ, that therefore the same do merit Iustification before God; for it relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no condition of works at all, but only the promise, and that a free one also; and so free, that it implies no condition except one only. And because in this place we enquire what is that only and peculiar condition, the <note place="margin">The promise of God unto Salvation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon one condition only.</note> Doctrine of the Gospel will easily teach us, if so be we are more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hearken to the Gospel, than to the Opinions of <hi>Trent.</hi>

In the mean while that is a very ridiculous thing, and too barbarous, that the Pope in his Decretals reduces the Object of Faith to the Keys and Succession <note place="margin">

                  <head>A Question.</head>
                  <p>Whether only relyance on Mercy justifies of it self?</p>
                  <p>Verily as for my part I am not, <note place="margin">Assurance of Salvation is necessatily joyned with Faith.</note> nor ever was the man that would be, prejudicial to another man's Opinion: I allow that every man should be persuaded in his own mind; I hinder it not. But if I am permitted freely to profess in a free Church, what my Opinion is, my reason leads me to think that this relyance on Mercy, and assurance of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promised, must be a thing very nearly joyned with Faith, and which every man ought to apply to himself; but then when it is most applied, it is not that which properly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely unloads us of our sins, and justifies us before God; but that there is some other thing proposed in Gospel, which by Nature should in some respect go before this assurance, and justifie us in the sight of God. For Faith in the person of the Son, which reconciles us to God, doth necessarily go before. And then relyance on most assured Mercy follows this Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which none of those that believe in Christ can doubt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But you may say, What, doth not Mercy promised in Christ go before the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith? doth not the same Mercy freely justifie Believers? Moreover seeing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95561:157"/>
of God are most sure, may not the same be safely and constantly trusted in?</p>
                  <p>That I may answer these men: <note place="margin">An Answer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> Indeed the Mercy of God moves first; no man doubts of that, which is the cause and original of all good things. But it is not that which is matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in this place, Whether Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on God's part is the Mother of <note place="margin">Mercy the first cause of our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on God's part.</note> our Iustification; but what that is on our part, which hath power with God for our Reconciliation; whether relyance on Mercy, or Faith in the Person of the Son. I know that the Mercy of God is immense and infinite, in which is comprehended all the Election of the Saints. Neither am I ignorant that those things are most sure, which are proposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Articles of the Creed; than which, as nothing is more sure, so neither is there any thing, which any man ought to doubt of about the assurance of those things, which are promised, or concerning the <note place="margin">On our part are consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed relyance on the Mercy promised, and Faith in the Person of the Mediatour.</note> faithfulness of the Promiser.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95561:158"/>
Son was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, not at all distrusting him that promised, and it is accounted a praise to him: What then?

There are so many engagements of promises in both Covenants, which if the Divine Truth would not have made sure unto us, why then would he have them written in the Word, and recorded in Books? Briefly, why are we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Christian Articles of Faith to believe the remission of sins, the Resurrection of the flesh, and Life Eternal, but that we might reckon those things to be most sure unto us, which are inserted in the Articles? Therefore that is false, which <hi>Hosius</hi> affirms, That no man is bound to believe firmly, or to hold assuredly either concerning himself, or this man or that man, that his sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him for Christ's sake; that he is in a state of grace, and that he is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly to possess the Kingdom of <note place="margin">Hosius lib. 1. confut. p. 15.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95561:158"/>
and is not without an impudent calumny. For we are not of such an Opinion, as to believe that an assured persuasion of Mercy should by any means be separated from Iustifying Faith, (which the Divines of the Popish way do abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably:) neither again do we transfer properly the very cause of Iustification into this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and naked application of Marcy, (as they falsly slander us.) Why so? because, yet some other thing is wanting, which must needs go before this application of the Promise, and which is necessarily required to the true cause of Iustifying.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The cause of Iustification depends not on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, or the application of Mercy only.</head>

If you say on God's part, it is true; if you ask on our part, you must go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and something seems to be necessarily joyned with the Promise. Now that we may set the thing more evidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes; God promises Salvation to his own, and that freely, and for Christ's sake. That indeed is most certain, and beyond all controversie.

When Salvation is promised freely for Christ's sake, shall therefore an absolute Promise save all men promiscuously for Christ's sake, without any restriction of condition? I suppose God will not save all promiscuously. Now then this Promise belonging not to all, but some certain persons only, upon some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain condition, I would know, who those are, to whom this Promise properly belongs.

Doth not this Faith only in the Person of the Son of God make us partakers of the promise? Doth not this Faith only justifie before God? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, is not this the only condition, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where the voice of Christ, and the Apostles in the Gospel, and the voice of the Prophets inculcate; which the appointment of the Father especially requires; that we should hear his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, that we should receive Christ, that we should believe in his Name, that we should flie to him by Faith, and betake our selves wholly to him, that we should believe in him, whom he hath sent, whom the Father hath sealed, that we should digest him inwardly in our minds, that we should be ingrafted into him, and should grow in him, that we should know Iesus, and him crucified only, that we should behold him only, as the Israelites of old beheld the Serpent in the Wilderness; that we should put on Christ.</p>

               <head>What is the True and Genuine Definition of Faith.</head>
               <p>BY Which so many and so evident places of Scriptute, there is no Man that cannot be most sure, what is properly <note place="margin">The Object of Faith that justifies. The Object of Faith which certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</note> the Object of that Faith which justifies us; To wit, no other thing, but the person of the Son of God: As again the object of Confidence is the promise of God. Which things being so, it will not be difficult to gather from these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, what is the true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine definition of justifying Faith, concerning which we are making enquiry: which seems, that it ought to be defined according to the right rule of the Gospel after this manner. To wit, That it is a right knowledge of the Son of God planted in our minds, <note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith whereby we are justified.</note> whereby we acknowledge a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Christ, and receive him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held forth, and with our Mouth profess him to have dyed for us, and rose again, Worship him in Spirit, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him with all our mind, together with all his benefits.</p>
               <p>And this Faith as it is a singular gift of God, so of all the gifts of God, we believe this faith is that only which justifies believers in the sight of God. To which, though assurance and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95561:160"/>
confidence of the grace of God is most nearly joyned, which is it self also sometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Faith, yet this confidence doth not properly infer the cause of Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but receives it being brought; neither doth it cause Iustification; but is rather caused by it, and renders those assured, who are justified by the Faith of Christ; but <note place="margin">Perswasion of Mercy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the faith of Christ in Order.</note> doth not it self justifie. For God doth not therefore forgive thee, and receive thee for a Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou embracest the Mercy of God with a Holy confidence; but because thou embracest his Christ with a right Faith, and confessest and lovest him, he loveth thee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we therefore believe in Christ, because we are assured of Salvation, and trust the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; but because we believe in Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we attain unto a certain hope of those things that are promised in <note place="margin">Wherein Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith and assurance do differ.</note> Christ: for Eternal Life is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to him that believes in the Son. And from hence arises that clear Distinction between Faith and Assurance; for they differ in Subjects and Objects. The Faith of Christ, which brings forth Righteousness, takes its place in the higher part of the Soul, wherein the understanding is. Assurance hath relation to those powers of the Soul, in which hope, and the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The Subject of Faith.

As touching the Objects, Assurance hath respect to the Mercy, or the promise in Christ: faith is directed to Christ himself, because he obtains Mercy for Believers.</p>

God. I come to their other Calumny, no less absurd, whereby they most unjustly slander us, as if we referred the whole cause of our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to nothing else but only an opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive assurance; so that to obtain the Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, we taught that no other thing is necessary, but that every Man should, by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial faith, be perswaded in his own mind, that his sins are forgiven him, which is most false, as there is almost nothing true in the Books of <hi>Hosius.</hi> For though we confess this to be most sure, that nothing is more sure than our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Christ; yet if the cause be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, which properly justifies us from our sins, we answer, It is faith, not whereby we believe that we are Iustified, (as <hi>Hosius</hi> chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) but whereby we believe in Christ the Son of God, who only is a propitiation for our sin.</p>

And afterwards from the same faith through consideration of free Mercy, purchased fo penitent sinners by Christ, assurance proceeds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are perswaded that God will be gracious to them for Christ's sake. And thus by this consideration of so great goodness, they begin to call upon God as the Fountain of all Righteousness, and to love him, and to cast away sin, and to endeavour after new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, and to keep the Commandments. And by this means we obtain a perfect disposition or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to Righteousness, whereby we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to prepare our Hearts to the Lord. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:95561:163"/>
Iustification follows this preparation, which is not only the Remission of sins; but also Sanctification and Renovation of the inner Man, by a voluntary accepting of grace, and gifts, whence a Man of unjust, is made just, and of an Enemy, a Friend, that he may <note place="margin">Free Will cooperating.</note> be an Heir according to the hope of Eternal Life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now, from what part of the Apostolick or Prophetick Scripture, have they taken this Doctrine? From none, neither is there need of any. The <hi>Tridentine</hi> Oracle is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Scripture. Amongst the Doctors, <hi>Canisius</hi> endeavours a valiant defence of this Decree; but he gains nothing at all. For tho' we acknowledge with <hi>Augustin,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that which cannot be deny'd, that we are Debtors to the grace of God; for all we receive, both for those things which belong to the forgiveness of sins, and also those things which belong to new Obedience: Yet what makes this for the matter we are now treating of? For the Subject matter at present, is not what the efficacious power of Divine grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in us (without which, <hi>Augustin</hi> justly pleads against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that all our strength is wholly ineffectual;) but what that is which justifies a wicked Man before God?

To wit, because all motion is denominated more from the term to which, than from the term from which: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Transmutation whereby

These things said he: and he said not amiss, if so be it be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, for suppose we grant that which must necessarily be acknowledged, that there is no Iustification of a wicked Man, without a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, and that Transmutation is not made without Remission, <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Thomas</hi> is examined.</note> and also that there is no motion without a twofold term, yet there is a twofold consideration requisite here: First, where he places his term to which? That is, where he would place this State of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? If in this life, it is false: But if in the other, it is most true: For here, by the help of Divine grace, we proceed from Vertue to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But we shall attain the term of full Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness only in the life to come. And then as touching the word Righteousness, I must ask <hi>Thomas</hi> what Righteousness he means, if he means, Human or Inherent Righteousness, whereby he thinks we are Iustified before God: I answer, That we shall never attain unto that state of Righteousness in this life: But if he understand That Righteousness which <hi>

               <p>BUT because here we fall into a debate with <hi>Thomas,</hi> about the definition of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; Out of whose Breasts the late School Divines seem to have sucked what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever poyson runs in this Controversie: It will not be unconvenient as it were by tracing his Foot-steps, to pursue the deceits of this definition by a more exact enquiry, and to confute them by just Authority, that we may as much as in us lies, bring to nothing these Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tricks. But by what reason more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, or by what authority more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall I do it, then if I oppose St. <hi>Hierom</hi> to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who I think is nothing inferior to him, as it were beating out one hard wedge with another harder wedge. Now, whereas <hi>Thomas</hi> measuring this peripatetical Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Physical Motion, he terminates it by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95561:165"/>
these bonds, to wit, That it is a Transmutation from a Term of Unrighteousness, by Remission of sins, to a Term or State of Righteousness: immediately the Divines of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> following him, snatch at this same defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and thus express it, that it is a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that State, in which Man is born a Son of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> into a State of grace and adoption of the Sons of God by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> Iesus Christ our Saviour. Though this latter definition seems to be somewhat more cautious in words, but it differs not much in the Sense, yet one answer is sufficient to both of them.</p>
               <p>And first I ask this of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and then of the <hi>Tridentines,</hi> What they mean by this motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Translation of theirs, from Term to Term, from State into State, as they teach. If this be their meaning, that we, who before were dead in sins, having our sins afterwards forgiven through Christ, and being again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into grace with God, being freed from death, and the bond of Damnation, are vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed into favour, and received unto life, and Placed in a free condition: Herein they do wholly agree with us: But if otherways, they think thus, That there is no Iustification made, but that which consists of the change of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, so that he who before was a sinner, an Evil Doer, a Deceiver, a Perjured person, an Adulterer, a Glutton and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, having changed his life now, begins to be another Man, fasts twice a week, and out of his own wealth, willingly supplies the want
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:95561:165"/>
of the needy, being forward to help all, unto the expending of the tenth part of all his goods, and so leading his life, and changed into a new Man, that he appears Iust and Holy, not by thatRighteousness, which either needsRemission, or is imputed to the bounty of the Iudge; But which by reason of true Vertues inhering by grace, is justly approved in the sight of God: What hinders, I beseech you, but upon this account the <hi>Pharisee</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> goes away justified? The Histories of the Heathen Nations abound with examples of many, who, when they had been very much corrupted by their own disposition, or by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, returned afterwards to a remarkable amendment of their Life, and a habit of good manners: And what will hinder, but we may reckon those also among the Iustified, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Philosophy of <hi>Thomas:</hi> If so be Iustification be nothing else but a certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from contrary into contrary, that is a transmutation from a state of Unrighteousness to a state of Righteousness?</p>
               <p>But there is added in the definition, by the remission of Sin, and what does this help their cause? For if there is no other Iustification, but that which consists of Remission of Sins, why then do they of <hi>Trent</hi> deny Iustification to confist of Remission of Sins only. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over whereas in the Remission of Sins always a suspicion of hidden Sin lyes hid, which needs the Patronage of a Pardon, where now will that state and term of Inherent Righteousness consist, which cannot otherways defend it self
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95561:166"/>
before the Iudge without his Mercy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>But why should I contend with any more words about this matter, when the Opinion of <hi>Hierom</hi> is contrary thereunto, who speaking particularly of these degrees of Righteousness, utterly beats down and overturns all this, both Station and term, settled by <hi>Thomas.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Thomas</hi> disputing about the motion of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication proceeds from one term to another term in which the motion ceases, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation receives an end and station; on the contrary, <hi>Hierom</hi> running through all degrees, teaches that we never <note place="margin">Hierom. cont. Pelag. Dial. 1. <hi>Phil. 10. 23.</hi>
                  </note> fix in a station, and are always in a race in this Life, and that that is always imperfect here, which we Men thought to be perfect. And he confirms it by the example of <hi>Paul:</hi> Who forgetting things past stretched himself always to things beyod him; by which he teaches that things which are behind should be neglected, and things to come should be desired, that what he thought perfect to day, whilest he always endeavours after better things, the morrow he finds it imperfect.</p>
               <p>These things said <hi>Hierom.</hi> Therefore if <hi>Paul</hi> being in perpetual motion, could find no ftate of Righteousness in which he could rest: It follows by consequence from hence, that either there is no Iustification of a Christian in this Life, or that surely it is not defined by its right terms, by <hi>Thomas</hi> or the <hi>Thomists;</hi> whence a just connexion is framed on this manner.</p>

                  <p>By these things, I think it is sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, what is the Iustification of a Wicked Man in the Scriptures, and in what thing it chiefly consists: not in a transmutation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent qualities, by a voluntary receiving of Grace, as they of <hi>Trent</hi> would have it; but in the judiciary absolution of the Iudge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he that is guilty is sent away free, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity is given to him. Whence Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seems to be defined not amiss by some: That it is an action of God, whereby he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves the condemned Sinner from the Law, in his free mercy, for the sake of Christ, justifies him from his Sins, and glorifies him being justified. Though in the mean while it is not denied, that it is a matter of great concernment, how every Man leads his Life, and amends it. But yet it is one thing to speak of Righteousness, and another thing to speak of Iustification. And again, it is one thing to be exercised in the common use of Life,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95561:167"/>
and another thing to be exercised in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories.</p>
                  <p>There the amendment of Life hath praise: but in judicatories, no regard uses to be, of what you are to do, but of what you have done; not what new qualities better Grace hath brought. but by what remedy former Sins may be done away. And now I pray you, what then must be said and looked for in that most strict Iudgment of the most high God, where the scene and sink of the wholeLife comes to be brought forth from its lurking places to the light; where impurity of Life, Deceits, Injuries, Filthiness of Lusts, the Defilement of Conscience and Concupiscence, the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Words, Works, Counsels, and Thoughts, the Ambition of a pust up Mind, the stubborness of Hatred, Love, Envy, and the other Affections Rebelling against Reason, the Love of the World, Earthly Desires, the Contempt and Ignorance of God, The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Duty. Moreover the whole sink of things formerly done, will be all at once laid open; What will the miserable Sinner say here? What will he bring? To what will he fly? Will he fly to his secret Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Expiatory Penances and Satisfactions: that will not be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>These things may declare thee to be a Sinner, and a Penitent, but not at all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. What then, you will say, hath not God promised to the Penitent the pardon of their Sins? Be it so, but where then is the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> Iustification, which is denied to consist of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95561:167"/>
Remission only, whereas you bring nothing into Iudgement, but Confessions, Penances, and Deprecatory Tears? For what need is there of any Satisfaction or Repentance, when you have committed no Sin? But if otherways, Where then is your Righteousness, whereof you boast? To wit, say you, Remission of Sins being once received by Repentance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Remission it self, flows in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the Renovation of the inner Man, and the other gifts of Grace by the Holy Spirit; whence Man of Unjust, becomes Iust, and of an Enemy, a Friend, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What and dare you trusting <note place="margin">Out of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> and the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi>

And think you that your Vertues are such that they will overcome at this Iudgment Seat, when they are Iudged? Not by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, say you of my Vertues, but by those works, which the efficacious Grace of God works in me: Which Righteousness is not mine but God's: Not of my own Free will, but of Grace acting in me.</p>
                  <p>Now then wherein will this Righteousness of yours differ from that <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the Parable of the Gospel? Whose Life if you look into, you see it is honest enough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, if you look upon Grace, he seems no less to acknowledge it, and to attribute all his Vertues to it. Otherways, why did he with so much reverence, and so carefully give thanks to God, that he was not like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

That I may answer these men, two things offer themselves to be considered; one which belongs to <note place="margin">A twofold Errour of the Papists.</note> the cause of Iustification, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which belongs to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word. In both of which the Adversaries are greatly mistaken. First in this, that treating of the cause of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they seem to place it in no other thing next and immediately, but in every man's own Righteousness, not which is imputed, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from another, but which every one hath within himself, trusting to this foundation: That because every thing receives its name and essence only from the form that is inherent; hence they gather, that none should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted just but those only, whom their own life and not another's <note place="margin">Formal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Iudicial Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> makes righteous. If they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of Formal Righteousness only, and not Iudicial, it hath no absurdity, and may, without any inconvenience be granted to them. But what then? what is this so much to the purpose? for this is not the matter of debate, what we are, or are not, formally in our selves; but what the Sentence of the Iudge doth judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning us. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <note place="margin">To justifie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Papises, is nothing else, but to make righteous.</note> not about Habitual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but Evangelical Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is one thing to dispute about Righteousness, and another to dispute about Iustification.</p>
                  <p>But these Logical Divines confound these
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:95561:169"/>
two with one another too unskilfully, defining Righteousness thus, as if it were nothing else but to make righteous: Or if there is any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, this is the manner of it, that. our Faith in Christ is by no means <note place="margin">Two parts of Iustification, of which the first consists in remission, the other in works of Faith. <hi>Alphonsus in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Though also they do not deny this, that in this very remission or reconciliation, where. by a wicked man is first justified before God through Faith and the Merit of Christ; some part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Iustification is contained, which also is necessarily requisite. But they say that it is not enough, that sins are forgiven, and that we are reconciled unto God (which is the first part of Iustification) unless another part also be added thereto, which compleats the former; which, of what sort it is, you may see here by their own words. When first, say they, man begins to detest sin, as offensive to God, and so of a wicked man is made just, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, at one and the same time, and in the same instant God infuses his Grace, waiting no interval of time: which Grace, where it comes, there we having received inward Renovation by the Holy Spirit, receive Righteousness, and are made truly righteous before God: And this is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95561:169"/>
that other part of Iustification, whereof I spake, without which no Righteousness is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfected; because it is most certain, that God justifies no man, or pronounces no man just, but him whom by the gift of his Spirit through internal Renovation he makes righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and cloaths, adorns, and endues with Righteousness, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The smoke of this Argument will easily vanish, by using the distinction of <hi>Augustin.</hi> Therefore we answer the <hi>Minor</hi> by the Authority of the Doctor: For <note place="margin">A twofold manner of keeping the Commands. Psal. 39.</note> there is a twofold manner of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commands; one is, when whatsoever is commanded by God is done. And after this manner the Son of God only is righteous, of whom only it is said, In the Volume of thy Book it is written of me, I come, that I might do thy will, O God, &amp;c. The other is, when that, which is not done, is forgiven. And after this second manner we are righteous, that is, we are accounted for righteous, not upon any

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is upheld by the legitimate Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Augustin. lib. Retract. cap.</hi> 19.

For by such an usual Scheme of Sophistical Speech they use to baffle the most evident Oracles of Scripture concerning our free Iustification by Christ. As when <hi>Paul</hi> reasons of Faith justifying freely without Works, they interpret it thus, that it is said of the first Iustification, which consists of Remission only and Reconciliation by Faith. But that there is another Iustification, besides this, which by inward Renovation is begotten of Inherent Righteousness, to which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the much more excellent part of true
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95561:171"/>
Iustification. But here again <hi>Augustin</hi> helps, by confuting this idle Tale with sound speech; who writing of this same second unjust Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theirs, Our very Righteousness, saith he, though it be true, because of the end, or true good, to which it is referred; yet it is so great in this life, that it consists rather in the remission of sins, than in the perfection of Vertues. Yea the same <hi>Augustin</hi> elsewhere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges the Life of the Regenerate how laudable soever, to a Curse, if it is to be judged in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Mercy. What then? <hi>Augustin.</hi> curses all the Righteousness of Humane Life without the Mercy of God. And should not they of <hi>Trent</hi> be accursed, who are not afraid to curse those, that with <hi>Augustin</hi> affirm, that all the comfort of our Iustification relies upon the Mercy of God only, forgiving us our sins for Christ's sake?</p>
                  <p>Let us add hereunto the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Oecumenius in cap. 3. ad Rom.</note> of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> lest we should not be too sufficiently guarded with Witnesses, who commenting on the words of <hi>Paul, Rom. chap.</hi> 3. Wherefore, says he, all, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they believed in Christ, are justified freely, bringing Faith only with them; and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, what that is, wherein all the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Salvation is placed, he introduces the remission of sins only, in these words, Being washed from our sins by Iesus Christ, &amp;c. And again confirming this same, and asking how this Iustification is brought to pass; he makes answer himself, saying, By remission of sins,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95561:172"/>
which we have in Christ Iesus. And soon after demonstrating the same more evidently, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein Righteousness, or the Iustifying Grace of God chiefly <note place="margin">Oicumen. ibid.</note> consists: Herein says he, that men who are dead in sins, may be justified by the remission of sins. Behold a demonstration of Righteousness set before you, that not only God himself is righteous, but also justifies his People by the Faith of Iesus. By which there are two things which you may see to be very evident: First, That all power of justifying is placed in Faith only, according to this man's Opinion; where he says, bringing Faith only with them: and then, That against the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> he teaches, that all this Iustification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us from God consists in the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins: For what is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than this speech? All Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note place="margin">Oicumen. ibid.</note> which proceeds to us from God, consists either in the forgiving of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or in the covering of the same, or in their not being imputed, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And these things we have said hitherto, are taken out of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> to whom, if we must agree, what credit then should be given to those Catholick <hi>Tridentines,</hi> who deny that they are justified by the remission of sins only? which how contrary it is to all reason, I need not plead against them with many Arguments, because they ought to be convinced of falshood by nothing more than by their own Actions. For who looks into the Lives of those Popes,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:95561:172"/>
Cardinals, Bishops, Monks, but he may easily perceive by those things which he daily sees, that there is nothing whereof they stand in greater need, or desire more ardently, than the gracious Clemency of God, in forgiving those sins which they have committed? This doth appear both many other ways, and also it is most evidently testified by their publick and daily wishes, suffrages and prayers. In their Temples, in their Liturgies, in the Solemnities of their Masses, in their Antiphonies, what other thing do they cry for, what do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of God, but that they may obtain the pardon of their own sins, and the sins of their Parents and Benefactors? Otherways what is the meaning of those words daily repeated in the Prefaces of their Masses; <hi>Let the Almighty and Merciful Lord give unto us the indulgence, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and remission of all our sins,</hi> &amp;C? What is the meaning of so many Advocates in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Patrons and Favourites, to obtain Mercy from God? Moreover, to what purpose are those words, wherewith they daily confess to God, and blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> and all Saints. And again, when they, days and nights without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and end, vehemently call upon the He-Saints and the She-Saints, and chiefly the blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> with such sort of cryes: <hi>By</hi>

                  <p>I beseech you, good men, what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Monsters of Religion? If those things be true, which your prayers declare, how is not your Doctrine false? with what Solder or Glue will these things so dis-joyned cleave to one another, that they who by an assiduous deploring of their sins, confess themselves to be sinners; the same men should seem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be formally just and perfect men in the sight of God by inward Renovation? that they should say they are less than the Mercies of the holy Virgin, and in the mean while the Mercy of God should be less than that it can justifie alone? That they know not Merits, and yet bring in no other thing but Merits to make Iustification perfect? What a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is this of the Divines? Or who should suppose them worthy to be believed, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict in their Temples, that which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for in their Schools? For they pray so, as if they were void of all Righteousness. But in Councils they so behave themselves, as if no Unrighteousness were inherent in them, and as if nothing were wanting to perfection of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:95561:173"/>
Now, these things being so, what remains to be said to these Men, but that with <hi>Hierom,</hi> we should say this: Let those Men either defend what they say, or forsake what they cannot defend. The Prophet cries, It is the Lord's Mercy that we are not consumed, and those Men hope, that they shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Mercy only, but shall be Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by the Righteous performance of Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isaiah</hi> so great a Prophet, or rather Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, under the sense of his sins, confesses his lips are unclean. And the same <note place="margin">Isai. 5. 53. Dan. 9.</note> elsewhere says, We have all gone astray, like Sheep. <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Prayer laments, We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have behaved our selves unrighteously, and departed from thy Commandments, &amp;c. And lest any Man should pretend that these things were signified by the Prophets, not in their own Name, who were Saints, but in the person of the People, the Prophet presently made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of himself, adding, Whilst I was yet praying, and confessing my sins, and the sins of my People, &amp;c. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> though praised upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">Abraham <hi>and</hi> Sarah. Genes. cap. 17.</note> of their Faith, were rebuked in their laughter, and their very thought was rebuked as a point of unbelief, and their silent Motion of Heart was not hid from the knowledge of God though they were not Condemned of distrust, because they laughed. <hi>Moses,</hi> than whom none
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95561:174"/>
was more familiar with God, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived so great a power of grace, yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the waters of strife, and did not obtain to enter with his Brother <hi>Aaron</hi> into the Land of promise. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle in whom so great <note place="margin">Moses Aaron <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. peter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</note> gifts of grace received shined forth, yet he is almost drowned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to hear, O thou of little Faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? If there was little Faith in him, I know not in whom it is great: Except in those succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Trent. Paul</hi> himself though he <note place="margin">Paul. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.</note> was taken up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet writing to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> openly professes, that he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto that which he sought for, but having forgot those things that were behind, he pressed forward with all his might, towards those things that were before. And does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this life hope to attain unto that, which <hi>Paul</hi> with all his endeavours, was not able to attain unto?</p>
                  <p>But why should I prosecute this matter any further? The Moon shall be confounded (said the Prophet) and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign before his Ancients gloriously: and in another place, the Heavens are not clean in his sight, and he charged his Augels with folly. The Moon is ashamed, and the Sun consounded, and the Heaven is covered with Sack-cloth. Wherefore then are not the <hi>Tridentines</hi> affraid to appear in the presence of

                     </gap> Pharisees of those days: For though the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:95561:176"/>
lives of those Men are Condemned, yet their manner of Doctrine was not so contrary to Divine Institutions; but the case is otherways with them: For not only their lives are far from that Righteousness which they teach, but their Doctrine also concerning this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and many other things is without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Foundation from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But you may say, what then? Doth Christ the Bride-groom forsake his Bride? Or is his grace lessened, that he is unwilling or unable to help his Servants? What think you of Charity? Which being the fulfilling of the Law, according to the Testimony of the Apostle, will it do nothing in the Hearts of those, in whom it is shed abroad, towards the fulfilling of the Law of God? I hear your Objection, and thus I answer it: Christ nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor will forsake his Church. Yet notwithstanding, he is not so present with his Church at all times; but that he leaves some Frailties and Imperfections in her. And the Bride doth not so fully enjoy <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant. 3.</hi> Grace, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> her Bridegroom, but that she hath sometimes occasion to complain, as it is in the Song of <hi>Solomon.</hi> I sought him whom my Soul loveth, I sought him, but I found him not, the Watchmen of the City found me, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But as touching Charity, and an habitual gift of grace, about which <hi>Thomas</hi> reasoned so largely, we also detract nothing from it, as we have said before. But this grace hath
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:95561:177"/>
its own degrees and measures, and <note place="margin">Charity was given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new us, not to justifie us.</note> bounds wherein it is contained. For Charity is not given to justifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man by Working, neither is so great a power of Divine grace, communicated to any Man in this life, as to fulfill all Christian Righteousness in every iota and Title. Though it be certain, that the bounty of God beautifies the Church with many and great Ornaments, yet he doth not cause her to arrive at so great perfection in this World, but she always hath need of the mercy of God, and the Remission of sins. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he preserves his Saints, and enriches and ennobles them, that they never perish, but not so, that they never sin. This fulness of grace, the Father hestowed on his own Son, by a singular prerogative of his Will, that all might receive of his fulness, for God gives not the Spirit to him measure; but he hath not dealt so with others, but he hath given to every Man according to the measure of the Rule, whereby he distributes to us, lest we should glory without measure, or stretch our selves too far above that <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. Ephes. 4. 1. Cor. 13.</note> grace, which is given to every Man according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Therefore let no Man arrogate unto himself, that which belongs not to him, but that which belongs to us is this: We know in part (as the Apostle speaks) and we prophesie in part, and now we see through a glass dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But when that which is perfect is come,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95561:177"/>
that which is in part, shall be done away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perfection not being attainable, let us be content with that, whereof we are <note place="margin">The Church of God in this life, is never so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that she hath need of the Mercy of God.</note> capable, and leave that fullness of perfection, which is void of all sin, to him, to whom only it is due. And let us not be seduced by a foolish perswasion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a desire of seeming to be that which neither we can be, nor any of our Fore-fathers ever were. Let us look back to the times and manners of Men, let us view the lives of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> Captains, Kings, Prophets, and the greatest Heroes. Of whom no Man can say, that they were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the grace of God: And yet there is not one of them all, in whom <hi>Hierom</hi> finds not something blame-worthy, in writing to <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> and doth not except so much as the Apostles themselves, and the Evangelists: Moreover, let us search into all the People of the Old Testament, and their Actions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Law was given them by <hi>Moses,</hi> do we suppose that they were utterly separated from Divine grace? Though the <hi>Messias</hi> was not yet come, yet the Faith of the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Calling and Election of God was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; Amongst whom also there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared many evident instances of Divine grace, who also being adorned with all kind of Vertues, thought no less of themselves, than the Catholicks of our time: And yet, what says the word of God concerning <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> them? <hi>Moses</hi> gave you the Law, and none of you all keep the Law.</p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:95561:178"/>
                  <p>But it may be objected, so great a power and abundance of Heavenly grace, had not yet shined forth in these days, as afterwards the <hi>Messias</hi> brought with him at his coming. I hear what you say, but what do you infer from this? Do such Men think, that by the help of this grace, they can do that, which the others could not do; that is, that by living Holily, they can attain unto all things that are requisite unto Righteousness, or perfect Obedience of the Law? But suppose it be so, as Christ then objected to the Pharisees: Did not <hi>Moses</hi> give you the Law, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>In like manner any Man may object to you Did not <hi>Paul</hi> a Servant of Iesus Christ, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer of the Gospel, a teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, a chosen Vessel; did not he in writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> prescribe a Law to you Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, shewing in a Compendious Speech how ye ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your selves in the Church of God, and what manner of Men it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1 Tim. 3.</hi> A Bishop must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And yet who among you so Administers his Office, that nothing is wanting to him, in the Catalogue of all these Vertues? In the management of which Office notwithstanding, if he do perform the chief things indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:95561:178"/>
well, he loses not the name of a good Bishop. Iust so it is in the fulfilling of the commands of God, and the performing works of Righteousness. For, as <hi>Hierom</hi> asserts, to have all things, and to <note place="margin">Hierom. ad Ctesiphon. Dial. 1.</note> lack nothing that belongs to his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that did no Sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth.</p>
                  <p>Now if you can never, or but very rarely find in the person of one Bishop the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a few Duties belonging to his Office, what should be said of those things, which being commanded by the Lord himself in the Gospel, belong alike unto all; as when he gives precepts of mutual Charity, of forgiving Brethren, of every Man's taking up his Cross, which if a Man refuse, Christ looks not upon him as a Disciple: Of Faith in God, which is not tainted with any wavering: Of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humbleness of Mind, resembling the simplicity of little Children: Of Chastity which doth not allow so much as an unclean glance of the Eye: Of bounty towards all Men: Of perfect Patience towards our very Enemies, and the most exact Purity, which is void of Covetousness, and whose treasure is laid up in Heaven, which is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> with any ambition or vain Glory, and designs it self wholly and all that it hath for the glory of Christ only.</p>
                  <p>But why should I enlarge any more upon those things, which no Man can easily set forth by Words, and with much greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty can he frame his Life according to them.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95561:179"/>
So great is the severity of Divine Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousuess, which suffers no rash anger, nor the least reproach cast upon a Brother, nor so much as an idle word to go unpunished. Christ commands our Speech to be Yea, yea, and Nay, nay, telling us, <note place="margin">Hierom. ad Ctesiphon. Dial. 2.</note> That what is more than this cometh of Evil, upon which place let us hear the interpretation of <hi>Hierom:</hi> Who of us, saith he, can avoid being lyable to this fault: Seeing we must give account for idle words in the Day of Iudgment? If anger and reproachful speeches, and idle <note place="margin">Precepts of Evangelical Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> talking are lyable to the Iudgment, the Council, and Hel-fire; what punishment will be due to unclean lusts, and covetousness, which is the root of all Evil, &amp;c. Hitherto are his words.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore is it, that we are commanded, to suffer him, that takes away our Coat, to have our Cloak also: And when any Man strikes us on the one Cheek, to turn to him the other, to give him that asketh, and not to withdraw from him that would borrow of you, to love our Enemies, to do good to them that hate us, and to pray for them that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us, and despitefully use us. Perhaps such a one, as performs all these things, may be found in the Family of the Catholicks: Verily <hi>Hierom</hi> could not find so rare a bird, as he speaks, amongst all that he knew. Now if we that are Christians, are commanded by God to pray for them that persecute us:
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95561:179"/>
What will become of those, that are so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with a Spirit of Persecution towards the Innocent Servants of Christ, and cause so great Slaughters, Tumults, Conflagrations, and Murders, such dreadful Tragedies, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs every where amongst the People of the Lord? By whose implacable fury and outrage so much Christian Blood has hitherto been shed. And yet after all these abominable cruelties, How comes it that the ringleaders of them, and chiefest incendiaries, are not ashamed to talk in their Councils of the perfection of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and of Grace, and Charity, which is the fulfilling of the Law?</p>
                  <p>But let us return to the subject matter of our present discourse. <note place="margin">Mark 9.</note> Our Heavenly Lawgiver proceeds in instructing his Disciples to a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this World, so that he commands us to cut off an Hand, an Eye, and a Foot, when it offends. Suppose it be spoken Figuratively, to signifie those things, which are nearest and dearest to us in this Life, do we think it an easie matter, (that I may speak in the Language of <hi>Hierom</hi>) suddainly <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> to tear away a thing so beloved for some offences? And in another place the Lord gives this command: If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> thou possessest, and come and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me. Though this was said to one Man only, yet nevertheless, (as I suppose) this is given for a warning to all Christians alike,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:95561:180"/>
to bridle their unruly affections, of whom every one should be in a readiness, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all things, that upon any account hinder their progress in true Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Hereby ye do see, O ye Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> what the Doctrine of Christian Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness requires of you. Therefore weigh your selves in this balance, and frame your Life according to these Rules of Perfection, who make so much ado in pleading for inherent Righteousness, and the merit of Works, and are not willing to be justified by remission only. Therefore let the <note place="margin">Popes. Cardinals.</note> Pope cast away these vanities of high flown Pride, these Bulls, and vain Titles, and these Royal and more than Royal Dignites of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which do not at all agree with the Spirit of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Renovation. Let the Cardinals, if they be Church-men, cast off this Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, which they take possession of beyond the bounds of their calling. But if they be secular Men, let them behave themselves with greater moderation in secular Affairs.</p>
                  <p>If the Bishops, Arch-bishops, and their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, the Abbots, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governours <note place="margin">Bishops, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors or the Church.</note> adorned with their Miters, would be accounted the Successours of the Apostles, and not the Pharisees, let them leave off so to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Phylacteries, and diminish their Worldly Grandeur and Wealth, wherewith they are too much puffed up, and learn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95561:180"/>
themselves within the bounds <note place="margin">The Orders and Rules of Monks.</note> of Apostolick moderation that, after the manner of the Apostles, they may grow truly rich in Christ. Christ doth not acknowledge them for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that serve two Master. Therefore if the Monks and Religious Orders would be Christians, let them cease to be <hi>Franciscans, Dominicans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If they profess Christ to be their Lord, let them call themselves by his Name, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession they have taken upon them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake those Idols, and irregular rules. Christ Iesus in the Gospel could not endure his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when they did but mutter with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the degrees of Dignity. <note place="margin">The strise about Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Churches.</note> And what else hath this Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been striving for these many Years; in raising debates with other Churches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Primacy, but that she might have the Superiority, and all others be subject to her Dominion. And what other thing are all the Cities, Nations, and People in league with her busied about: Or for what purpose is all this Slaughter and Persecution through the whole Christian World, at this day, but that they may by all means Establish and protect the Dignity of their Mother Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> But how these things agree with Charity, and the perfection of Evangelical Doctrine, let themselves judge.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore do I so much enlarge upon this matter? The reason is, to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95561:181"/>
appear, that, when the <hi>Tridentines</hi> have said all they can, yet the whole concernment of our Salvation and Iustification consists not in our Merits, and Mercinary VVorks, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of Manners, and Holiness of Life, but in the gracious favour of God: VVhereby he not only renews the Inner-man, but delivers the whole Man, both outwardly and inwardly, from the bondage of Death, wherein he was wretchedly ensnared; frees him from the Curse, redeems him from the slavery of Satan, and a state of Damnation, forgiving all his Sins, and daily offences, whereby he most justly deserved Eternal Destruction.</p>
                  <p>Now these things appearing very evident, what remains, but that either the <hi>Tridentines</hi> should lead so Holy a Life, as being weighed in the balance of Righteousness, hath no need of the Pardon of Sins: Or if they cannot do that, let them lay down their <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Pride, and acknowledge with other Sinners, that all the blessedness, which comes by Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lies only in the mercy of a gracious God, who deals not with us according to our Sins, and though he may justly, yet he doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our Evil deeds to us. As the Apostle teaches us out of that Prophetical <hi>Psalm:</hi> VVhere the <hi>Psalmist</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining <note place="margin">Psal. 31.</note> the true blessedness of Man, says, Blessed are they, whose Iniquities are forgiven, whose Sins are covered. Blessed is the Man. unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity. Now if the forgiveness of our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities is sufficient to blessedness, is it not also sufficient to Iustification?</p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:95561:181"/>
                  <p>But what else is our Iustification, but bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness? As <hi>Oecumenius</hi> bears witness: Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the highest degree of good <note place="margin">Blessedness the highest degree of all good things.</note> things. Which if it be true, what other thing will those Men require, to make Iustification perfect? To wit, a Supernatural infusion of Grace, as they call it, whereby being purged from all pollution of Sin, we are not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted acceptable to God, but in <note place="margin">

For though both the Godly and the Ungodly Sin: Yet not after one and the same manner: For that Man Sins one way, who rushes upon all manner of Wickedness against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and wittingly and willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severes in sin without Repentance; of whom it
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:95561:182"/>
is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. He that worketh <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.</note> unrighteousness is not of God; And that man sins another way, who is rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his infirmity, than yields willingly to the sinful inclinations of his flesh, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he slips into the evil, that he <note place="margin">Sin not reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> would not: And nevertheless with his mind obeys the Law of God, and endeavouring after Holiness, in the midst of his sins he strives and cries out against them. Therefore I answer with this distinction of the <hi>Majon;</hi> which I deny not to be true in those, who living according to the flesh, wallow in all filthiness without measure or shame: Of whom <hi>Paul</hi> said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly; <note place="margin">Romans 8.</note> If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but yet it must be acknowledged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Example of the same Apostle, that the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, may consist with infirmities in the Regenerate. And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after this manner the Apostle joyns the Old Man and the New Man in the Regenerate; the Law of the Members, and the Law of the Mind; the Flesh striving against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh; as when speaking of himself, he testifies: Therefore I my self with my mind serve the Law of <note place="margin">The Saints themselvessin sometimes.</note> God, and with my flesh I serve the Law of sin.</p>
                  <p>As this disease of infirmity, being never idle in the Saints, doth often drive them into great and grievous sins, and brings them to such distress sometimes, that for a season they seem like unto the wicked, forsaken of God,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95561:183"/>
and void of all Faith and Consolation: But God in his infinite Goodness never leaves them so destitute of his Mercy, whom once he hath planted in his Son by Faith, but that he puts his hand under them, when they fall, that they are not broken to pieces; and again he stretches forth his hand unto them to reduce them from their sins. Though he is greatly offended and angry at their wickedness, yet in his wrath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring Mercy, he doth not cast them off for ever. This appears evidently by the known Examples of <hi>David, Peter, Manasseh, Evah, Adam, Aaron, Miriam, Solomon,</hi> and others. And this is the difference <note place="margin">They that sin finally. The Saints, though they fall some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into sin, they do not continue in sin.</note> between the godly and ungodly, that though both of them fall into grievous sins against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet in this they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished: the wicked run head-long on in their sins, and taking pleasure in them, not only for a while, but through their whole life give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the bondage of corruption, and take no care to return unto God by Repentance; but the case is contrariwise with the Godly and Regenerate; for though they may sin se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely for a time, and reigning sin may have dominion over them for the present, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless by the Grace of God they are brought to the acknowledgment of their sins, and are recovered by Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I answer to the <hi>Major</hi> with this restriction: It were so, except Remission came
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95561:183"/>
together with Conversion, without which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace hath no place in sinners. Now, though Conversion may seem lost for a season by the falls of the Saints, yet notwithstanding the Regenerate are not cast out of the favour of God, in as much as they are not finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken. Otherways if any sin of infirmity should utterly make void all the Grace of God, how was the Grace of Christ sufficient for <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was buffeted by <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> a Messenger of Satan? or how is his strength said to be made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Moreover, how else is that saying of the Apostle true, Where sin abounded, grace hath superabounded, if Divine Grace hath no union with any, but them that are arrived at perfection?</p>
                  <p>But here again there arises an <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.</note> Objection out of <hi>Iohn;</hi> Whosoever is born of God cannot sin, &amp;c. And what is concluded from hence? Therefore he that is truly regenerate in Christ, is free from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of sin. The same fallacy returns again, from that which is said in a certain sense, to that which is said simply. <note place="margin">A Fallacy from that which is said in a certain sense to that which is said simply.</note> If the signification of the word (sinning) be taken simply in this place, for any kind of sin, in this sense it is false, which they assume, by a wrong interpretation of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But if it be understood of those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who wilfully give themselves up to work wickedness, or through obstinate malice allow
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95561:184"/>
themselves in sinning, and resolutely persevere therein; I confess that which they cite out of the Apostle is true of such; to wit, that they are not of God, who sin after this manner, which yet cannot be truly said of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that are born of God. Therefore the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence should be observed, not only of the things which are committed, but much more of those that commit them: For the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of corrupted Nature, and inclination to sin, abides in both, which nevertheless the Regenerate suppress by strugling against it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting their vicious affections, as much as in them lies. Howbeit they are not so perfect and entire, but that sometimes they wilfully fall into gross sins; but they do not continue in them, but at length return to God by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: Therefore let us grant that, which neither can be denied, nor ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused; that both the godly and ungodly, by reason of the common Law of Infirmity are liable to sin; but yet they differ very much in their purpose and continuance. <hi>Solomon</hi> knew this difference, and therefore spake of it, The righteous man, though he fall <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov. 24.</hi> Prov. 24.</note> seven times, yet he rises up again; but the wicked fall into mischief.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they of <hi>Trent</hi> themselves will not deny, that there is some natural infirmity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the godly and ungodly, which makes it possible for them to sin, if they will; but they deny that the godly can will to sin, because by a voluntary receiving of Grace they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95561:184"/>
with so pure Charity and Innocency, that being polluted with no spot of unrighteousness, they are not only accounted clean and undefiled by imputation and the remission of sins, but are in reality righteous and unblameable by the true possession and exercise of Vertue. But where will they find those righteous men, that dare profess themselves free from all guilt of sin? As I may speak it of all the other Apostles, so here I would ask them particularly of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom they quote, whether they think that he himself should be reckoned in the Catalogue of the righteous, who are not tainted with the least spot of sin? Let us <note place="margin">1 Iohn 1.</note> then hear the Apostle confessing of himself: If we say that we have no sin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us. Now then, if so great a Disciple of Christ, and one so dearly beloved of him, durst not plead a total and perfect freedom from sin, nor could do so without a Lye, dare those <hi>Tridentine</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers attribute that unto themselves? and do they suppose that the World can be so blinded by them, that it doth not easily take notice of, and detest their manifest Lyes, Deceits, and Impostures, and so great an impudence in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Deceiving.</p>
                  <p>Pious Reader, what Testimonies of greater Authority dost thou look for? That which the <hi>Tridentines</hi> affirm the Apostle denies. If they say true, the Canonical Truth is a Lye: But if it be blasphemy to entertain such a thought, must not they of <hi>Trent</hi> be Lyars? What need is there
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95561:185"/>
to prove it? I will express it in a word. The Testimony of Scripture, the Consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Experience of all Ages, the Iudgment of the Learned, the Sayings of the Antient Fathers, the Examples of all the Saints, the general Opinion of all good men, the guilty Conscience of evil doers, the constant Prayers of the Church, her Complaints and Tears, the Rebellion of the Flesh, the wicked Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions arising in the Heart, the Deceit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the Groans of troubled Spirits, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances incident to a Mortal Life, and Death it self common to all men: Moreover, the constant Confessions of the Papists, and their often repeated Absolutions; what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these so many and weighty Arguments? What is it that they declare, but that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness attainable in this Life, is either none at all, or such as <hi>Augustin</hi> describes, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists more in the remission of sins, than in the perfection of Vertues? And lest any should flatter himself with <note place="margin">August. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Dei, l. 19. c. 17. August. in Ioan. Tract. 4.</note> hopes of perfection in this Life, let us hear what the same <hi>Augustin</hi> commenting upon <hi>Iohn</hi> infers: Let not sin reign in your mortal body: He says not, let it not be but let it not reign: For, as long as you live, of necessity sin must be in your Members: Yet let the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion be taken from it; let not that be done which it commands, &amp;c. And again writing to <hi>Macedonius;</hi> Who of us is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin? And presently again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating <note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 54. ad Macedon.</note> the same: But who in this
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:95561:185"/>
Life is without some sin? But him we call good, whose goodness prevails; and him we call best, who sins least. Therefore those whom the Lord himself calls good by reason of the participation of Divine Grace, he calls the same also evil, because oftheir infirmities, until our whole man be thoroughly purged from all corruption by passing into that Life, in which we shall sin no more, &amp;c. Thus said <hi>Augustin.</hi> Where then is that real infusion of Vertues, as they call it? where are these new Qualities, and that Inherent Righteousness, that hath no need of remission of sins? for what need is there of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission there, where there is nothing to be forgiven? For what sin can remain there, where the perfect purification (as they speak) of Body and Soul from all pollution of sin, makes us holy, and partakers of the Divine Nature? Briefly, that I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">Andrad, lib. 6. Lorichius, c. 8.</note> the matter in a few words, lest this discourse should grow into too great a bulk, I suppose I have sufficiently, by what I have discoursed at large, cleared these things following: First, what is <note place="margin">A brief sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the things trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of before.</note> the nature of true Faith, which causeth Righteousness; what is its proper Object; from whence it receives power to justifie, which we have proved by the Scriptures to proceed wholly from its object, that is, the person of him only, in whom we believe. Now because Faith only embraces the person of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that Faith only, upon the account
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95561:186"/>
of its Object, and not for the sake of our Vertues, justifies the sinners and ungodly.</p>

               <p>Which things being granted, what can the Papists say against this Assertion, concerning justifying Faith?

Yea, on the Lord's days there are not a few, that through idleness, commit many sins. What then, because they that know not how to use good things aright, take occasion to abuse the time of the Lord's Day to Gluttony and Drunkenness, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a door to Licentiousness, should we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject the Lord's institution? No verily, Human things must give place to Divine, and the usual custom of Men of wicked Lives, must not be your rule to walk by, but that which God hath commanded to be done. Christ commands the Gospel to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mark 16.</note> to every Creature: Will ye forbid it, though many abuse the Gospel? But what is this Gospel of Christ, that he commands to be Preached? He that believeth, and is Baptized, shall be saved. Do you hear that Salvation is simply promised to Believers; and that it consists of nothing else but Faith, and that Sacrament of Faith? Will you deny it? Whether then shall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ, or you? So it pleases him to open
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:95561:188"/>
unto sinners, the Treasures of his abundant grace. And will your envy shut up that from us, which he hath opened? do you neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your self, nor suffer others to enter? Christ also speaks thus by the Prophet, ye have been sold for nought, and ye shall be redeemed without price: What is the sense of these words, (without price) but this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Merits of Works at all, that is, your own Merits, but not <note place="margin">Esa. 52.</note> the Merits of another. What then? If the procurement of another, hath brought you to death, may not also the procurement of another, restore you to life again? And in the same Prophet, the Holy Spirit proclaims how beautiful the feet of those are upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that bring good tidings, that publish peace: And yet do you endeavour to stop the comfortable course of Gospel Preaching and in the room thereof, do you obtrude your old erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrine of mournful Sorrow, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less doubting.</p>

Where are those feet of them, that run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountains, and bring glad tidings of Peace, if it is not lawful to publish the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Peace? We are not against the Preaching of Faith, (say they) but we would not that Faith only should be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That is the only thing that <note place="margin">Objection. Faith only.</note> we require, for the cause that we mention'd, because when this form of Doctrine is taught, of necessity the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof is the Ruin and Destruction of all (<hi>honest Discipline.</hi>)</p>
               <p>That I may answer this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it hath been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Answer. In Sermons frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations are used to Pious Works.</note> answered already, two things must be considered, one whereof belongs to the manner of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other to the truth of the Doctrine. And first as touching Preaching, their Objection is very false: For though we teach that Faith only Iustifies, yet we neglect not to use strong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the practice of good Works, and sharp Admonitions, and not only Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but also severe threatnings, yea, and moreover Excommunications, if need be, to restrain wicked practices.</p>
               <p>The frequent Sermons that are Preached in our Churches bear witness to this, in which <hi>according to our power,</hi> we exhort unto Works of Piety, and by the Authority of Scripture, thunder the Iudgments of God, against Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, Adulterers, Covetous Persons, Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95561:189"/>
Sorcerers, that they may know there will be no place for such in the Kingdom of God and Christ, except they amend their lives. Who was more zealous than <hi>Paul,</hi> in exalting the Righteousness of Faith? And who was more Holy in Life than he, or more fervent against the sins of those that walked not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit, but after the flesh? The Books of our Divines do evidence the same, in which they discourse no less of Repentance, and good Works, than of Faith, joyning always the one with the other. Therefore as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of Teaching, you will find, that it is not Faith only, which is Treated of in the Churches and Books of Men of our perswasion. But if the matter of debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, be about the cause of Salvation and Iustification, there is nothing more agreeable to sound Doctrine, than that an ungodly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is Iustified before God by Faith only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works.</p>
               <p>But you may object; this Doctrine <note place="margin">An Answer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> hardens the People in their sinful courses. If you understand it of all, it is false: If of evil doers, that run on in sin against their Conscience, and take no care to restrain their Lusts: As for such, who ever said or taught, that they are Iustified by Faith only? And yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the Truth of this Assertion remains invincible, whereby we affirm that a wicked Man is Iustified by Faith only, without Works, if the Scope and meaning thereof be well understood. Which will be easie, if by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:95561:190"/>
that, which supplies the room of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, the proposition be made entire. As when Faith only is said to Iustifie, add unto the Subject of this Enunciation, its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per predicate, or I may rather say, add the proper Subject of Iustification, and understand aright, who they are, whom Faith only Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies without Works, according to the saying of <hi>Paul:</hi> For herein chiefly lies the (difficulty) of this Controversie, <note place="margin">Ambiguity. Faith only Iustifies, but not all kind of Sinners.</note> Neither is there any thing wherein the Adversaries are more grosly mistaken: And herein they follow the Foot-steps of those, concerning whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> justly complains, saying, They look at that, which is said in the first place, but regard not, what follows after. They catch at that which we assert of Faith only Exclusively, and think there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to good Works, if Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is sufficient to Salvation: But they take no notice what manner of Persons they are, to whom this Iustification by Faith belongs. It is the Advice of those School Divines, to consider the reasons of things proposed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Subject matter, and why then do they not observe their own Rule in this Evangelical Assertion? Christ affirms it, <hi>Paul</hi> confirms it, yea, the common practice of life, natural Reason, and Experience, and the Conscience of all good Men proclaim that Ruine comes only from our Works, and Salvation only from Christ.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:95561:190"/>
only, hence it is that we assert it is Faith that justifies believing sinners before God. But let us see what manner of Sinners they are, whom Faith Iustifies: Is it the Rebellious, and Impenitent? No verily. Then it must be such sinners, as are Converted, and Humbled, and have the fear of God before their Eyes. But there is no fear, that such will continue to wallow in their former filthiness, but on the contrary, they are hereby so much the more stirred up to amend their lives. All Ages have abounded with Examples of those, to whom the Doctrine of free Iustification by Faith in Christ, as it conduced much to their necessary consolation, so it was no hinderance to their leading an holy life. If Charity (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Adversaries themselves do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie) is the perfection of the Law, which is the Rule of Life; I would ask such men, whether he to whom more, or he to whom fewer sins are forgiven, hath the strongest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to love either God or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? which of these two mentioned in the Gospel, loved Christ with the greater ardency of affection, <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee, or <note place="margin">The Love of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> that brought with her no good works at all, but a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of sins? And why was her Love to the Lord more vehement? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had more sins forgiven her? But let us proceed; Wherefore were so many and so great offences forgiven her, but for her Faith, which guided her Love? for she did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe in Christ, because she loved him, but because she knew him to be the Son of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:95561:191"/>
God, her Faith being thereby incited to act the more vigorously, she loved much. For, Love proceeds from Faith, and not Faith from Love. Because we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <note place="margin">Love rises from Faith, not Faith from Love.</note> therefore we Love, but we do not believe, because we Love-Whence the Lord, regarding more her Faith then her Love, said unto her, thy Faith (not thy Love) hath saved thee.</p>

               <head>How Love and Repentance are concerned in Iustification.</head>
               <p>BUT You may say, Is Faith alone here? Is it not joyned together with Love and Repentance? I grant indeed, that they are all three together in the person of the Believer. But in the Case of Iustification Faith only is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: And the other do follow as Fruits and Effects thereof. For as that Woman, unless she had believed in the Mediatour, made known unto her by Faith, she had nevor loved him: So she had never come unto him, as her Physician, unless the Disease of her Troubled Conscience had driven <note place="margin">Charity is no cause of Iustification.</note> her. Wherefore if we reason aright about Causes, these things follow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Effects and Fruits thereof, but they are no causes of obtaining Salvation.</p>
               <p>We have spoken of <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> let us now behold the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and compare the one
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95561:191"/>
with the other. If the Woman that was a Sinner, by her love mericed (as they speak) Iustification, What shall we say of the <hi>Pharisee?</hi> Did not he also love the Lord? Would he have gone to him so Courteously, or invited him so lovingly? or received him into his House so kindly, or entertained him at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so honourably, unless he had been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with some Affection of Love? What shall I say of his Faith? Did he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; being instructed by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth? Did he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ as a Prophet? Now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Father, and receiving the Son with Affectionate Love, What could be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, that was necessary to Iustification? If so be all our Iustification is perfected by Charity? And yet, I suppose, no Man will say, that this <hi>Pharisee</hi> was justified by Christ, that is, set free from all Condemnation by this love of his. Why? Because Faith in Christ as a Saviour was wanting. But suppose he had Faith, and he trusting to his own Righteousness, and being puffed up with Pride upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, had begged no help, and imagined he needed no Pardon, would this Faith have availed him to Iustification? I do no not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: But you may say, That is true indeed, and therefore this proves, that Faith only doth not justifie.</p>
               <p>I answer, and also request the Adversaries, that, laying aside the desire of vain jangling,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95561:192"/>
they would examine the matter according to Scripture and right Reason.</p>
               <p>Though the manifest Testimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Examples of the Saints make it an undoubted Truth, that only Faith in Christ the Son of God, hath the power of justifying without Works. Yet it cannot open this power upon all; but only those in whom a fitness is found for receiving the displayings of Divine Grace.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Repentance of those that are Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith.</head>
               <p>BUT None are found more fit, than those, that seem to themselves most unworthy, and none less fit, than those, that are most highly conceited of their own worthiness. Seeing we are all Sinners by Nature, nothing can be more reasonable, than that we should acknowledge the filthiness of our own abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and cast our selves down at the Feet of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>And there is nothing that God more requires, than this: Whose Nature, or rather Mercy is such, that he delights not in any thing more, than in a humble Heart and a broken Spirit, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares: <note place="margin">Psal. 34. Isa. 57.</note> He saveth such as are of a contrite Spirit. And in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> God testifies of himself, that he is the high and lofty one that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95561:192"/>
Eternity, and dwells in the high and Holy place, and also with him that is humble and of a contrite Spirit, to comfort the humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones. And for that cause he calls aloud in the Gospel, and offers his kind invitations chiefly to such as labour, and are heavy laden, that they may come unto him, and be eased.</p>
               <p>What is coming to Christ, but believing? What is it to be eased or refreshed, but to be justified? Though indeed he calls all, and despises none, that come <note place="margin">

Esa. 9.</note> to him: Yet so it comes to pass for the most part, that none come to Christ as they ought, unless they be pressed and burdened under the sense of their Sin and Misery. And again, that Heavenly Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is seldom sent unto any others, but such: As the Prophet bears witness, who making a particular description of those, to whom Christ was to be sent, he sets before us the meek, the broken in Heart, the Captives, the Prisoners, the Mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> them that are walking in Darkness, and sitting in the shadow of Death, &amp;c. And the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks much to the <note place="margin">Ps. 107.</note> same purpose, <hi>Ps.</hi> 107. describing the Mercy of God on this manner. He filleth the hungry Soul with goodness, and such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of Death, being bound in Affliction and Iron. Though he being sent by the Father, is given
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95561:193"/>
to all, yet he is not entertained by all with the like Affection.</p>
               <p>The Lord himself shews the cause thereof: For, what need have the whole of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician? Therefore as a skilful Physician, doth not Administer his Medicines, but when sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness requires it, so Faith cleanses none, but those, whom Repentance also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our Sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to sorgive us, and the Blood of Iesus Christ cleanseth us from all Sin.</note> neither doth the Gospel heal any, but those whom first the Law hath slain, and Conscience hath wounded. And as that is most true, which we Preach by the Authority of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, that Men are justified by Faith only without Works, so on the other side it is false, which the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries assert, that by this Doctrine of Faith it comes to pass, that all care of good Works is cast off, and the reins are let loose to all manner of wickedness: Howbeit if they speak of such impenitent persons as go on resolutely in their Sins, we acknowledge, that such as they, are not justified by Faith, and yet we assert that this is no way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the cause that we plead. But if they speak of such, as join Repentance with Evangelical Faith, and therefore stand in need of consolation, if they deny that those are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Faith of Christ only; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves to be utter Enemies of the Gospel, and adversaries to Christ. And again if they assert that such penitent believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95561:193"/>
worse by this Doctrine, they do therein err exceedingly, and lye abominably.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that the Mouth of Malice and Slander may be stopped; I admonish these professours of Divinity, who condem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this Doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> as Heretical, that they would take our proposition, not by halves, but whole, and join the legitimate predicate of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position with the subject, that when <note place="margin">Faith only justifies the Uogodly, but not unless he be first humbled by Repentance.</note> Faith is said to justifie, they should reckon that is not enough, unless they understand aright, whom this Faith justifies. To wit, none of those that continue stubborn and impenitent in their wicked courses, but only such as acknowledge their Sins with grief of Heart, and being weary of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abominations fly to Christ by Faith for resuge.</p>
               <p>But here they take another occasion to cavil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> For if Faith justifies none, but them, that repent, then (as they say) Faith only doth not justifie; but together with Faith a Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Mourning for Sin Iustifie also.</p>
               <p>I Answer, It is true indeed, that Faith is joyned with Repentance, in him that is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from his Sins. And yet Repentance is no cause of Iustification: As those, that are afficted with a painful Disease, Their pain makes them desirous of a cure, but yet there is no healing vertue in this desire. So Faith and Conversion are joyntly united in the person, that is justified.</p>
               <p>But as touching the cause of Iustifying, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95561:194"/>
indeed prepares a Soul for the reception of Iustification, but the cause of justifying lyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in Faith and not at all in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For the just Iudge doth not absolve him, who hath violated his Iustice, because he is grieved upon that account, but because he believes in Christ, who hath satisfied Iustice, and for whose sake Pardon is promised to such as Repent; for in him are all the springs of our Iustification.</p>

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>First the manner of arguing is captious, and transgresses the right <note place="margin">A Fallacy in the terms.</note> Laws of Logick. For the terms therein exceed the due number: For there is
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95561:195"/>
a redundancy in the conclusion, by this addition, without Works. For this should have been the conclusion: Therefore no Faith, that is without Works justifies. And that may be well granted without any disadvantage to our Cause. For, suppose we grant, that Faith is Dead, which is not moved with a desire of doing good Works, according to the saying of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> yet it doth not therefore follow from hence, that no Faith Iustifies without Works. From which two things do follow, worthy of consideration.</p>
                  <p>First, That no Faith justifies, that is not lively: And next, though it abounds in good Works, and never is without them, yet it only without Works Iustifies.</p>
                  <p>This will appear evident by the Example of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> Who though he was not conscious to himself of any Wickedness, yet he durst not affirm himself to be thereby Iustified.</p>
                  <p>I think nothing hinders, but the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be yielded unto, if so be the terms are rightly placed.</p>
                  <p>The Adversaries gather out of the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> that Faith is dead, which is without Works, and herein we do not much oppose them. But what follows from hence? Therefore, (as they say) dead Faith without Works doth not justifie.</p>
                  <p>And I deny it not: But what Conclusion flows from this manner of Arguing? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only Faith doth not justiste? Why so? If no Faith, but that which is lively, justifies, and if it receives Life only from Works, then
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:95561:195"/>
this is the consequence, that Faith justifies, only upon the account of good Works.</p>
                  <p>I Answer, First, though we grant it is true. that the Faith which justifies us in the sight of God is lively, and always joyned with a Godly Life: Yet, that this Faith justifies and reconciles us no other ways, but upon the account of good Works, is most false. For this is not a good consequence from the premises: Because Faith is not alone in the Life of the Believer, therefore Faith is not alone in the Office of justifying. Or because the Faith that justifies is not a dead, but a lively Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not justifie alone without Works: For herein is a fallacy of the Consequence. But you may object? Whence then is Faith said to be lively and not Dead, but from Works? Which if it be so, of necessity it must draw all its Life and Vertue from Works.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the matter is quite contrary: For though in the sight of Men, Faith is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be Lively and Vigorous, but by Works, yet Faith receives not Life from Works, but rather Works from Faith. As Fruits draw their Life and Sap from the Root of the Tree, but not the Root <note place="margin">The Life of Faith is not begotten of Charity, but only is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced thereby.</note> from them: Iust so external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceed from Faith, as the Root, which, if they be good, they evidence the Root to be sound and lively, and this is all they do, but they communicate no Life thereunto.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:95561:196"/>
                  <p>And this Life and Vertue of Faith is not one, but Twofold: And it acteth <note place="margin">A twofold Life and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Faith.</note> partly in Heaven, and partly in Earth. If you ask what it doth amongst Men upon Earth: It does good to its Neighbour, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Love.</p>
                  <p>But before God in Heaven it justifies the Ungodly, not by Love, but by the Son of God, whom it only lays hold of, Therefore those Men seem not to have got a clear insight into the Vertue and Nature of the Grace of Faith, that suppose the whole Life thereof to consist in Love, as if Faith of it self could do nothing, but as it receives Vertue and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy from Charity.</p>
                  <p>Indeed both may seem to be true in the External Actions of Human Life, in which Faith lyes like a dead thing, unless it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by Charity to the exercise of good Works. And hereunto belongs that saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby he so much commends Faith working by Love, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <note place="margin">What Faith Works with God, and what with Men. A twofold Opperation of Faith.</note> such Works, as Faith working by Love brings forth to the view of a Human Eye. Yet with God Faith hath a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent operation; for it only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reliance upon Works, or assistance of Charity, but trusting to the naked promise of God, and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Mediatour, climbs up to Heaven, and gets access into the presence of God, where it does great and wonderful things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95561:196"/>
with the Iudgment to come, fighting against the terrours of Death, Satan, and Hell, pleads the cause of a Sinner, obtains his pardon, absolves and justifies him from the accusations of a guilty Conscience, takes away all Iniquity, reconciles God to the Sinner, appeases his wrath, subdues the power of Death and the Devil, and procures Peace, yea and Paradise it self; with theThief, that had led a wicked Life, and yet at Death was justified by Faith in the Redeemer. Who would desire more or greater things? And now so many and great things being done by Faith, let us enquire, After what manner it does them? Not <note place="margin">After what manner doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Life of Faith is not Charity but Christ.</note> as it lives and works by Love, but as it lives only by Christ, and relies on the promise: for the Life of Faith, which lives (before God) is not Charity, but Christ, not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life from Charity but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating life unto it, and justifying Works, that they may be acceptable to God, which would otherways be abominable. Unto the truth of this we have a sufficient Testimony given us by <hi>Paul:</hi> When he says, my Life is <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 1 Cor. 4.</note> Christ; and again, the Life, that I now live in the Flesh, I live, not by the Love, but by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>
                  <p>And elsewhere speaking of himself, he says, That he was not conscious to himself of any VVickedness, and yet he denies that he is thereby Iustified, as the same Apostle discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

I ask in the first place, who is it here, that was an hungred? You will say, Christ either himself in his own Body, or in a Member of his Body. Did you then feed Christ, when he was an hungred? That was Piously done indeed? Therefore I see and commend what you have done. But I ask, what was it that stirred you
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95561:198"/>
up to do it? Whether was it Charity, setting Faith a work, or was it not rather Faith setting Charity a work? But what if some other that was no Member of Christ, whether Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or <hi>Turk</hi> had need of your Meat? Would you in your Charity have fed him? I doubt of that. But suppose you your self had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Christ but had been an Enemy to him, if you had seen one that belonged to Christ almost ready to perish for hunger, would you have relieved him? I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so. Why? Because it is only believers, that feed Christ, but Infidels persecute him. The Lord, was thirsty on the Cross, and he had Vinegar given him for drink; which was a Hellish wickedness. But why did they give him Vinegar? Was it want of Love, or was it not rather want of Faith in those unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Pharisees?</hi> Who if they had not wanted Faith, they would not have wanted Charity, to administer help, and Charity, would not have been unrewarded. But let us <note place="margin">Works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outFaith, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent in themselves are of no value with God: yet on the contrary the Works of believers that are mean in themselves lack not their reward.</note> proceed: Suppose one that is not a believers, whether <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> should refresh a hungry Christian, by giving him of his Meat, as old <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Pharisee</hi> entertained Christ with a Dinner: And many of the <hi>Heathens</hi> have been Eminent in offices of kindness and Love. Can the giving of Meat and Drink by any such without Faith merit Eternal Life? Surely not. But if a believer gives his
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:95561:199"/>
Christian Brother so much as a Cup of cold Water in his necessity, shall he lack his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Christ himself says he shall not.</p>
                  <p>Hereby you may see whence it is that our Vertues and good deeds are acceptable to God, and dignified with Rewards; not for themselves, but for the Faith of him that works them, which first justifies the person before all works. And after the person is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, his performances are accepted; and though they are of small value in themselves, yet they are looked upon as great, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded plentifully. Wherefore we <note place="margin">How the name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to works.</note> deny not, that sometimes in the Scriptures the name of Reward is joyned with Eternal Life; and that the works of Brotherly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may in some sense be called meritorious, if so be these works are performed by persons, who are already ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and received into favour by remission of sins, and have obtained a right unto the promise of Eternal Life. Not that their works are of such value, that they should make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Law of God, or merit any thing with God (<hi>ex congruo,</hi> or <hi>condigne</hi>) as they phrase it, either by congruity or worthiness: But they are imputed as Merit by Grace: Not that Eternal Life is due to the works themselves; but because there are consolations laid up in Heaven for Saints and persons in a justified state, to support them in their afflictions: Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life not being due to them for their works, but by right of the promise; just as a Son
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:95561:199"/>
and Heir, to whom his Father's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance <note place="margin">Works imputed for Merits by Grace.</note> is due, doth not merit the right of Sonship by any duties that he performs, but he being born a Son, his duties upon that account are meritorious, so that he wants not a due reward and recompence. Therefore in this Popish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument there is a fallacy.</p>

                  <p>Suppose we grant all contained <note place="margin">Andr. Vega.</note> in this Argument, what will these Roman Iusticiaries infer from thence? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as <hi>Vega</hi> speaks) Faith is not sufficient to Salvation, without the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. It is easie to answer him in a word. Let him keep the Commandments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact Rule of the Divine Will,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95561:200"/>
and he shall be saved. But neither he, nor any other man can perfectly keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God in this Life: From whence we infer this by necessary consequence, That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is no hope of obtaining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or else that it lies not in the works of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be so, what remains, but that finding this is not the way to Heaven, we should seek for another way; and because there is no door of Salvation opened to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Law of Commandments, therefore we must flie to another Refuge: But what that Refuge is, appearing to us from Heaven it self, the Divine Will declares unto us, which is not set forth in the Old Law, but in the New Testament of the Gospel. And this is his Will, that every one who believeth in the Son, should not perish, but have Eternal Life. For whereas the Law was weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Iohn 6. Romans 8.</note> of the flesh, God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the Righteousness, of the Law might be fulfilled in us, that walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But here some may object; Will the Faith of Christ justifie us. in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there may be a Legality and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for us to disobey the Will of his Father? God forbid. The Liberty of the Gospel allows not that; for it openly affirms, That they, who are justified by the Faith of Christ, walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And to this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95561:200"/>
purpose our Lord himself speaks, though not in the same words; Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is in Heaven. For what is it to do the Will of the Father, (but as <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it) to walk, not after the flesh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the spirit? In which place a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the whole Law is not required to Iustification; but the meaning of our Lord's words is this, that he requires a Faith which is not counterfeit, nor hypocritical, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and sincere; which doth not only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and with the mouth, make mention of the name of the Lord, or the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, as the Pharisees and Hypocrites did of old, but heartily endeavours to walk in the fear of God; and though it cannot perform all things commanded in the Law, yet it strives, (as much as in it lies) to shun all things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will of God, that, at least, sin may not have the dominion, if it cannot be wholly excluded or rooted out. Thus I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these words of Christ, To do the Will of his Father, which is in Heaven: For God requires us to do his Will, <note place="margin">A notion of <hi>Bucer.</hi> It is one thing to do the Will of the Father, and another thing to obey it without any imperfection.</note> but does not exact a compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Obedience in this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life. On the contrary, he that makes an outward shew of Faith, and an external profession of the Name of Christ, whilst he takes
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:95561:201"/>
no care to lead a Life suitable to his profession, but runs on in sins against his Conscience, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that such a Faith, according to the saying of Christ, profits him nothing, though he boast in the Name of the Lord, as much as he will; not that Faith without Works doth not justifie before God, provided it be true, and not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; that is, if it is received into a heart truly humbled, as seed into good ground; But because that Faith, which doth not provoke unto Love and good Works; though it may be boasted of at a high rate, yet in reality it is no Faith at all, but only a shadow, and <note place="margin">A feigned and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Faith.</note> false resemblance of Faith. And the same Answer may serve for all their Arguments, which they have wrested out of the Sermons of Christ in the Gospel, to defend their Doctrine of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Works. Of which sort are these next following.</p>

                  <p>From these words they draw this Argument.</p>

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>I answer to the first. The <hi>Minor</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">An Answer to the first Argument.</note> must be understood with a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; He that works iniquity, is taken two manner of ways in Scripture. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times godly men work iniquity, and likewise wicked men; for both of them sin; but they differ in their manner of working iniquity. Godly men commit many things which they hate, and which are truly sins: But because they delight not in them in their inner man, but in their love to Christ, they endeavour with all their might to return unto God by Repentance, God doth not impute their sins
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:95561:202"/>
to them; wherefore those sins that are done away by remission, are not reckoned for sins. But the case is far otherways in those that are wholly bent upon the fulfilling of the lusts of the flesh, and continue in them <note place="margin">Answer to the second. The strength of our Vertues is weak.</note> with delight and satisfaction. And unto them belongs that sentence of Christ, whereby he commands all that work iniquity, to depart from him.</p>
                  <p>As touching the second Argument, it is a fallacy (a <hi>non causa, pro causa,</hi> as we call it) if our Vertues were of sufficient efficacy to merit the Grace of God, there would be some ground for that which they infer. Now our Works being such as have always need of Mercy, and never satisfie the Law of God, nor bring Peace to the Conscience, nor support us under the stroke of Death, or the weight of Iudgment. How evidently doth it hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what we should answer to this Argument? Good Works are pleasing to God; I grant their assumption. But first the person must please God, and be reconciled <note place="margin">Works please for the sake of the perfon being first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</note> to him, that so his works may please and be acceptable; for the person being once reconciled, the works from thence derive their dignity. I acknowledge therefore that works of Piety are pleasing to God, but yet only as they are performed by persons reconciled and justified. But if the manner, how they that do good works, are reconciled, be enquired
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:95561:202"/>
into, they do not obtain Reconciliation by works, but before all merits of <note place="margin">Aug. de fide. &amp; operibus.</note> works; for works go not before him that is to be justified, as a cause thereof, but always as an effect follow him that is justified. As fruits, if they be good, they receive their goodness from the Tree, whence they grow, but they are not the cause why the Tree is good. So in like manner we grant with <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the righteous have great merits. But it comes not from their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but from another caufe, that they are righteous. So <hi>Iacob</hi> was <note place="margin">Iacob. David.</note> beloved of God, before he had done either good or evil. What did <hi>David</hi> before he was anointed King, to deserve so great a dignity? The same may be said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom we read in sacred Records, how great things were promised to him, when first he was called away from his Fathers house: But the Scripture gives us no account of any merits of his, as <note place="margin">Abraham. Adam. Abel.</note> if thereby he had Right unto so great preferments. What shall I say of <hi>Adam?</hi> did he not first lose Paradise, before he received the promise of recovery? And God had respect unto the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel.</hi> What is your Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this? Did the worth of his Oblation procure him this favour? Or shall we say there was some other thing that made his person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, before he had any regard to his Sacrifice? If you cast your Eyes about
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:95561:203"/>
upon all the Histories of the holy Scripture, and take a view of all the Generations of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> when God in his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness did bear with all the provocations of that People, can you discern any thing in their works, that merited so great long-suffering, and patience; or should we say that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the sake of Christ, that was to be born of that Nation? In like manner it may be said of the Church, which though it hath been in so many dangers, and compassed about with so many troubles and snares, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues firm notwithstanding all this opposition, in spite of the very Gates of Hell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it thus? Is it for its own merits, or should we account the Grace and Power of Christ to be the only procuring cause thereof, and no strength nor merit of ours? Now it is evident to every reasonable man, that the same thing, which is the cause of Preservation, is also the cause of Salvation to the Church, which consists not in our Works, but only in the Faith of Christ, and his free Bounty.</p>

                  <p>No man by deeds fulfils the Law in this life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no man is justified by deeds in this life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident by the Authority of the same Apostle <hi>Iames:</hi> Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and offend in one thing, is guilty of all. There is none in the Land of the Living, but fails in some thing. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. Yea there is no man that <note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> offends not in many things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man in this life fulfils the Law of God, no not <hi>Iames</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider the words <note place="margin">The words of Christ are considered. Matth. 7.</note> of Christ that are cited out of the Gospel: He that heareth my words, and doeth them, &amp;c. Who doth not clearly apprehend the mind of Christ in these words; for it is manifest that his design was, to rebuke the counterfeit pretences of Hypocrites, and thereby to stir up the minds of his own Disciples to the power <note place="margin">A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned. 1 Tim. 1.</note> of Godliness, and sincerity in their profession; which he doth in more than one place, and not without
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95561:204"/>
weighty reasons. For, as nothing is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, so nothing is more usual, than for false Hypocrites to be covered with a Vizard of Holiness, who having no experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things which they profess, nor drawn unto God by Effectual Calling, nor taught by his Spirit, being ignorant of God, and strangers to the practice of Holiness, do make a great shew amongst all men, outwardly pretending to that, which they are not indeed, but would seem to be, who take little or no care at all, to be any way instrumental for the Glory of God: But their chief endeavours are to encrease their gain, and satisfie their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious desires, that they may be great in this World, and get applause and renown amongst men. Such a frame of spirit is in most Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. But the great searcher of hearts, who looks into every dark corner of the Soul, and discerns all the most hidden imaginations, is not unacquainted with their Hypocrisie, and there is nothing more abominable unto him. Therefore our Lord, in giving Instructions of Piety to his Disciples, strictly commands, that such as take upon them the profession of Faith in his Name, should not only make shew of it in words, or account it enough to encline their Ears to his Doctrine, but also practise it in their Lives; and endeavour, as much as in them lies, to walk suitable to their profession. By what I have said it may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that these words do not express the way how we are justified, but they only declare, what manner of men they ought to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95561:204"/>
be, who are Iustified, and have obtained a right to the Heavenly Inheritance by Faith and free Grace.</p>

For though a sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lazy Servant ought to be shut out of the House, yet it doth not therefore follow, that the Inheritance must needs be due to him that faithfully and diligently performs his duty. The Kingdom of Heaven is given to faith, not to duties, by way of gift, not by way of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not for merits, but freely. And though faith in the mean while is not idle, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently exercises it self in the ways of Holiness, yet the possession of this great benefit should not therefore be attributed unto Works?

                  <p>Therefore, the Salvation or Destruction of Men depend on their Works, and not Faith only.</p>
                  <p>If any Man desires to see this Argument in a Syllogistical term, he may take it thus:</p>
                  <p>There is no Iustification without Works, where there is a reward given according to Works.</p>
                  <p>The Iudgment of God rewards according to VVorks.</p>

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>As there is nothing more sure than the Words of <hi>Peter,</hi> in which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that Christ is appointed <note place="margin">Act. 10. 2 Cor. 5. Rom. 10.</note> Iudge of the Living and the Dead, so also that is a truth, which is asserted by <hi>Paul:</hi> That we must all appear before his Iudgment Seat, who will render to every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, which he hath done, whether Good or Evil.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you say, Not Faith but Works do justifie, which are the procuring cause ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Salvation or Destruction. But this is not the consequence of the Words of the Apostle, nor the sense of that Scripture. But, if we Reason according to the mind of the Holy Ghost in these places of Scripture, we must rather draw these consequences from them. Seeing such a Iudgment is approaching, as will bring every one to render an account of their Lives, therefore no Man should flatter himself with hopes, that any of his offences either in words or deeds will go unpunished, but every Man should so frame his Life, that Faith and Holiness may be jointly united together, and not separated from one another.</p>
                  <p>And this is a truth, which many now a days have need to be admonished of, not only Papists, but also Protestants, who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Name and Faith of Christ, but
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95561:206"/>
yet notwithstanding, they so behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as if they thought an-outside shew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were sufficient, and as if they did not look for Iudgment to come, they are so void of care to walk worthy of that Holy profession, giving themselves up against their Conscience to all uncleaness with greediness, whereby they both greatly provoke the wrath of <note place="margin">The inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table severity of Iudgment should stir us up to care &amp; watchfulness.</note> God, and put themselves in dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful danger of the loss of Eternal Salvation. Against such Men as run on into open wickedness, without measure or remorse, we may by better consequence draw this inference.</p>
                  <p>We must appear all of us before the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of God, where account will be taken of all the Actions and Practice of our Lives.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let every one that hath regard to his own Salvation, endeavour according to his power to lead a Life suitable to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and without Hypocrisie, to join a good Conscience with a good Faith.</p>
                  <p>For the word of Truth hath told us: They that have done <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. Coloss. 3.</note> Evil, shall come forth unto the Resurrection of Damnation.</p>
                  <p>But are such Scriptures contrary to Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, in such as together with the profession of faith in Christ, joyn the fruits of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95561:207"/>
Obedience; which though it is not perfect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all accounts, yet it is yielded in sincerity and uprightness of Heart, according to their weak power, and capacity? Which though it comes far short of the compleat perfection of the Law, yet nevertheless our Iustification is full and perfect in the sight of God: For what is defective in our Works, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by his own imputation, thro' <note place="margin">As we are Workers, but as we are Believers. Rom. 4. Habbac. Ioh. 17.</note> faith in his Son, which Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness, not for our working, but for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: for though the abominable rebellion of wicked Men, who walk not after the Spirit, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, brings upon them the Iudgment of Condemnation, yet this continues to be a truth: The Iust shall live by Faith. And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me shall never perish.</p>
                  <p>But you may say, The Sentence of the Iudge remains evident and uncontroulable; which promises the Resurrection of Life, to them that lead a Godly Life.</p>
                  <p>I answer, It is very true, which the Lord says, but the conclusion drawn from hence is very false. For in these Words Christ joyning the Fruit and the <note place="margin">A Fillacious Sophismfrom the concrete to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract.</note> Tree, Persons and things together, gives the comfortable hope of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life unto his own Servants, who according to their power, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour diligently in the Gospel: Not thereby determining what their Works deserve, but
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95561:207"/>
shewing with how many, and great rewards he will crown their labours; who have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any thing for his Name. But those Men contrariways arguing from the concrete to the abstract, and dividing things from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, conclude amiss by this <hi>Enthymema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that are believers in Christ, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves diligently in all Holiness; shall be received into Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Good Works are the cause of Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>To this I may make a brief and easie Answer.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>I deny the consequence: for it is a Fallacy (<hi>a non causa pro causa</hi>) for in the antecedent the works of the godly are brought in as effects, but in the conclusion <note place="margin">A Fallacy.</note> as a cause: whence there is no sound conclusion from the concrete to the abstract. For it is no rational arguing, because believers living Holily receive the gift of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, therefore their deeds merit Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. Iust as if a Man should reason on this manner; a Wife being Obedient to her Husband, is admitted to be a partaker of all his Goods: Therefore her Obedience is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a share in all his Possessions: A Son being Obedient to his Father, is received for
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95561:208"/>
his Heir, therefore his Obedience deserves the Inheritance. VVorks are evidences of faith in Christ, but not the cause of Salvation. Iust as a Tree, that brings forth Fruit, if it hath any goodness in it, receives it not from the Fruit, but the Fruit hath all its goodness from the Tree. In like manner the works of the Godly, have nothing, that they can claim a right unto in Iudgment: If they find any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or reward, that is not due to them, but partly to Mercy, and <note place="margin">Mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Evil deeds. Imputation puttidg a great value upon finall things.</note> partly to Imputation for the sake of the Mediatour: to Mercy, which pardons Evil deeds: to Imputation, which puts a great value upon good VVorks, though of very little worth in themselves, and crowns them with rewards: So that all the praise belong, not to Men, but to God: Not to Righteousness but Grace, not to Works, but Faith, not to Iudgment, but Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, Shall we not all come to Iudgment? Must we not all appear before the Tribunal of God? It is true, we <note place="margin">The Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is twofold according to <hi>Aug. de confut. Evang. lib. 2. cap. 30.</hi> The Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Iudgment of <hi>discretion.</hi>
                     </note> shall all come: But <hi>Augustin</hi> tells us of a twofold Iudgment, one of condemnation, and another of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, whereby the Goats shall be separated from the Lambs, and not Lambs condemned with the Goats. It is an Article of my faith, that we shall all of us come to <hi>Iudgment,</hi> but I do hope the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95561:208"/>
Elect of God will not come into the Iudgment of Condemnation. And here we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distinguish between the Lambs and the Goats; between those that are united to Christ by Faith, and the damned crew of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. For though in this just Iudgment of God, every one shall give account to God of all their Works. And there is no doubt but a reward will be given suitable to every man's Works; but in a far different manner to the one and the other. For they who seek for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not by Faith, nor the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness only, but by the Works of the Law; they shall receive a reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the desert of their deeds; upon this condition, that they shall live by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, if they fulfil the Law as they ought; but if not, what else must they expect, but that, according to the just Decree of the Law, no violation thereof should be found so small, as not to make the sinner liable to Condemnation, and justly so. For he that hath no power in himself to obtain Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is not willing to receive it, when it is offered by another, if he suffer the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to his sins, let him not accuse the Law of unjustice, but himself of unbelief.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, they that by sincere Faith are converted unto Christ, if they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any evil thing (for who among the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest that is) can run through his Race without a fall: Their sins can do them no hurt in the Iudgment, which are already done away and pardoned before the Iudgment by Faith and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95561:209"/>
Repentance. And besides this, if they did any thing well, and worthy of praise, they receive an everlasting Reward, not for the merit of the Work, but according to free Imputation, whereby God in his Infinite Mercy sets such a value on the works of them that believe in his Name, though they are vile and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in themselves, that he rewards them with the recompence of the promised Inheritance, not for any merit of theirs, but according as he hath promised it freely in his Son. Now there being a twofold <note place="margin">The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Mercy of separation.</note> manner of Divine Iudgment (as we have shewed out of <hi>Augustine</hi>) one, belonging to the Iustice of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and another to the Mercy of Separation. According to this diversity of Iudgment, we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that are to be called before this Tribunal of the great Iudge; for all of us must be called and presented before it; but the distinction between those that shall appear must be observed: For though we are all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Nature, and in the practice <note place="margin">A twofold kind of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Romans 8.</note> of our Lives; yet we are not all sinners after the same manner. There are some whose sins are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgiven by Faith and the free Grace of God; and there is no doubt but the Mercy of Separation will deliver such from the Iudgment of Condemnation, because there is nothing that can be justly alledged against them. For who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that justifies, who is he
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:95561:209"/>
that condemns? Or, how can they in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness be called to Iudgment for these things, that were pardoned by the Iudge himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought under the Tryal of Iudgment? For the offence being taken away, the offender is not liable to Iudgment: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Sentence of Condemnation should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright those that are in Christ Iesus. What Law can hold them guilty, that are not under the Law, but under Grace?</p>
                  <p>And again, there are others, that having passed their days in all manner of wickedness and abominations, at their departure out of this Life, carry with them a guilty self-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conscience unto Iudgment. Of which sort of Monsters this World hath been very fruitful: Such as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Who are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Iudgment of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>Diagoras, Lucian, Sardanapalus,</hi> vain glorious Boasters, implacable Persecuters and Murderers of the Saints; and such like: Who, though they may flatter themselves in this Life, as if they were safe and out of danger, yet they will find to their sorrow, that there is a Iudge before whom they must unavoidably appear, and give a strict account of all the actions of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as touching the Iudgment of the Evil and the Good, as I deny not that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, the Lord will judge the Living and the Dead in Righteousness and Equity: So, if they understand it of the Iudgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:95561:210"/>
I answer, as the Lawyers use to say, The Exception limits the Rule. For though this Iudgment is to be <note place="margin">The Rule of Right.</note> general, yet if it be taken for the condemnatory Iudgment, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule is of force, excepting those things that should be excepted. But what this Exception is, and to whom it belongs, it appears evident enough by the distinction of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, mentioned by Christ in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">Iohn 5. Luke 21.</note> places: He that hears my Word, and believes in him that sent me, shall not come into condemnation, but shall pass from death to life. And again, where the Lord fore-telling the time of his coming to Iudgment, <note place="margin">Why the day of Iudgment is called a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> says thus; When these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads: And presently gives the reason thereof; for your Redemption draweth near. Wherefore did it please him to make mention of Redemption to his Disciples without naming of Iudgment? Certainly it was, because, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, as on the contrary, there is no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those who live without the Faith of Christ, in slavery to this World and the Flesh. And elsewhere the Lord, when he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Disciples, and could promise them nothing that was more glorious and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he said unto them, Ye also shall sit upon Thrones, judging the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> Moreover
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:95561:210"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corintbians,</hi> says, <note place="margin">The Saints shall judge the World.</note> Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the World? And yet breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth something more glorious, he exalts Saints above the highest pitch of worldly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty adding further: Know ye not that we shall judge the Angels? If the Saints shall be judges, how should they be judged in this Court of Iudicature, in which they have something to do, but nothing to fear.</p>

               <head>Whether the Iudgment of God is terrible to the Saints.</head>
               <p>THerefore let <hi>Canisius</hi> produce what he can answer unto these Scriptures; for it is his Opinion, that all men should be possessed with fear of Iudgment. These are his words; Not only Sinners, but <note place="margin">Pit. Canis. in opere Catechis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico de Iudicio; cap. 3.</note> also Saints themselves are oft-times affrighted at the fore-thoughts of Iudgement. Thus the Iesuit speaks in his own Dialect. But let us hear what Scripture-proofs he brings to maintain his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. Hence, saith he, <hi>David</hi> feared, and with great fervency breathed forth this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Lord, enter not into Iudgment with thy Servant. In like manner <hi>Iob</hi> feared, though he was innocent; What shall I do, said he, when God ariseth to judge, and when he visiteth, What shall I <note place="margin">Psalm 142. Iob 31.</note> answer? For destruction from the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95561:211"/>
Almighty was a terrour to me, and because of his greatness, I could not endure. I was afraid of all my sorrows, for I knew thou wouldest not hold me innocent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this Objection, I answer in short; Who knows not, that, in us, and our Works, there is nothing whereof we ought not to be greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid? So <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and all the Saints; the more they call to mind the actions and practice of their Lives, the more they are surprized with the fear of Divine Iudgment, and repose the less confidence in themselves.</p>
               <p>But this doth not at all abate our rejoycing in Christ Iesus; so that relying upon the never failing Promise of God, and being assured of the remission of our sins, we strive against this fear as much as we can. Howbeit we cannot be so perfectly rid of <note place="margin">It is incident to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Saints to be in donbt sometimes concerning their spiritual graces and to be afraid of their sins.</note> this fear, which is placed in our Nature, but that it will sometimes return and cause trouble to the most eminent Saints. But that, which sometimes happens through infirmity, is one thing, and that which always becomes the Saints to do, is another. So <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> before the return of spiritual comfort, were in terrour, but, after God had restored unto them the joy of his Salvation, all fear vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away. <hi>Canisius</hi> in saying, the Saints should be possessed with the fear of Iudgment, does, what in him lies, to root out all the assurance of Faith out of the minds of the godly, and to make the Promise of God, and our fiducial
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:95561:211"/>
relyance on him, utterly void, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Does Christ encourage us to lift up our heads for joy of the approaching Redemption, and yet dares <hi>Canisius</hi> command us to hang them down for fear of Iudgment? <note place="margin">Romans 8. Galat. 4. Philip. 1.</note> Doth <hi>Paul</hi> promote the Saints unto so high a pitch of dignity, that he places them on the Seat of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together with Christ. <hi>as his Assessours and Assistants.</hi> And yet must <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> thrust the godly down as low as the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to render a strict account of all the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of their Lives? The holy Spirit in the Souls of Believers, with fervency breaths after Christ, crying, Come Lord Iesus, come quickly; Should <hi>Canisius</hi> then <note place="margin">Apoc. 22.</note> endeavour to quench those holy desires by unbelief and distrustful fears? The Sacred Writings of the holy Apostles call the Spirit of the Saints, a Spirit, not of bondage to fear, but a Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father; and yet hath <hi>Canisius</hi> the Iesuit the impudence to call back the Saints from a Spirit of Liberty, to a slavish Spirit of Bondage? Is this any society with Iesus? <hi>Paul</hi> desires to be dissolved and to be with Christ. All Believers in Christ desire the same being afflicted in this Life. For all that desire to live godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in this present evil World. The Souls of them that were slain, under the Altar, are greatly longing for the coming of this Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But, as for <hi>Canisius,</hi> he would persuade us to be afraid of this day, and not to wish
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95561:212"/>
for it, and love it, as the Apostle <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. For them that love his appearance.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> bids us rejoyce, because the Marriage of the Lamb is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the Iesuit bids us mourn. The Lamb's Wife cloaths her self in fine Linnen in token of her joy; but <hi>Canisius</hi> would have her cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sackcloth.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless I deny not the truth of that, which he gathers out of <hi>Bernard, Gregory</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> concerning the dreadful severity of this Iudgment, than which I know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more terrible to them, that seek Salvation by the Righteousness of the Law, without flying to Christ for refuge.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, we ought not to abate the comfort, nor discourage the fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of Believers in Christ, who are planted in him by Faith. Though they acknowledge their own imperfections, yet they strive against them, and endeavour daily, according to their power, to make some progress in Holiness. And therefore, as there is nothing in their good Works, whereof they may boast; So also there is nothing in their evil Works (being now forgiven) which they have cause to fear. Let us now proceed to the other Arguments of the Adversaries.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Argument.</head>
                  <p>If there are no merits of Works, then that saying is false; Thou shalt render to every one according to his Works. But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:95561:212"/>
is false, therefore also the Antecedent</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> hath been answered already by making a distinction of persons: For there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a twofold sort of men, to wit, Such as are in Christ, and such as are out of Chrst, there must be a different Iudgment made of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>First; Those that are in Christ, being united unto him by Faith, the Iudgment of God uses to begin with them in this Life. As touching the Life to come, the Lord hath made this Promise concerning every Believer; He shall not come into Iudgment, but hath passed from Death to Life. <note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Suppose we grant, that the Elect of God shall be called to Iudgment, the account that they shall then make, will be very easie, who have Christ for their Righteousness. Whence it follows by necessary consequence, that this Iudgment will be to them a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of Condemnation, but of Absolution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Sentences of the Law belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to them that are under the Law; but as for such as are regenerate by Faith in Christ, because they are not under the Law, but under Grace, the Law hath no dominion over them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Whereas it is said, That every man shall receive according to his works; those works are either good or evil: If good, they are good upon the account of Faith only, (for
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95561:213"/>
what is not of Faith is sin) and so they are beyond all danger: But if evil, either they are forgiven, or not forgiven. If they are forgiven through Faith and Repentance, they are not called to Iudgment: If not forgiven, it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want Faith, and so they are the works of the Unregenerate. Whence it follows, that this Iudgment of Condemnation doth not at all belong to them that are regenerate by Faith, but them that are unregenerate.</p>
               </div>

                  <p>That place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. concerning <note place="margin">Of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment.</note> the wedding garment is objected. The King entring into the Marriage Feast, saw a man not having on the wedding garment, &amp;c. I wonder what those Papists can find in this place of Scripture to cover the shame of their own nakedness, when there is nothing, that less advantages their cause, or weakens it more. The wedding garment, say they, signifies Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from whence they form this Argument.</p>
                  <p>They that have on the wedding garment, are admitted to the Marriage Feast.</p>

               <head>An Explication of the Parable of the Wedding Garment.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Minor</hi> must be denied: <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Though works of Charity are of no small advantage, to adorn and beautifie faith in the exercise fo Civilty and Morality; yet a Garment suitable to the Heavenly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast, cannot be made of such Cloth; but of other Materials. What that is, whereof this Garment must be <note place="margin">Rom. 13. Galat. 3.</note> made, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle teaches us, Put on the Lord Iesus Christ. And again, whosever of you are Baptized, ye have put on Christ. Because we put not on him by Charity, but by Faith only; Therefore faith is the Garment, made white with the Blood of the Lamb, which Cloaths us for this Marriage-feast, not <note place="margin">Apoc. 7.</note> Charity, nor the filthy ragged ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel of our Works. Which that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more evident, let us diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider both the Parable and the signification thereof.</p>
               <p>First, He that compares our <note place="margin">The Parable of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and Marriage-Garment considered and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> great happiness in Christ to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast, How could he more significantly set forth that, which is the most joyful of all things? For what is more joyful, or suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Mirth than a Marriage-feast?
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95561:214"/>
Where all things resound with Ioy, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, where there is no sign of Sorrow, where no Lamentation is heard, no Tear is seen, yea all Tears are wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">Isa. 25.</note> from the Eyes. Unhappy is he, that partakes not of the great felicity, and unspeakable Ioy of this blessed Marriage-feast. He that unworthily dishonours it, deserves to be abhorred, and he that disgraces it with Sackcloth and Ashes, or any other Garment, and comes to it without the wedding-garment, is not worthy to enjoy so great a blessedness.</p>
               <p>Now consider, besides the joyfulness of the time, the greatness of the benefit; both which are Infinite and Eternal. For <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Lamb of God with his Bride.</note> as there is no firmer, nor nearer Bond amongst Men, than that of Marriage: So nothing is more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, nothing is more Glorious, than that Bond, whereby the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and Mortal Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the Immortal Son of God, the frail Church to the Heavenly Bridegroom, that they both become one flesh, and have God to be one Father to them both, and have the same Family, the same House, the same society of Life, and the same <note place="margin">The Guests of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> possession of all Goods. Which thing is so exceedingly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it surpasses all human understanding. Iust as if a great King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to shew forth the Riches of his munificence should invite Beggars, and the Blind, and the Cripple, and every one that
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95561:214"/>
was least worthy, and entertain them with a Feast, and enrich them <note place="margin">The Guests of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Feast.</note> with abundance of his best gifts; Is it possible, that any Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them durst imagine, that this was due to his own Vertues, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</p>
               <p>It remains that we should view the Guests themselves, and also the garments of the guests, whom he invites to this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage banquet, and not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, <note place="margin">Luk. 14.</note> but compels them to come in. Call the Poor, saith he, and the Lame, and the Blind, and compel them to come in, that my House may be filled? Who are these Poor, and Blind, <note place="margin">Who are the Blind, and the Lame, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the Marriage.</note> and Feeble, and Naked, but such as have no provision of their own Works? Who have nothing in themselves, whereof to Glory, but only in the Lord. Such as were the Publicans of Old, and Sinners of the Gentiles, and Pagans, concerning whom <hi>Paul</hi> Discourses in words of great weight.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles that followed not after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, laid hold on Righteousness, that is, the Righteousness that is of Faith. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryways, <hi>Israel</hi> that followed after the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law, attained not thereunto: Wherefore? Because <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law. How great stupidity then and abominable impudence is this in vain glorious Men, who being by
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95561:215"/>
Nature wretched, and Blind, and Naked, and most miserable Beggars, notwithstanding all this, are exalted to the highest dignity of union with God, and <note place="margin">Against the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Works.</note> that not for any merit of their own, but the free donation of Christ, that yet they neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their own nakedness, nor testifie their thankfulness to God for the Riches of his Grace, but think themselves abundantly beautified with their own ornaments, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furnished with merits to attain unto Righteousness: But what a Righteousness is this of theirs? If it be the Righteousness of Works? Who then are those poor and needy, that are admitted to the Marriage? They that are adorned with the beauty and glory of Merits, and abound with Riches of good Works, How can we account such to be poor, and blind, and lame? And if they are said to be compelled to come in, where is the free will of the <hi>Tridentines?</hi> Or its co-operation? But on the contrary if by the poor here be understood such as have no good works that can commend them, nor any help of free will, that are decked with no ornaments, but are admitted, or rather drawn to the Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feast by the grace of Christ only, How then can Charity abounding <note place="margin">The Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with the works of the Law, be truly called the Wedding-garment?</p>
               <p>Howbeit, I know there are some great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that rather approve of this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the wedding-garment here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95561:215"/>
Should signifie Charity. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider exactly the circumstances of the Parable, if without offending those, that have better Iudgments, I may freely profess, what is my Opinion, I do rather suppose, that our Lord's design was, to signifie the same, that <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle expresly <note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> speaks of himself, that I may be found in him, not having my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the saith of Christ; the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which is of God by faith. And if we are not blind, we all see evident proof of the same, not only by words, but by the example of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Wherefore if none are entertained in this Marriage-feast, but they that have on the wedding-garment, and if <hi>Israel</hi> that followed after Righteousness is said to be rejected upon no other account, but because they sought it by works, and not by faith; can it be doubted, that this Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ornament consists not in works, but in the faith of Christ? I know, there are many kinds of garments, as also there are many differences of things, <note place="margin">Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should be every where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumstances of places, times, and things.</note> of Men, and of places: But all things agree not with all places, nor with all Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>One thing is suitable to a Court of Iustice, another thing to a banquet. Iudges sitting on the Bench, and Guests at a Marriage feast, do not only differ in the frame of their Spirits,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95561:216"/>
but also in their outward Garb. A suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of things, places and times, should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. The Law hath its own <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Law, and the Kingdom of the Gospel. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Gospel.</note> Kingdom, and Christ also hath his; and both have their own Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: As the Kingdom of the Law receives none but the righteous; so the Kingdom of Christ rejects none, though they be wicked, if they are brought to Repentance by believing. And though both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms belong to God, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dominion, yet the manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of both Kingdoms is not the same: For in the dominion of the Law God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to manifest his Righteousness; but the Kingdom of Christ is the gift of Grace and Mercy: And as by the free gift of God it is offered to all that believe, so it receives none but such, as are glad, freely and willingly to embrace the Grace offered. And for the same reason chiefly, this Kingdom of Christ is by a very fit similitude compared to a Marriage Feast and a wedding garment: And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause; for if in a Marriage Feast all things abound with mirth and joy, how much more should we rejoyce, and be glad in Christ, by whose procurement we obtain the manifold riches of Everlasting Salvation and Glory?</p>
               <p>Therefore what remains, but that we should with thankful hearts gladly receive these great benefits, of our dear Saviour; and <note place="margin">What the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment signifies</note> especially because by the wedding garment, in this place, nothing else
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95561:216"/>
can be understood. For as a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a token of the joyfulness of the mind at the Marriage Feast; so by this wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing garment is signified with what joy and gladness, with what holy reverence and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, the Guests of this Banquet will enjoy the heavenly benefits. Whereunto the Apostle exhorts more than once with so much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that we should not be over-sollicitous for any thing, but always rejoyce in the Lord, and glory in nothing, but in the Cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, praising God in our hearts, as it is expressed in that sacred Hymn; Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory. But how do those superstitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists glory in the Lord, who trust to their own Works, whose rugged and burdensom Religion consists wholly in Watchings, Vows, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Men, sleeping on the ground, and such like hardships, and an affected austerity of life. But let us proceed to the Arguments that remain.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Another Argument.</head>
                  <p>There are also many other Scriptures, which they have wrested abominably for the defence of their Opinion about Inherent Righteousness. As for example, where the Lord says, That he came not to destroy <note place="margin">Matthew 5.</note> the Law, but to fulfil it: Hence they infer, that all that would be saved, must of necessity keep the Law. That I may answer this Objection, I acknowledge that saying of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:95561:217"/>
the Lord to be very true, and I know what he professed in words, he performed in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of his Life: For he came not to destroy the Law, but perfectly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The sense of thatScripture,</hi> I came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it.</note> to fulfil it, and that not so much upon his own account, as upon ours. But it is not therefore a right consequence, which they draw from an ill formed Argument.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Argument.</head>
                  <p>Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is no Salvation to any, but those that perform the Law.</p>
                  <p>This is a false consequence; for there is more in the conclusion, than in the antecedent: For this should have been the conclusion, Therefore should we diligently endeavour to fulfil the Law, according to his Example, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those things that belong to us; for we are not subject to the same Ceremonies of the Law, that he was: As when he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, and went to the Feast at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> thrice a year, abstained from things that were cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially unclean, and from things strangled, and blood, and celebra-ted the Passover ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law; and many things of that kind, whereunto we are not now obliged.</p>
                  <p>But, though it be very true, that he came to fulfil the Law; yet we are not therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:95561:217"/>
to the fulfilling of the Law, as a thing necessary to our Salvation. For the Office of Christ is distinguished by a twofold end: For he was sent by his Father partly for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that in our stead he might yield perfect Obedience unto the Law, to which impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity we our selves had a woful Obligation, and that he might stir us up unto Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by his own Example; but the Office of the Mediatour consists chiefly in this; That he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <note place="margin">A twofold Office of Christ the Mediatour.</note> us from the dreadful Curse of the Law, and by his Death made full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Iustice for all our Debts, and translated us from our bondage and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very into a blessed state of liberty: Which makes us now to rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The Errour of those who take Christ for theirLaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</note> it is seasonable here to give notice, that they who upon this account take Christ for a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, as if he had been sent by God for no other cause but to make new Laws in the World, are in a great Errour: For though he made a sound and right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his Countrey Laws, which were commanded by God, and given by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet he was not sent principally for this purpose, to make new or old Laws, but rather to bring help to those that were under the Curse of the <note place="margin">Christ is not a Law-giver, but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</note> Law, and thereby in peril of damnation.</p>

                  <head>Another Argument.</head>
                  <p>Unless Christ had kept the Law, he had neither saved himself, nor others.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we cannot be saved, unless we keep the things that are commanded in the Law.</p>

If he had failed in any thing commanded by the Law, there was no other Redeemer, that could have interposed for him. The same may be said of the Angels if they had sinned: But if we through infirmity go astray, the blood of our Lord Iesus Christ is in readiness for our Redemption, to raise us up when we are fallen, to procure the pardon of our offences, and to restore us unto a blessed state.</p>

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>Verily there is no other Weapon put into our hands, that we can retort with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon Enemy, than this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the Mystical signification of both these Sacraments, Baptism, and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is nothing else but Faith in Christ Iesus: for as Baptism is called a Sacrament of Faith, and therefore is sometimes by <hi>Augustin</hi> put for Faith; so those that are well instructed in the knowledge of Christ, understand, that to eat the flesh of Christ, is the same with believing in him. If we rightly consider the nature of this Sacrament, there cannot be a more evident demonstration that we are justified by no other thing but Faith only. For by what Argument could it be more manifestly set before our Eyes, how great benefit redounds to us from the shedding of the blood of Christ, than by the Institution of the Sacramental Bread and Wine, for a memorial of his Body and Blood? Or by what other thing could he more effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto our Faith the powerful efficacy of his Death, than by the Institution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
                  <p>First; Pious Reader, call to mind, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your self this miserable and mortal Nature; which how void and destitute it is of all things, and how empty of Divine Grace, and laden with iniquities, you cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Thou who in thy self art a wretched and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95561:219"/>
destroyed man, comest to the Banquet, where thou art commanded to take the Sacramental Bread and Cup in the name of him that was slain for thee, and then thou art bid, Eat; for otherwise to what purpose should you hold the Bread in your hands when it is broken, and reached forth unto you, unless it be <note place="margin">The glorious resemblance between the Bread of the Sacrament, and the Lords Passion.</note> received inwardly for digestion. Eat, saith he, and drink ye all of it; for this is my Body, and this is my Blood, that was shed for you. What was his design in expressing himself thus, but to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that his Death would be like a great Supper to his whole Church, in which, sinners, that in themselves were wretched and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and empty and hunger-bitten, might be refreshed with an everlasting Feast of fat things, according as the Lord had long since promised by the Prophet <note place="margin">Isa. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Isaiah.</hi> For as this mortal Life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue without daily nourishment; so neither hope of Eternal Life, nor any other Grace can endure, unless it be supported by Faith in the Lamb of God, and thereby receive spiritual nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> And therefore unless ye eat, saith he, the flesh of the Son of Man, &amp;c. Whence it is evident, that there is no Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for miserable sinners, but that which consists in Christ only, who was slain for us. Yea there is no Iustification in him neither but by Faith, which receives inwardly, and digests this Bread that came down from Heaven;
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95561:219"/>
according as we are taught in the Gospel. He that believes in me hath Life eternal; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ye may have life through his name. Unless ye believe that <note place="margin">Iohn 6. Iohn 2. 38. Luke 8.</note> I am he, &amp;c. Thy Faith hath made thee whole. Wherefore, there can be no surer demonstration that Faith only justifies, than is held forth in these very words of the Sacrament, whereby the flesh and blood of Christ is represented in that holy Banquet under the similitude of Bread and Wine.</p>

                  <p>By these words the Lord gives us serious Instruction, what manner of lives they ought to live, that are justified: But he doth not thereby signifie, what is the proper cause of Iustification; one Iudgment should be made of the causes of things, and another of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. If you enquire for the cause of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lord hath resolved that doubt; Thy Faith hath saved thee. This is Life eternal, that they should know thee, <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:95561:220"/>
the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent. In like manner <hi>Paul</hi> expressed himself: If thou confess the Lord <note place="margin">Romans 9.</note> Iesus with thy mouth, and believe with thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. But if you enquire, what manner of lives they ought to live, that make sincere profession of the Faith of Christ, we are taught in this place, and many other sayings of Scripture, that they ought to differ much from the lives of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees; to wit, that they who are created in Christ Iesus, should behave themselves without a Pharisaical Vizard of external Holiness, or a proud conceitedness of their own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but that they should be adorned and beautified with sincerity and uprightness of mind, and persevere in the practice of good Works, which God hath prepared, that we should walk in them; he said not, that we should be justified by them, but that being justified by his Grace, we should walk in them, bringing forth fruits worthy of our Vocation.</p>

                  <p>Every Tree that bears not good fruit shall be cut down, and cast into the fire, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Faith only is not sufficient to Salvation without Repentance.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge the Divine Authority of that Prophecy, which is true, as it is generally known
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:95561:220"/>
to all that have heard of the Gospel: For who would endure an Unfruitful Tree, that cumbers the ground, and beares either no Fruit at all, or such as is hurtful to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? But suppose it brings forth good Fruit, and beautiful to look upon, I would ask them, whether the abundance of Fruit be the cause, or whether it is not rather the demonstration of the Tree's Fruitfulness; and whether the Fruits do not rather receive their growth from the Root, whence they come? Therefore, if Repentance is reckoned amongst Fruits, it doth not make the Man, in whom it receives its first beginning, perfect and good, but only evidences what manner of Man he is now, and hath formerly been. For unless a wicked Life had gone before, no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had followed after. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <note place="margin">Repentance doth not make a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfect, but evidences what he is.</note> Repentance could do no good, unless Faith be joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, by which a broken hearted Sinner may get access to the Throne of Grace. But you may say, Are not grief and remorse for Evil deeds, and resolutions to the contrary, things very acceptable to God, and are not only conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the amendment of former miscarriages, but also a great cause of future Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>I Answer, The sorrow of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conscience, which we call <note place="margin">The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> Repentance, is a lovely effect, but it proceeds from an Evil cause: yet I deny not, that it is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95561:221"/>
thing, and never too late, but always acceptable to God if so be it is accompanied with Faith in Christ. Neither do I deny that by means thereof Men are deterred from their customary Evil courses, and stirred up to the exercise of Vertue. Which though we grant to be true, what doth all this avail towards the justifying of a sinner from those Sins, that he hath formerly committed?</p>
                  <p>If a Man hath transgressed the Laws of the Commonwealth, and being arraigned before a Iudge is forced to give account of all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Life; will it be enough for him to say, I was in an errour, or I repent of my fault? Will fear of judgment, or shame, set a Man free from the condemnation due to sin, unless the Righteousness of a bleeding Saviour, apprehended by faith, do interpose, and ward off the stroke of Divine vengeance from the guilty Sinner? Without <note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> shedding of Blood, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, there is no remission.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if neither Holiness of Life, nor Prayers, nor Tears; nor the Blood of all the Saints can avail any thing towards the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bitterness of this Iudgment, and the only remedy be the death of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, what will your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance do in this case? Indeed, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Scripture attributes much to Repentance, and there are glorious promises annexed thereunto; but two things must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:95561:221"/>
here. First, Of how large an extent the Promises are, and <note place="margin">How far the Promises reach and to whom they belong.</note> next, to whom they do belong: for there are some rewards given in this Life, and others that are reserved for Life Eternal. Verily Eternal Life, which is the benefit of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it could not be purchased by any works of ours, so likewise it is not promised as the reward of Repentance or if in any Scripture it seems to be so promised, it is not simply upon the account of Repentance, but for another cause; To wit, the faith of the worker, and not the work it self.</p>
                  <p>Therefore these things should be put each of them in their own places, and comprehended within their own bounds. That it may be understood aright, what Faith does, and what Repentance, and what efficacy is in both, and how they are distinguished from one another, and also how they being joyned together do contribute mutual assistance to one another in the Iustification of the Ungodly. For though we deny <note place="margin">What Faith does, and what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> not that both are very pleasing to God, yet the one is acceptable to him one way, and the other ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. For faith is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able through Christ, but Repentance only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Faith. And it is also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, that, though by faith only, as the procuring cause, we obtain Iustification in the sight of God: Yet this very faith doth not put forth its power of Iustifying upon any, but penitent and broken-hearted Sinners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95561:222"/>
in the Gospel we are so often invited to Repentance. Not that it is not true faith only, which justifies without Repentance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause faith, if it be true, justifies no others, but them that have turned from their Sins in sincerity, and are converted unto God by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For such as have no trouble of Conscience, nor sorrow for Sin, but run on obstinately against their Conscience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Evil courses, it is a vain thing for them to hope for Iustification by Faith, whereof they falsely boast, for all such stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Sinners are far from Righteousness. None need the Physician, but they that are Sick, neither doth Christ invite any to come unto him, but such as are heavy laden: Come unto me, saith he, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. But what is coming to Christ, but believing in him according to the saying of <hi>Augustin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, as Christ rejects none, that come unto him, that is, such as return to him by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but revives and justifies them; so faith in Christ, in which only our Salvation consists, is no where of a saving efficacy, but only in those whom it finds <note place="margin">

                  <head>Another Objection.</head>
                  <p>If Faith only were sufficient to Iustification, it would follow <note place="margin">Andrad. Vega, de Iust. 2. p. 741.</note> that good Works are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>But the Consequent is false.</p>
                  <p>And, Therefore the Antecedent also is false, That Faith ony is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vega</hi> confirms the <hi>Minor</hi> with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Unless good Works had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in all respects, <hi>Paul</hi> had not so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given Instructions about Vertue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked Vice, and so mightily commended good Manners, and Integrity of Life; but we shall afterwards enquire into the <hi>Minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the Argument: And,</p>
                  <p>First, I deny the <hi>Major;</hi> for this is not a necessary Consequence.</p>
                  <p>Salvation is obtained by Faith in Christ only.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, good Works are not necessary.</p>
                  <p>The necessity of Vertue, and honest disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is, and always hath been, very great in all respects both private and publick; yet this
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95561:223"/>
necessity doth not at all detract from the peculiar dignity of Faith, that it should not be the only cause of Iustification; as on the other side, the Iustification of Faith doth not take away the necessity nor lessen the care of a Godly Life. Therefore both Faith in Christ, and the practice of Holiness are necessary; the one, to justifie Sinners in the sight of God, and the other to exercise them that are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this World.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, There is need of a distinction in this case: for according to Philosophy, a thing is said to be necessary two manner of ways.</p>
                  <p>First, Absolutely and simply, when one thing is so necessary to <note place="margin">A twofold necessity, 1. Absolute.</note> another, that it cannot be done or consist without it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In respect of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when a thing is of such a <note place="margin">2. In respect of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencee. How are good Works are necessary to Salvation.</note> Nature, that as soon as it begins to be, other things also are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it. or at least soon follow after, and thus good works in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons justified, are necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not simply, but in regard of Consequence.</p>
                  <p>By what I have said, any Reader that is not void of Sense, may easily discern, that we seek not to banish good Works out of the World, that they should not be necessary, but
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:95561:223"/>
we only remove them from being a cause of Iustifying: That so both Faith and Works may be put each of them in their own place, and contained within their own bounds. For <hi>Paul</hi> did not in vain, nor without great necessity exhort with much <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was a Zealous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horter to a Holy Life.</note> vehemency to the Godly practice of a Christian Life. For what is more glorious in it self, or more worthy of the profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or fitter to adorn the Doctrine of the Gospel, than that those, who are called by the Name of Christ, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him exactly in their manners, and the practice of their lives: And as they profess themselves to be Citizens of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, they should according to their power endeavour to lead a Life like Heaven, upon Earth? On the contrary what is more abominable or odius, than if those, who have been engaged by so many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, exalted to so great dignity, and are joyned to him into so near an union by so many Covenants and Obligations, if yet they do not follow his Foot-steps, nor imitate him in the practice of their lives?</p>
                  <p>Therefore in this we and they agree, that Works of Piety are very necessary; but we must consider, wherein this necessity lies: For they are effects which of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depend upon their cause, from whence they proceed, but the cause hath no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon them by any necessity.</p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:95561:224"/>
                  <p>By the like Consequence, we call many things necessary in common Offices of Civility and Humanity; as when Kindnesses are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, what is more necessary, and according to Iustice, than a thankful remembrance of a Favour received, and a readiness of Mind, to give evidence of thankfulness, not only in Words, but also by repaying Kindness with Kindness, if there be Opportunity? Which thankfulness was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <note place="margin">Necessity of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> no cause of the Kindness that was done. Let us here compare other kinds of Offices: Who knows not, that a Son and Heir ought of necessity to be dutiful to his Father? But again, who can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that this is no cause in him, why he should receive the Inheritance? The same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may be observed in Marriage, where the Wife being tyed to her own Husband, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity owes Subjection to him, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless she shews to him, not so much for any Law of necessity that extorts it, as of her own accord, and willingly, being provoked by a Principle of Love; moreover when she shews him the greatest Subjection, this necessity is no cause of the Marriage bond: Iust so it is in the performance of Godly Works, which <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to maintain for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary uses, not that necessity of <note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> Works is any cause of Iustification, but because it cannot otherways be, but that where true Faith is, there of necessity good Works are required, and yet they are not so much required, as they are a necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95561:224"/>
for who was ever endued with the true Knowledge of Christ the Son of God, or had the secret breathings of his Spirit, or had a lively sense of his unsearchable Power, and the unspeakable Glory of his Majesty, but is drawn after him with the Cords of Love, and cleaves unto him with all his Heart, setting light by all the Vanities of this World? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over who hath a true savour of Christ, but he dispises the World, and all the things of the World, as the dirt under his Feet? So that now there is no need of any Law to exact Works of Righteousness of him, who is truly planted in Christ, because he is a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and does more of his own accord, than can be commanded by any Compulsion.</p>

Scripture, I confess it is not, in so many Letters and Syllables.

Thus these cunning Artificers of Words have turned one Iustification into two, one, that is obtained by the first Grace, as they call it, before all Works, as in Infants, when they are Beptized: And another, which is in Persons come to Years, by the practice of good Works.</p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:95561:226"/>
                  <p>That I may Answer this frivolous Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: First, I object this saying of <hi>Augustin,</hi> good Works that follow <note place="margin">The second Iustification of Papisis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned.</note> him that is justified, do not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that is to be justified; which if it be true, what remains, but that they should either Confess, that there is no such thing as this second Iustification, which they have devised, or else that good Works go before him that is to be justified, contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Augustin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, if they think there is sufficient cause, why Faith <hi>only</hi> should not be admitted, because it is not expresly mentioned in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, why should not also this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theirs, (about a second Iustification by the practice of good Works) be rejected upon the same account, which is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the sacred Oracles: But by a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Contradiction is opposice to Heavenly Truth? It is an Ancient and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rule of Lawyers, That there <note place="margin">A Rule of Law.</note> is no occasion of distinguishing, where the Law makes no Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In what place of Scripture can those Sophisters find this Distinction between a first and second Iustification; whereby Infants Baptized are otherways justified, than they that are come to years, for both were alike dead in their Sins, and they are both alike regenerated, and live by Faith in Christ the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>That we may briefly Consute this Sophistry, whereas neither the Holy Scriptures, nor the Godly Doctors of the Primitive Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konwledge

any manner of justifying, but one only: How comes it to pass, that those men have devised a twofold Iustification? making two, of that which is but one: So that the first Iustification consists of Faith only, and the second is made up of Works? But it is easie to withstand this absurd device, by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sufficient witnesses; amongst whom <hi>Ambrose</hi> comes first into <note place="margin">Ambrose <hi>in</hi> Cap. 3. ad <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     </note> Mind: who hath expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus; Because there is one God of all, he hath justified all after the same manner; and what that manner is, he shews in these Words, He justifies them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but as they are Believers. And present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, he excludes all Merit of Works; For nothing, saith he, is the cause of Dignity and Merit, but Faith only: And again, Seeing that a Man is not justified before God, but by Faith only, &amp;c. Therefore let us inferr <note place="margin">It is proved out of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> that a twofold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatoin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</note> from these Words of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if there is one manner of justifying, as there is one God; Then no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction can make two Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that which is one only: As no Distinction can make the one only God, that justifies, to be two. Again, if Believers are no otherways justified before God but by Faith, according to the Testimony of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and there is no other Dignity nor Merit, that God regards, but only Faith; what place is there for a second Iustification made up of the Merits of Works?</p>

If we are found Naked in our Reception into Glory, where then is that second Iustification (<hi>made up</hi>) of good Works? but if it is not so, where is that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness whereof <hi>Gregory</hi> speaks?

In the mean while this should not be omitted, which the same <hi>Gregory</hi> mentions of Grace, which he divides not into a first and second, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do now adays, but he shews, that it is one and the same Grace, which both first regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us, and also afterwards receives us into the Kingdom of Glory. By which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there is but one manner of justifying, which consists not in the Merits of Works, but in Grace only, and the Hope of Mercy, unto

But because we cannot do that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of our selves, we can deserve nothing according to the rules of Iustice, but only Death and Damnation. But now by the right of Redemption through Christ, we are set free from the Law of Iustice, and translated into the Kingdom of Grace; by Vertue of a new Covenant, whereby it comes to pass, that God hath respect not to our Merits, but only to Christ, the price of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I answer, That this opposition of contraries is of force according to the strict severity
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:95561:228"/>
of the Law, but not according to the Grace of the Gospel, for here there is a block put in the way; To wit, The Blood of the Redeemer, that frees us from the Law of Sin and Death.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Argument from contraries avails not, except the contraries are set equally in their full extent one against another. Now Evil Works in us are perfectly Evil, but good Works, though assisted by Grace, yet because of the refractary imperfection of the Flesh, in the sight of God are imperfect at the best, as they are performed by us. Wherefore <hi>Hierom</hi> says, The perfection of all Righteous Men in the Flesh, is Imperfection.</p>

                  <p>By the same Answer, the Fallacy of this Sophistical Argument is discovered, because our Sins and Vertues are not equally contrary to one another. But whereas it is said, that the Grace of Iustification is retained by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, though this in some sense may be granted, yet Iustification is not thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95561:229"/>
as if this were done for the Merit of the Actions, but only for the sake of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, upon whose account first the person is accepted, and afterwards the actions are well pleasing, which otherways would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and of no value.</p>
                  <p>They say, that perseverance in Righteousness is lost by Evil <note place="margin">There is a twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration both of good and Evil Works.</note> Works. But Evil Works, as they are in us, admit of a twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; either as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, as in all Saints, thro' the infirmity of the Flesh, and we presently rise up again by Repentance, and Faith. And such kind of Sins, (as <hi>Paul</hi> asserts) shall not have dominion over us, or in the next place, as we give up our selves to Sin, against our own Conscience; that we may serve it, and take a sinful delight therein: But such a Sin can by no means consist with this Faith, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, which hath place in none but those, that are turned from Sin, and returned to God.</p>

                  <p>I may oppose unto this Argument, another not unlike it, that the Fallacy of the one may appear the more easily by the other. Thus then by way of Instance a Man may infer, If the heat of Fire <note place="margin">An Answer by way of Instance.</note> only makes warm, then it makes warm without light.</p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:95561:230"/>
                  <p>But the heat of Fire doth not make warm without light joyned therewith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, The heat of the Fire only, doth not make warm.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, but by this mutual comparing of Arguments, it appears evident to the Reader, how like the one is to the other, <note place="margin">Every Union of things doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their Offices.</note> and consequently how he should judge thereof; so that there is no need of any further Refutation. For all things that are joyned, and agree together in some respects, are not therefore engaged in the same Office.</p>
                  <p>He that hath Feet, Eyes, and Ears, though he hath not these Members in separation from one another, yet it is an untruth, if it is said, That he sees not with his Eyes only, or walks not with his Feet only.</p>
                  <p>Though I deny not, that in the performance of those duties, which belong to this Life, Faith is not separated from Charity: So if we look upward to things, that are Divine and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, if we contemplate and view, what that is, which can help us at our appearance before the Dreadful Iudgment Seat of God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease his Wrath, and deliver us from Eternal Destruction, and conquer Death and the Devil, and regain the favour of God, and Iustifie us, and procure us the Crown of Life, Faith only in the Mediatour doth so bear rule in these affairs, and so fully performs all things requisite to our Salvation and Redemption, that here
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:95561:230"/>
Charity hath nothing to do; for the Kingdom is not promised or due to you, because you love this or that Neighbour after your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but contrarily, because you neither love God as you ought, nor your Neighbour as your self, therefore unavoidable destruction is due to you, unless Faith only through the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour should come in for your help, and set you free from the condemnation due unto you, notwithstanding your Charity. Faith is so far from needing to be joyned with Charity for Iustification, that unless Charity it self were justified by Faith, it could not stand, nor keep it self from falling to ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p>Of the like nature is that Argument, which they wrest out of the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, Iustification comes by Faith, and good Works.</p>
                  <p>Answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Erasmus</hi> did write in his Exposition on the Second Chapter of <hi>Iames:</hi> Faith which is cold without Charity, and puts <note place="margin">Erasmus &amp; censurus Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siensium Tit. 7. They of <hi>Paris</hi> argue that Faith can be without Charity.</note> not forth it self, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires, it is not Faith, but
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:95561:231"/>
only the Name of Faith, &amp;c. They of <hi>Paris</hi> argue contray ways, that Faith can be without Charity, out of this place of <hi>Paul:</hi> If I have all Faith, so that I can remove Mountains; <hi>Erasmus</hi> following <hi>Basil,</hi> Interprets this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on this manner; That we should take this to be feigned by the Apostle for Amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not, nor can be.</p>
                  <p>And seeing <hi>Thomas Aquin.</hi> here by [all Faith] understands perfect Faith; Therefore, because perfect Faith is not found without Charity, it is necessary that according to the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Basil,</hi> we should here take notice of a Trope or Fiction, which <hi>Quintilian</hi> also reckons amongst the forms of amplifying.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whereas we deny a Dead Faith without Charity, to deserve the name of Faith, we speak this by a very usual Trope, as we say, That an unprofitable and idle Man is no Man, or, Wine which is decayed, and hath lost its strength, is no Wine. Therefore that which is cited out of <hi>Paul:</hi> If I have all Faith, but have not Charity, &amp;c. Must be understood thus: Not that <hi>Paul</hi> simply affirms Faith to be a gift of God without Charity: But he speaks Figuratively to amplifie the praise of Charity, as he that says: Though I have an hundred Tongues, and as many Mouths, yet I could not fully set forth the matter as it is, he doth not therefore presuppose, that there is any Man, who hath an hundred Tongues, and as many Mouths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> useth the like Figurative Speech: Though I speak with the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:95561:231"/>
Tongues of Men and Angels, for Angels have no Tongues, but it is feigned by way of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification to signifie some excellent Tongues surpassing those that are human. Thus he said.</p>
                  <p>If what hath been hitherto said, doth not satisfie the Adversaries: I Answer thus: That this Speech of <hi>Paul</hi> belongs not to the manner of Iustification, but to the Life of the Iustified Person; If I have all Faith, saith he, But want Charity, &amp;c. What then? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Charity enters together with Faith into Iustification. But this is no good Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But this is rather the consequence thereof. Therefore Charity is necessary in the Regenerate. Which must of necessity be granted, for Love is necessary and pleasing to God; To wit, In those that are in a state of Reconciliation, and for the sake of Christ. For God naturally delights in the Obedience of his own: Which though it be imperfect, yet he approves of any endeavours in those that are reconciled unto him by Christ. So then Faith, that is Christ apprehended by Faith Iustifies us freely. But on the other side, we must not receive this Grace in vain: But he receives it in vain, who is not obedient to the precepts and <note place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> example of Christ. Howbeit, there are also some that answer, that this Faith here mentioned by the Apostle should only be taken for the Faith of Working Miracles; amongst whom is <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who calls this the Faith, not of Doctrine, but of Miracles.</p>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:95561:232"/>
                  <p>Moreover whereas they urge this word of the Apostle, as if he had <note place="margin">A cavilling about the Word [all.]</note> used it in a general significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To this it may be answered, that the Word (all) signifies often not the universality of a kind, but the perfection of a species, to which it is joyned, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. God is able to make every good gift abound in you, that having all sufficiency in all things, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In like manner in this place of <hi>Paul:</hi> If I have all Faith, that is, the most perfect Faith of working Miracles, so that I can remove Mountains, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another place out of <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Now these three remain, Faith, Hope, and Charity; but the greater of these is Charity.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>That I may briefly Answer both these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, First let us rightly conceive not only the words of the Apostle, but in what sense he speaks them. These three remain, saith he, but the greater of these is Charity: in which words we hear the Apostle preferring Charity before Faith: And we acknowledge it to be true, but let us see in what sense it is true.</p>
                  <p>I will make use of an argument like it: There hath not risen a <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> greater than <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that are born of Women: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist must be greater than Christ. I answer, from the sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Though Christ seemed less than <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist by the judgment of the World, and the general opinion of People, yet in the Kingdom of Heaven he was, and always will be, greater than <hi>Iohn;</hi> we may observe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this in Faith and Charity. Though in this World, in Mens dealings with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutual Charity hath the preeminence: Yet in the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, in our concernments with God, against Satan, Death, Sin, the Iudgement of God, his Wrath and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95561:233"/>
Vengeance, and the terrors of <note place="margin">In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Faith is greater than Charity.</note> Conscience, Faith doth so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, that it only hath the Dominion not only above Charity, but also without it.</p>
                  <p>If the dignity and excellency of any thing is discernable by its effects, and performances, as a Tree is known by its Fruits, let us now compare these Vertues with one another, that it may the better appear, what each of them can do, what is the efficacy of Charity, what Faith performs, and how much it excels.</p>
                  <p>And first, as touching Charity, and its Offices, let us hear how <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. The Offices of Charity.</note> greatly the Apostle commends it. Charity, saith he, is patient, and bountiful, and courteous, fitted for every condition of Life: Charity doth not envy, doth not behave it self unseemly, is not puffed up, seeks not its own things, but seeks the good of all; it is not easily offended, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of revenge; and though it suffer injury, it deviseth not to do evil to any man; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the wickedness of the wicked, but rejoyceth in the Truth; it suffers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things, waiting for better, with an undefatigable expectation. Though other things <note place="margin">Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from its duration</note> may fail; though Prophecies, and Miracles, and Knowledge may cease, yet Charity will never fail; mutual Love will endure for ever.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto ye have heard the Apostle set forth the duties and offices of Charity, with deserved praise,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95561:233"/>
which, though they are exceeding great and magnificent, and cannot be sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by any man according to their worth; yet such is the nature of all these offices of Charity, that they pass <note place="margin">How great things Faith doth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> not beyond the bounds of this mortal Life, and the mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Christians with one another.</p>
                  <p>But now let us raise up our minds, as high as we can, to contemplate the power and efficacy of Faith, and what it doth, not only upon the Earth, but in Heaven in the presence of God. Whilst Charity is exercised in this inferiour World amongst men, Faith ascends into the Kingdom of God, where first by a sublime contemplation it lays hold on the Son of God the Mediatour at the right hand of Majesty, takes a view of his Kingdom, and the glorious Riches thereof, and is ravished at the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the universal Power that is given to him over all Heaven and Earth; and searches for the Promises of the Father, that are ratified in his Son the Mediatour, and by search under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands them, and in Heaven beholds them to be sure and infallible; wherewith the mind of a Believer being now confirmed, takes pleasure in them, and triumphs with great joy; and now Faith, by relying on these Promises, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fearless of danger, and invincible, and stands firmly against the fury of Satan, the power of Death, the terrours of a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the Gates of Hell, the malice of the World, and the oppositions of the rebellious
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95561:234"/>
flesh. Hence flows a gladsome tranquility of Conscience, and Peace and Ioy in the Holy Ghost; and thence it is that Hope derives its fiducial Relyance, and Charity its fervent Zeal from Faith only.</p>
                  <p>For the mind being supported and safe guarded by Faith in Christ, what more can it wish for, to arrive unto the highest pitch of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity? Moreover, who can fully express with words, or conceive in his mind all the good things, that Faith by means of the Mediatour prepares in Heaven for those, that are yet groveling upon the ground? This Faith is that which reconciles man (who was in a woful and wretched condition) unto God: Iustifies a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was at the brink of despair, opens the Gates of Paradise to the penitent Malefactor: Obtains the Grace of the Holy Spirit for the Centurion, gives <hi>Peter</hi> the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, justifies the Publican, procures pardon to the man sick of the Palsie, heals the Woman with the bloody Issue, restores sight to blind <hi>Bartimaeus,</hi> procures us the Grace of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, the hope of the Resurrection, and Life Everlasting, and overcomes Death, which can by no other power be conquered, and gets Victory over Satan, who cannot be subdued by any of our Vertues, nor by our Charity; but the Shield of Faith only drives him away, and puts him to flight.</p>
                  <p>Thus, pious Reader, I have given you some description both of Faith and Charity; you may take your liberty to judge, how you should account of both; and what should be attributed
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:95561:234"/>
unto Charity, which, though it may seem to claim the principality in things belonging to this Life, yet in Iustification, and obtaining the pardon of sins, it is <note place="margin">How Charity is greater than Faith; and how Faith is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> so far from having the superiority, that in this case it can do nothing at all. What need is there of words to prove this? for <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle explains himself abundantly, in what sense Charity is greater; to wit, because of its duration, which appears evident by these things that follow: For he draws this Inference from what he had said; Charity, saith he, never fails; though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Miracles may be abolished.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> furnishes us with an Answer to this Argument. Whereas that excellent Patriarch made no doubt of sacrificing his dearly beloved Son at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">Iustification before God, Iustification before men.</note> of God; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Iames</hi> says, That he was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Works. If they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it amongst men, it is true, but not in the sight of God, unless we would give the Lye to <hi>Paul,</hi> that choice Instrument in the hand of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:95561:235"/>
Christ, who discoursing of the Works of the Patriarch; he says, That if he hath any thing to glory in, he hath it before men, but not before God. And why before men, and not before God? but because the Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <note place="margin">What the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is whereof <hi>Iames</hi> speaks.</note> of men is one thing, and the Iustification of God is another; for men judge by the appearance, and the sight of Works moves them to justifie. Now the whole Epistle of the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> is taken up about this outward appearance of Works before men; and its whole design is, that by our good deeds, and Charity (which is inseparably joyned with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith) we should give evidence, that the Faith, wherein we glory before God, is a lively Faith, and not counterfeit, nor unfruitful: Wherefore presently he adds; Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my Works. By which it easily appears, what Iustification it is, whereof the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> speaks to wit, that, which by works discovers it self before men.</p>
                  <p>Now as for this, neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any other man doubts of it. For what man is there but will confess that Charity and good Works must of necessity be joyned unto Faith, which unless they be seen by men, in those that make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, it is very evident, that such a Faith as they profess, is in reality no Faith at all, but an empty name and shadow thereof. But what does all this make against Iustification by Faith? That Faith appears not to be lively in the Eyes of men, out of which, as out of a living
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95561:235"/>
Root the blossoms and flowers of godly works do not grow. But does not Faith therefore justifie in the sight of God without works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not evidenced by the Testimony of good deeds joyned therewith?</p>
                  <p>But suppose that good works are joyned with Faith, which give evidence to men that it is a lively Faith: Will Faith justifie thee? you will say, Why not? and I acknowledge the same my self. But I ask, wherefore doth Faith justifie before God? because of the works that appear unto men? or are the works rather acceptable because of Faith? But how many works seem to be excellent in the sight of men, to which human Reason gives applause, and men, because of them, are accounted holy and just, when yet the matter is far otherways? And this is that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Human Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the shewing of good works.</note> Iustification, which I spake of, and the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> hath written of, which, though someties it judges according to Truth, yet much oftener it is deceived in judging: Why so? because the Iudgment of God, and the Iudgment of men are of a different nature. What man looking upon the Lives of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, their long Prayers, frequent Fastings and Washings, their holy-like deportment, and all their outward shews of Piety, but would have judged them to be men very near, and dear unto God? when yet none were greater <note place="margin">An outward appearance is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</note> Strangers and Enemies to God than they? What man is there at this day, who looking upon the Orders
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95561:236"/>
of the Monks, their Vows, Fastings, Rules, Austerity, and Rigour of Discipline, but would reckon them amongst the chiefest of those that are justified, when yet they are no such men in the sight of God?</p>
                  <p>And yet in the mean while I deny not this to be true, which <hi>Iames</hi> writes: For he that being endued with no Vertue, or Love to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, makes an outward profession of Faith in Christ, and leads not a Life suitable thereunto, I say, according to the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> that such a man's Faith is little worth. But if such a man in the last hour of his Life, come to himself, and fly to Christ for Refuge by an unfeigned Faith, and beg for Mercy, and cast himself wholly upon Christ, what would the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> say in such a case, Will not Faith only without Works justifie such a man as this? The penitent Malefactor is an evident proof of the truth of this, who had no other thing but Faith only, to commend him to Christ, and so to be admitted into Paradise: Like unto which there are many Examples daily of them that die on Gibbets; so that the Iudgments of God are very wonderful, who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
                  <p>But now let us return to what we were say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> If we look upon his Faith, what was more sincere? If we consider his Works, what was more glorious and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Therefore upon both accounts he was certainly an admirable man. Now let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Faith with his Works. And because it is evident that he was justified before God,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95561:236"/>
let us enquire whether he was justified by Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Works; because he could not be justified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both accounts, as the Apostle witnesseth; If it is of Faith, then it is not of Works; but if it is of Works, then it is not of Faith. What shall we say then to these things? let the Scripture answer. <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> believed God, when he promised, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness. And the same <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed God, when he commanded; and why doth not the Scripture in like manner add, That this was imputed to him for Righteousness? <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> Let us hear what the Apostle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. The Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Gentiles by Faith, he first told the glad tydings to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and what glad tydings was this? That he and his Seed should be Heirs of the <note place="margin">Romans 3.</note> World. A great Promise indeed. But how did he obtain this Promise, by Faith, or by Works? There is an answer ready made to our hand by the Apostle: The Promise came not by the Law to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to his Seed, that he should be Heir of the World, but by the Righteousness of Faith. Why so, <hi>Paul?</hi> why, not by the Law? and why by the Righteousness of Faith? That he might be the Father of all the faithful, who walking in the footsteps of the Faith, which was in the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> shall have. Faith in like manner imputed unto them.</p>
                  <p>But here. St. <hi>Iames</hi> is represented as fighting with all his might against this Doctrine. For
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:95561:237"/>
the Adversaries say thus. Did not the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> assert with great Authority, That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was justified by Works? and will ye deny it? God forbid, that any man should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the Authority of that holy Apostle. And yet I suppose St. <hi>Iames</hi> would not have us to disbelieve the Scripture, which teaches us far otherways, attributing the Iustification of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not to Works, but to Faith: For <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> believed God, and we read, it was imputed unto him for Righteousness. But God hath not said in his Word concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> going to sacrifice his Son, That it was imputed to him for Righteousness. Or let us grant the assertion of St. <hi>Iames;</hi> That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was justified by Works. But where and how was he thus justified? before God? St. <hi>Iames</hi> says not so. Then it is before men. And <hi>Paul</hi> himself denies not that: So that there is no real disagreement between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this doth not satisfie some Sophisters, who account it is not enough, that the holy Patriarch is justified by Works before men, as <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, unless he be also thereby justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God: For though he was first justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, (as they say); yet nothing hinders, but that afterwards he might be yet more justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Works, and this they call a second Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. But Reason shews that to be an utter impossibility, for it implies a manifest contradiction; for it is a contradiction not to be justified by Works, and again to be justified by Works. And <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:95561:237"/>
seeing one of those is denied by the Apostle: How can they maintain and plead for the other. But hereunto may be added another Reason. If there is a twofold Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, <note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> one by Faith and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Works, it would follow, that there is a twofold manner of Iustifying: But there is one and the same manner of Iustifying, as there is one God, as hath been proved out of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi> Therefore it appears, that there is not a twofold Iustification. A third Reason is this, seeing Iustification <note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> consists of the Remission of Sins, and God forgives no Man his Sins, to whom he doth not perfectly forgive them: Therefore it follows that the Iustification of those, that are justified, is compleat and perfect, and cannot be made more perfect than it is already. Now in the next place, let them prepare to answer this Argument of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whosoever is justified by Works, <note place="margin">Reason.</note> hath whereof he may Glory before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> hath not any thing whereof he may Glory before God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is not justified by Works before God.</p>
                  <p>By these things which we have quoted out of <hi>Paul,</hi> and other sacred writings; I suppose, it appears evident enough, what we should judge of the Works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Which, though they were excellent, and worthy to be
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95561:238"/>
admired before men, yet they found no place for glorying before God, according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony and Interpretation of the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>We need not be at any great trouble to find out the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <note place="margin">Tiletan.</note> 
                     <hi>Tiletan</hi> and other Iesuits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a cause thereof out of <hi>Augustin:</hi> Because the Works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were not of the Law, but of Faith, not of the Flesh, but of Grace, which because they were not done by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Free-will only, but in the Faith, and (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation) of Christ, therefore all Praise and Glory was due to Christ, and none to them; which Invention of theirs though it savours more of Wit than Solidity, yet though we grant all this to them, there is no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, seeing both of us acknowledge with <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of glorying, nor Iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by Works; and therefore that he had no cause of glorying, because he was not justified by Works; for otherways, if he had been justified by Works, he should have had, wherein to Glory, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. But now he hath not any thing, wherein he may Glory before God, therefore he was not justified by Works. And thus hitherto we have treated of the Arguments of the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as much as may suffice not only to discover, but also confute their Sophistical Wiles, and captious Deceits, who fight with so great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness for their inherent Righteousness, against the Testimony of the Holy Scripture, and the Sacred Gospel of Iesus Christ, and the bright
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95561:238"/>
shining Light of Grace, yea and against their own Salvation. It remains in the next place, that we should hear, what those Men on the other side answer and oppose to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and most approved Reasons manag'd, not only by us, but by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and with what Cavillings and fraudulent Devices, they darken and baffle the clear meaning of the Apostle's Words, and with what deceit they wilfully wrest and deprave the genuine Signification of his Words by their most absurd Interpretation, to the intent they may maintain their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Doctrine. If they did this only in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, they should not be so much the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Anger, as of our Pity and Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration, as being Men misled into Errour. But they behave themselves as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be <hi>undeceiv'd.</hi> And though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see the Truth in such a clear Light of the Scripture: yet they wilfully shut their eyes, because they are not willing to see, or at least believe the clear shining Light of the Truth; which that it may appear the more evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men, let us now produce the Answers and deceitful Shifts of the Adversaries, whereby they maintain their own Cause against our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. And because there are eight Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which we oppose against the Papists, we think it is not unprofitable in this place to set down, what the Papists answer unto these.</p>

               <p>BY the Works of the Law, shall no flesh be justified before him; for by the Law comes the Knowledge of Sin: But now the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God is manifessed without the Law, being testified by the Law and the Prophets; to wit, the Righteousness of God, by the Faith of Iesus Christ upon all that believe, &amp;c. Which is also confirmed by these Words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Knowing that a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law, for by the Works of the Law no flesh is justified, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I Appeal unto thee, Courteous and Pious Reader, what Man is there (if he duely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Words of <hi>Paul,</hi>) that can gather any other thing from <note place="margin">Free Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Words of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> them, but what their genuine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification holds forth? Which is this: That the Works of the Law should be utterly excluded from having any hand in Iustification. And if Works are excluded, what can be a more undoubted Truth, than that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith only?</p>
               <p>What is more solid than this Argument of <hi>Paul?</hi> What can be more plainly expressed? What Words are more familiar. if so be they are not darkned by a Sophistical Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:95561:239"/>
If according to the Testimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> we are not justified by Works, or obedience to the Law, but by Faith without Works; who can deny that our Iustification consists of Faith only, unless he desperately oppose himself, not only against <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, but also the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit God?</p>
               <p>But behold here the Deceit, or rather the Malice of sinful Men. They do not openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Words of the Apostle, but wrest the sense and meaning of them to serve their own purpose. They deny not, that Works should be excluded: but pray, take notice of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Snares of Sophisters, who endeavour by a cunning way of distinguishing, to baffle the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Apostolical Doctrine: For they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide asunder Works, and their Iustification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, calling the one, Works of the Law, and the other Works of Grace: And they say, the Works of the Law are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Iustification; but the other they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count very necessary. Therefore, they An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Words of <hi>Paul</hi> with this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: By the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified, &amp;c. The meaning of these Words (say they) is this: No Man shall be justified before God, for his own Works, which he hath done, as by the Vertue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereof, but by the Vertue and Merit of Grace infused. For, according to <hi>Paul's</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking, then a thing is said to be done by Works, when it is done by Works, when it is done as a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Andr. Vega de just. pag.</hi> 751.</note> due Debt, or for the Works. Wherefore there being a twofold Iustification, (as they say) one by
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95561:240"/>
Grace infused, and another by the Obligation of the Law without Grace: In this Case, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by VVorks, and every thing that is contrary to Iustification by Grace is excluded: And so the saying of the Apostle holds true, as they Interpret: to him that worketh, the Reward is not imputed according to Grace, but according to Debt, as if he should say, that what is given by <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> VVorks or for them, is not given according to Grace, but according to Debt; therefore that Iustification which is separated from Grace, is excluded, but not the Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that comes by VVorks with the Assistance of Grace, &amp;c. VVhat else should I Answer to these Sophisters, but that I pray God to give them Repentance, and a better frame of Spirit, that they may not always resist the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and overspread the Truth with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. VVhat Man is there, but clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that it is altogether contrary to the VVords and Meaning of the Apostle, to build the Hope of Salvation upon any VVorks; when he doth so manifestly teach and protest against it, denying that we are justified any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, but by Faith without the VVorks of the Law. Yea, they themselves deny not that the exclusive VVord is understood of the Works of the Law, though not of the Works of Grace, but now what are these Works of Grace? those (forsooth) which the influence of the Grace of Christ, performs in the Souls of the regenerate; but were not the <hi>Romans</hi> to whom the Apostle wrote, regenerate in Christ? VVere they not partakers of the same
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:95561:240"/>
Grace? Did they not abound in the VVorks of Grace? VVhom yet the Apostle denies to be justified by their own VVorks. It is true indeed (say they) if you understand it of their own VVorks, which are called VVorks of the Law, but not those VVorks which are Christ's. How ridiculous is this! as if those things that are planted <note place="margin">The Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Papists is idle and Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note>

                  </gap> us by the Spirit of Christ, were not also oftentimes called ours. Yea Faith it self, which is most especially reckoned amongst those Gifts, it is usual to Scripture to give it the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithet of ours and yours. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus, [By the Communion of my Faith and yours] and again [Hearing of your Faith] and in another place [Your Faith which is in Christ, &amp;c.] Is it not evident that he speaks of that Faith, which we have in Christ through the free gift of God? How much more then may this be understood of VVorks, which when <hi>Paul</hi> excludes from Iustification, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but he understands it not only of VVorks, that are ours wholly, <note place="margin">Rom. 1. Eph. 1. Colos. 2.</note> and done by our own Strength, but also of those VVorks that are done by the help of Grace opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in us; so that there is nothing in the Works either of the Law, or of Grace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Faith only, but what rather contributes to Destruction than Iustification: (What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law of God, that we can do without Grace?) Therefore seeing <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all Works from the Office of justifying, it must needs be, that he understands it of the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95561:241"/>
Works of Grace, as well as of our own Works, or the Works of the Law: What shall we say of the Works of Christ, were not they Works of the Law: For he himself hath said, that he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it; were not the things which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in fulfilling the Law, VVorks of Grace? VVhat difference then is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those VVorks, that are called VVorks of the Law, and those other that are called VVorks of Grace? So that it appears, that he who excludes the VVorks of the Law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes also the VVorks of Grace from Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Though I acknowledge there is great difference between <note place="margin">Wherein the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> the Law and Grace, in respect of the manner of Doing, and the ends of their Offices: For what the Law exacts, that, Grace performs; but in respect of the things themselves, and the Actions unto which they are directed, seeing both the Law and the Grace of God are exercised in the same subject Matter, there is no difference between them.</p>
               <p>The Law commands us to Love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and lays a Punishment on him, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys. But Grace communicates Strength and Ability to perform what the Law commands. VVhich when we perform, we are said to do not only a VVork of Grace, but also a VVork of the Law by Grace; so that it is a matter of small concernment, whether it be called a VVork of the Law, or a VVork of Grace, a VVork of our own, or a VVork of Faith. Therefore if the Scripture denies, That a man is
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95561:241"/>
justified, and attributes his Iustification to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, that is Faith, what should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from hence, but that Man's Iustification comes neither by the VVorks of the Law, nor the VVorks of Grace. <note place="margin">A Similitude.</note> Iust as if a Man writing to his Friend, should say thus: This Benefit was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him by no Money, or charge of his own: VVhat matter is it, whether it was his own Money, or borrowed of some other Man, when the meaning of the VVriter was to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that this Benefit, whatsoever it was, was not bought by any Price of the Receiver, but obtained by the free Bounty of the Giver.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> desiring to set before the Eyes of all Men the boundless Immensity of Divine Grace toward Mankind, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and embrace it, expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">The Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
                  </note> that Man is justified by the VVorks of the Law. But here the Distinction of <hi>Hosius</hi> (as I have said) presents it self. It is true, saith he, in respect of the Works that are of the Law, and belong to our own Free-will, which being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Imperfection, can avail nothing to Iustification: To which I Answer in a Word. Give then that Grace, which may furnish frail Nature with Strength, to yield perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, and may restore us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect innocency in this Life, and you have won the cause. But in the mean while, let those Disputants consider, how many gross and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Absurdities proceed from this kind of Doctrine; for hereby the infinite greatness of
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95561:242"/>
the free Grace and Mercy of God towards us is taken away and abolished, this also destroys our thankfulness to him for his goodness, and withholds Consolation from afflicted Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences so that very great injury is done to him, that hath freely communicated so many and so great Benefits, and much greater injury is done to those, on whom they are bestowed: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also it comes to pass, that there remains no Assurance in the Promise of God, no firmness in our Faith, no soundness in the Doctrine of Religion, nor Comfort or Refreshment in the Suffering of the Saints.</p>

               <p>Unless the Hearts of these our Adversaries were fully set in them to pervert the ways of the Lord, it could not otherways be, but these clear and evident sayings of the Apostle must be sufficient to satisfie them, and prevail upon them to beware lest they kick against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, and exalt themselves in their proud Imaginations, and vain Conceit of their own Righteousness, against such clear
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:95561:242"/>
Manifestation of Divine Grace. But here the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions make a fresh incursion again. and the Ring-leader of them is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeas Vega,</hi> who fights against the <note place="margin">Andraeas Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga.</note> Righteousness of Faith: Whom there is no need of answering in this World: For he hath been removed out of this Life a great while since, that he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God his Iudge. And because he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was justified by the Faith of Christ only, let him look to it, what he must answer his Iudge in that Iudgment, wherein he must give account of his whole Life, where of necessity he must either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or fall. If he overcome, where is the Truth of Scripture, in which it is said, God only overcomes, when he is judged? But if he fall, where then is the Righteousness of Works? What if <hi>David,</hi> so great a King and Prophet could not endure that God should enter with him into Iudgment. If <hi>Iob,</hi> a Man of so Holy a Life, yet durst not answer to one of a thousand. What will our <hi>Vega</hi> say, what will he bring? his Cowls, his Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his lyings on the Ground, his Night Watches, his Vows, his Liturgick-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, his Propitiatory-Masses, his Mumbled over Confessions, his Penances and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

               <p>But I need not ask him, what he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God his Iudge: To whom I know he can make no satisfaction with all his inherent Righteousness: But this is that which I ask him, and not him only, but all the other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentines also, what they will answer the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul,</hi> who openly pronounces a Curse both on Men and Angels, if any of them should dare to preach any other Gospel than he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And what Gospel is it, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the preaching of <hi>Paul?</hi> Is it not the same that he taught so often in all his Epistles, with frequent Repetitions, and great Care and Diligence, and also confirmed it with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? Now the summ of the Gospel, which he preached, is this: That Man is justified freely without Works by the Grace of God, through the Redemption, which is in Christ Iesus,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95561:243"/>
whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his <note place="margin">What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel <hi>Paul</hi> preached. Rom. 3.</note> Blood. Is not this evident in the writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. And yet <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> not being contented with this Gospel, nor deterred by the Curse which the Apostle denounced, hath arrived at so great an impudence, that he takes upon him to contradict, what the Apostle hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with so great Authority. The Apostle says, freely without Works, but he says, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not without Works; but how .is it freely, if not without Works? <hi>Paul</hi> says, the Righteousness of God by the Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe. But what says <hi>Vega</hi> and <hi>Hosius</hi> the enemy of <hi>Paul?</hi> This universal Term [all] saith he, is not here by the Apostle applied to every one of the kind, but to every kind of every one: So that the meaning is this: Righteousness is communicated to them that believe, whether they are <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Thus said <hi>Vega.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> What Ignorance was this in thee, or unskilfulness of Speech? Thou mightst learn of <hi>Vega</hi> to speak more curiously, and to polish thy Stile according to the elegancy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, after this manner. The Righteousness of God by the Faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and not only all, but also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one, and upon every one present and to come, that believe, so that thereby you might comprehend not only the kinds of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, but also every species of the kinds, and every individual of the Species. But that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:95561:244"/>
I may answer seriously to the vain-glorious <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</hi> It was your Duty, O <hi>Vega,</hi> to correct your Spirit of Errour, by the divinely inspired Words of <hi>Paul;</hi> and not to pride your self in such vain and empty Notions. For who sees not the clear and perspicuous simplicity of this Speech of <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby he proclaims a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest in Eternal Life and <note place="margin">The popish comment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Sign is overturned.</note> Righteousness, not only to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the general, but to every one of them in particular, whether they be <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that believe in Christ? Unless the Apostle had together with the universal Term set down the proper Mark of Distinction, that is, the peculiar Condition of attaining to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, you might have some colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for what you pretend. As for Example, when the Scripture speaks thus. They shall be all taught of God: God would have all Men to be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth, in such a Case a Man may interpret the universal Term. (As <hi>Augustine</hi> did) in such a manner as you speak of: To wit, that it is not every one of all, but some particular Persons of all kind of Men and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that attain unto the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Aug. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest. Sanct. <hi>lib. 1. cap. 8.</hi>
                  </note> of the Truth; but the Case is otherways in this Expression of <hi>Paul,</hi> where the Apostle together with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Term, adds also a peculiar and proper mark of Distinction: So that he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the Righteousness of God common to all in the general, but also expresly sets down
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95561:244"/>
a certain manner, whereby all do attain unto it, and to whom it peculiarly belongs; in these Words: By the Faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all that believe. Whence of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it follows, that every Mans Righteousness consists in his believing in Christ by Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, and embracing of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note place="margin">Hab.</note> The just shall live by Faith.</p>
               <p>But let us again hear what the Prating So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister hath to say for himself.</p>
               <p>But whereas (saith he) the Iust shall live by Faith, and God is said to justifie Man by Faith, it doth not therefore follow by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that Works are not necessary; for it is one thing to live by Faith, and another thing to live by Faith only; One thing to be justified by Faith, and another thing to be justified by Faith only; and if these Words [Faith only] are sometimes found in the Books of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctors, by the Word (only) good Works are not excluded, but all other Sects and Ways to Salvation, except Faith only, and the Christian Religion. Thus said <hi>Vega.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom that I may answer, First, whereas he inferrs, that good Works are not necessary, because the Iust live by Faith, he may as reasonably gather Thistles <note place="margin">No Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Works to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</note> from the Vine; for this is no good consequence: The Iust shall live by Faith, therefore Works are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: Which we also with <hi>Paul,</hi> do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:95561:245"/>
account to be necessary. And in the next place, whereas he says, that it is one thing to be justified by Faith, and another thing to be justified by Faith only: Though we grant this to be true, yet I see no great difference between these two Expressions: To be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith without Works, and to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith only. Thirdly, Whereas he Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils about the Word Only, what it excludes, and what it excludes not in the Books of the Catholicks, we do not trouble our selves much about that; but this is manifest in the Writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> that Works themselves, though otherways they are very excellent, and also necessary upon other accounts, yet in this free Gift of Evangelical Iustification, they are excluded without all Controversie. Though that also is an untruth, which he asserts of the Books of the Catholicks: For <hi>Basil</hi> (that I may produce one of them instead of a great many) expresses the same in manifest Words, taking away from every Man all occasion of glorying in his own Righteousness, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that each one of us is justified by Faith in Christ only. And therefore he presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Example of <hi>Paul</hi> to confirm the same, and <hi>Paul</hi> Glories (saith he) in the Contempt of his own Righteousness. I may also add the VVords of the same <hi>Basil</hi> upon the 32. <hi>Psalm,</hi> where giving a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Basil.</hi> in Psal. 32.</note> of a perfect Man, he says he is such a one as puts no trust in his own good deeds, but hath his whole hope and reliance on the Mercy of God alone. I think it is
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:95561:245"/>
not amiss to joyn unto <hi>Basil</hi> his intimate Friend <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who assents and subscribes to the words of <hi>Basil</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nazian.</note> on this manner: Faith only is our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But let us proceed unto the remaining Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Paul.</hi> For (as I have said before) <hi>Vega</hi> with his Associates heaps together eight Assertions for Iustifying Faith out of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the other five Assertions of the Apostle, together with the Answers of the Adversaries, do follow in this order.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Assertion. Rom.</hi> 4. If <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by the Works of the Law, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. For what says the Scripture? <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was imputed to him for <note place="margin">3 Argum. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.</note> Righteousness. To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Reward is not reckoned according to Grace, but according to Debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifies the ungodly, Faith is imputed unto him for Righteousness. As <hi>David</hi> also declareth the blessedness of the man, to whom the Lord imputeth Righteousness without Works. And likewise <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. If it is by grace, then it is not of works; and if it is of works, then it is not of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Assertion. Rom.</hi> 10. If thou shalt <note place="margin">4 Argum. Rom. 10.</note> confess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and believest with thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved;
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95561:246"/>
for with the heart man believeth unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto Salvation. For the Scripture saith, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, shall not be ashamed. There is no difference between Iew and Greek: For every one that calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Assertion. Acts</hi> 13. Be it known <note place="margin">5 Argum. Acts 13.</note> unto you, Brethren, that through this Man remission of sins is preached unto you, that through him every one that believes may be justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Assertion. Acts</hi> 10. To him all <note place="margin">6 Argum. Acts 10.</note> the Prophets bear witness; That all that believe in him, do receive through his name remission of sins.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Assertion.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. For other <note place="margin">7 Argum. 1 Cor. 3.</note> foundation can no man lay, than that which is already laid, that is, Christ Iesus. But if any man build upon this foundation Gold or Silver, &amp;c. If any man's work is burnt, he shall suffer damage, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Assertion.</hi> The eight Argument <note place="margin">8 Argum.</note> is gathered from many Examples of those, who were justified by Faith only, and admitted unto Baptism: As three thousand of those that believed at the Preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:95561:246"/>
and the Eunuch, whom <hi>Philip</hi> baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Iaylor and his family, whom <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. &amp;c. By which Examples it may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally proved, that the Apostles judged Faith to be sufficient to qualifie a man for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Baptism, and therefore also for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Iustification.</p>
               <p>By these proofs of Scripture this Doctrine is sufficiently confirmed, which attributes the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the ungodly, not to Works joyned with Faith, but to Faith simply without Works. But because I am not now dealing with men of moderate Principles, but with cunning So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters, let us for a while bring the Apostle out of the Church into the School, that he may fight hand to hand against them with their own weapons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute <note place="margin">Arguments out of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> them with their own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Righteousness of the Law or of Works, and the Righteousness of Faith, are so contrary to one another, that they cannot consist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the one of necessity makes void the other.</p>
               <p>But we look for Righteousness by Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore not by the Righteousness of Works.</p>

                  <head>An Induction from Examples.</head>
                  <p>The Scriptures tell us of many <note place="margin">An argument taken from Examples. Acts 2. Acts 8.</note> that were justified and baptized without making any mention of Works. On the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> three thousand were baptized; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Eunuch was baptized by <hi>Philip; Acts</hi> 8. The Iaylor with

his family; <hi>Acts</hi> 16. The sinful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">Acts 16. Luke 7. Luke 18. Luke 23. Luke 18.</note> whom faith saved; <hi>Luke</hi> 7. The prodigal Son; <hi>Luke</hi> 18. The Thief on the right hand; <hi>Luke</hi> 23. The Publican; <hi>Luke</hi> 18. And a multitude of others obtained Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without any condition of Works.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, only Faith in Christ justifies the humble and broken hearted sinner.</p>
                  <p>Unto these things so very evident and clear, what do the Adversaries object? with what subtilties and distinctions do they defend their Popish Errour of Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? <note place="margin">Inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Be pleased to hearken; though what they say is fitter for laughter and derision than instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And first as touching the distinction, that <hi>Paul</hi> makes between him that worketh, and him that worketh not; between Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary works, and Iustification imputed without Works; between Debt and Grace; between the Righteousness of the Law, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith, let us observe how those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters cloud and darken it with their vain janglings. For whereas the Apostle argues on this manner from the Rule of contraries. If it is of grace, then it is not of works; but if it be of works, then it is not of grace, &amp;c. If the Inheritance is by the Law, then it is not of the Promise, &amp;c. And again, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. Gal. 3.</note> distinguishing between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:95561:248"/>
of the Gospel, he so divides the one from the other, that difference appears evident. Of the Righteousness, that comes by the Law, saith the Apostle, the Law it self speaks on this manner; He that <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> doth these things shall live in them. But what saith he of the Righteousness that is of Faith? If thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus. and believe with thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. What is more evident than this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction? what words are more perspicuous? But what is there that can be so <note place="margin">A Sophistical Pretence.</note> well conceived in the mind, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in words, but it may be wrested by the wrong Interpretations of such men as take delight to set themselves in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Truth? for thus they <note place="margin">A Sophistical Objection.</note> speak. Are not pious works the gifts of God? Doth not Charity shed abroad in the hearts of the Saints by the Holy Ghost, inflame the minds of Believers, and provoke them to all things that are honest and agreeable to the Will of God? Which Works of Charity, when God crowns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in us, they are not so much our works, as his gifts; for they are not our works, or performed by any strength of our own, but they are the works of <note place="margin">How Grace justifies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of the Papists.</note> God, which we perform by his help, and they should be wholly attributed to his Grace. Whence also they oft-times are called in the Scriptures by the name of Divine Grace.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:95561:249"/>
As <hi>Paul</hi> also, bearing witness of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, says, By the grace of God I am what I am; for this grace of working not being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto by any human industry, or strength of our Nature, nor any precedent obedience to the Law, or works and merits of our own, but only by Faith in the merits of Christ. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> says well, That we are justified by faith without works; speaking of such works as belong to nature, but not <note place="margin">Works consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as they are either of grace or of nature.</note> to grace; which are a man's own works, and not God's; and are called the works of the Law, not of Faith. But by the works of the Law, the Apostle understands such works as are performed by a man's own free will, or by the direction of the Law and Nature only, without the assistance of Grace. And this is the meaning of <hi>Paul,</hi> (as those Popish Doctors would have it) when he distinguishes between Iustification by Works, and Iustification by Grace or Faith: So that if it be by grace, then it is not of works, to wit, such works as are done by Nature, and not by Grace; but if it is of works, then it is not of grace; for then grace (saith he) would not be grace; which opposition must be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, according to the Opinion of those Popish Teachers; so that grace doth not wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all works, but those only, that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the strength of Nature without the assistance of Grace. But contrarily, the pious works which proceed from Grace and Faith, their Righteousness is so far from being made
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:95561:249"/>
void by Grace, or the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">Aug. de spirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu &amp; litera, cap. 30.</note> of Faith, that it is rather thereby confirmed. For the Law (as <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks) is not made void by Faith, but rather established; for Faith obtains the Grace, whereby the Law is fulfilled. Therefore whereas <hi>Paul</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes between the Righteousness of Works, and the Righteousness of Faith. This is the Answer the Catholick Faction gives to this distinction. In this place the Righteousness of the Law, and the Righteousness of Faith, are not set in opposition one against another; (as they express themselves) but Righteousness by the Law, or in the Law, is that which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Righteousness of Faith. And they say, The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <note place="margin">What is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness by the Law. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by the Law, or in the Law.</note> that is in the Law, or by the Law, is that obedience which is performed to the Law by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength without the assistance of Grace: For these things differ not a little from one another; for the Righteousness of the Law is one thing, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Law, or in the Law, is another thing. From which distinction they draw this Inference; That the Righteousness of Faith, or by Faith, doth not exclude the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law, but is exercised about it, and fulfils it: In as much as the Law sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Obedience to the Commandments, which faith by obtaining grace performs: And because the Grace of God performs the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:95561:250"/>
Law, that is the certain cause why the works of the Law, which are the gifts of God, ought not to be excluded from Iustification, just as Faith it self cannot be excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the gift of God, as much as the Works of the Law and Charity, which are infused by the Grace of God. This is the entangling Sophistry whereby <hi>Andraeas Vega,</hi> and others of his Association persuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they can break through the force of all the former Arguments.</p>

               <p>And I greatly wonder at the power and efficacy of Errour, that so stupifies their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destanding, that in the light of Noon-day they can be so blind, and err so pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and betray their own Ignorance so shamelesly. It is a Rule of Lawyers; (as I formerly have said) <note place="margin">A Rule of Lawyers.</note> Where the Law distinguishes not, we ought not to distinguish. What need then is there in a thing so evident, of so many by-ways of distinctions, and Labyrinths
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:95561:250"/>
of perplexities? for <hi>Paul</hi> hath spoken expresly, and given many weighty Arguments, whereby he makes it very clear, that it is theGrace ofGod only, to which we are indebted for all our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. But those men are of another mind, saying, That this Grace consists not in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God only, whereby he receives sinners for the sake of Christ, but also in Moral Vertues and Charity, whereby the Law is fulfilled. Tho' I deny not that the excellent gifts of honest actions are bestowed upon us by the Grace of God: Yet our Iustification before God depends not upon this grace of working: Therefore we do not utterly reject the distinction that they bring of pardoning and renewing grace, if they keep them duly within their own bounds. But that which they conclude from hence, we alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether disapprove. I know and confess it is the Grace of God, which both sanctifies and justifies; which both pardons &amp; renews: For we are daily renewed unto new obedience by the influence of Divine Grace. But though this be so, we are not renewed for this purpose, that by this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of obedience we may be justified: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Renovation we are sirst justified by Faith in the Son of God; all the sins of our former life being blotted out for the sake of Christ in whom we believe: Unto which Iustification succeeds the renovation of imperfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but not such as justifies a man from his sins in the sight of God: for <note place="margin">Aug. de fid. &amp; oper. c. 15.</note> good works go not before him that is to be justified, but follow him that is justified. For whereas hence they make a
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:95561:251"/>
twofold Iustification; a first (as they call it) and a second; of which the one is before works, and the other after works, whereby it is perfected; it is a vain imagination, not derived from the fountains of sound Doctrine, but from the filthy Cisterns of Sophistry and vain jangling. For the Gospel acknowledges no Iustification but one only, and such a one as endures for ever.</p>
               <p>As Christ, whom he loves, he is said to love unto the end: And as God hath once chosen and called those unto Salvation, whom he will justifie for ever; so also he likewise once justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies those whom he will glorifie. For I see no such difference between these things, but that what agrees unto Election and Vocation, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be attributed to Iustification. Wherefore as God's election and calling of those, who are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, is one, and not twofold; it must follow by necessary consequence, that there is but one Iustification of those who are chosen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God hath once chosen those, that are to be justified, why may not one Iustification be sufficient for them, whom Election hath called unto glory? especially because there is one and the same cause and manner both of electing and justifying. He chose <note place="margin">The cause why we are chosen and justified in Christ only.</note> them in Christ first, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated unto life: And in like manner he justifies in Christ those, whom by the sacred Decree of his Election he appointed to glory. But if you ask the cause, why God chuses his own in Christ, I answer, That the cause thereof is not placed in the works of men, but it depends upon the free
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:95561:251"/>
favour of God, and the like we may say of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; for those, whom he justifies, he justifies in Christ; but if you ask, why doth he justifie in Christ, the cause appears evident, which cannot be found in our VVorks, but before all VVorks in the favour of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>But you may say, Those things are not well compared with one another, which disagree in Nature; for Election, and Vocation, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification are such things, as being once determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, cannot be disannulled. But the Case is otherways in Iustification, which may sometimes be lost, and sometimes retained, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is hindered or not hindered by the Grace of God. For thus spake <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vega de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> q. 2. pa. 754. It is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that we by believing only, be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, unless we do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hinder the Grace of God by our Sins.</note> 
                  <hi>Vega,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and others. That I may Answer such Men, I confess indeed, if the manner of our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication were such, as those Men feign, to wit, if its chief reliance were upon Works, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Vertues; it would be true, which they assert, concerning the uncertainty of losing or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iustification. But seeing all the stability of our Iustification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not at all upon our Works, but upon the Merits of Christ by Faith, and the Remission of Sins by his Righteousness; therefore it is, that as there is one Election and Vocation, and that sure and firm, so also Iustification is not twofold, but one and the same, and such
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:95561:252"/>
an one as endures for ever. I call it one, because there remains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note place="margin">One manner of justifying and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</note> one and the same cause and manner of Iustifying, which relies not on the Merits of Works, but consists of Faith and the Remission of Sins. And though the Sins from which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are not all of the same kind, but are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by times and variety of Actions, yet nevertheless Iustification, that is, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins in respect of the form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not divers but one: Not twofold but simple, as Faith also, which is the procuring cause of Iustification is not, which though it is daily increased, yet it remains always one and the same. Moreover, as this Iustification which increases together with Faith is only one, so also the same being firm and stable, no less than the Promise of God, on which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, undergoes no change, but continues firm, and constant and the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, because it relies not on <note place="margin">The Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a first and second Iustification is confuted.</note> Works but Faith only, whence the Apostle said. It is therefore by Faith, that according to Grace the Promise may be sure to all the Seed.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, they who make a twofold Iustification, and assign divers causes of both, of which the one confists of Faith only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works going before, which they call the first, and the other, which they call the second is increased by Works of Grace, as they speak. I see not what they can find in the Scriptures, for
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:95561:252"/>
the defence of their Opinion; for <hi>Paul</hi> writing to so many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <note place="margin">The cause of Iustification is not twofold but one.</note> acknowledges no cause of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, but one, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to be Faith in Christ, and that without Works. What need is there of better evidence? Can you not be perswaded to believe the Truth, which hath been so often and so perspicuously demonstrated by so great a Master as <hi>Paul?</hi> But to what purpose hath Christ appointed him to be a Teacher to us <hi>Gentiles;</hi> if we despise his Instructions, and chuse to our selves other Masters, that teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Gospel? And what else do those Men, who reject the Apostle's Doctrine, and hearken to such as teach contrary thereunto? <hi>Paul</hi> says, Without Works Man is justified: Will you then dare to plead for Iustification by Works in Opposition to the Apostle? Dare you deny what he affirms? But you say, I detract nothing from Works in opposition unto <hi>Paul,</hi> but I add Grace, from whence they receive the power of Meriting and Iustifying. Then, according to your Opinion, Works being assisted by Grace do justifie, but without Grace they avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>But what will you answer to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who without making any Distinction of Works, says not of such or such <note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> Works only, but indefinitely and in the general of all Works. It is of Faith, and not of Works, lest any should boast. And again, to the <hi>Romans,</hi> If by Grace, then it is not of Works, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note>
                  <pb n="488" facs="tcp:95561:253"/>
To him, that worketh not, &amp;c. And how often doth he in all his Epistles Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all Power of Iustifying to Faith, shutting out not only such or such Works, but all Works of what kind soever, concerning which <hi>Paul</hi> speaking indefinitely and absolutely, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes them from any concernment in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. Which would be false, if any Works, whether performed by Grace and in Faith, or without Grace, were conducible to Iustification. And hence this Argument ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>An Argument against inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>We are justified without Works by Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> testifies.</p>
               <p>VVorks of Charity infused by Grace, are VVorks.</p>
               <p>Therefore, without these Works also, that consist of Grace, we are <note place="margin">The Caviling of the Papists.</note> justified.</p>
               <p>The Adversaries Answer to the Major: <hi>Paul</hi> asserts, that we are justified without Works, but with this Exception, unless they be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by Faith, and the influence of Grace; for the Apostle excludes not such kind of Works, because they please God, and procure Iustification. Contrarily those VVorks only are excluded, that are of the Law, or of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:95561:253"/>
without which we are said to be justified. But this Answer doth not satisfie the VVords of <hi>Paul,</hi> who without making any such Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Distinction of VVorks, teaches simply and indefinitely, that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied without Works. By what <note place="margin">An indefinite Proposition.</note> Logick then have these Sophisters learned to make a definite and particular Proposition of that which is Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Universal? Or what Reason have they to confine that unto a particular Case, which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of Works in the general? Let us consider the Words of the Apostle: Who, if he had believed, that Works of Charity infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, procure Iustification in the sight of God, it cannot be doubted, but he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said so much. Now he says expresly without any Exception: By Works shall no Flesh be justified.</p>
               <p>Whence we may form this Argument.</p>
               <p>If Works performed by Grace and in Faith, were meritorious of Iustification, then some flesh would be justified by Works, seeing there are many Believers that Work by Grace.</p>
               <p>But no flesh at all shall be justified by Works, as <hi>Paul</hi> bears witness.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is false, that good Works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Grace have any Power of justifying. <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:95561:254"/>
               <p>Let us confirm the saying of <hi>Paul</hi> by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Examples. That which <hi>Paul</hi> here preaches of free Salvation without Works, the same <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> foretells, will come to pass, though in other Words yet to the same purpose, under the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of Wine and Milk. All ye that thirst, saith he, come without <note place="margin">Isa. 55.</note> Money, and without Price, and buy Wine and Milk. What is signified here by Wine and Milk, but the glorious Mystery of our Iustification? and what is the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Words, wherein we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to eat without Money and without Price, but that the Lord would intimate unto us by the Prophet the same thing, that the Apostle declares, to wit that we attain unto so great Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity by the free Gift of God only, and not by Works or Merits of Works? For what can be the sense of these Words of the Apostle [With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works] but the same that the Prophet expresseth in these Words (without Money, and without Price:) What hole can the Papists find here, to creep out at? Without our own Works say they, or without those that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, as <hi>Campian</hi> says, or without the Works of the Law as <hi>Osorius</hi> speaks, but not without the Works of Faith, or those Works which flow from the Grace of God; but this vain Sophistry is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown <note place="margin">A frivolous Trick of the Sophisters.</note> by the similitude of the Prophet, which would be utterly absurd, unless upon all accounts Salvation were freely offered without any Condition of Works.
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:95561:254"/>
For otherwise, what will they answer the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or how can they interpret his Words, where he commands to eat without Money and without Price? Will they distinguish Money in this place just as they distinguish Works? So that they reject that Money as unprofitable, which is our own, being purchased by our own labours, but what is given us of God, they are so far from excluding this, that unless we have it, it is in vain to come and eat. O vain janglings of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters, not so fit to be confuted by Arguments as to be hissed away, and accursed by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Execration. Suitable hereunto is that saying of the same Prophet: Ye were sold for nought, and ye shall <note place="margin">Isa. 52.</note> be redeemed without Silver: What else can be understood by these Words, but the freeness of the Infinite Mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us without any Merit of ours? Where then are the Merits of inherent Righteousness, which the wicked bring before God, if none obtain Iustification, (as they plead) but those who are first endued with Charity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are rendered just and worthy of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</p>
               <p>For the Confirmation of what we assert, let us add also the Example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> From whence we may argue thus.</p>

                  <p>Therefore VVorks done by Faith and Grace Merit nothing before God.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, what these Interpreters Answer, absurdly wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <note place="margin">The VVords of <hi>Paul</hi> wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Papists.</note> these Words of <hi>Paul</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense, contrary to the Mind of the Apostle. For thus they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this place. If <hi>Abraham</hi> by VVorks, &amp;c. The good VVorks of <hi>Abraham</hi> done in Faith, are not by these Words excluded from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, neither is he declared to be justified by Faith only. But the VVorks of the Law, done without Faith, are excluded, which sort of VVorks because <hi>Abraham</hi> did not, therefore he is truly said to be justified by his VVorks before God. Moreover (as they say) it is not proved by these Words, that the good Works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> being a renewed Man and righteous, though done in Faith, did not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, but that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by Works only without Faith. Thus they say, What should I answer then, but that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation doth not agree with the Mind of the Author? <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he had proved it by many and weighty Arguments, That a Man is justified by Faith without Works, being about to confirm the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:95561:255"/>
same by an Example; He enquires concerning the Works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> What shall we say, that <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father according to the flesh found? For if he was justified by Works, he hath whereof to Glory, but not before God, &amp;c. First, let us see, what these Works were of which <hi>Paul</hi> treats, and next whose Works they were? The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <note place="margin">Tarrianus <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit.</hi> pro epist. pent. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> Answer, and amongst those <hi>Campian</hi> our Countrey-man, who a while since, when he was urged by this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the Works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is reported to have answered thus, like his own Iesuits, the Works of the Law, as they are done without Faith and Grace, avail nothing to Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but because the Works of that Holy Man were not such, being replenished with Faith and Grace, therefore he is truly said to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Works before God, yet not as his own Works. What do you say? Was he justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Works, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> says expresly, that he had no cause of glorying in his Works before God? Was the Apostle ignorant of the Holiness and Excellency of the Works of the Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, which were not without Faith, and the Grace of God? And yet <hi>Paul</hi> denies that these Works, though excellent in themselves, availed any thing before God, in respect either of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or of Iustification? And it is evident by the Authority of <hi>Paul,</hi> that it was of Faith, and nor of Works that he was justified before God; for <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness: How then will those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters agree with the Apostle, in affirming
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:95561:256"/>
he denies; for they contrarily do plead that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by his Works: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in opposition thereunto the whole scope of this Epistle is to remove the works of the Saints, though excellent in themselves, from Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not that pious works should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, but that the free Bounty of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sinners may evidently appear, who libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally communicates his Righteousness, not to the dignity of Merits, but to Faith; not to him that worketh, but to him that believeth in him, that justifies the ungodly, (who justifieth the ungodly, saith the Apostle.) But here <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> objects after his former manner, pleading; first, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Works; and next, he renders the reason, why he was justified by Works; because that his Works were not done in Circumcision, nor in the Law, but before Circumcision and the promulgation of the Law, by Faith and Grace: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Commenting upon the scope of the Epistle, he affirms, that we misunderstand the words of the Apostle, because his whole drift through all that Epistle is, to separate from Iustification the Ceremonies of the Law, and the Works, that were done before Faith in the Law, or by the Law only without Grace. For thus he reasons, and such are all <hi>Camplan's</hi> Objections. To all which I answer, that they are most false.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas he affirms, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">An Answer to the first Objection.</note> was righteous by Works, <hi>Paul</hi> expresly denies it, Reason
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:95561:256"/>
openly confutes it and the thing appears evident of it self. For what need had he of the promised Seed and a Redeemer, if already he had been righteous by Works? or what need was there, that Faith should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto him for righteousness, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to obtain the praise of Righteousness by Works? Moreover, death being the wages, not of righteousness, but of sin; by what right could he be subject to the dominion of death, if he had not been a sinner? If he was a sinner, how then was he righteous by works?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas he says, That these works were not done according to the Law, nor under the Law, but before the promulgation of the Law, I would ask him, What the Law is; which if it is nothing but the Rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <note place="margin">An Answer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> how can any man be just, where there is no Law? But what man was there ever in the World, but he carried about with him the Law of God, if not written in Tables, yet written on his heart, and engraven on his conscience? But the Decalogue was not yet engraven on Tables of Stone. But what was contained in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decalogue, which that holy man did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready comprehend within his own heart, both of loving God and his Neighbour, of not Murthering, of not committing <note place="margin">An Answer to the third Objection.</note> Adultery, or honouring Parents? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As touching the scope of this Epistle, how greatly is <hi>campian</hi> mistaken? For who is so void of sense, that he doth not clearly perceive,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:95561:257"/>
that the drift of the Apostle is not that, which those Iesuits dream of, to attribute our Salvation or Iustification to any Works, either going before, or following after? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this Office of an Ambassadour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, that he might contend with the Iews about Ceremonies, or with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles about Moral Duties; but as <hi>Peter</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Apostleship of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so also the Preaching of the Gospel to the Uncircumcision was committed unto <hi>Paul;</hi> not that he should Preach the Law, but the Faith, which before he opposed: Not that he might declare the Righteousness of Works (in which there is no Salvation) but that God by him might reveal his Son amongst the Gentiles, and might manifest unto the World that heavenly Trophy and glad Tydings of Peace and Victory obtained in Heaven by Christ, and spread abroad far and wide through the Churches, the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less riches of Divine Grace, which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in himself. For he was called for this purpose to the Apostleship, that the infinitely gracious Lord and Redeemer Christ Iesus might first exercise his Mercy towards him, and afterwards by him declare his great Mercy towards Sinners, not only by hisEx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but also by his Ministry For <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> thus he bears witness of himself, that the Ministry of Reconciliation was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, for which he was appointed to be a Preacher, and Apostle and Teacher of the Gentiles, in Faith and Truth, that he being an Ambassadour in Christ's <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:95561:257"/>
stead, might invite all men, yea and beg of them, that they would <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 2 Cor. 5. Ephes. 3.</note> be reconciled unto God. And this seems to be the principal scope, that <hi>Paul</hi> aims at, not only in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but also in all his Doctrine, to proclaim amongst the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and that he might set before the view of all men, what is the Communion of the Mystery that was hidden with God in former Ages, &amp;c. But now in the Righteousness of Works, no such Mystery lay hidden with God from former Ages. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is false, and abominable, which <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> the Iesuit, and such like Sophisters assert concerning the scope and sense of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> For by the Law, (which <hi>Paul</hi> excludes from Iustification) they understand that part thereof which comprehends Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Iudicial Works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Iews gloried; or Works <note place="margin">The blind Errour of the Papists about the sense and scope of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles.</note> purely Moral, performed before Faith, on which the Gentiles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied. Yea on the contrary, when <hi>Paul</hi> removes the Law from Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he doth not only exclude it, upon the account of Iewish Ceremonies, or Moral Works performed before Faith; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so upon the account of its weakness through the flesh, both in Iews and Gentiles, both in the regenerate, and the unregenerate; so that it cannot make sufficient satisfaction to the Iustice of God. And <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, That for this cause God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.</p>

                  <p>What did God do, but what flesh could not do? For sin, he condemned sin in the flesh. In what flesh? ours, or his own Sons? Who of all the Regenerate, though endued with great habitual Faith and Grace, hath so led his life, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, but he always carries about with him flesh, that is weak in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and vicious and subject to sin? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which every one may complain with the Apostle: I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. And again; I find a Law. that when I would do good, evil is present with me, &amp;c. For <note place="margin">Romans 7.</note> what they speak of Works following Faith and Grace, how little that helps their cause appears not more evident by any Argument, than by the Lives of those, that maintain this Controversie, if they be strictly enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If that be true, which <hi>Campian</hi> with his Iesuits pleads for, That Righteousness is not obtained in men come to years, but by Works that follow after Faith: Let us behold then what excellent Works this Faith of the Mother Church of <hi>Rome</hi> brings forth; seeing they so much glory in the Title of Catholick Faith, and Preach so many things about Charity, which is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Let us look into the Life and Works of the Roman Popes, Cardinals and Bishops, and the whole Crew of the Monks and Iesuits; Where can you find more of the flesh, or less of true holiness, than in those false-hearted and painted Hypocrites, whose whole profession of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:95561:258"/>
Religion consists, in Purple Gowns, high topped Mitres, Purple Caps, Rings adorned with Iewels, solemn Vows, Ceremonies, which in reality are rather Stage-playes than Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Piety. This appears to be too true by the unhappy Tumults raised in the World, the Wars and Persecutions that are stirred up by none more, than by those very men, that call themselves Spiritual and Catholick; whom it should become to be the chiefest encouragers of Concord, and Messengers of Peace.</p>
                  <p>But having so much enlarged upon this sort of men, with their Works and Merits, let us return to the Examples of those of whom we spake before, who were freely admitted unto Baptism, and received into favour by Faith without any commendation of Merits at all, yea without mention of any Works, except such perhaps as were evil: Amongst which number those Iews may be reckoned, of whom three thousand at one time were Baptized by <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise also the Eunuch whom Faith only without Works, made not only meet for Baptism, but also an Heir of the Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And the Iaylor, whom <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized. Moreover, <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and all the Apostles, and Publicans, the family of <hi>Cornelius, Zacehaeus, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Thief on the Cross; If Faith without Works was sufficient to them for the Grace of Baptism, why not also for the obtaining of Iustification and Life Eternal?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vega,</hi> and those of his Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Vega de Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat. p. 771.</note> answers after his usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:95561:259"/>
that in all these Repentance was joyned with Faith, and other things also belonging to good Manners, and a godly Life. But it easily appears how vain and insignificant this Answer of <hi>Vega</hi> is: He says, Repentance and other Vertues are joyned with Faith: Which, tho' I confess to be in some sense true in the lives and persons of them that are justified; but these things have no union with Faith in the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iustification. And first, as touching Repentance, abundance hath been said before; for seeing Repentance is nothing but a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sins committed, it may indeed of it self afflict the guilty person, and fit him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Grace; but it cannot obtain a pardon for the sins committed before a Secular Iudge, and much less before the Iudgment Seat of God. For that is the Office of Faith, which as it only obtains a pardon, so it obtains it for none but them that are afflicted, and repent, and believe in Christ. For for their sakes chiefly Christ was sent by his Father into this World, that he may help all them, that being in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, flie to him by Faith. In which three things are to be considered, and placed each of them in their own bounds and territories. First, that we may see what the Mediatour does, what Faith performs, &amp; what sorrow for sin produces. All our Salvation flows from the Mediatour as from a Spring and Fountain. But if you ask, how, or for what cause he saves; I answer, by Faith. And if you ask, whom he saves; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, those that repent of their wickedness, or whom he draws unto himself by an inward
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:95561:259"/>
Call: Doth the Lord then save those for their Repentance? No verily. Suppose a man is greatly grieved at the remembrance of his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past life, but yet comes not to Christ; will grief for his sins save him? No surely. Yea, who can come to Christ unless he first hear and understand, who he is from whom Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be sought? Now it is Faith, and not Repentance, that does this: For it is not the grief and sorrow of a broken hearted sinner, but Faith that discovers a Saviour to us, and guides us to him, and obtains Salvation from him: Yea, which is Salvation to them that are in distress: for thus it is written: This is the will of God, That every one that seeth and believeth in him, should <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> have Eternal Life. By which it is evident enough, what should be attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Repentance, and what to Faith, in the case of Iustification; for sin is not therefore pardoned, because he that sinned hath repented, but because he that sinned not at all, hath died for sin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sinner is forgiven, not for his Repentance, but for Faith, whereby he believes in him, that died for our sins, &amp; rose again for our Iustification.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Where Faith is joyned with Works, and where it is not joyned.</head>
               <p>AND hitherto we have been speaking of Repentance. But as touching the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Life in other respects, though I
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:95561:260"/>
know that nothing is more convenient, than that Faith, which is rightly instructed in Christ, should have Charity, and other Offices of Piety, suitable to the Christian Profession joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it.</p>
               <p>Yet it must be considered what <note place="margin">Romans 4.</note> manner of Union this is, and of how large an extent: for Faith and Charity have that wherein they are of necessity united. And they have that also, wherein they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be separated. Where we deal with God about Salvation, Iustification, and the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sins, here Faith only without Works is powerful and overcomes. But in dealings with men in the Lives of the Iustified, in popular duties, in the exercise of Vertue, there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near Union between Faith and Vertue, of which the one cannot consist without the other. Therefore these things should be measured by their own bounds, that we may attribute unto Faith its due, and to Works their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Haeres. 54.</hi>
                  </note> due, and unto both that which is meet. For as that poisonous Errour of <hi>Eunomius</hi> should be abhorred, who is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been so great an Enemy to godly works, that he thought it was not a matter of any concernment how any man led his life: So also great care should be taken, lest in shunning the <hi>Soylla</hi> of <hi>Eunomius,</hi> we fall upon the other <hi>Carybdis</hi> of the Papists, which is no less pernicious, being mis-led by the Popish Doctors, who make such a confused Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faith and Works, that neither Faith without Works, nor Works without Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Iustification.</p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:95561:260"/>
               <p>But this Union is easily confuted by the Authority of Scripture: For if Faith only doth not bring Believers into a state of Salvation, unless it be joyned with great Holiness of life, why did not Christ joyn these together, when he said simply; He that believeth in me hath Eternal Life? Why did not <hi>Peter</hi> joyn them together, when, according to the Testimonies of the Prophets he proclaimed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins to all that believed <note place="margin">Iohn 6. Acts 10. Acts 16.</note> in his Name? Why did not <hi>Paul</hi> joyn them together, when instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iaylor in the Faith, he said unto him, Believe in the Lord Iesus, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house? Many other such like things may be mentioned.</p>
               <p>The History of the <hi>Galatians</hi> is well known, who being led aside by the false Apostles, did not wholly cast off Christ, nor excluded Faith in Christ, but they would have had the good Works of Believers joyned with Faith in the Article of Iustification before God unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: for which cause, how angry the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was at them, his Epistle bears witness.</p>
               <p>But here again a place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> out of the same Epistle is objected, <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> where writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he speaks of Faith, that works by Charity. From hence the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Divines infer a necessary connexion between Faith and Charity; so that Faith without Charity, like matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form, avails nothing to the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tridentine</hi> Counc. 1. <hi>Sess. 6. cap. 7.</hi>
                  </note> perfection of Righteousness. And they say of Charity, which they
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:95561:261"/>
call Righteousness inherent in us, That it is so impossible that it should be separated from Faith in the concernment of Iustification, that they assert it only to be the formal cause of our Iustification. But it is <note place="margin">Objection from the words of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> not difficult to answer to this place of <hi>Paul.</hi> For in that Epistle the Apostle endeavours with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to call back his <hi>Galatians</hi> to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith from which they had swerved. In the mean while, lest they should be seduced by a counterfeit Faith, by these words he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, what Faith it is, that he speaks of: Not such a Faith as is idle and dead without Works, but which worketh by <note place="margin">Answer.</note> Love. And in this sense we deny not that Faith is not alone. But what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is that?</p>
               <p>Lively Faith is not alone without Charity.</p>
               <p>It is a lively Faith that justifies.</p>
               <p>Therefore in Iustifying, Faith is not alone without Charity.</p>
               <p>This Argument is disproved in the Schools of Logicians; for it is a Sophism (a <hi>non causa ut causa.</hi>) Therefore I answer to the <hi>Major:</hi> The Faith that is lively is not alone without Charity: That is true in working, but not in justifying. Therefore as touching the Cause and Office of Iustifying, this is not the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof: Therefore in Iustifying, Faith
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:95561:261"/>
is not alone without Charity. But as for the the <hi>Minor,</hi> though Faith that justifies is called lively in respect of good Works, yet it doth not justifie in respect of those Works, but only upon the account of its Object, which, because Faith only without Charity embraces; therefore Faith only without Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from thence the power of <note place="margin">Why Faith is alone in Iustifying.</note> Iustifying. If all things that any way are, or are done together, should be joyned in one and the same Office, it would come to pass, that he that hath Feet, Eyes and Ears, because he hath not these Members alone, therefore he should be said to go not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his Feet only, but to walk with his Eyes, and see with his Ears, as hath been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. Iust so the case is in Faith, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and other Vertues: Which tho' being infused by Grace, they inhere <note place="margin">How Faith, Charity, and other vertues are joyned together.</note> in the same subject, yet each one of them are distinguished by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Offices. Therefore if it be asked concerning the Office of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, What it is that reconciles us to God, and procures Eternal Life for us? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, it is Faith, and that only. If you ask; how? I answer, by Christ, the Mediatour. Again, if you ask, what manner of Faith that is? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, It is not an idle or dead Faith, but lively and active. But if you would know by what marks you distinguish between a true Faith, and that which is counterfeit? St. <hi>Paul</hi> answers that question; The Faith, that is true, works by Love.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <head>What, where, and How Faith worketh by Charity.</head>
               <p>BUT here there are several things, that need to be explained, as, what Faith works, where, and after what manner it works; for Faith doth not act every where after one and the same manner: It acts one way with men, and another way <note place="margin">What, where, &amp; how Faith works by Love.</note> with God. It is true, that it works by Love, as <hi>Paul</hi> says but it must be understood in respect of men, not in respect of God. Neither doth Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the same in both respects, nor after the same manner; for with men it works by Love, but with God it works not by Love, but by Christ only, by whom it is admirable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what, and how great things Faith performs. It obtains grants of Petitions, pardon of sins; it reconciles, justifies, wrestles, overcomes, reigns, and triumphs. Faith only does these things, not with men, but with God; not working by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by Christ our Lord. Therefore Faith works one thing by Christ, and another thing by Charity: By Christ it obtains Salvation, by Charity it performs Obedience to the Law. Doth it perform perfect Obedience? No. Doth it then perform imperfect Obedience? But that is not sufficient to procure Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Salvation. And where then is that excellent integrity of Life? Where is Charity's
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:95561:262"/>
meritorious efficacy to purchase Salvation? Where is the Assertion of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which only attributes the beginning of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to Faith, but makes the formal cause thereof to be Charity or New Obedience, which they call Righteousness inherent in us, whereby we are not only accounted righteous, but are both called, and also really are righteous, before God; adding also a dreadful Curse, if any dare be of another Iudgment. Which manner of Doctrine, if it be admitted, it utterly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Trid. Concil. cap.</hi> 11. If any say, that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness only, or by the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins only, exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace and Charity, which is spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the hearts, and inheres in them. Or if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny say that the Grace whereby we are justified is only the favour of God, let him be accursed. If any say, that Iustifying Faith is nothing else but a fiducial relyance on the Mercy of God, forgiving sins for Christ's sake; or that this fiducial rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is the only thing whereby we are justified, let him be accursed, <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Rom. 4. 11. Rom. 3.</note> disannuls the sacred Scripture, and overturns all the foundation of our Religion. For if this be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Salvation, that it must rely upon good deeds, and not free Imputation only: Where then is that Righteousness, which is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto Faith so often Preached by <hi>Paul?</hi> Where is the difference between the Law and the Gospel, which, unless it be carefully obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we may be as blind as to the knowledge of the Scripture, as Moles and Batts at Noon-day. Moreover, where is that opposition mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> between the Righteousness of the Law and of Faith? between Grace and Debt? Where is glorying in Works
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:95561:263"/>
excluded? Where is Faith account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness? And how will the Tridentine Decrees agree with that which <hi>Paul</hi> says: Faith is accounted for Righteousness not to him, that Works, but to him, that believes in him who justifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly? And where be those remarkable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and exclusive Particles, whereby our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wholly cut off from Works, and ascribed unto Imputation? Moreover where are all those sweet Promises, if those <note place="margin">Testimonies out of the Prophets.</note> Men rob us of the Assurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and God's Imputation?</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to the Prophets, that if any are less moved with the Authority and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles, if they have any thing to say for themselves, they may either Answer the evident Testimonies of the Prophets, or yield unto them. And first, that I may begin at this, I ask of them, that deny that it is sufficient to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Iustification, that Christ hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all Righteousness for us, unless thereunto be added also a Righteousness implanted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, being formed in us of his free Bounty, which makes us formally Righteous, satisfies the Law, and merits Life. Which if it be so, I ask of them, Whether any Man will be assured that he is in a state of Salvation in this Life. If they deny it, where then is that Peace and Ioy in the Holy Ghost, whereof there is so frequent mention in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles? Where is that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent singing of Praise in the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Where is that Everlasting Ioy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:95561:263"/>
which <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet foretels shall be upon the head of those who being redeemed by the Lord, shall come into <hi>Sion</hi> with Praise? Where is that way so straight, that Fools can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err therein? Where is that Voice of the Prophet preaching Peace, and proclaiming Glad tidings, and comforting his own People, which taking away all Fear, Grief and Sighing, confirms fearful and affrighted Consciences, strengthens weak Kness, and feeble Hands, yea provokes the very Beasts of the Field, and the Ostriches to the Exercise of glorifying God.</p>
               <p>If yet we waver in doubtful and uncertain fears, and have no firm hope of Salvation, but in that Righteousness, which is inherent in our selves according to the Pseudocatholick Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where then is that fiducial reliance; where is that Holy Courage, concerning which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: In those days <hi>Iudah</hi> shall be saved, and <hi>Israel</hi> shall dwell safely. And again to the same purpose <hi>Ezekiel</hi> foretelling of the future Peace of the Church: And <note place="margin">Ierem. 23. Ezek. 34.</note> I will make with them a Covenant of Peace. And they that dwell in the VVilderness, shall sleep safely in the woods, and shall be in their own Land without fear: And presently he subjoins: But they shall dwell safely without any fear. Hereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the encouragement, that <hi>Isaiah</hi> gives the People of the Messiah, commanding them not to be afraid. Fear not, saith he, <note place="margin">Isa. 41. Isa. 43. Isa. 44.</note> for I am with thee. And again, Fear not for I have redeemed thee. And again, Fear not, my Servant
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:95561:264"/>
                  <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. Hereunto also agree <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.</note> the Words of <hi>Zephaniah</hi> Prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the same Spirit: Be glad, O Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> and be joyful, O <hi>Israel,</hi> and rejoice with all thy Heart, O Daughter of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The Loard hath taken away thy Iudgment, he hath turned away thy Enemies. The King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord is in the midst of thee, thou shalt not be afraid of evil any more, &amp;c. How then doth this so great Peace and Tranquility of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, so often repeated in the Prophets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with that trembling fear and doubtfulness, which the Papists plead for? For what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is there for Hope, when the Mind is restless through fear, and all thingsly at an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? For how can Hope avoid being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if Salvation must be hoped for by Works, and not by free Donation?</p>
               <p>Howbeit we are not ignorant, nor deny that Sanctification and Renovation, and the practice of good Works, that flow from hence, are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits bestowed upon us by Christ, which of necessity all good Christians must endeavour to attain unto. But that is not the state of this Controversie, for the debate here is not about governing the Life in this World, but about Eternal Salvation, and the cause thereof. Nor whether Offices belonging to Christian Piety should be performed; but whether, when they are performed, they are so much accounted of by God, that they Merit Salvation, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile an offended God to Mankind? Whether Vertues and good Works are able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudgment Seat of God, without being condemned according to the rigid Sentence of the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:95561:264"/>
Law? Whether under great Terrours of Conscience, when Salvation hangs in doubt, we may safely rely upon them, that we may become the Sons of God, and inherit Eternal Life. And yet it is not therefore false, that as long as this Life endures, it is very requisite, that Believers should be careful to <note place="margin">The necessity of Pious Works.</note> lead Holy Lives, and utterly abhor all wickedness. But it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, how it is requisite. In respect of the necessity of Obedience, it is true, but if you say, that it is requisite in respect of our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right unto Eternal Life and Salvation, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more false, or pernicious, because it is not purchased by our Merits, but is given to us, that deserve not, and are unworthy, and it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then, whilest we are yet Sinners, that it may evidently appear, that all the Glory of our Salvation is due to the Mercy of God, and not to our Works, which follow Reconciliation to God, as Fruits thereof, but do not procure it.</p>
               <p>Therefore as I have already admonished, I must again renew this Admonition. that in this course of Obedience, the godly practice of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity should not be separated from us, but should of necessity accompany Faith: but yet it must be so admitted, that it shut not out Faith from its own Office and Dignity, nor justle out the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Riches of the Grace of God, which is in Christ Iesus: Nor darken the Glory of the Cross of Christ, nor take away Consolation from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Consciences, nor corrupt the sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Apostles have taught us; which seeing it places all our Salvation in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the Benefit of Redemption by Christ,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:95561:265"/>
let men of understanding and Piety iudge which of the two Opinions is in the right; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that place all the Hope of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Faith only, or they that place it in the Righteousness of inherent Works only, and call Faith, if alone, a Presumption. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if the Spirit of Christ could not <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> endure those <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who were puffed up with a false Imagination of their own Righteousness, and understood not how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miserable, and naked they were: I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it may easily appear what should be judged of Popish Catholicks, and all this Divinity of theirs. I beg of Christ, the infinitely Glorious, and only begotten Son of God, King of Kings, Preserver of Life, the Merciful Author and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of our Salvation, the Glory of Heaven, the brightness of his Father's Glory, according to his Infinite Goodness, unto whose Everlasting Dominion all things are subject, that are in Heaven and in Earth; that we miserable Men, whom Nature hath brought into this wretched Condition, who are Poor and Needy, Naked and Blind, and utterly. destroyed, being restored by his Bounty, and having Salvation bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us by his free Gift, and being cloathed with his Ornaments, and enriched with his Wealth, and carried on by the safe conduct of his Spirit, we may grow in him daily more and more, and never fall from him, being strong in the Faith, and fruitful in good Works, until at length at the coming of his Kingdom, we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into those blessed Mansions of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, where he Lives and Reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit in Eternal Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
