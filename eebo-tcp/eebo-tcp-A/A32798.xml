            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF Love is a Weakneſs, one muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs there is none that ought ſooner to be excuſed, or that is Authoriſed by ſo many Examples. It would be a hard matter to find a Man of any Note, who has never been in Love: The greateſt Heroes could not defend themſelves againſt its Power, and they valued their Crowns of Myrtle, no leſs than thoſe of Laurel; the Pleaſures which aroſe to their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Minds from their many Exploits, and Illuſtrious Conqueſts, did not ſeem to them ſo ſweet, as thoſe of Love. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who had under their Command almoſt half the World, thought it Glorious for themſelves to obey that Sex, which has always been the faireſt part of it. <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> himſelf, that Prodigy of Strength and Valour, preferred the Fetters of a Woman, to the Honour of upholding Heaven, and the Gods themſelves. One of <hi>Omphala</hi>'s threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning looks could make this invincible Hero
<pb facs="tcp:105648:4"/>
tremble, his Armour was no Proof againſt her Charms; her Diſtaff eaſily took place of his Club, and his Lyons Skin ſurrender'd to a Woman's Attire. <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf the God of War, could not reſiſt the Charms of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Love, and he never thought himſelf ſo happy, as when he ſhar'd with <hi>Vulcan</hi> the Favours of <hi>Venus.</hi> Since then the greateſt <hi>Heroes,</hi> and the Gods themſelves, have been thus enamour'd; how can any wonder, that the Victorious <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> ſhould yield to the Charms of <hi>Arianiſſa?</hi> This formidable Captain, who never fought without Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, killed near two thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> with his own hand, without receiving the leaſt wound; but Love did what all his Enemies could not do, and wounded the Heart of this Invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conquerour. <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> tho' but a Slave, loaded with Chains that Vanquiſher of the moſt powerful Emperour in the World. But how paſſionate ſoever this King of <hi>Albania</hi> was, Love could never draw one word from him, or compel him to an Action, unworthy of himſelf. The perſon who inſpires him with theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and theſe Deſigns, is uſed to make <hi>Heroes</hi> both Speak and Act. And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the Amours of <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> will be as pleaſant to the Ladies, as the great Tranſactions of his Life have ſeem'd won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to thoſe who have read them in his Hiſtory.</p>

            <p>VAlour and Virtue, appeared never with more Splendour, than in the Perſon of the Invincible <hi>Scanderberg.</hi> This Prince was Bred up in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Cruel <hi>Amurat,</hi> preſerv'd there his Manners uncorrupt, and his Vertue may be propoſed for an Example to all the Monarchs in the World. After he had freed himſelf from a ſhameful Slavery, recovered his Father's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, ſtruck Terrour, by his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Actions, into the heart of him who had Captivated his Youth, he

ſaw all his Lands Invaded by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which the angry <hi>Sultan</hi> led in Perſon to the ſight of the Walls of <hi>Croya,</hi> a Famous City, and the ordinary abode of the Kings of <hi>Albania.</hi>

               <hi>Scanderberg</hi> ſince his return, had led there a Life which might have been called happy, if Love had not mixed its ſad Diſpleaſures with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of reigning over the hearts of all his Subjects; he had bore the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt brunts of War with unimagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtancy; he had won Battels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Provinces, vanquiſhed every where, and given Matter enough to Poſterity for celebrating his Praiſes, there were ſtill remaining ſome formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Enemies, powerful by their number, and dreadful for their fury, whoſe only intent was to oppreſs him; but the fear of their Arms was not the thing, that diſturbed his reſt: Some more tender concerns, caſt him into a ſorrowful Condition, and if care of his Subjects, by whom he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly beloved, had not kept him at <hi>Croya,</hi> he had gone himſelf to the Camp of the Enemy, to ſeek out the abſent and unfortunate <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105648:5"/>
the moments which he gave to other Affairs, ſeem'd to him as ſo many Crimes againſt his Love; and <hi>Croya,</hi> which he could not leave with Honour, was a ſorrowful abode for him, by reaſon of <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Abſence.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the care of thoſe, that feared for his Liberty, he did ſeek ſometimes Solitary Places, to ſigh there with more Freedom, and would go a conſiderable way from <hi>Croya.</hi> One Morning going out with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus</hi> only, he ſteer'd his courſe towards a Vally that ſeem'd more agreeable with his Melancholy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> had made already many Incurſions, and gain'd ſome ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which the Sorrow of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi> ſeem'd to neglect. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus</hi> being ſolicitous for his Maſter's danger, who was come ſo near his powerful Enemy, and having given him a conſiderable while to think by himſelf, ſtopt him at laſt, and ſhewing him <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Tents, ſpake thus to him; Do you intend, My Lord, to go to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Camp, and do you ſeriouſly reflect upon that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army, which bears ſuch an ill will to your Perſon: That Life for which thou art ſo ſolicitous, anſwer'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105648:6"/>
the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> is not dear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to me, to take any care of it; and my Eyes, deprived of the ſight of <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> long to be deprived of that of the day: What, will you, My <hi>Lord,</hi> reply'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus, expoſe to a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fate, a thing which is ſo dear to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa? <hi>I know what your Valour can do; but in our preſent Condition—In our preſent Condition,</hi> ſaid <hi>Scanderberg, do you think that the Army of</hi> Amurat <hi>can make me tremble? Was I but certain of ſeeing</hi> Arianiſſa <hi>again, I would venture to fight it my ſelf alone: yes ſure</hi> (added he, with one of thoſe threatning looks, which had been often the Preſages of his Victories) <hi>I would endeavour it.</hi> As he was going on, ſome groaning that he heard from behind the Trees inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him. The Prince was Naturally bountiful, and thinking that might be ſome oppreſſed Perſon who wanted help, he run thither with haſte, and found a Man wallowing in his Blood, this Man was a <hi>Turk,</hi> but <hi>Scanderberg</hi> whom no prejudice could hinder from being kind, drew nearer him, and knew preſently (tho' in the Pangs of Death) <hi>Aradin,</hi> the firſt of the Eunuchs of <hi>Amurat,</hi> who had taken care of him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105648:6"/>
in his Infancy, and by whom he was tenderly beloved; the unfortunate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> tho' dying, knew alſo the Features of the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> and, fetching a deep ſigh, he ſaid, <hi>Oh,</hi> Scanderberg!

This ſtrange event was but a new increaſe of Grief for <hi>Scanderberg:</hi> The Nanies which <hi>Aradin</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, paſs'd to his very heart; he perceived the <hi>Eunuch</hi> had not ſpoke, but after he had known him, and that he was nearly concerned in all thoſe things, which Death had forced him to ſuppreſs: <hi>Juſt Heavens,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>what News do you intend to tell me? Is</hi> Arianiſſa <hi>Alive, or Dead? Ala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s!</hi> Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>my dear</hi> Uranus, <hi>what perplexity do I find my ſelf now in?

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105648:8"/>
               <hi>Thopia, the</hi> Turks <hi>may ſurprize your Valour in this place: Let us go to</hi> Croya, <hi>where your Preſence is wiſhed for.</hi> And ſo jointly with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus,</hi> they obliged the Prince to go towards the City, but firſt they took care of the Corps of <hi>Aradin,</hi> ſome <hi>Albanian</hi> Troopers, who were riding about the City, to obſerve the Motion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd it away by the King's Command.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thopia</hi> knew very well that <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> was in Love, but he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Particulars of his Life, and ſhew'd a great Deſire to know them. <hi>Scanderberg</hi> condeſcended eaſily to call again to mind, his moſt ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ideas, that he might ſatisfie <hi>Thopia,</hi> whom his Friendſhip diſtinguiſht from all the other Princes of his Court.</p>

               <p>YOU know my Mother was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prince of the <hi>Triballians,</hi> and that <hi>John Caſtriot</hi> my Father did Reign in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Albania;</hi> he was envy'd for his Valour by <hi>Amurat,</hi> who rendered himſelf Formidable in <hi>Greece;</hi> after he had been the Terror in <hi>Aſia; Caſtriot</hi> forced to yield to the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his proſperous Fortune, made Peace with him, and ſent my three Brothers and me for Hoſtages, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople. Vorſana</hi> my Mother, keeping ſtill by her ſelf four Daughters, to wipe off her Tears: She expected much from my Birth, by reaſon of a Dream, which ſhe had when ſhe was Big of me; She Dreamed ſhe was Delivered of a Serpent, ſo great; that he covered all <hi>Epirus,</hi> his head did reach to <hi>Turkey,</hi> which he ſwallow'd up, and he did dip his Tail in the Sea towards <hi>Venice.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105648:9"/>
regard of the ſafety of his Dominions, could ever have brought him to this Reſolution, I being but eight years old, all my Brothers were Elder than I; this Age expoſed me to the Ceremonies of the <hi>Turks,</hi> wherein they changed my Name, that was <hi>George,</hi> into that of <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> which is as much in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tongue, as <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord, concerning my Brothers, their Riper Age free'd them from this Violence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> who had a good Opinion of my youth, took all the imaginable care, to make me an Honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: The unfortunate <hi>Aradin</hi> was made my Governour, and never man performed his Duty, with more Zeal and Diligence. But tho' his kind uſage made me forget, that I was beholding for it to a Slave, yet my Condition, and the firſt Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, which I had received, could never be blotted out of my Memory.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not relate to you what I did, from eight years, to ſixteen. I learn'd all Exerciſes neceſſary, both for the Body and the Mind; and <hi>Aradin</hi> did all his Endeavours to inſpire me with the love of Glory and Vertue. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105648:9"/>
who took ſome delight in my Sight and Converſation, ſeem'd always pleaſed with me: I had the advantage of Signalizing my ſelf in his preſence, in the firſt War wherein I was allowed to fight; and kind Fortune waiting every where upon me, being yet but nineteen years old, I was made a <hi>Sangiac</hi> by <hi>Amurat,</hi> that is to ſay, a Leader, and I was truſted by him, with the Command of five thouſand Horſes; a little while after, I was nominated a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> which was a Dignity that made the <hi>Sangiacs</hi> inferiour to me. I confeſs, my Advancement was very ſudden, but the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who foreſaw I ſhould prove uſeful to him, had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my Youth.</p>
               <p>In this paſs I acquired more Glory in <hi>Natoly.</hi> I was feared by the Enemies, loved by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and eſteemed by the Emperour; and I can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, without Bluſhing, that after ſome important Victories, where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Amurat</hi> had had a great ſhare, he would call me his Right Arm, his Heart, his Eye, and the Defender of his Eſtates. I enjoy'd all the ſweet Pleaſures of Liberty, becauſe I was look'd upon as a <hi>Turk.</hi> My Brothers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105648:10"/>
Slavery would ſometimes vex me, but ſeeing that they did not ſuffer much by it, and being beſides reſolved to make my ſelf famous for the future, that was not able to put a ſtop to my Ambition.</p>
               <p>Heaven puniſhed me for this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, and permitted that the Cares of Love, ſhould have their ſhare in my Heart, as well as thoſe of War: Nay, ſhould wholly poſſeſs it. I had not gone for a long while near the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women, and my Age did deprive me of thoſe Careſſes, I was wont to receive from the Lovelieſt <hi>Sultaneſſes:</hi> I felt in my heart, neither Averſion nor love for their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And in this quiet State of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, I ſpent in ſome Exerciſes very pleaſant to the Emperour, that leaſure we injoy'd at <hi>Adrianople:</hi> Thoſe that were then moſt in favour with him, were <hi>Muſſelman, Boſtangi Baſſi,</hi> or great Gardener, <hi>Muſtapha, Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, and <hi>Orcan,</hi> the now <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> They poſſeſs'd infinite Riches, and ſtately Palaces, and their Families lived in great Splendour. <hi>Muſſelman</hi> prevailed over the others, becauſe in all times and in all places, he had a free acceſs to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105648:10"/>
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> his Cloſet, his Counſel, and his Gardens were equally opened to him: Proud of theſe advantages, he entertain'd other Courtiers ſo coldly, that he ſeem'd to deſpiſe them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was loved by <hi>Amurat,</hi> and he deſired to keep in his Favour, I did not find the ſame reception as the reſt. I had a Natural averſion againſt him, but I had learnt Diſſimulation, in a Court, where that Art was ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>About this time there came to <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> a <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince, whom Curioſity had brought thither, the like man had never been ſeen before, he was of a prodigious height; being a foot taller than any of the reſt of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Tho' he was Proud, and Rude, yet he was received like a Prince, by <hi>Amurat;</hi> it was reported he was famous over all <hi>Tartary</hi> for his Exploits; and he had never fought without Victory; proud of his own Reputation, he little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded others civility; unfortunately for him, he contradicted me in any thing that I ſaid; we were uſed to talk about Warlike Matters, and one day he was ſo preſumptuous, as to tell me that the Victory over twenty ſuch Men as me,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105648:11"/>
would be no difficult attempt for him; being impatient, I defied him to fight me in a Duel, in the Emperour's ſight. The <hi>Tartar</hi> was amazed at my boldneſs, and accepted of the Challenge: <hi>Amurat,</hi> who feared the loſs of my Life, oppoſed it: But I craved his leave ſo inſtantly, that at laſt he conſented to it.</p>
               <p>The ſeeming unequality between my Adverſary and me, affrighted all thoſe who loved me, and I was likely the only man who was not alarmed: The Field for the Fight, was appointed in a ſpacious piece of ground, which lay over againſt the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Emperour gave leave to the <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> and Slaves, to get upon the Towers, to ſee this Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and other Women, whoſe Houſes look'd upon that place, had the ſame Licenſe.</p>
               <p>At laſt the hour appointed for the Fight came, and we appeared before a numberleſs multitude of Spectators. The <hi>Tartar</hi> began to jeer me bitterly, for my Age and Weakneſs, but it was not long before I puniſhed him for it, and my blows were ſo fortunate, that after an hours Reſiſtance, he expired in the ſight of all the Aſſembly. There were never heard ſo many Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105648:11"/>
of joy among the <hi>Turks,</hi> as after my Victory; they eſteem'd it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, and I was lookt upon with great Reſpect: I carry'd the <hi>Giant</hi>'s Sword to the Emperour's Feet, who imbraced me, and tho' ſome Perſons envy'd me for the Honour of that day, thoſe that were the Wiſeſt, followed eaſily <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi>'s Example.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> took away their Maſter's Corps, of which they diſpoſed as they pleaſed; and for my part, I followed the <hi>Sultan</hi> to the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> the Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> his eldeſt Son, had received from Heaven ſome eminent Parts, which had been cultivated to a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; we lived very freely between us, and tho' one could not ſee that ſtore of ſincere Friendſhip, which tyes cloſely two hearts together, yet we were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different one to another; he praiſed my Action, and civily congratulated me for it.</p>
               <p>That ſame night to avoid the Crowd, of which I was already weary, we went together, at the Moon-Shine, upon the Sea Shore, juſt behind the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women; after we had walk'd a long while, in a very pleaſant place, incompaſſed one way by the River, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105648:12"/>
towards the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with a Hedge ſo thick, that it rendred the Gardens more inacceſſible, than any ſtrong wall. We were ready to retire, when a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Voice, Sung diſtinctly theſe words in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Since here a Captive, void of all relief,</l>
                  <l>I bend beneath the weight of deadly Grief;</l>
                  <l>Why, cruel Love, do'ſt thou increaſe my pains,</l>
                  <l>And add new Slavery to my former Chains?</l>
               </q>
               <p>The ſound of this Voice paſs'd through my Ears, to my very Heart. I had never felt before any tender motions, and my free and indifferent Soul was capable of any impreſſion. That! Song was repeated many times: <hi>Mahomet</hi> hearkned to it with as much attention as my ſelf, we knew well there were in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> many Fair <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> and Lovely Slaves, whom <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> had offered; but they were altogether unknown to us: One hath never the more Priviledge in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> for being either the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Son, or his Favourite; for their jealouſie is ſo careful, in hiding what they deſign for their Pleaſures, that unleſs kind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105648:12"/>
favours a man, he can never come to know it.</p>
               <p>The Prince, and I having heard this Charming Voice, we knew the perſon who had ſung it, was not alone, becauſe another began to ſpeak in <hi>Greek,</hi> but with a Barbarous pronunciation, Does that Song concern you, ſaid ſhe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have you loſt your Heart in this place, where we ſee but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Objects? <hi>Suppoſe what you ſaid was true;</hi> anſwered another, <hi>it would be a hard matter for my Heart to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain its thoughts in a Song; you have deſired me to Sing, and I have done it: How happy are you,</hi> Arianiſſa, <hi>to keep your Heart ſo free, and repreſent anothers Diſtemper, without fear of being infected with it; how happy are you, but how unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate is</hi> Selimana? <hi>You are the Object of the</hi> Sultan<hi>'s moſt tender Affection,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Arianiſſa, and that is the only thing that may well ſatisfie you, in this Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Retirement. What can you deſire more, Madam, ſince you are the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Miſtreſs of him, who can diſpoſe of all? Tho' Ambition is well pleaſed with that advantage,</hi> continued <hi>Selimana,</hi> ſighing, <hi>a Soul as nice as mine cannot be contented; and if you had ever been in Love, you</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105648:13"/>
                  <hi>would quickly apprehend my meaning. Alas, Madam, I have had ſo many Misfortunes in my Life, that I willingly renounce to that Experiment,</hi> reply'd <hi>Arianiſſa, with a Charming Sweetneſs; well,</hi> interrupted <hi>Selimana, ſince you do not know the cauſe of my ſuffering, at leaſt do not condemn it. A power which I cannot reſiſt, forces me to utter this Secret without bluſhing. I love, I love,</hi> Arianiſſa, <hi>the Prince</hi> Scanderberg, <hi>and his Victory over the</hi> Tartar, <hi>is not the only one he has got to day; he has ſeem'd to my Eyes as Lovely, as he was formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to his Enemy, and that ſhort ſpace of time, has aſſured to him the poſſeſſion of my heart for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot relate to you <hi>Selimana</hi>'s Kindneſs without bluſhing: But you muſt be acquainted with it, that you may the better underſtand how ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the young <hi>Sultan</hi> and I were. I was loved without knowing by whom, and ſuch a man as I might have been well pleaſed with the Idea of this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but beſides that, <hi>Selimana</hi> ſeem'd too paſſionate to deſerve my Heart; ſhe was a Sacred Object for me, being the beloved <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> of <hi>Amurat,</hi> I was more taken with <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Modeſty, and tho' I did not wiſh her ſo paſſionate
<pb facs="tcp:105648:13"/>
as the other, I could have deſired ſhe had not been inſenſible.</p>
               <p>Some noiſe made them retire; the Prince drew nearer me, when he heard them no longer, and claſping his Arm about my Neck, <hi>whatever good Opinion you entertain of your ſelf,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>did you think,</hi> Scanderberg, <hi>that</hi> Mars, <hi>and Love, ſhould intend to beſtow their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon you at the ſame time? My Lord,</hi> reply'd I ſmiling, <hi>if we had more Freedom at</hi> Adrianople, <hi>I would tell you that this adventure is but a ſham. You ſee,</hi> added <hi>Mahomet, that there is nothing but what is Natural in it; the hour, the place, and the perſon who ſpoke, in a word, all things witneſs your good Fortune, and you have nothing to do, but to rejoice. Alas, My Lord,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>though my Heart was ſuſceptible enough, to fall ſo eaſily in Love, I ſhould never forget what I owe to the</hi> Sultan. Selimana <hi>may be a charming Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what ſhe ſaid may flatter me, but</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat <hi>is Emperor, and worthy of my Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. You think,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mahomet, that a great Zeal for his Paſſion, will make me betray yours. No, My Lord,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted I ſomething haſtily, <hi>I know you are generous, and diſcreet, and I ſpeak what I think.</hi> We went then into
<pb facs="tcp:105648:14"/>
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and we parted at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>I did never go to Bed without ſeeing <hi>Aradin;</hi> that day pleaſed with the Honours I had received, he did not fail to be in my Chamber; as becauſe I had no acquaintance in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women, and all things were changed there, ſince my Infancy, I asked him ſeveral queſtions, which ſurpriſed him. I inquired of him concerning <hi>Selimana;</hi> he anſwered me, that ſhe was always the deareſt Object of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Love, who had preferred her to all things, and he drew her Picture with great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: After that, I asked him about <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> and my Curioſity about a Slave, who probably was unknown to me, ſeem'd the more ſurpriſing to him. <hi>I don't know,</hi> Scanderberg, ſaid he to me, <hi>what is your Deſign, but I can aſſure you, that among all the Women in the World, I think there is none more Lovely, than</hi> Arianiſſa; <hi>with a perfect Beauty ſhe poſſeſſes a wonderful Wit and Virtue, and I cannot but wonder, that the Emperour has not yet caſt his Eyes upon her:</hi> I hearken'd to <hi>Aradin,</hi> with a trouble which I had never felt before; what ever he ſaid about <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> were <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105648:14"/>
many pleaſant wounds to my heart, and I may ſay, I was in Love, before I had ſeen whom I loved; after a long Converſation, I thought I could not hide it from <hi>Aradin;</hi> he was afflicted at it, and knowing how dear <hi>Selimana</hi> was to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his jealous, and violent Temper, he uſed his utmoſt care to make me underſtand, how dangerous to me ſuch a concurrence would prove. I aſſured him, I had no diſpoſition to love <hi>Selimana,</hi> however I diſcovered not my thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> but paſſed the whole night in fancying her to my ſelf, as lovely, as the Eunuch had deſcribed her; I found not my ſelf the following day, as I had been hitherto; is it poſſible that <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with ſome tender Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ſaid I ſighing,</hi> and can my Heart, which ſhe takes from me, hope any comfort from her? I had no ſooner ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thoſe words, but I found them unworthy of a man, whoſe only Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was to be great. I knew that violent Paſſions were look'd upon as a weakneſs, and my Love for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Object, ſeem'd to me ſtrange and worthy; nevertheleſs, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105648:15"/>
and I could not conquer it as I had done the <hi>Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was forced to open my Heart to <hi>Aradin,</hi> who condemned me to think never upon her, ſince I could not hope to have any Converſation with her.</p>
               <p>There happen'd then an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeen among the <hi>Turks:</hi> The <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> had ſent a magnificent Embaſſie; and ſome rich Preſents to <hi>Amurat,</hi> who to ſhew his Grandure to Strangers, in the ſeat of his Empire, gave them a publick Audience, that day the Women went from their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> to that of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s adorned with the moſt precious things the <hi>Eaſt</hi> could afford, <hi>Selimana,</hi> the beloved, as I told you before, appeared ſhining with her Natural Beauty, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Ornaments; She was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by a hundred, in the ſame Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and by an infinite number of young Slaves, dreſſed with leſs Art, but certainly worthy of another Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To make this Spectacle ſeem the greater, they wore golden Chains, and they had been loaded with Eſſences, and Baskets full of Flowers, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105648:15"/>
they ſpread in a great Hall, at whoſe end, the <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> sat upon rich Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, theſe Slaves ſtood round about them, and the Emperour ſate upon a Splendid Throne, whoſe ſteps were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy'd by his chiefeſt Officers.</p>
               <p>After this manner, <hi>Thopia,</hi> we ſaw the Secret Court of <hi>Amurat,</hi> when the Turks and <hi>Egyptians</hi> had a free acceſs to the Hall. <hi>Selimana</hi> ſate in a higher place than the others, and her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as her Rank, diſtinguiſh'd her from the reſt: But among the Slaves who were round about her, the young <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> neglected, and bluſhing, for appearing before ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in a condition ſo unworthy of her, was remarkable, in ſpight of her ſelf, for her Charms. I could not know her as being <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> but my heart took notice of her, as of an Object which it was reſolved to adore. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I had conceived of her, upon <hi>Aradin</hi>'s Relation, I wiſhed <hi>Araniſſa,</hi> and that Slave might be the ſame; upon that account I abandoned my ſelf to the Paſſion that poſſeſſes me, and which will never end.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not relate to you what was done there, having taken no notice of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105648:16"/>
the Ceremony; <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> only had all my looks and my attention, neither did I mind whether <hi>Selimana</hi> caſt her eyes upon me, as caring little for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>I ran to <hi>Aradin</hi> as ſoon as the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and the Slaves were retired. Love which firſt had engaged me by the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I had had with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> made me feel now all its power: The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch was amazed at the violence of my Paſſion, and was almoſt angry. <hi>My dear</hi> Scanderberg, ſaid he to me, <hi>you know me well enough, not to queſtion the ſincerity of my advices; what can you hope from an affection, whoſe conſequences muſt needs be unfortunate?

               </p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Aradin,</hi> which his affection created, confounded my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but did not perſwade my heart: My Love for <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> was too ſtrong, and it could not be prevailed on by his Advices, no more than by my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; he perceived well my ſad Condition, but ſeeing it was impoſſible to alter my mind, he exhorted me not to rule my Conduct according to my blind Paſſion, but to have a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Severity, and to take my meaſures accordingly.</p>
               <p>I felt all the griefs of Love, as ſoon as I knew <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> the impoſſibility of ſeeing her was to me a moſt cruel pain, deſpair often makes us ſlight thoſe things we deſire to obtain, but the difficulties I met with here, did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame me the more.</p>
               <p>As if the Obſtacles before mentioned, bad not been enough, there aroſe againſt me three formidable Rivals. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105648:17"/>
who had never before look'd upon <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> found her ſo Beautiful the day of the Publick Audience of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that <hi>Selimana</hi> ſeemed to him leſs Charming. Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had not till then entertain'd any other thought, but the fear of the common Fate of the Princes of his Blood, and who had carried himſelf ſo well, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sultan,</hi> as not to give him any juſt cauſe of Anger or Jealouſie, paid to <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Beauty, what was due to her from all tender Hearts. And <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelman,</hi> who ought to have reſted ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the amorous intrigues, which either his Inclination or good Fortune had procured him, look'd upon her with the ſame eyes as we did.</p>
               <p>I knew not for a long while their thoughts, and I was very careful to hide mine. <hi>Mahomet</hi> became melancholy; and for my part, I loved Solitude ſo much, that I could ſcarce caſt my eyes upon thoſe things which formerly had ſo much pleaſed me; we neglected our Warlike Exerciſes, we minded no more thoſe Pleaſures which we had been ſo deſirous of before, and Solitude was the only thing we ſought after: All admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105648:17"/>
forbidden to us, we were continually in the paſſages to it; where ever my Love guided me, I did meet there <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet: Muſſelman</hi> was happier than we, his Employ, whoſe Authority is almoſt unlimited, did give him acceſs where we could not go, and we may think he made uſe of his advantages.</p>
               <p>As I was uſed to ſpend moſt part of the day and night about thoſe places, which hide <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> from my ſight, I did ſometimes forget my ſelf there. One night I tarried ſo long in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Garden, which was next to that of the Women, that the Gates were ſhut up: All the <hi>Boſtangi</hi>'s had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, no body was up any longer in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> no light appeared there, and I was fain to ſtay there till day, after I had endeavoured to no purpoſe to get out towards the Sea.</p>
               <p>As I was withdrawing in a retired place, to ſpend there the reſt of the night, I ſaw a man croſſing the great Flower Garden, and marching towards me with all poſſible haſte: By avoiding him, I had confeſt my ſelf guilty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going towards him, I perceived it was the Emperour. <hi>What do you do here,</hi> Scanderberg, ſaid he to me, <hi>with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105648:18"/>
Countenance? being bred up in Our Palaces, and well inſtructed with our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, ought you to ſhew this Example of boldneſs to ſo many Perſons, who can make an ill uſe of it, and have you ſome ſecret deſign againſt my Reſt, my Life, or my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? I have nothing to ſay to thy High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for my Juſtification,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>and I appear guilty enough, to deſerve thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; but I muſt ſay this, that a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour is the cauſe of the fault for which thou blameſt me, and I ſwear I have tarryed here minding not the place where I was. You are ſo dear to me,</hi> reply'd the Emperour, <hi>that I am concern'd with all your ſorrows, and if you have any reaſon for any, not only I forgive you this fault, but ſhall do my endeavours to ſatisfie you. Thine Highneſs,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>is too kind, and ought not to trouble it ſelf about ſo ſmall trifles; the want of Employment is the cauſe of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and thy Highneſs, leaving nothing to do for us, makes my young Courage grumble at its being idle. You have done enough to deſire Peace, and enjoy ſome Reſt,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultan, but if your Valour wants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, I promiſe you ſome. Go home qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and expect from me ſuch Employments, as are worthy of a Hero, who intends to ſurpaſs all the</hi> Ottomans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:105648:18"/>
I made a very humble bow to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, glad I had pacify'd him, and went away as he directed me; but that Night was to bring forth other adventures. Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> brought there by the ſame motives as I, had been alſo ſhut in, and we ſaw him coming towards us, thinking we were ſome <hi>Boſtangi</hi>'s, or <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs: Is this a fit time for you to be here,</hi> ſaid the angry Emperour to him, <hi>and are you my Son, only to ſhew your ſelf unworthy of being ſo?</hi> The young Prince was ſtruck with theſe words, he ſaw me, and thought concerning me the ſame thing I did concerning him. <hi>I have ſinned againſt my own will, My Lord,</hi> anſwered he to the <hi>Sultan, but I proteſt to thy Highneſs I ſhall come hither no more.</hi> A third man who did ſteal behind the Hedge more ſlily than we had done, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s reply; he did go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Womens Lodgings, a place which had always ſeem'd ſuſpicious to <hi>Amurat,</hi> but chieſly now in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his new Paſſion; but his fear and vexation increaſed when he heard <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s fine voice, with which he was already acquainted, ſing theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105648:19"/>
                  <l>Go on, obſerve the Dictates of your Love,</l>
                  <l>The Favours of the ſhady night improve.</l>
                  <l>Suppreſs theſe ſighs which from diſorders flow,</l>
                  <l>And let your noble Flame yet higher grow,</l>
                  <l>Yield him your heart, his pleaſing rules obey,</l>
                  <l>Who is a God, and does direct your way.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> felt then all the powers of jealouſie, eſteeming that Song to be the ſignal: we were guilty all three, and never did an innocent Adventure afford greater cauſe of ſuſpicion to a paſſionate Lover: He ran to the third Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and knew him preſently to be <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> whom <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s voice had ſtopt.</p>
               <p>None of us was a contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and tho' <hi>Mahomet</hi> and I had ſome advantages above <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> by reaſon of our Youth, and natural parts, yet his Authority in the Gardens might be of a great uſe to a forward man. Tho' the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa</hi> had ſome priviledges and few ſet hours, yet <hi>Amurat</hi> thought him more guilty than us. <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> ſaid he to him, with that pride which is natural to all the <hi>Sultans, what brings</hi>

                  <hi>you hither at an hour, when no duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires your preſence? Was it to introduce you to the</hi> Sultaneſſes, <hi>that a Slave ſung juſt now, and do you leave your houſe only to come and trouble me in mine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſſelman</hi> was not amazed at this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding, he is Naturally bold, and anſwering without any commotion, <hi>I thought, my Lord,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I could not have too much Zeal for thine Highneſs, and that all the hours of the day and night, were free for my Loyalty; by thy Kindneſs I command in the Gardens, but I know how to ſtay in mine, as ſoon as I ſhall perceive that my Services are ſuſpected. I believe,</hi> ſaid the Emperor, <hi>I ſhall not be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle this Miſtery; I will moderate my own Temper, let us retire, and let us be more careful for the future:</hi> So we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> I don't queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but <hi>Muſſelman</hi> ſuſpected both the Prince's Love and mine. <hi>Amurat</hi> whom his reflect thoughts had brought to the Garden at that hour againſt his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, doubled the Guards towards the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women, and gave more ſevere orders to the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> which ſome faithfully obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aradin</hi> upbraided me the next day for my wandring: We concluded <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105648:20"/>
and <hi>Muſſelman</hi> were my Rivals, and hoping to cure me, he aſſured me the Emperour was deeply in Love with <hi>Arianiſſa:</hi> That Paſſion could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy mine, tho' it ruined all my hopes, I feared neither the Prince nor <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whoſe condition was not better than mine: But I ought to fear all things from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> whoſe inclinations were violent, and whoſe will nothing was able to reſiſt. I ſighed for this with <hi>Aradin,</hi> I became more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect before the Prince; and avoiding the Gardens, contented my ſelf with the Entertainment my Melancholy Thoughts enjoy'd upon the Sea Shoar.</p>
               <p>I underſtood one day, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was going to bathe with ſome <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> in a little Iſland, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople</hi> about an hours journey; he was uſed to take ſecretly ſuch Paſtimes, and then he would put off for a while all ſorts of Gravity; his Galley was ſo ſhut, that the <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> could neither ſee nor be ſeen; it was led by ſome <hi>Boſtangi's,</hi> and <hi>Muſſelman</hi> by vertue of his place was at the head of them, but that honour procured him no advantage, ſince he could ſee nothing but his <hi>Boſtangi's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:105648:20"/>
But my Jealouſie was ſo ſtrong, that I went all along the Sea a very great way from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and caſting my looks as far as they could reach, I ſaw ſomething over the water, carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the ſtream: I thought I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Vail, and believing it might be a Woman ready to be drowned, I threw my ſelf preſently into the water, and uſing my little Skill, I ſwam with all poſſible diligence, and took really into my Arms a woman, who was almoſt choak'd.</p>
               <p>I doubled my efforts to get to the Shore, and as ſoon as I was there, I perceived it was <hi>Arianiſſa:</hi> You may judge, Dear <hi>Thopia,</hi> what was my grief when I ſaw the only thing that was dear to me, in ſuch a lamentable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mercileſs Fate,</hi> cry'd I, <hi>ought you to have offered her to me in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? O fair, but unwiſe</hi> Arianiſſa, <hi>why did you ſeek your death, in ſo little important a Pleaſure?</hi> This tranſport of mine did not hinder me from aſſiſting her. I lifted her head, and bending a little the reſt of her body, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water ruſhed out of it, and within a ſhort while, ſhe recovered her Breath; this relief called again the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105648:21"/>
natural heat which ſeem'd to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken her, and drove away part of my Allarms, after a deep ſigh, ſhe open'd her Eyes, and ſeeing her ſelf alone with a man, having but a thin gown on, ſhe was willing to change her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. Knowing her Deſign, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to pleaſe her, I let her ſet down upon the Graſs, and ſeeing ſhe was able to underſtand me; <hi>Fair</hi> Arianiſſa, ſaid I, <hi>that Fate which hath expoſed your Life, hath been favourable to my Affection, but let not this adventure trouble you, ſince</hi> Scanderberg <hi>would ſooner loſe his Life, than his reſpect towards your Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arianiſſa ſighed twice or thrice, and was ſome while without anſwering me, but at laſt ſhe reply'd: <hi>Tho' my Life be not dear to me, My Lord, I am not the leſs beholding to you; if you had not been ſo generous, you had freed me from many Misfortunes; but you could not have gueſt my condition.</hi> I was as much moved with <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s words, as with her languiſhing Charms. <hi>I know not what Fate Heaven deſigns for you, but I ſhall think my ſelf happy for ever, ſince I have been ſerviceable to you; in another time, and under another Government, I ſhould take other meaſures, and ſhould not let you</hi>

                  <hi>know my Love, till my Services and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had ſufficiently demonſtrated it; and deſerved your conſent; but as things ſtand now, how is it poſſible to ſee you in a Palace, where we can have no admiſſion? and how can one ſpeak with you, ſince it is in vain to hope to come near you? I Love you, I am forced to acquaint you with it, and if this free Confeſſion renders me guilty, I ſhall never repine at my Puniſhment, I was the ſame before I had ſeen you, and I adored your Vertue, without knowing your Perſon. What Diſcourſe is this, My Lord,</hi> interrupted <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> with a charming Sweetneſs? <hi>Is this to try me? Do you conſider that I am a Slave, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Emperour of the</hi> Turks, <hi>loaded with Chains by</hi> Selimana, <hi>and who likely ſhall not ſee you any more in all her life time? as for your preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>it is an injury of Fortune, which may eaſily be repaired, and if you deſire to put an end to your Captivity, do but truſt me, and, follow me. What can you do, Scanderberg,</hi> cry'd that fair Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? <hi>You have Valour enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> Amurat<hi>'s Enemies, but you are not ſtrong enough to deliver me from his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raany.</hi>

we entered into <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Emperour was already returned, and we put an end to our Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> met <hi>Aradin</hi> who was looking for me, knowing what had paſt.

what ſhe was to ſuffer from the <hi>Sultan.</hi> Fair <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid he to her, all moments are here precious, and I ought not to neglect them. <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> famous for his Valour, and remarkable for his rare and great Qualities, (forgive me, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> if I uſe <hi>Aradin</hi>'s words, to avoid all digreſſions) <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> ſay I, kept far from you by a barbarous Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires you might know his Zea and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and to that purpoſe he is forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make uſe of this innocent means. Then the Eunuch offered her the Billet: But ſhe who knew not our intimate friendſhip thought he was come to try her. Theſe Intreagues are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Seraglio, anſwered ſhe; we might pay both dear enough for them; and your Maſter is not ſo kind a Prince as to permit them. Leave off therefore this Playing, which cannot but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me, and may prove fatal to your ſelf: And believe, that I care neither to love nor to be loved. You may ſuſpect me of Perfideouſneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Aradin,</hi> ſeeing it is ſo common among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and becauſe I am altogether unknown to you. But, <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa,</hi> do not entertain ſuch a thought concerning me; and do not wrong ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105648:25"/>
far the Prince <hi>Scanderberg;</hi> he loves you, and you cannot, but with a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty blame-worthy, deny him the favour to read what he writes to you. <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa,</hi> after a long reſiſtance, took at laſt the Paper, and kept her eyes fix'd upon it a conſiderable while; ſo that likely ſhe read it more than once. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi> obſerved her, and told me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that he had perceiv'd in her looks a trouble which favoured me, that ſhe had ſighed, and ſeem'd to feel ſome tender motions in her heart; and conſidering her and my own condition, ſhe had ſaid, alas, <hi>Aradin,</hi> what can the Prince <hi>Scanderberg</hi> expect from me, who can diſpoſe of nothing, and find my ſelf bound in that unfortunate place where my ill Fortune detains me? All his deſire, replyed <hi>Aradin,</hi> is, you would permit him to love you, and that your kindneſs might be concerned in all his misfortunes. Suppoſe I ſhould do what he deſires, added <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> would his condition be the happier? Bid him, ſooner forget me, and if he finds in me any thing that deſerves his affection, let him conſider, that all ſorts of Converſation is forbidden us; let him take care, not to attempt any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105648:25"/>
enterprize that may either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do him or endanger my ſelf; let him be careful chiefly of his own life. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa,</hi> interrupted <hi>Aradin,</hi> is your heart ſo much concerned for his life as to deſire its preſervation? Ask me no ſuch queſtions, replyed the fair Slave bluſhing, and do only what I bid you. <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid the officious <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> one word from your hand would do more with him than any thing I can tell him. You ask for too much, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> and you know your ſelf, I ought not to do what you deſire; that all things are dangerous here, and that very often the moſt ſecret Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons become publick. I tremble even now for reaſon of this converſation; be gone, <hi>Aradin,</hi> and leave me to my dreadful ſorrow. I leave you to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s love, replyed <hi>Aradin.</hi> Cruel misfortune of my Life, and cauſe of all my Miſeries, cryed <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> how dearly have I paid for that love which I abhor? and what ſorrows I am like to ſuffer upon its account? Some body coming, obliged them to part. <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi> kept my Letter, and <hi>Aradin</hi> came to me to acquaint me with what had paſs'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:105648:26"/>
The Emperour's love was too violent not to be followed by an extraordinary jealouſie; his ſuſpicious increaſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively; and conſidering <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s coldneſs, he thought that either her heart was not free when ſhe came to the Seraglio, or that ſince ſhe had fallen in love. His meeting me in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, my good fortune upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar, and my deep melancholy, which I was no more able to hide, rais'd great ſuſpicions in his mind. And though my condition was but little different from <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s, or the Prince's, yet I ſeem'd to him more formidable than they, by reaſon of my good Fortune: He obſerv'd carefully all my ſteps, took notice of my Eyes, which were always turned towards the Seraglio, explained to himſelf the meaning of my troubles, and of my Sighs; and in a word, did not queſtion but I was in love. You may eaſily conjecture whether it was an eaſie matter for me to attempt any thing, being watch'd by ſuch an <hi>Argus. Aradin,</hi> who perceived his jealouſie, was continually adviſing me how I ought to ſteer my Conduct, and in this uneaſie condition I ſpent many ſad and uſeleſs days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105648:26"/>
But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> I was not the only Man who was troubled. <hi>Muſulman</hi> loved exceedingly <hi>Arianiſſa:</hi> The ſame Paſſion wholly poſſeſs'd <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and <hi>Selimana</hi> being forſaken by the Emperor, began to be ſenſible of the injury done her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thought the only way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, was to get a new Lover.</p>
               <p>There is always a prodigious number of Eunuchs in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whoſe duty is to obſerve the Sultaneſſes, and to ſerve them, and thoſe are pickt out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the uglieſt. <hi>Selimana</hi>'s favour had gained her the zeal of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of them: <hi>Amaldan</hi> had always ſtuck to her intereſt; and ſince <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi>'s new Paſſion gave her time to mind her own, ſhe manag'd ſo well the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch's Zeal, that he was willing to do her any Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amaldan</hi> was about forty years old, he was black and ugly, but witty and bold, and in a word, a fit Confident to ſerve <hi>Selimana:</hi> It had look'd a little odd, if he had acquainted me without any more ado with <hi>Selimana</hi>'s tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. She knew not what the Prince and I had heard, and therefore ſhe could make no uſe of that Adventure; had ſhe directly written to me, it was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105648:27"/>
likely my Heart had not been pleaſd with that freedom; ſhe therefore whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relyed upon <hi>Amaldan</hi>'s wit: Having been bred up a Schollar, he underſtood Greek perfectly well, and was well nough acquainted with the niceties of Poetry; he thought therefore his beſt way at firſt, was to ſhew me ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Verſes; and having made ſome fit for his purpoſe, he accoſted me upon a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs in the great <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s Gardens where, in a melancholly Humour, I was looking upon the Stream that water'd the foot of the Walls. Who could believe, my Lord, ſaid he to me, that a Prince of your Age and Parts would ſeek ſolitary places without being in love? Was your Heart free, you would not ſhun with ſo much care other Men's Converſation. I beg your pardon, my Lord, for my boldneſs; but your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bounty will excuſe this freedom, which is not ordinarily uſed towards Perſons of your rank, but in whatever condition you are, either free, or not, thoſe that honour you as much as I do, ought to do always their endeavours to divert you. I bluſhed, hearing <hi>Amaldan,</hi> ſpeak thus, fearing leſt he ſhould ſuſpect ſomething. My Lord, ſaid he then, one
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105648:27"/>
does not bluſh except he hath ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, and this commotion proceeds likely from your Heart. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piercing too far into a Secret which I ought to reverence, give me leave to conſult you upon a nice point. And then he offered me ſome Verſes, which I could not deny to read, and which I remember yet, they were thoſe:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Love, like a dangerous Tyrant ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</l>
                  <l>His fancy'd Laws ſound harſh to tender Ears.</l>
                  <l>Women, if fair, we muſt avoid, they ſay,</l>
                  <l>Like fatal Rocks at Sea, which oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</l>
                  <l>Such feign'd Advice puts out the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire,</l>
                  <l>And turns the edge of ev'ry brisk De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</l>
                  <l>The Fears of Shipwraek thro' the fancy rove,</l>
                  <l>And fright the Youth from off the Seas of Love.</l>
                  <l>But when he ſees the way before him's clear,</l>
                  <l>When he is choſe and loved, what needs he fear?</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105648:28"/>
If he would then enjoy a happy State,</l>
                  <l>He muſt give up his yielding Heart to Fate:</l>
                  <l>When he is Conqueror own'd, then Arms are vain;</l>
                  <l>To uſe the Conqueſt is the ſweeteſt gain.</l>
                  <l>The greater then his Zeal does prove,</l>
                  <l>The more's the glory of his Love.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I lik'd them well enough, and I read them more than once; but I never ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the meaning of them. <hi>Amaldan</hi> was glad I was pleaſed with them, and thought it was now time for him to truſt me with his Secret. Is it not true, my Lord, that Love is commonly drawn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtrange manner? and that, if we will hearken to the Wits, it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monſter, which ought carefully to be avoided? I confeſs, it appears un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant to thoſe that have nothing that renders them worthy to be beloved; but I imagine thouſands of Charms in the ſincere and tender love of two Hearts. I muſt confeſs, ſaid I to <hi>Amaldan,</hi> that your Verſes and your Opinion ſeem to me to be in the right; but I am ſo little verſed in Love Matters, that I am no competent Judge of its Effects. My Lord, reply'd the Eunuch, when you
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105648:28"/>
pleaſe you may be a great proficient therein, and I know a certain way for that purpoſe. I cannot diſſemble with a Prince, as diſcreet as you are. I'll tell you therefore, you are loved by <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana, Amurat</hi>'s beloved Sultaneſs; ſhe acquaints you, what way it is beſt for you to follow, by her order I ſpeak to you, and you ought not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at the <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s Maximes, ſince I can overcome the greateſt Difficulties. I did not expect ſuch a Complement from <hi>Amaldan,</hi> which did not anſwer my Inclinations, and I was a little while without anſwering him. You bring your ſelf into no danger by your freedom, ſaid I at laſt to him. I take it for a token of your Eſteem and Friendſhip, nor am I willing to make an ill uſe of it. <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana</hi> may be fair and kind, but <hi>Amurat</hi> is a formidable Prince, and my Loyalty obliges me to all ſorts of reſpects. You don't ſpeak, reply'd the Eunuch ſmiling, like a young Prince favour'd by Love, but like a fearful Politician, or a moroſe Philoſopher. This modeſty which ought to be praiſed in a Derviſe, ſeems to me in you the ſtrangeſt things in the world; what can all <hi>Amurat</hi>'s power do, ſince your beloved <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s Pleaſures
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105648:29"/>
eaſily obtained, loſe much of their ſweetneſs? Beſides, was I not certain to ſerve you, I am not ſo much out of love with my own life, as to expoſe my ſelf to an unavoidable Death: Let me then be your Guide, and truſt me with the carrying on of your Intregue. All <hi>Amaldan</hi>'s fair words could not perſuade me to it. I was not willing to expoſe my ſelf to ſo many Dangers for <hi>Selima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s ſake, and I alledged ſtill in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, Cuſtom, and my Loyalty to the Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amaldan</hi> did not acquaint the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the unhappy iſſue of his firſt Negotiation, leſt he ſhould drive her into Deſpair; her hatred againſt <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> increaſed, as his love for <hi>Arianiſſa;</hi> ſhe was capable of any violent Action, had not <hi>Amaldan</hi> allay'd her Rage.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſeem'd to act nothing, and <hi>Muſulman,</hi> whoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were very ſecret, had nevertheleſs ſome private Intelligences, and gain'd ſome Friends in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo natural to the <hi>Turks,</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt often makes void the ſeverity of their Laws. <hi>Boſtangi Baſſi</hi> being a rich Man, gained by his liberality almoſt all the Eunuchs; and except <hi>Aradin</hi> whoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105648:29"/>
Honeſty was proof againſt all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the reſt yielded eaſily to his Gold; having a free occaſion in the Gardens, he could freely Converſe with them; he intruſted the cunning <hi>Amaldan</hi> with his Paſſion for <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi> Another had been ſtarted at this Propoſition. But <hi>Amaldan</hi> harken'd to it without the leaſt Commotion, and his exaggerating to the grand Gardner, the difficulties they ſhould meet with, was only to ſet an higher value upon his Services.</p>
               <p>You may judge, <hi>Thopia,</hi> thereby, how Pernicious is idleneſs; had the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> a different Employment from that of obſerving the Women in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> they ſhould never apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to barter their Favours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amaldan,</hi> who knew <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to perceive her good Nature, feared not in the leaſt to be puniſhed by her for his boldneſs. He did <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman</hi>'s Errant, as <hi>Aradin</hi> had done mine, and repreſented the <hi>Boſtangi Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſi</hi>'s Paſſion to her, as the only way to free her from her ſlavery; ſhe did not entertain him as ſhe had done <hi>Aradin,</hi> but with a Noble Pride, ſhe let him underſtand that it was in vain for the grand Gardner to hope any thing from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105648:30"/>
her. The covetous <hi>Amaldan</hi> was little troubled at this, and was not ſuch a Fool as to diſcourage any body, as long as he could obtain his Ends. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in ſpight of my ſelf, to bring me one Night into <hi>Selimana</hi>'s compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and little ſolicitous of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Fortune, ſo he might ſatisfie himſelf. He truſted <hi>Muſulman</hi> with this Secret. He told him that if he could bring me into the private Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, for himſelf, he would get <hi>Selima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> to take a walk, which might be favourable to us, making the grand Gardner believe, that I was in love with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and that fear only hindred me from courting her. <hi>Muſulman,</hi> who had ſuſpected I loved <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> was glad to underſtand this Miſtery, and promiſed to do whatever <hi>Amaldan</hi> deſired.</p>
               <p>The grand Gardner was well enough acquainted with the Maxims of the Country; the effects of which he ought to fear, but his Love prevailed over his Reaſon. He found me out, as he had promiſed to <hi>Amaldan,</hi> and asked me, whether I was willing to walk. I could not gueſs his intentions, and tho' <hi>I</hi> looked upon him as my Rival, yet, at laſt <hi>I</hi> followed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:105648:30"/>
We took many turns in the <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s Garden, and the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſi,</hi> who was well acquainted with all the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, brought me into that of the Women, through a door which we found open'd; <hi>I</hi> was not ſenſible at firſt of my wandring, but coming near a labyrinth, which <hi>I</hi> had not ſeen ſince my Infancy. <hi>I</hi> was ſurpriſed to ſee my ſelf in that place. <hi>You are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or you have a mind to ruine me,</hi> ſaid <hi>I</hi> to <hi>Muſulman, and theſe places are not free for ſuch perſons as we. Do you think I am capable of betraying you?</hi> Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Muſulman, and do you believe I ſhall not ſhare here the ſame Fortune with you? Your preſence is deſired by</hi> Selimana, <hi>and her kindneſs will protect you.</hi> As I was going to anſwer, diſpleaſed with his proceedings, we ſaw Prince <hi>Mahomet</hi> coming, who had no more priviledge than we, and who was not there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Deſign. He was as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed as we. We could not think but we were guilty all three; yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would have us hide our Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had we had a mind to fall out, we had been hindered by <hi>Abaci</hi> the Eunuch, who had introduced the young <hi>Sultan,</hi> and who knew nothing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105648:31"/>
of our being there. My Lord, <hi>ſaid he to him, loud enough to be heard by us Arianiſſa</hi> is coming, make uſe of ſu<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> from <hi>Selimana,</hi> came. Tho' Night de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of the ſight of her Charms, yet by reaſon of its favourable ſilence we could the better hear her ſight. <hi>Muſulman</hi> curbed by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s preſence did not enjoy the happineſs he hoped for. And the Prince in a maze by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Abaci</hi>'s diſcourſe, tarried in the ſame place. For my part, I was alſo put to a ſtand. <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> ſat her ſelf down upon the graſs, and thinking ſhe was heard by no body, ſhe let go theſe ſad Complaints. Unfortunate <hi>Arianiſſa, ſaid ſhe,</hi> Princeſs expos'd to ever laſting Sufferings, what canſt thou expect from <hi>Amurat?</hi> What canſt thou do for <hi>Scanderberg?</hi> Did Cruel Fate take thee from <hi>Albania,</hi> to offer him here too Charming for thy Reſt? <hi>Caſtriot,</hi> why don't you ask all the Princes of the World ſome Succour, to deliver ſuch an Illuſtrious Son from thoſe Hands, who likely, for a Reward of his Glorious Exploits, will one day ſacrifice him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105648:31"/>
Theſe <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s words made a deep impreſſion upon both our Hearts. But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> thoſe two Rivals were not the only I ought to fear, a third more formidable heard them. <hi>Amurat</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by ſome Traytor, that <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> were in the Garden, was ſurpriſed at it, becauſe they were not uſed to go there, running there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all poſſible haſte, he heard what I have already told you. Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Arianiſſa, cryed he in a jealous rage,</hi> thou telleſt every moment I ſee thee, and tho' thou haſt my moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affections, yet wiſheſt thou my Ruine. Thy imprudent Heart hath condemned <hi>Scanderberg</hi> to dye, and I will puniſh him for having pleaſed thee, as I ought to do. I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thy Anger, <hi>replyed the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Arianiſſa,</hi> and I am ſo far from pacifying it, that I confirm to thee what thou haſt already heard by chance. A Power above thine will defend that Prince thou intendeſt to Oppreſs, and for my part, I ſhall be pleaſed better with Death than with thy Love.</p>
               <p>About that time, <hi>Thopia,</hi> did the Emperor perceive us. I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Rage to you. His Son, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105648:32"/>
                  <hi>Muſulmon</hi> ſuffered but little by it. It fell heavy only upon me. Take away that Slave, ſaid he, to a great many <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and be reſponſible of the leaſt of her Actions: and for thee, <hi>ſaid he, turning towards me,</hi> Knave, and perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> unworthy Object of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Favours, and the fatal cauſe of all his preſent grief, go, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a death as thou deſerveſt. If thine Injuries proceeds from thy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>anſwered I,</hi> I forgive them upon that account, becauſe that Paſſion is uſed to blind our Reaſon. Think of my moderation what thou pleaſet, but know, that had any other Man ſpoke to me after this manner, beſides thee, he ſhould not eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>The proud Emperor harkned no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me. He commanded I ſhould be ſhut up in the dreadfulleſt Priſon, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by what he had heard, <hi>I</hi> entertain'd ſome ſecret Correſpondence with <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa.</hi> As for <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Muſulman,</hi> he ſhew'd them only an angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, without Arreſting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimana</hi> ran away hearing this noiſe, and <hi>Amaldan</hi> was not ſuch a Fool as to come and ſhew his Face. As ſoon as we were out of the Gardens, <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:105648:32"/>
threatned the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and ſtruck Terror every where. He ſent the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of his <hi>Seraglio</hi> to obſerve the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch a vaſt number of them was placed in <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Appartment, that all admiſſion there became impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> was ſhut up in a Dungeon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing <hi>Aradin,</hi> whom my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was like to caſt into a deſpair.

Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill his wonted freedom, he made uſe of it, he ſaw <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> in ſpight of all her Obſervers, comforted her, and obliged her to write to me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her with my deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. She did not queſtion in the leaſt,

               <p>Having read this Letter, <hi>I</hi> was no longer ſenſible of the heavineſs of my Chains. <hi>I</hi> enjoyed my hearts deſire. <hi>I</hi> was beloved of <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> born of one of the moſt Illuſtrious Families in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania. I</hi> knew <hi>Aranit</hi>'s name, and tho'
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105648:33"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> had but a feeble Idea of my Father's Court, yet <hi>I</hi> could remember him. It was quite impoſſible for me to anſwer <hi>Ariantſſa</hi>'s Note. And all that <hi>I</hi> could do was to read it over a thouſand times a day.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> Fortune, which intended to croſs me, afflicted me ſtill with new msifortunes. <hi>I</hi> learnt from that man whom <hi>Aradin</hi> had diſpoſed to favour me, that my Father was dead, that <hi>Amurat</hi> was incenſed againſt me, and to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, had poiſoned my three Brothers, deſigning me for another Sacrifice; but altho' he was violent to exceſs; he durſt not deſtroy me, in the Preſence of the Turkiſh Souldiers, by whom <hi>I</hi> was loved, and who began to grumble at my Captivity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Cruelty produced in my heart that effect which could be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected; yet <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, to juſtifie my reſentments, that <hi>I</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver projected any Deſign againſt him, unworthy of a Man of Courage; all that <hi>I</hi> deſired, was to ſee my ſelf free, and to declare an open War againſt the proud <hi>Sultan,</hi> who regarded ſo little the Blood <hi>I</hi> had loſt in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:105648:34"/>
Whilſt I was thus griev'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, both by Nature and Love, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had ſeen me venture my life for their Emperour's Glory, pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Fate, and demanded my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Amurat</hi> deſired my death, but feared the conſequences thereof, and therefore was obliged by reaſon of the Grumbling of the Nation, to put an end to my Captivity.</p>
               <p>Going out of Priſon, I retired to <hi>Acomat,</hi> a young <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and the only Man amongſt the Turks, upon whoſe Friendſhip I did moſt rely. I met there with a generous reception; he approved my Reſentment, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to go my ſelf, and upbraid the <hi>Sultan</hi> for his ungratefulneſs. But I could not abide his ſight, I could not think without horror on my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death. My Mother's ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the miſerable Life the young Princeſſes my Siſters lead in ſome retired place of <hi>Albania.</hi> I heard before it was long, the violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Emperor's Tyranny; I had a true Relation thereof from <hi>Aradin,</hi> whom I ſaw by <hi>Acomat</hi>'s means, he aſſured me alſo of <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards me, and added, that tho'
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105648:34"/>
the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Rage had not fall'n ſo heavy upon <hi>Mahomet</hi> or <hi>Muſulman</hi> as upon me, yet they had ſmarted for his Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>Tho' I was fully at liberty, I did not know what to reſolve. <hi>Amurat</hi> had poſſeſs'd himſelf of all my Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the only thing I could own, was my Sword; after a long Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with <hi>Acomat</hi> and <hi>Aradin,</hi> at laſt I intended to depart, tho' I felt a great reluctancy in leaving <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' I had conceived a mortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt <hi>Amurat,</hi> yet I reſolved to ſpeak to him. I met him one day, as he was going out of the <hi>Divan.</hi> He had been vexed at ſome important deliberation there, and diſpleaſed with <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s continual rigour, ſo that one could eaſily read his Rage in his Eyes. <hi>I thought,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you ſhould make a better uſe of the Liberty I grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you at</hi> Adrianople, <hi>than to offer your ſelf to my preſence, and that your remorſe ſhould free me from the ſight of ſuch an odious Object.</hi> This Diſcourſe, like the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Pride, was too outragious to me, to be born patiently. <hi>If thine ungrateful Eyes had never ſeen me,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, <hi>it is likely you had paid dear</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:105648:35"/>
                  <hi>enough for it. You are no longer an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage,</hi> interrupted the unjuſt <hi>Amurat, but a Captive, of whom the</hi> Janiſſaries, <hi>are to be reſponſible. If thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Hoſtages as ſacred,</hi> replyed I, <hi>thou hadſt never poiſon'd my Brothers, and nothing can hide the Horror of this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous action from Poſterity. I pity thy young age,</hi> replyed the Sultan, with a ſcornful ſmile, <hi>and the trouble thou takeſt of deſcribing my Actions, deſerves a fit Reward; get far from me and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa, <hi>and repent of having offended me. I ſwear to thee by our moſt Holy Laws, I ſhall never call thee back again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he left me ſpightfully. I ſaw preſently, that it was now time for me to depart, and to perform for my own Family, and that of <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> what Honour required from me; it was impoſſible for me to ſee that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Beauty, whom <hi>I</hi> recommended a thouſand times to the care of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate <hi>Aradin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurat,</hi> to cloak his injuſtice, and not to diſoblige the <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> who had declared themſelves my Protectors, offered me by <hi>Orcan,</hi> his Favourite, and already Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> in the room of the deceaſed <hi>Herſecoli,</hi> the Command
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105648:35"/>
of ſome Forces, which he kept in the entrance of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſent me word, to tarry there for his Orders, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>I</hi> ſhould never attempt any thing againſt him, ſince all the Garriſons in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Albania</hi> were filled up with <hi>Turks. Aradin</hi> did not queſtion but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat's</hi> deſign was to ſhut me up in ſome remote Fortreſs. <hi>Croya</hi> it ſelf ſeemed well affected for him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Efforts of the Princes Loyal to our Intereſt.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſeeming to accept of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s proffer, Fortune procured me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſeeing <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> once more.</p>
               <p>There happenned one night a fire in the <hi>Seraglio, Muſulman</hi> was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Author of it. It increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much, that it caſt all <hi>Adrianople</hi> into a great Conſternation. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the Women began to burn, and the like Confuſion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen; they laboured but in vain to put it out in the Emperor's preſence, who encouraged thoſe that laboured; all the Water of the Sea, Channels, and Rivers, had never been able to ſave <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> had I not ſhewed my ſelf more eager, and more Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:105648:36"/>
You may judge how much I was affrighted at this Accident, and with what haſte I ran to aſſiſt her. All the <hi>Janiſſaries, Spahis,</hi> and other Souldiers, and all the Officers of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were buſied in quenching the Flame, but durſt not venture any farther to ſave the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men threatned with a cruel Death. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi>'s fair Promiſes were in vain, fear rendred them all deaf to his words, and I was the only Man whom Love emboldened; I ran upon high Piles of burning Cinders to the Gallery, where the Women with the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> expected their laſt hour. And moſt part of them did cry after a ſtrange rate, for fear of Death. <hi>Selimana</hi> her ſelf looked very pale and fearful. But <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſtill her mageſtick and ſerene Countenance, and look'd upon death without the leaſt Commotion. As ſoon as <hi>Selimana</hi> perceived me, ſhe came to truſt her ſelf into my arms, but ſhe found them not opened. <hi>Aradin, ſaid</hi> I <hi>to the Eunuch who had followed me,</hi> ſave the beloved <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> whilſt I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do the ſame to ſome more expoſed Perſon; he took her away, and I ran to <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> who had obſerved my behaviour, and I carried her away
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105648:36"/>
eaſily; reproaching the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> with their weakneſs, and exhorting them to do the ſame to the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Muſulman,</hi> who had ſeen me going into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> were aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtay idle, and not follow my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but I was more diligent than they, and brought <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> into a ſafe place. I paſs'd ſlily towards the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to converſe with her in Secret, whil'ſt the faithful <hi>Aradin</hi> carried <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana</hi> into another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> was almoſt choaked with the ſmoak, and tho' ſhe had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a purer Air, yet ſhe could not ſuddenly recover her loſt Speech; I had alſo ſuffered much by it, and all my Cloths were ſpoiled; but the pleaſure of being with <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to reflect on ſuch an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs. I think, my Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me, when ſhe was a little recovered,</hi> that Heaven had deſign'd you for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of my Life; for as often as it is threatned with a danger, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your own to ſecure it. How for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſhould I eſteem my ſelf, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg,</hi> if I could acquit my ſelf of thoſe great Obligations. Tho' you prolong but an unfortunate Life, yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105648:37"/>
that do's not leſſen the dangers, to which you expoſe your ſelf. Madam, interrupted I, had I done a thouſand times more, you ſhould not be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the leaſt to me, your dangers are mine own, and acting for your Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I promote my own reſt. Alas! <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> let not your kindneſs buſie it ſelf in taking notice of ſuch ſmall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; but conſider rather, how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous your abſence will prove to me, you know <hi>Amurat</hi>'s barbarous proceedings towards our Family; my Mother ſtript of all her Eſtate and Dignity, leads an uncomfortable life, in ſome corner of <hi>Albania,</hi> with her Daughters, and the illuſtrious <hi>Aranit,</hi> that Prince your worthy Progenitor, is forced to ſubmit to a Foreign Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> was ſenſibly moved at my Diſcourſe, and her Tears teſtified it. Go, my Lord, into <hi>Albania,</hi> anſwered ſhe ſadly to me, revenge your Royal Blood, deliver thoſe great Princeſſes, whoſe only comfort you are, poſſeſs your ſelf of <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s Throne, protect <hi>Aranit,</hi> and never forget <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi> If you were willing, Madam, replied I, I ſhould not fly alone. Alas! my Lord, anſwered ſhe, I could follow you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105648:37"/>
repugnancy, was it poſſible for you to take me from hence; but ſuch an attempt can never ſucceed well here at <hi>Andrinople.</hi> To prevent thoſe Griefs and Alarms which abſence might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in you, I paſs my word to you, I ſhall reſiſt the Emperour; let him pray or threaten, 'tis all one. I embraced then <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Knees, and could not refrain Tears. I ſwore an inviolable Conſtancy to her, and I bade her Adieu for the laſt time, I went away accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Command, for fear of being ſurprized with her.</p>
               <p>I went to <hi>Aradin,</hi> and to <hi>Baſſa Acomat,</hi> and I acquainted them with what had paſs'd: The fire was put out, the <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> ſhut up again, and <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> more cloſely than the reſt: At laſt I departed from <hi>Andrinople,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending my Amorous concerns to <hi>Aradin;</hi> and inſtead of going to the place appointed to me by <hi>Amurat,</hi> I entered <hi>Albania</hi> with three hundred men, who came over to my party: There I performed thoſe happy Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have amazed the whole world; I turned the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power out of <hi>Croya,</hi> and other places of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> where I was proclaimed King:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105648:38"/>
the Valiant <hi>Aradin,</hi> Loyal to Our Blood, and concerned for his dear <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> did for me all that I could expect from an affectionate Father. <hi>Vranus,</hi> Illuſtrious both for his Birth and Merit, ſtuck very cloſe to me, I did not enjoy the pleaſure of ſeeing my Mother again, who was dead for grief, ſhe had given three Illuſtrious Husbands to three of my Siſters, and <hi>Amiſſa</hi> only was not marry'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurat</hi> fell into a rage, as ſoon as he heard my advantages, and ſaw himſelf deprived in few days of a great number of fine Provinces. He ſent a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army to regain them. But firſt I defeated <hi>Sebaſia,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Alibeg,</hi> who commanded fourty thouſand Men. After this, I won an immortal Fame in <hi>Varna</hi>'s Battel: <hi>Amurat</hi> wrote to me like a Maſter, and <hi>I</hi> anſwer'd him like a King, who deſpiſed him. In one word, without mentioning all other paſſages, <hi>Amurat</hi> came in perſon, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a numberleſs Army, after <hi>I</hi> had defeated <hi>Muſtapha</hi> his <hi>Baſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could never learn ſince <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s condition, tho' I have done all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to be inſtructed by thoſe <hi>Turks,</hi> who are faln into our hands, becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105648:38"/>
they know but little what <hi>Amurat</hi> does. I have been told only, that ſhe is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtill, that <hi>Muſulman</hi> is diſgraced, and abſent, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> does not well agree with his Father. You know, <hi>Thopia,</hi> what has paſt ſince we ſaw <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> about <hi>Croya,</hi> and by my laſt cruel adventure you may judge of my grief.</p>
               <p>Here the King of <hi>Albania</hi> made an end of his Diſcourſe, and ſighed after ſuch a manner, that <hi>Thopia,</hi> who really loved him, could not but pity him. <hi>Scanderberg</hi> was not concerned alone for <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s misfortunes. <hi>Aranit,</hi> her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, had been extreamly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her Captivity, and coming to ſee <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> he heard the cauſe of his extraordinary ſadneſs. We muſt all die, my Lord, ſaid he to <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Father; but before we die, let us render our Arms formidable to <hi>Amurat,</hi> let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn on him that terrour he ſtrikes into our hearts, and let whole Torrents of Turkiſh blood waſh off the Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the innocent <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> was not able to go on. <hi>Thopia</hi> informed Prince <hi>Aranit,</hi> what was the reaſon of his cruel rage, he was amazed at it, but could not believe what he feared was true. My Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:105648:39"/>

If our Subjects deſire to ſee a glorious Battel, let them come to this.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thopia</hi> obey'd the King's Orders, and within a ſhort time <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was filled with Perſons of Quality, who were ready to ſignalize their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſeeing him reſolved to attack the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Retrenchments in what time and poſture ſoever. <hi>Thopia's,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105648:39"/>
Commotion did not differ much from that of <hi>Scanderberg.</hi> And <hi>Aranit</hi> in ſpight of Age ſhew'd all the vigour deſired in a man of younger years. The famous <hi>Ducagins,</hi> the renowned <hi>Spani, Duſmani, Zacharia, Cernoniqui,</hi> and many others appeared at the head of their <hi>Albanian Forces:</hi> The orders having been given every where, the invincible <hi>Scanderberg</hi> appeared at the head of his Army wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black Feathers; there was to be ſeen ſuch a mixture of grief and pride in his Eyes, that his ſight would move ſome to pity, and ſtrike terror into Others. Having caſt his looks upon his Forces, and having obſerved the conſtancy, which appeared in the leaſt of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Arianiſſa, ſaid he, ſighing,</hi> your precious blood will be expiated by that of your barbarous murthers.

               <p>The Scouts of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Camp ſoon diſcovered <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s March, and brought word to <hi>Amurat.</hi> He was well experienced in Warlike Matters, and knew well what he ought to do, <hi>Orcan</hi> brought his orders to the reſt of his Officers. Every one went where his preſence was required, and <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> hating <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> and deſiring to keep in his Fathers favour, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the readieſt, and the willingeſt to fight. <hi>Aconot,</hi> the King of <hi>Albania</hi>'s generous Friend, did not go there to fight againſt him. There was as many Souldiers left in the Camp, as were neceſſary to ſecure it, and all the other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105648:40"/>
Forces, which were to encounter <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi> went out.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he perceived their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, he ſent forth a Cry, which was anſwered by all his Men; and with a threatning Look, and naked Sword, he went to meet the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> who had ſeen him van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh ſo often, trembled at his firſt ſight. <hi>Amurat</hi> himſelf, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Pride and Cruelty, was much concerned. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> jealous of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi>'s Glory, and of the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he had above him, aſpired to an immortal Fame by killing him. And <hi>Orcan,</hi> deſiring to keep to himſelf the Sultan's favour, wiſhed nothing ſo much as to ſacrifice that Illuſtrious Victim to his Maſter's reſentment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> ſpared no body in his firſt tranſport; even <hi>Amurat,</hi> whoſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had reſpected till then, had felt himſelf the ſtrength of his Arm, had he not been encompaſs'd by a crowd of <hi>Turks.</hi> How formidable is a valiant Man, when Love and Revenge encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to fight! What abundance of Blood was ſpilt in few moments! What vaſt number of <hi>Turks</hi> did the King of <hi>Albania</hi> kill? And how many
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105648:41"/>
fine Exploits were that day, performed by his Friends? <hi>Aranit</hi> was not at all ſenſible of his old Age; and the young <hi>Thopia</hi> let the <hi>Ottomans</hi> know there was more than one Hero in <hi>Albania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had already defeated <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Van-guard, took his Standards, made Priſoners many of his Captains, and Victory did already begin to incline on <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s ſide, when Night put an end to their Fighting, tho' the Quarrel was not fully decided. <hi>Scanderberg</hi> would have purſued the <hi>Turks,</hi> but the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs became ſo thick he was fain to ſtay till to Morrow.</p>
               <p>After the Lights had been kindled, as <hi>Scanderberg</hi> was going to enjoy a little reſt, there was a kind of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſeen; his Semitar had cleaved ſo faſt to his hand in the heat of the Fight, that it could not be pluck'd off but with extraordinary pains: This was taken for an aſſured ſign of his Strength and Valour.</p>
               <p>His firſt care was to enquire about <hi>Aranit,</hi> who was no more to be ſeen, he was ſought for to no purpoſe; and <hi>Scanderberg</hi> feared either he was dead or taken: He was thinking upon this when he perceived <hi>Acomat</hi> coming,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105648:41"/>
who to ſee him, had revolted in the dead of the Night to his Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> embraced him with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtations of joy; and the generous <hi>Turk</hi> received his Careſſes with all ſorts of reſpect. My dear <hi>Acomat,</hi> ſaid the amorous <hi>Scanderberg</hi> to him, do you come to confirm <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s death, or to reproach me with my weakneſs. No, my Lord, replyed <hi>Acomat,</hi> I do not bring you ſo ſad news. <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> is ſtill alive in the Sultan's Camp. You have a mind, ſaid the King of <hi>Albania,</hi> to deceive my grief. I have ſeen <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Command, replyed <hi>Acomat;</hi> and then he ſhew'd him the Paper found upon <hi>Aradin,</hi> whoſe unfortunate Fate he acquainted him with. I took that faithful Eunuch to be with you, my Lord, and he left <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Camp, only to paſs into yours. But without doubt, <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> who hides himſelf not far from hence, had kill'd him. As for <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſhe is alive, and you may rely upon my word for that.</p>
               <p>One cannot expreſs how much then was <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s joy. <hi>Aranit</hi> was ſought after; but ſome Souldiers ſaid, they thought he had been made Priſoner,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105648:42"/>
having ſeen him venture too far among the Turks.</p>
               <p>They took that night the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient meaſures for their ſafety, tho' it was not likely that <hi>Amurat,</hi> half van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, would come again to a Battel; there were Sentinels plac'd every where, and the news of <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Life were brought to <hi>Croya. Scanderberg</hi> enjoy'd more reſt that night than uſually; at break of Day they viſited all the Corps, but could never find <hi>Aranit</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> was reſolved to fulfill his Victory, and to free <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> and her Father from his Enemies. <hi>Acomat</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him <hi>Amurat</hi> expected a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuccour. <hi>Scanderberg</hi> was but little alarm'd with this; and the hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> prevail'd more upon his mind than any other conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aranit</hi>'s Captivity was ſoon confirmed; and there were news brought to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi>'s Camp that <hi>Amurat</hi> had more rejoyced at it than at the gaining of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Battels, having now in his power what to affright <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> with: That fair Princeſs had ſuffered a thouſand ſorrows ſince <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s departure; and the Emperour's violent deſires could not have been reſiſted but by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105648:42"/>
Virtue, ſuch as hers: But all her paſs'd ſufferings were but ſlight, compar'd with her affliction for her Father's Captivity. <hi>Amurat</hi> ſent for him; and <hi>Aranit,</hi> who had not ſeen <hi>Acomat,</hi> and was not acquainted with <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s condition, look'd extreamly ſad. Thou art vanquiſh'd and ſubdu'd to our Power, ſaid the Sultan to him, and notwithſtanding all the pride of thy Family, thou muſt ſtoop before us. Thou needs not thank Fortune, reply'd <hi>Aranit,</hi> which hath delivered into thy hands an unfortunate Victim, and which longs to be ſacrificed: So many great Men as ſtill remain in our Party, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s Conduct will find thee work enough. Tho' they have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed us, replyed <hi>Amurat,</hi> yet thou may'ſt judge by thy preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inconſiderableneſs of their advantages; and that I have no great reaſon to fear them. But that is not the thing now: I will propoſe unto thee a ſafe way to free thy ſelf. Thou canſt not propoſe any, ſaid <hi>Aranit,</hi> but what is ſhameful; and he that had murdered <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>—hold, interrupted <hi>Amurat,</hi> and do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of a crime I was never guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105648:43"/>
of <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> lives, but ſtill ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, that I want thy aſſiſtance to change her mind; thou ſhall ſee her, but thou muſt uſe this liberty for my ſervice: I love her, I adore her, but the Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſpiſes my flame with a cruel ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy. Reflect, <hi>Aranit,</hi> how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is for ſuch a Man as I to ſigh, and ſuffer to no purpoſe, nor any take care of my reſentments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aranit</hi> was no fit confident for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat: Scanderberg,</hi> his King and his Friend was in love with <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> and was belov'd by her: Theſe being thus, he was not capable of a baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance: Thou knoweſt, ſaid he, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſeldom fearful, and that they ſeldom act againſt their Parole or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how dear ſoever <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> may be to me, I would ſooner ſee her dead than to bring her to grant thee thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Hearing this diſcourſe, which could be ſo eaſily underſtood, <hi>Amurat</hi> grew mad againſt <hi>Aranit:</hi> Tarry my Priſoner, ſince thou deſpiſeſt my Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, ſaid he to him; all <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s Power ſhall not be able to deliver thee, and thou ſhall quickly feel what deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I prepare for thee. Then he ſent him back into a private Tent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105648:43"/>
he ſhould be kept cloſely.</p>
               <p>Having found the Father ſo reſolute, he went to try whether the Daughter would prove alſo inflexible: Therefore he went to <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> who knew not what had paſs'd; Cruel <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid he to her, I proſtrate my ſelf to your feet, for the laſt time of my life, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſome ſmall favour from you, which I promiſe to retaliate, by releaſing <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit</hi> your Father, who is now my Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Heavens! cry'd <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> is this the laſt Affliction you prepared againſt me? And do you forſake the juſt party, to caſt me ſtill into new Troubles? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! dear Father, Why did not my Death prevent your Misfortune? You may diſpoſe of his Deſtiny, reply'd <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> and it depends wholly upon your Behaviour. Reflect earneſtly upon this, do not deſpiſe mine Anger; and tho you need not fear the loſs of your Death, yet fear that of <hi>Auranit</hi>'s. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, reply'd the Princeſs full of ſorrow and indignation, what hath my Father done againſt thee? Is this the uſe thou oughteſt to make of what Power the chance of War hath given thee over him? Alaſs! he is falln into this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger only to deliver me: Endeavour then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105648:44"/>
on your ſide his Deliverance, reply'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat,</hi> ſince I am reſolv'd to be cruel except you favour me; either you muſt love, or ſee <hi>Aranit</hi> dye. Is this thy way of gaining love, reply'd the fair <hi>Arianiſſa?</hi> is Cruelty ſuch a pleaſing Charm, and muſt we offend the Perſon by whom we deſire to be loved? Give ſome occaſion to my Heart to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, boaſt ſooner of thy Services than thy Rage, to the end thou may'ſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me with ſome reaſon. You have taken ſo little notice of my Sufferings, reply'd the Sultan, that I intend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no more that courſe. If you are ſtill the ſame, I will not warrant you of my Fury; but if you change, you may expect any thing from me, and diſpoſe at your pleaſure, of my Soul and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Well, anſwered <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> let me ſee my Father. Tho' I ought to refuſe this Favour, to a perſon who never granted me any; yet interrupted <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> I give you leave to ſee him, but do not forget when you embrace him, that his Life depends upon this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view: Take together ſuch Reſolutions as may be agreeable with my Deſigns. The Sultan went away without ſpeaking any more, and ordered <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> ſhould
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105648:44"/>
be brought to <hi>Aranit</hi>'s Tent, not far from her's.</p>
               <p>Four Years abſence had made but an advantagious alteration in the Princeſs: And <hi>Aranit</hi> who knew well her Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wondred to find her ſo fair. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe embraced her Fathers Knees, and weeped there abundantly: He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her a thouſand times, and took her up very lovingly. After he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the firſt motions of Nature, I ſee you again at laſt, ſaid he, dear <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> after I have ſo long bewailed your loſs, and lived in a ſorrow proportioned to the cauſe thereof. If I have taken any care of my days, it was only to the end they might be ſerviceable to you. I have ſeen the Emperour of the <hi>Turks;</hi> I have heard, but I find not my ſelf diſpos'd to do what he deſir'd.—Forgive me, my Lord, if I interrupt you to praiſe your Conſtancy, it is worthy of your ſelf; but ſhall I ſee you dye, rather than give my ſelf to <hi>Amurat?</hi> And ought I not to ſacrifice the Peace of my Life to the ſafety of yours? What <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Aranit,</hi> could you reſolve your ſelf to be the Miſtreſs of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince? How ſorrowful would this ſign of your love prove to me, and by preſerving my
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105648:45"/>
life, how intollerable would you render it? I can loſe it a thouſand ways with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glory; and you ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it by ſo baſe means, ſince ſhould I conſent to it, I cannot but loſe my good Fame amongſt all honeſt Men. In a word, <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> forſake ſooner both my Life and yours, if there is any need. I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble giving you this advice, but I ſhould bluſh ſhould I do otherwiſe. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what you owe to the King of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> to that Prince who before he knew you, had ſerved you with ſo much reſpect. Alaſs! My Lord, I have forgotten nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Valour, nor his Services. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to what dreadful paſs I am brought: Shall my love upbraid for ever my ſevere Vertue, by reaſon I have not ſaved your life when I could do it? And if I grant <hi>Amurat</hi>'s deſire, will not the whole World look upon me as upon a Princeſs perfidious, both to Heaven and <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg?</hi> Alaſs! my Lord, what ſhall I do? That which I have adviſed to, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the conſtant <hi>Aranit:</hi> But then I ſhall ſee you dye, ſaid the Princeſs; no matter for that, reply'd <hi>Aranit,</hi> I ſhall dye without ſhame: Then both began to weep in a ſad manner. The Eunuch's Witneſſes of this ſorrowful
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105648:45"/>
Converſation, put an end to it, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa</hi> was like to dye, taking her laſt leave from her Father: Did I ſee you only, my Lord, to bid you an eternal farewell, cry'd the deſolate Princeſs. Cruel <hi>Amurat,</hi> let me dye with <hi>Aranit:</hi> Moderate your Grief, reply'd the Prince, ſoftly: We are not ſo far from <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg,</hi> you know what his Valour can do; go away my dear <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſpair as long as he lives.</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible to expreſs <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Rage, when he heard in what manner the Father and Daughter had ſpoke one to another: Am <hi>I</hi> Soveraign only, ſaid he, to be hector'd by my Enemies? And ſhall <hi>I</hi> always ſee my Power inſulted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? Let them dye ſooner; and tho' <hi>I</hi> cannot quench a Flame which <hi>I</hi> abhor, let my Reaſon at leaſt condemn to an everlaſting Grief the perſon that cauſes it; let the World ſee what Revenge <hi>I</hi> will take of a Captive, who does but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s hatred againſt me: Let him dye, <hi>I</hi> don't queſtion but <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg,</hi> whom my Arms ſhall puniſh as a Fugitive Rebel, will reſent this loſs. Let <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> have a juſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me; heretofore ſhe had only been the witneſs of my weakneſs, but now
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105648:46"/>
ſhe ſhall ſee me ſpill her own Blood.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had reſolved this, he thought upon the means of bringing it to execution: He choſe his Camp to be the Stage where that Tragedy was to be acted. The moſt uſual kind of Death among the <hi>Turks</hi> is Strangling; but ſuch Executions are frequently very private: That would not ſerve the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's turn, who intended to ſhew pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly his Cruelty, that <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> might be the witneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>The next day all things were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Aranit</hi>'s death; a Scaffold was erected in the middle of the Camp, which was encompaſſed by the <hi>Janiſſary</hi>'s, and other Souldiers of the Guard; <hi>Amurat</hi> took a convenient place to ſee his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders executed, and the deſolate <hi>Arianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> was brought near him. The Sultan kept always his dreadful looks upon her, but ſhe turned hers towards Heaven to implore its Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange Spectacle was offer'd to their ſight. <hi>Aranit</hi> appeared in ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, that it could not but ſhake his Daughter's Conſtancy: He was loaded with huge Chains, had his hands tyed, and his head uncovered, but he ſeemed neither caſt down nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105648:46"/>
at this barbarous uſage: He walk't with a ſedate countenance, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his Enemies; but when he ſaw <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> ſo frighted, almoſt drowned in her Tears, and almoſt dead for Grief, he grew pale, and pityed the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of that lovely Princeſs, who had always been the deareſt Object of his Hopes and Love; he wept, but his great courage could not allow of ſuch Tears, and preſently he wiped them off. He was no more diſcountenanced then, than if he had been at the head of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and recovering his former Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, he lifted up his Voice that he might be heard by the Sultan, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the reſt of the Aſſiſtance. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſſa,</hi> ſaid he to her, do not think this ſeems either cruel or ſhameful to me; I find therein both glory and pleaſure, ſince you ſee there an Example of which you can make ſome uſe: Hide thoſe Tears from me, which argue your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: You are my Daughter, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo that you are a Princeſs, that rank where Heaven has ſet you, requires both conſtancy and a great reſolution; you will ſee me no more, 'tis true, but let this conſideration comfort you, That no baſe Action will blemiſh the Glory
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105648:47"/>
of my Life; come to your ſelf, dear <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> live for <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s ſake; nay, dye for him, if there is need, as I am confident he would do for you. As for the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſaid he, turning himſelf towards <hi>Amurat,</hi> a Prince born from ſo many Heroe's, from whom thou degenerates ſo much, and whoſe Cruelty thou only imitateſt; learn from my Death to deſpiſe Life. Yeſterday I was with the valiant <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> whoſe very preſence diſſipates Fear and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and behold now I am ſubmitted to a Tyrant who trembles at the leaſt thing.</p>
               <p>Let him dye and periſh, cry'd out the Emperour, and let him be puniſhed for his pride. Then the Executioners went about to obey his Orders, and the fair <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> falling into a Swound, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Tent where ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been.</p>
               <p>But whilſt they were preparing to execute <hi>Aranit,</hi> many repeated out-cry's of the fartheſt Sentinels, ſignify'd <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi>'s coming, who had enjoyed no reſt ſince <hi>Aranit</hi>'s Captivity: His Forces brought again to fight, did march with a warlike Conſtancy, which ſtruck terror into the firſt that ſaw them. <hi>Amurat</hi>'s
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105648:47"/>
Camp was ſoon in a great fright; he was reſolved to haſten <hi>Aranit</hi>'s Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but <hi>Orcan,</hi> who could prevail the beſt upon his mind, got it to be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, judging it would be convenient to keep him alive: He was therefore brought back again, and <hi>Amurat</hi> put on his Arms, having ſtill conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces left, which were ſoon in a poſture of Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> broke like Thunder through whole Squadrons; <hi>Amurat</hi> was mightily afraid of his rencounter, and therefore went another way, leaving <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> to deal with <hi>Scanderberg:</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Thopia</hi> attacked the Sultan, and let him know the King of <hi>Albania</hi> was well ſeconded. The <hi>Turks</hi> turned back every where, confuſion and horrour had ſeized them; <hi>Amurat</hi> ſeeing there was no hope of the Victory left him, ran to <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Tent with a barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but could not find her there; and was ſtrangely amazed when he heard, that <hi>Muſſelman</hi> whom he took to be far from thence, had ſtoln her away: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Grif, he was put to a ſhameful flight; <hi>Scanderberg</hi> remained the only Maſter of the Field and Bagage; he ſaw <hi>Aranit,</hi> but could not find <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi> Who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105648:48"/>
can expreſs his Sorrow, when he ſaw all his Attempts fruitleſs, and ſo much Blood ſpilt to no purpoſe, and when he heard in whoſe hands ſhe had faln? He took this at firſt for a trick of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who being defeated, hided <hi>Arianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s condition: Conſidering this, he was reſolved to root out his Souldiers before they had time to breath, but ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Priſoners told him for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Muſſelman</hi> had gotten her away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> could not but think, that <hi>Muſſelman</hi> had no deſign to bring her into <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Territories, or tarry in <hi>Albania;</hi> he feared all things; and the knowledge he had of <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s temper, did but increaſe his dreadful trouble: To comfort himſelf, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Aranit,</hi> who acquainted him with his paſt Dangers. After he had ſettled his Camp, and left the diſtribution of the Pillage to the greedy Souldiers, every one endeavoured to divert his Sorrow. <hi>Thopia</hi> was more buſie in it than any: You were never acquainted with Love, ſaid the Prince of <hi>Albania</hi> to <hi>Thopia,</hi> and therefore you cannot imagine my Sorrow; <hi>Thopia</hi> bluſhed at this reproach, which he was ſo far from deſerving, ſince
<pb facs="tcp:105648:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no heart was more addicted to that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than his. I am more acquainted with Love than you think, my Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he; and becauſe I know its effects, I pity you more than any. My Lord, reply'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus,</hi> whoſe only deſire was to divert the King from thoſe ſad thoughts, to convince the King of the truth of what you ſay; pray let him hear your love Adventures. I ſhall hear them, ſaid the King to <hi>Thopia</hi> with pleaſure and attention, howſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed I may be; and if you are not a fortunate Lover, my own Experience will teach me to commiſerate you. My Lord, anſwered <hi>Thopia,</hi> both my Love and Fortune wholly depend upon your pleaſure, and the account which I am to give you by your Command, will make you more ſenſible of that Truth.</p>

               <p>WAS Love a voluntary Paſſion, my Lord, and could we rule the motions of our Hearts according to the advices of Reaſon, we ſhould never pich upon any choice without firſt conſulting her. Firſt of all, <hi>I</hi> muſt needs tell you, my Lord, that I love the Princeſs <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105648:49"/>
and that all my reſpect could never ſtop my paſſion. I beg humbly your Pardon.—I do forgive you with all my heart, reply'd the King, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admire my Siſter's Happineſs, to poſſeſs ſuch a Noble Heart. <hi>Thopia</hi> then fell upon his Knees, but being taken up by <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> he went on after this manner.</p>
               <p>I hell'd a conſiderable rank in King <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s Court, upon my Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and after you had been ſent to <hi>Amurat,</hi> I was look't upon as the chiefeſt of the Princes of <hi>Albania.</hi> I was ſurnamed <hi>Carlomus,</hi> which ſignifies in the <hi>Sclavoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Tongue <hi>happy,</hi> either becauſe I was very aimable in mine Infancy, or becauſe I was ſprung from the Noble Blood of <hi>Charlemayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King who could ſee you no more, never look't upon me without ſighing, and without complaining of that cruel Law, which deprived him of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Princeſſes <hi>Angelina, Zella,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lacia,</hi> your Siſters, comforted the Queen <hi>Vorſana,</hi> being already come to years of reaſon, ſince they were ſoon after marry'd to three illuſtrious Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: But the young <hi>Amiſſa</hi> was ſtill in her firſt Infancy, ſo fair and charming,

that one could not look upon her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving and admiring her. <hi>I</hi> fell in love with her as ſoon as I was ſenſible of any Reaſon, and our free Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation did but increaſe my Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Muſachius</hi> my Father, who had had me in his old Age, when he had no hopes of any Son, was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed with the advantage of having a <gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>All <hi>Amiſſa</hi>'s Actions ſeemed charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, and <hi>I</hi> wiſht mine had not diſpleas'd her: <hi>I</hi> was a long while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> could acquaint her with my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and whatſoever my complaiſance towards her might be, ſhe was to young to gueſs the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>As for me, a little more Age and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had taught me to diſtinguiſh Love from Friendſhip; and Time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Princeſs, that one doe's not ſigh without Love: In my younger Age I had ſhewn but a quiet joy at her ſight, but as ſoon as I came to my ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, ſhe obſerved I was melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and perplexed.</p>
               <p>She was uſed to go very often with her Governants, to divert her ſelf a fiſhing in the great Pond, which was in
<pb facs="tcp:105648:50"/>
the middle of the Palace of <hi>Croya; I</hi> follow'd her there one day, and whilſt her waiting Women were talking at ſome diſtance from us, I ſaw her longer than an hour apply only her ſelf to that Exerciſe: She was ſo fair, that I look'd upon her with an extraordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in that pleaſing occupation, I ſighed ſo loud, that <hi>Amiſſa</hi> who could catch nothing, and was vexed at it, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned angrily her head towards me; <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pia,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>I</hi> think you affright the Fiſhes, and the noiſe of your Sighs ſpoils all my ſport. Alas! Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd I, how can they hear what you do not hearken to. 'Tis poſſible enough, reply'd ſhe, that I hear you without hearkning to you: If you hear my Sighs, Madam, ſaid <hi>I, I</hi> am certain you do not underſtand the meaning of them, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould be too happy were you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Secret. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs left her Fiſhing to look upon me more earneſtly; and caſting one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging look upon me, <hi>I</hi> eſteem you ſo far as to pity you for your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſaid ſhe, and to rejoyce at your advantages: And <hi>I</hi> am willing to know that Secret, if you think <hi>I</hi> may ſerve you therein. Madam, reply'd <hi>I, I</hi> will
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105648:50"/>
then impart it to your kindneſs, and tell you, that you are the cauſe of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I the cauſe of your ſufferings, <hi>cry'd the young Princeſs, with a kind of amazement, mixed with fear,</hi> Alas! <hi>Thopia,</hi> how can that be, ſince I bear you ſo good a will? I do not tell you, Madam, <hi>added I,</hi> that they are cauſed by your will. I ſuffer, tho' you do not intend to make me ſuffer. You puzzle me ſtrangely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Amiſſa,</hi> and I muſt confeſs my Wit is not piercing enough, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that Myſtery. I perceive, Madam, <hi>added I, trembling,</hi> that my mouth muſt be my heart's interpreter. I love you, and thoſe ſighs which trouble your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſport, proceeds only from that extraordinary love you have inſpir'd me with; this paſſion is almoſt as old as I, and I was ſenſible of it, before I did know my ſelf. Alas! <hi>Thopia, replyed the Princeſs with a charming innocence,</hi> do not talk to me about Love, it has been repreſented always to me, after ſuch a manner, that I will ſhun it like a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and if you deſire I ſhould ſee you, you muſt rid your ſelf of it. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, Madam, <hi>reply'd</hi> I, I ſhould part with it, and I perceive, I am its ſlave for the reſt of my life. But, Madam,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105648:51"/>
do you think, a Paſſion, which you inſpire me with, can be any thing frightful? that Love which hath been drawn to you, was no ſuch Love as mine, nor the effect of divine <hi>Amiſſa</hi>'s Charms. If there is any horror to be found therein, it concerns me alone, and it proceeds from the fear of diſpleaſing you. But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> replyed the Princeſs, what do you deſire from me? Your pity, Madam, added I, and a Confeſſion from your mouth, that you accept of my Services with ſome joy. I profeſs to you, <hi>anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Princeſs,</hi> that I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend half of what you ſay, and that I want many Leſſons to underſtand this matter; did your heart tutor you ſo well, <hi>added I,</hi> as mine does me, you would be ſoon as great a Scholar in it as I, I promiſe you replyed ſhe ſmiling, to impart to you all that it ſhall teach me, in the mean time ſuppreſs your ſighs, and help me to conquer the ill luck I have to day.</p>
               <p>I was well pleaſed with this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and I did what ever I could to ſatisfie <hi>Amiſſa.</hi> At laſt the enchantment ended, and we caught fiſhes a pace, ſo that we entered into the Palace very well contented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:105648:51"/>
Since that day, the Princeſs made ſome Reflections, which opened her eyes. She had always looked upon me, as upon a young Prince, with whom ſhe was allowed to live familiar, but after that my diſcourſe, my actions, and her own reaſon had acquainted her, that I was in love with her, and when ſhe conſidered the conſequences which would follow the Courtſhip of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Lover, ſhe took a ſevere Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and tho' ſhe never ſhew'd any hatred againſt me, yet I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in her that innocent kindneſs, which till then had flatter'd my hopes.</p>
               <p>I was ſoon ſenſible of this Change, which is imputed to indifferency; ſome time paſs'd before I could complain, but my grief prevailing upon my patience, at laſt I ſpoke thus to the Princeſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> you have taught me to love, but I am afraid, I have taught you to hate, and except your kindneſs take my part, I fear leſt your rigour deprives me of the Liberty of ſeeing you. Are theſe the leſſons you have learnt from your heart, and did you conſult it only to render it mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? You will never be able to teach me to hate; but, My Lord, <hi>replyed ſhe,</hi> I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105648:52"/>
don't care you ſhould teach me to love; but ſuppoſe I am now a little more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ought you to wonder at it? 'Tis enough, <hi>Thopia, ſaid ſhe,</hi> caſting an obliging look upon me, that there is no other difference between what I was, and what I am. I know not whether this Kindneſs is a Leſſon from my heart, but as long as it ſhall not inſpire me with any thing inconſiſtent with my Duty, you need not fear I ſhould take any reſolutions contrary to your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. I found ſo much reaſon in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that it increaſed both my Love and Reſpect. It would be both ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and rude in me, <hi>ſaid</hi> I, to ask any more, ſince only my ſervices, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ought to ſpeak for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amiſſa</hi> ſeemed pleaſed with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but whilſt I was abandoning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely my ſelf to that paſſion, and ſhe look'd upon me, as a man who was worthy to ſerve her, Fate prepared it ſelf to croſs us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſtriot,</hi> who had married the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes his daughters with ſome <hi>Albanian</hi> Princes, could hardly have found a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily more worthy of his Alliance than ours. The Queen, who loved more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <hi>Amiſſa</hi> than the others, fearing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105648:52"/>
leſt ſome Reaſon of State ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her into a Forreign Country, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my paſſion well enough; but the King, who had ſome different deſigns, took meaſures quite oppoſite to hers.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe that were of ſome note at <hi>Croya, Balſé,</hi> a Prince as well as I, had become <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s Favourite, he was no man of great Vices, nor of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Virtue, and the only thing that got him in favour, was his affected complyance. He was ten years older than I, and was not handſome to pleaſe the Eyes of a nice Princeſs. Yet <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot</hi> had choſen him for <hi>Amiſſa</hi>'s Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and had thought that his Sons being abſent, <hi>Epirus</hi> and <hi>Albania</hi> could not have a better Protector.</p>
               <p>Some Broils then call'd us to the War, I was none of the unwillingeſt to go, ſacrificing my Paſſion to Glory, and to the deſire of deſerving <hi>Amiſſa.</hi> I did not part from her without Sorrow, and I believe ſhe was alſo ſenſible of my departure. <hi>Balſé</hi> commanded our Army, and becauſe there were but few Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere-places revolted, it was not very Numerous. I did not then look upon him as my Rival, yet I had no love for him; he had, may be, no greater
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105648:53"/>
ſhare in the Victories we got, than I, and the others that ſerved, but he was rewarded a great deal better. Arriving to <hi>Croya,</hi> I found the Princeſs <hi>Amiſſa</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, for <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s loſs, whom a <hi>Caravanne</hi> of <hi>Turks</hi> had ſtoln away in a Voyage, which her Father had impoſed upon her without any neceſſity.</p>
               <p>About that time, My Lord, the whole world ſpake of you with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your Conqueſts, both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> amazed the moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souldiers. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> had then good reaſon to ſigh, ſeeing that what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices you did for an Infidel, might have proved ſo uſeful for <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> The Princeſs wiſhed your return, and when I would commend you in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Pity that Illuſtrious Brother, <hi>would ſhe ſay,</hi> that his valour ſhould be engaged to ſerve a man of a barbarous extraction, and who knows little what belongs to gratitude, and friendſhip. Pity me at the ſame time for loving him as much as I do, and for having no hopes to ſee him again.</p>
               <p>But, My Lord, 'tis time to relate to you my Sorrows; the King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thought he was mightily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to <hi>Balſé,</hi> prepared to do any thing for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:105648:53"/>
This formidable Rival for reaſon of <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s protection, began to court the Princeſs in ſuch a manner, that I was deprived of the liberty I had before. As ſoon as I ſaw he had declared himſelf, I was ſenſible of my misfortune, and tho' he was a King's Favourite, yet I defired my Father to do ſomething for my love. He loved me too tenderly to deny me any thing I asked, and without object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me all that I ought to fear, he did partly what I deſired.</p>
               <p>I went to expect with the Princeſs the event of my Father's deſign. I ſound her ſorrowful, and melancholy. You are afflicted, Madam, <hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> and that trouble which appears in your eyes ſignifies as much. Yes, Prince, <hi>replyed ſhe, with a ſad Countenance,</hi> I am cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed. Can I without offending you, ask you the Cauſe thereof, <hi>reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I?</hi> You will know it too ſoon, and if you are a little concerned for me, what will you ſay, when you hear I am near to marry <hi>Balſé?</hi> This diſcourſe, like a thunder, ſtruck me almoſt dead, and I was ſo little prepared for it, that this ſurpriſe ſtopt my blood, and one could ſee upon my Face, the ſigns of a real deſpair. The Princeſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105648:54"/>
was moved at it. Alas! <hi>Thopia, ſaid ſhe, looking ſadly upon me,</hi> how dear am I like to pay for my Obedience to my Fathers Commands? Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> I, are you then reſolved to marry <hi>Balſé,</hi> and by a Scruple of Virtue will you ſooner renounce your own happineſs, than reſiſt <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s will? Would you have me, <hi>replyed ſhe,</hi> incur his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by a rebellious reſiſtance? Tho' you might love me the better for it, yet I am ſure you would eſteem me the leſs, and you know your ſelf well enough, that a Daughter of my rank, cannot diſpoſe of her own Fate. I know, I adore you, Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> I, and I ſhall dye for grief, if <hi>Balſé</hi> injoy a Fortune he has never deſerved. What great advantages above me can that Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rival boaſt of? I am certain, I give him none, interrupted <hi>Amiſſa,</hi> and were you only to ſtrive with my inclination, you would ſoon be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> you know <hi>Caſtriot</hi> is my Father, and what power he has over me. What ſhall I do, replyed I, if you marry <hi>Balſé,</hi> you ſhall ſee me no more, or at moſt? You ſhall ſee me only in publick places, replyed the Princeſs. And if I live, I ſhall live the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105648:54"/>
perſon in the World. Can you, Madam, give your ſelf to him, <hi>replyed I, ſomewhat angry?</hi> Yes, without doubt, <hi>interrupted Amiſſa,</hi> and I ſee nothing can diſpenſe me from that Duty, if <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot</hi> requires it of me. Cruel Princeſs, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> you know well enough I cannot live after that; muſt I alſo adore your Fortunate Husband, as I do every thing that belongs to you? Did you know my hearts Condition, <hi>replyed ſhe,</hi> you would not be ſo paſſionate, and you would ſooner endeavour to comfort it. My trouble does not proceed from any affectation. However you are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate then I, ſince you are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give your ſelf to one you hate, and ſince you may ſigh without crime. In my preſent confuſion, I know not, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> what to ſay, nor what to think. All things ſeem guilty to me, and I cannot but accuſe my ſelf, believing heaven would never puniſh me unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly. After that I asked the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, how ſhe came to know <hi>Balſé</hi>'s good Fortune? And ſhe told me, that after he had often ſpoke to her about his love, but in vain, the King at laſt had declared himſelf for him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Queen's averſion to it,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105648:55"/>
and that he had commanded the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to look upon <hi>Balſé</hi> as upon a Prince whom he deſigned for her future Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>I perceived then that all my Father's endeavours would prove fruitleſs, and I was grievouſly afflicted at this. <hi>Amiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> ſeemed alſo very ſenſible of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and her kindneſs did but give me a greater ſenſe of my loſs.</p>
               <p>Againſt my cuſtom I was glad to leave her, intending to go to the Queen, who had always been kind to me, to implore her aſſiſtance. I was told ſhe was in the Gardens, therefore going that way, I met my Father, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Countenance did but increaſe my trouble: He confirm'd unto me the King's reſolution in <hi>Balſe</hi>'s behalf, and exhorted me to take patiently a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which could not be helpt. In the ſame minute I ſaw my Rival appear, follow'd by many Courtiers, drawn there by his fair hopes; my colour chang'd, and my Father ſenſible of my violent commotion, forbad me to enter into any converſation with <hi>Balſé:</hi> what could I have promiſed him, ſince I was maſtered by a Paſſion I could no longer bridle? It was well I did not attack
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105648:55"/>
my Rival in his preſence; but as ſoon as he diſappear'd I abandoned my ſelf to Wrath and Jealouſie. I found <hi>Balſé</hi> in the Garden where <hi>I</hi> was looking for the Queen. Could <hi>I</hi> ſpeak one word with you, <hi>ſaid I?</hi> Yes, replyed he, without any apparent amazement. I know, ſaid I, that you are deſign'd to poſſeſs the only thing that may render you the moſt glorious Man in the World: But you don't know, it may be, that I ſigh for the Princeſs <hi>Amiſſa</hi> theſe many years ago, and that you muſt deprive me of my life ſooner than obtain her. I did not think, replyed <hi>Balſé,</hi> in a ſcornful manner, which vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the very heart, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of a great King were to be croſs'd thus. For my part, I, who know how I am to obey, ought to take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care to perform my duty. Do not conclude from hence, that I don't care to fight with you; you ſhall have that ſatisfaction: But, <hi>Thopia,</hi> you will not take it ill if I defer it till Marriage hath given me a full poſſeſſion of <hi>Amiſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſpoke to me, he left me ſcornfully; and I was ſo much caſt down at thoſe words, that I could not attack him at preſent. The Place was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105648:56"/>
a Sacred Place, and I was fain to curb my Paſſions. As they were acting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me with the greateſt violence, the Queen came, and I went to her in a trouble which ſhe eaſily took notice of. That generous Princeſs caſt a ſad look upon me; and leaving her Gentleman-Uſher to give me her hand, ſhe did not ask the reaſon of my ſorrow, which ſhe eaſily gueſſed, but let me know how afflicted ſhe was at the King's prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Balſé</hi>'s behalf, aſſuring me, that if ſhe had had the diſpoſal of my good Fortune, ſhe had not deferred it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I wiſh, ſaid ſhe, I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your ſatisfaction with the loſs of my own Blood; but we have a Maſter obſtinate in his reſolutions, and who will be obeyed. I have ſtrove againſt them as much as I could, but all to no purpoſe, and I cannot but condole with you. The paleneſs and the deſpair that appeared upon my face at the hearing of theſe words caſt the Queen into a great fright. Madam, ſaid I to her, my misfortunes are ſo great that 'tis like they will alſo prove fatal to <hi>Balſé,</hi> and all the reſpect I owe to the King's order can never prevent my reſentment. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> came afterwards, follow'd by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105648:56"/>
the Princeſs, and I retir'd in that ſad condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amiſſa,</hi> who ſaw me retire, eaſily perceiv'd my trouble, ſince I ſeemed to ſhun her preſence. I ſpent that night in the greateſt trouble imaginable. I had a thouſand ſeveral Projects in my Head; at laſt I reſolved to render <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa</hi>'s poſſeſſion impoſſible for <hi>Balſé.</hi> I had ſeen him in ſeveral occaſions, but I never had the leaſt fear his arms ſhould triumph over me as his favour did: In fine, I roſe up at the break of day, and went to tarry for him near the Palace where he was uſed to go every Morning. <hi>Balſé,</hi> ſaid I, as ſoon as I ſaw him, we muſt fight for <hi>Amiſſa,</hi> and you will never be happy before you have killed me. Then I drew my Sword, my Rival was forced to do the ſame, and we fought with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual courage and advantage; we wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another in ſeveral places; and tho' they endeavour'd to part us, yet our fight laſted ſo long, that it exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt part of our ſtrength. <hi>Balſé</hi> at laſt fell at my feet; and tho' I ſtood up ſtill, yet <hi>I</hi> was in a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a crowd of people coming then carried us both away.</p>
               <p>

The King ſhewed ſuch a great reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my Father, who endeavour'd to juſtifie me, that his great grief caſt him into a Fever, which brought him to the Grave. <hi>I</hi> durſt not appear, and this increas'd my deſpair. The Queen and Princeſs ſent me word how much concerned they were for me: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſatisfie <hi>Caſtriot</hi> but my death, ſhould <hi>Balſé</hi> live no longer; his wounds were more conſiderable than mine; <hi>I</hi> was curld in a ſhort time, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my grief, but all the care they took of him could not prevent his death.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> could no longer tarry in <hi>Croya,</hi> or in any other place of <hi>Albania; Caſtriot</hi> had no regard for my Love, nor Services, nor Birth, and granting ſome tears to <hi>Balſé</hi>'s death, he fully reſolved my own. The Princeſs, whom he ſuſpected to favour me, felt his ſeverity; even the Queen her ſelf underwent his reproaches.</p>
               <p>I thought it very hard to hide my ſelf for a glorious action, and <hi>I</hi> had fallen into a deſpair, if the Princeſs, who could obtain any thing from me, and who knew well <hi>I</hi> was not out of <hi>Croya,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> was carefully ſought after, and who feared <hi>Caſtriot</hi>'s reſentment, had

not preſcrib'd a Law which <hi>I</hi> could not reſiſt. <hi>I</hi> receiv'd her orders in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written with her own hand, which was delivered to me with a great deal of circumſpection.</p>

               <p>I wiſhed I could have taken my leave of <hi>Amiſſa,</hi> but the then preſent Juncture of Affairs would not allow of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interview. I parted from <hi>Croya</hi> with a ſound body, but a heart full of grief. I took with me ſome of my faithful Servants, abandoning whatever my Father had left me. There was then no War in any place of <hi>Europe,</hi> and having no certain Deſign, I was led at laſt by my profound Melancholy into a part of <hi>Greece;</hi> as I was thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a larger Journey, I heard of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot</hi>'s death. How unjuſt ſoever he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105648:58"/>
had been againſt me, I was afflicted at the News; I had returned to <hi>Croya,</hi> if <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Tyranny, who had poſſeſs'd himſelf of all <hi>Albania,</hi> had not put an invincible ſtop to my Deſigns. The Queen and <hi>Amiſſa</hi> were made Captives, and having no Forces to defend, I went every where to make ſome intereſt for them, and made at laſt that Party, which I brought to you after the Queen's Death, which oppreſſed me almoſt with grief, entirely honouring her, and knowing how ſenſible <hi>Amiſſa</hi> would be of this Misfortune.</p>
               <p>In fine, my Lord, I was Witneſs of your immortal Actions; I ſaw <hi>Amiſſa</hi> again, whom I found the ſame, and who told me, that my happineſs whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depended upon your pleaſure. This is that Hiſtory, my Lord, you deſired to know, you are both my King and Maſter, but beſides you are the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Umpire of my Felicity.</p>

                  <hi>Scanderberg</hi> embraced <hi>Thopia</hi> as ſoon as he had made an end of his Relation, and aſſured him, that he might poſſeſs <hi>Amiſſa</hi> when he pleaſed, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be ſo acceptable to him as his Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:105648:59"/>
But tho' <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s violent paſſion had been diverted for a while by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>'s Relation, yet it ſoon recovered its former ſtrength, the ſorrowful <hi>Aranit</hi> was much concerned, and they were but little pleaſed at the gain of the Battel, ſince their hopes were furſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acomat</hi> wondred that <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> who had ſo many reaſons to fear the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s wrath, ſhould be ſo raſh as to enter his Camp, and carry away <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not acquainted with all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his Life, he could give no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the King of <hi>Albania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time this Prince could ſee the <hi>Turks</hi> had departed, that his Army was not much weakned, and that <hi>Croyae</hi> had nothing to fear; being thus free to act as he pleaſed, he could not reſolve himſelf to tarry, till he had heard ſome News concerning <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> and reſolved to venture any thing to find her out. My Lord, ſays he to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,</hi> our common intereſt requires mine abſence; as things ſtand now, there is no danger <hi>Amurat</hi> ſhould attempt any thing, but we ought to fear all things from the treacherous <hi>Muſſelman.</hi> We muſt deliver <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> from his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105648:59"/>
and I am weary of my life, when I think ſhe is in his power. <hi>Aranit</hi> was far from oppoſing this reſolution, and <hi>Scanderberg</hi> prepared himſelf to depart with the fortunate <hi>Thopia,</hi> who would never forſake him. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus</hi> followed them alſo, and <hi>Acomat,</hi> who could not with Honour follow his Maſter's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, tarried with <hi>Aranit</hi> as a Priſoner of War.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Alhania</hi> would not take many Souldiers along with him, for fear of being known, his Equipage was not very great; but he found himſelf in an exceeding trouble, concerning the way he ought to take; he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>Muſſelman</hi> had fled from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat,</hi> and that it was to no purpoſe to ſeek him among the defeated Army; it was not likely neither, that this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher ſhould retire into the Emperour's Territories, or tarry in <hi>Albania.</hi> In this uncertainty he wholly truſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chance: not certain of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Enterprize, and going he knew not where, he found in ſeveral places many Companies of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſcattered, and returning to <hi>Amurat.</hi> He was three days without taking any reſt, and all his inquiries being to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he began to deſpair.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:105648:60"/>
But he was not the only man that ſought <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi> Prince <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her out of his Father's hands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to get her for himſelf, and look'd upon <hi>Muſſelman</hi> as upon a light obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, could he but meet with him. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> tho' ſorely afflicted at his loſſes, ſent ſeveral Parties after him; but the young <hi>Sultan,</hi> led by his own heart's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, took that licence followed only by twenty men.</p>
               <p>At firſt he was not more fortunate than <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> and travelled over a ſpacious Country to no purpoſe; at laſt being arrived in a ſavage place, which properly may be called a Wilderneſs, he heard ſome noiſe over his head, and ſaw <hi>Muſſelman</hi> retrenched in a ſteep Rock hurrying <hi>Arianiſſa</hi> with violence, and ſtriving to get her, notwithſtanding all her reſiſtance, into a Den, where the Sun had never ſhone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> had an <hi>Ottoman</hi> Soul (that is, haughty and cruel) as the reſt of his Life witneſſed. The injury done to a fair Princeſs, whom he loved dearly, inſpired him with the utmoſt Fury, and crying very loud, he would fain have gone to <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> but he ſaw every where inacceſſible Precipices. <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:105648:60"/>
and <hi>Muſſelman</hi> hearing that noiſe, look'd upon him. The Princeſs hated all the Turks, but ſhe had a leſſer aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> than againſt the <hi>Boſtangi-Bachi;</hi> the Prince who ſaw her deſolate, and oppreſſed with grief, made many attempts, which did not affright <hi>Muſſelman;</hi> but Heaven, who had deſigned that day for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt Rogue in the World, brought <hi>Scanderberg</hi> and his Men in the place where the Prince <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> was, it vexed them to ſee one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother there, but the King of <hi>Albania</hi> ſoon perceived <hi>Arianiſſa.</hi> Who could expreſs his commotion at this ſight? or <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s rage? The Precipices that were round him, ſeem'd to ſecure his Cruelty; but ſuch as they were, he did not think they were inacceſſible for the paſſionate <hi>Scanderberg.</hi> Juſt Heavens, cry'd he, favour my Paſſion, and ſince you grant me to ſee <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> grant me alſo that I may deliver her from that cruel Tyrant. Then he caſt his eyes all round about, and ſeeing a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way difficult, but leſs dangerous than the reſt, followed it haſtily. <hi>Thopia, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranus,</hi> and the reſt followed his ſteps, and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who would not be an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105648:61"/>
uſeleſs Spectator, went after them, tho it was a long circuit, and tho' <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> affrighted, threatned to carry away <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> the couragious Princeſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his deſign. <hi>Scanderberg</hi> ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Men fall, and bruiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Rocks; but this did not abate his Courage, and at laſt he found a way eaſier and broader, which led him to <hi>Arianiſsa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas! thoſe were not all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles he was to met with, and <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Fury was more to be feared than thoſe Precipices he had overcome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. That barbarous man, tho' he had a far greater number of men, than thoſe that had followed the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet could not truſt on his own ſtrength: a helliſh rage poſſeſs'd his Soul, and ſeeing he was undone, he reſolved to undo all. With this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he ſeized <hi>Arianiſsa</hi>'s arm, and drawing a Cymeter, <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> ſaid he to her, with his ſcared looks, ſhall never ſee thee alive, or enjoy thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thou deſigneſt for him. Thou cannot affright me, in threatning me with death, replied <hi>Arianiſsa,</hi> with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene countenance, but tremble for thine own. I look upon it as certain, replied
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105648:61"/>
the Turk, but <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s hand ſhall never ſacrifice me.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Albania</hi> was ſtill draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer, and could already hear them. <hi>Muſſelman</hi> perceiving him, bad him ſtop if he deſired <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s life. The Prince, who ſaw his Cymeter, and who was well enough acquainted with the Turks temper, to expect all ſorts of cruelties from them, was ſtrangely ſurpriſed, and durſt go no farther. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa</hi> ſeeing him ſtop, and fearing leſt too much love ſhould make him eaſily leave her, exhorted him to advance. Come, my Lord, cryed ſhe to him, <hi>Muſſelman</hi> is too faint hearted to attempt any thing upon my life, but ſuppoſe he was not, I would ſooner die than ſubmit to him. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had alſo drawn near, and who was not ſo much concerned for the loſs of her life, tho' he was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in love, would have advanced far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but <hi>Scanderberg</hi> bad him imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly not to advance raſhly, leſt he ſhould conſider him as <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. The Prince advanced no more, and <hi>Muſſelman</hi> ſeeing the well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fear of his Rivals grew the more inſolent.

O barbarous! cry'd the Prince, is this your way of loving and deſerving her? How cunningly thou knoweſt how to make uſe of my Love and thy Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe! Depart Monſter, go far from hence, ſince <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s ſafety requires it; but at leaſt reſpect her Virtue and Rank. Can you forſake me ſo, cryed out <hi>Aranit</hi>'s fair Daughter, and do you think, <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> that I am ſo much in love with my life as to chuſe to live with this Monſter? How blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy is your faint-heartedneſs! Muſt my own example encourage you? If you do not come to me, I will go meet either Death or you; then ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to get looſe out of <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s hands, but her ſtrength was not ſufficient: <hi>Muſſelman</hi> foreſaw then his certain ruine: Love, ſaid he, without any more ado, guide mine Arm: Then he lifted it up to ſtab <hi>Araniſſa</hi> in the breaſt; and he had certainly done it, if the affectionate <hi>Thopia,</hi> whoſe mind was more ſedate than <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the effects of <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s rage,

had not taken ſecretly a by way, and got in that critical minute ſo near him that he ſtruck him, and ſent both his Arm and Dagger to <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Feet; another blow divided <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s Face in two, ſo that he gave up his unclean Soul with his cruel Blood.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were there preſent were ſo amazed at this wonderful Action that they took <hi>Thopia</hi> for a Man ſent down from Heaven: But <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> whoſe terrour was converted into a ſudden joy, ran to embrace <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Deliverer before he went to her ſelf. 'Tis impoſſible for us to relate all the obliging things they told one another. <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> to ſhew his great paſſion, proſtrated himſelf at <hi>Arianiſſa</hi>'s Feet, and uttered the moſt paſſionate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that his heart could invent.

               <p>He knew not what had paſs'd at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinople</hi> ſince his departure thence: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa</hi> who had ſeen <hi>Acomat,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the Death of the Loyal <hi>Aradin,</hi> was willing to ſatisfy <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; one Evening being with <hi>Amiſſa</hi> and <hi>Thopia,</hi> who had heard her former Adventures, ſhe thus related the laſt to the King of <hi>Albania.</hi>

               <p>AS I had paſſionately wiſhed for your departure from <hi>Andrinople,</hi> ſo was I overjoy'd at the News of it, ſince you ought not to expect there any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105648:65"/>
and tho' I could not abſolutely flatter my ſelf with the Idea of a future Liberty, yet <hi>I</hi> had ſome glimmering hope ſtill left me. <hi>Aradin</hi> and <hi>I</hi> congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated one another upon this occaſion; but the fearful <hi>Sultan</hi> fell into an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rage, when he heard you had been proclaimed King by the <hi>Albanians.</hi>

               <p>As his wrath increaſed, ſo did his troubleſome and imperious Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: He did not queſtion, but <hi>I</hi> had ſome ſecret Intelligence with you; and he ſuſpected <hi>Aradin</hi> of having favour'd our Deſigns; he threatned him with Death, and me with the utmoſt Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo caſt me often into dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimana</hi> ſeeing ſhe had loſt you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, endeavoured to regain the Sultan's Love; <hi>I</hi> did what <hi>I</hi> could to facilitate that Conqueſt unto her, yet ſhe hated me as a dangerous Rival, who deprived her of the Sultan's Affection, and who likely had hindred you from loving her: She conjectured from the words which you heard me ſing, and which truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from my heart, that ſince the day you fought the <hi>Tartar, I</hi> had not look't upon you with indifference.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:105648:65"/>
Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was no longer obſerved by you, and who feared only his Father's Jealouſie, reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any thing to ſee me; and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Muſſelman</hi> got alſo into the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> after the way <hi>I</hi> ſhall relate to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurat</hi> thought, that having no hope left of your return, <hi>I</hi> ſhould never be able to reſiſt him; but ſeeing all his moderation was to no purpoſe, after he had ſighed, he began to threaten, and ſhew'd me all that cruel Pride natural to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Blood. You try my patience too far, cruel and ungrateful <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid he one day to me, and you do not regard at all my kindneſs for you. Do you think <hi>I</hi> ſpare you by reaſon of my own weakneſs? No ſure, but my Heart protects you againſt my Reaſon; you ought therefore to own your ſelf obliged to me; otherwiſe <hi>I</hi> ſwear by all the Powers above, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall make uſe of all mine Authority, if your unkindneſs forces me to it.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe had been proceeded by ſo many of the like nature, that I did not look upon it as a new thing, but <hi>Amurat</hi>'s countenance was quite chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thou knoweſt well, that <hi>I</hi> never
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105648:66"/>
abuſed thy Highneſs, reply'd <hi>I,</hi> and that <hi>I</hi> never promiſed thee any thing; <hi>I</hi> am ſenſible both of thy Power and Dignity: But, my Lord, thou oughteſt to know, That thou canſt not require from me, but the reſpect due to thy Rank; <hi>I</hi> am no perſon of a mean Birth, and the Chains <hi>I</hi> am loaded with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depreſs my Courage; thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which are ſubject to thy Power, afford thee Beauty's enough, whoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire is to pleaſe thee; thy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allows them that liberty, and their Inclinations are agreeable with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as for me, Fortune only had made me thy Slave; <hi>I</hi> am not thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if thou art juſt, and there are Laws above thine, which forbid me to favour a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> If <hi>Scanderberg</hi> did ſit upon the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Throne, reply'd the angry Sultan, you would not be likely ſo nice; and all your Reaſons about Independance and Conſtancy, would not prove ſo ſtrong as you pretend them. Well, <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid he proudly, perſiſt in your reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but expect no longer from me any moderation, ſince I will have no more regard to your Sex, your Religion, or your Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:105648:66"/>
Being in ſuch a humour, he left me; <hi>Selimana</hi> exaſperated him by her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and both the <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s were witneſſes of his violent Rage.</p>
               <p>Since the Converſation I had had with the Sultaneſs in the Garden, and which you heard: Our Friendſhip had not been great, becauſe <hi>Amurat</hi>'s love changed ſoon after, and for reaſon of the new rank which he forced me to take; ſhe judged by what had happen'd in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where ſhe had deſir'd me to walk with her, when the Emperour met us, that you were no indifferent Perſon to me; ſhe had look'd upon the Sultaneſs love, as upon a thing which authorized in ſome manner her freedom with me, and her in conſtancy: But when ſhe knew that you lov'd me, and that I had ſome gratitude for you, ſhe fell in a Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and call'd me perfidious and treacherous, becauſe ſhe had truſted me with the Secret of her own Heart.</p>
               <p>Jealouſie had ſoon inſpir'd her with an immortal hatred againſt me, and I was like to feel its cruel Effects: You have deprived me of all my comfort, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> ſaid ſhe one day to me, and you have rewarded the ſincere confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my Heart with Perfidiouſneſs;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105648:67"/>
but believe what I ſay, this place in ſpires no moderation; and whatever kindneſs I am forced to ſhew you, may be ſoon changed into hatred. Fear mine, ſince you have ſo baſely ſerved me. I am ſo far from deſerving theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, reply'd I, with a ſedate mind, that I feel neither remorſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor terrour at the hearing of them. My Behaviour had been always innocent; I never endeavoured to pleaſe the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and as for your confidence, Heaven knows whether I have abuſed it: But you loved <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> reply'd ſhe, and when I acquainted you with my paſſion; you hid your Sentiments from me with a criminal Diſſimulation: Suppoſe what you ſay was true, anſwer'd I, you have yet no reaſon to accuſe me, did not your Jealouſie blind you. Was I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to open my heart to you, by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of your confidence, which I ſo little deſired? And inſtead of complaining of me, ought you not to commend my prudence for not declaring my ſelf your Rival? But <hi>Selimana,</hi> let us not trouble our ſelves any longer about what is paſt, or what is to come: Let us conſider, that <hi>Scanderberg</hi> is like to be King of <hi>Albania,</hi> that we are Slaves,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105648:67"/>
and that I would willingly give moſt of my Blood to regain you the Sultan's love; if you are acquainted with my endeavour, you may know how I deal with him. Alas! reply'd ſhe, your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire is to ſee <hi>Scanderberg</hi> again, and that Crown you talk of, renders him more lovely to your Eyes: But tho' Fortune confines me here, you are alſo like to ſhare the ſame Fate.</p>
               <p>The Emperour who went by, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted us; he was that day in a rage that cannot be expreſſed, having heard of the new progreſs of your Valour; he upbraided me for it, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſure he gave me, by telling me of theſe News.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, 'tis time to acquaint you with a more remarkable paſſage: I was one night upon a little Terraſs, which rendred mine Apartment very pleaſant; the Emperour kept his Bed by reaſon of a violent Feaver, which proceeded from his Anger. I was thinking upon your Advantages, and I had ſpent part of the night in that pleaſing Occupation, had I not been interrupted. I heard at the foot of the Terraſs, a Voice, which I knew preſently to be <hi>Amaldan</hi>'s, becauſe there
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105648:68"/>
was none ſweeter than his in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> and by reaſon we had ſung often together to divert <hi>Selimana,</hi> he ſung but theſe four Verſes, likely of his own making.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Awake, prepare for gentle Love's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm:</l>
                  <l>No, prying<hi> Argus </hi>now can do you harm.</l>
                  <l>And whilſt all things are here by ſleep poſſeſt,</l>
                  <l>May you in ſweet Delights of Love be bleſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I hearkned to <hi>Amaldan;</hi> thinking he had no deſign; but turning my head at a little noiſe, I ſaw a Slave, whom I took to be one of thoſe Women that waited upon me; but it proved the bold <hi>Muſſelman</hi> in that Diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs my amazement and my wrath; this way going to break out againſt the <hi>Boſtangi Bachi,</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Woman (as I thought) drew near me, as raſh as the firſt, and in the ſame Diſguiſe; this was Prince <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had I followed my firſt paſſion, I had ruined them both, and drawn like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon my ſelf the ſuſpition of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105648:68"/>
one or the other; they were as much amazed as I at the Conformity of their Adventures. After I had look'd upon them a long while, to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſured, that <hi>I</hi> was not miſtaken; at laſt <hi>I</hi> told them, that they hazarded more than I, and that their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes which rendred them ſo guilty towards the Emperour, could not prove pernicious to me. There is no need, ſaid I, I ſhould inſtruct you about the Laws, which you know well enough, and which you cannot violate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Crime or Danger. But, my Lord, ſaid I, turning my ſelf towards <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> I muſt needs tell you, that tho' my civility may hide your Actions from the Sultan, yet you ought to make a good uſe of it: And as for thee, O <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the perfidious Subject of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who had honoured thee with the firſt Diguities of his Houſe, if thou eſcapeſt free; thank my Indulgence and <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Boſtangi Bachi</hi> felt a ſecret Rage at theſe words; he believed that your abſence had changed mine Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that I was in love with the young Sultan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:105648:69"/>
I have interrupted your Deſigns, reply'd he, with a boldneſs like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: You wiſh <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould come again; but I am not ſo little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Intereſt, as to hide from him what has paſs'd. You Rogue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Prince, do not offend <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſſa,</hi> and acknowledge your fault as I do mine. Since our paſſionate Love hath brought us hither, againſt all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence, let us confeſs our ſelves guilty: Tho' you ought to queſtion me about what I do, yet tho' I am your Prince, I'll give you what ſatisfaction you can deſire from me: Come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to another place. Theſe words did but confirm him in the Opinion he had, that I loved <hi>Mahomet;</hi> they were both forced to retire; and after I had ſeen them go out, I went into my Chamber, reſolved to tarry there for fear of the like Surpriſal, ſeeing that all the Eunuchs in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were debauched in their Duty. <hi>Amaldan,</hi> who deſign'd nothing elſe by favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Boſtangi Bachi,</hi> than to make uſe of his Liberality, cared little whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was pleaſed or no; thoſe that ſerved <hi>Mahomet,</hi> were not more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105648:69"/>
Some of my waiting Women had their Share in this Intreague, but for fear of communicating theſe things to thoſe that were innocent, <hi>I</hi> thought it fitter to be ſilent; I got all the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to my Appartment cloſely ſhut up. <hi>Aradin</hi> did aſſwage my diſpleaſure, by telling me he had received News from you, and that nothing being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you, you would ſoon be Maſter of <hi>Croya.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your happineſs made me look leſs melancholly than I was uſed to be, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat,</hi> who was ſick but a little while, ſoon perceived it, and upbraided me for my ſedate mind, as if it had been a great Crime.</p>
               <p>In fine, My Lord, we heard at <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> your arrival to <hi>Croya,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs to you, what was <hi>Amurat</hi>'s rage, when he heard of the defeat of his <hi>Baſha</hi>'s; he reſolved to go in perſon to fight you. But he was not willing to leave me behind him. <hi>I</hi> was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at this news, reckoning it a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to come near the place, where you and my Father were, <hi>Selimana</hi> mad at this Reſolution, deſigned to have killed me, and to make her ſelf cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that way, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you, or to the <hi>Sultan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105648:70"/>
I have told you already that we had no great correſpondance. She knew what preparations were made for my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſeeing ſhe had quite loſt the Emperours love, ſhe reſolved to puniſh me for it; by her liberality ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to induce ſome <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon me, ſome were perſidious enough to attempt againſt my Life, but all to no purpoſe, tho' I uſed but a little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection. Theſe ſlow enterpriſes, did not agree with the violence of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; therefore one night, being mad at <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Scorn, ſhe entered into my Chamber, with a dagger in her hand, which ſhe had uſed without any mercy, had not my good Fate brought there <hi>Aradin,</hi> who, full of Zeal and Terror, threw himſelf upon her, and hindred her deſign. The proud <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> turned her head, and perceived her own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe told us all that a violent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred can inſpire. She curſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; reviled me baſely, proteſted againſt me, named you many times, and at laſt ſtabbing her ſelf with two ſtrokes, ſhe fell dead at my feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ran away at this cruel ſight. The Emperour coming in was little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her Death, tho' he had loved
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105648:70"/>
her paſſionately, becauſe he could no longer abide her apbraiding humour.</p>
               <p>At laſt, my Lord, we departed from the <hi>Seraglio</hi> at <hi>Andrinople;</hi> I was put in a covered Cart with two old Women, it was impoſible for any man to ſee me, and no body was ever obſerved with greater care, notwithſtanding all this, the raſh <hi>Muſſelman</hi> endeavoured to ſteal me away; he was diſcovered the firſt time, and forced to fly from the preſence of the angry <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was reſolved to have puniſhed him; he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo, and that poor Prince was like to undergo the Fate, which hath ruined ſo many of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
               <p>We arrived in ſight of <hi>Croya,</hi> with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army. I felt ſome tender motions, when I ſaw theſe Towers, and <hi>Amurat</hi> redoubled then his Efforts to ſoften my heart but never found me Kinder, than <hi>I</hi> had been at <hi>Andrinople.</hi> Vexed at this, he would always threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me with your or <hi>Arianit</hi>'s death. I was often alarmed at his: But the truſt <hi>I</hi> had in the Valour of you both, diſſipated my Terrors, and kept up my Courage.</p>
               <p>One day after he had extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105648:71"/>
tormented me, he reſolved to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice me to that rage my unkindneſs had cauſed in him, he thought he ſhould forget me, when he ſhould ſee me no more; and being loath to uſe any other Executioner, than his loyal <hi>Orcan,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, worthy ſuch a Maſter, he wrote the Note to him, which you found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Aradin,</hi> and truſted it to an <hi>Eunuch. Aradin,</hi> who knew the exceeding and violent wrath of <hi>Sultan,</hi> obſerved all his Actions, and meeting the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who carried his orders to <hi>Orcan;</hi> he likely brought him out of the Camp, and fought him, having no other way to get his Note of him; I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but he went towards <hi>Croya,</hi> to acquaint you with my miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he was aſſaſſinated in the way by <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> who had never loved him, according to what he told me, after he had ſtolen me away, that he had already ſacrificed that paſſion to himſelf.</p>
               <p>I expected nothing good from <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi>'s Anger, and ſeeing <hi>Aradin</hi> no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I thought he had been arreſted by his Orders, as being too much affected for your Service and mine.</p>
               <p>As Paſſions are not always equally
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105648:71"/>
violent he had no ſooner ordered my death, but he thought with himſelf, how cruel this was like to prove to him; he ſent for the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> but he was no longer to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurat</hi> at laſt ſaw <hi>Orcan,</hi> who had not received his orders, and who had never approved it. Conſidering what advantage it would be to them to keep me alive, in a Country where the chance of War might not favour them always. <hi>Amurat,</hi> who had harkened to his own reaſons, more than to thoſe of <hi>Orcan,</hi> gave me leave to live, but ſwore he ſhould have no longer any reſpect for me.</p>
               <p>You know, my Lord, all the reſt that had paſt, my Father's captivity, your own Victories, and <hi>Muſſelman</hi>'s ſtealing me away; he broke open the Tent where I was carefully kept, killed many men, and carryed me away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance, aſſuring me, that to make amends for what he had done, his only deſire was to deliver me into your hands; I could not truſt him, but that diſcourſe flattered my hopes; that Traytor brought me away with all the immaginable ſwiftneſs, whilſt all the Camp was full of confuſion, and I loſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105648:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoon after the ſight of the Walls of <hi>Croya,</hi> and that of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Tents.</p>
               <p>You may judge, my Lord, of my grief, to fall from <hi>Amurat</hi>'s hands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Traytor's, whom no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had been able to divert from ſuch a dangerous attempt. I weeped, but all to no purpoſe, my Prayers were but in vain, he made me wander a long while, without letting me enjoy any reſt, and hurried me in that place, whether Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moved by my tears brought you in ſuch a Critical Minute.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs made an end of her Diſcourſe, <hi>Scanderberg</hi> ſhew'd how much moved he was at her ſeveral ſufferings; in the mean time, <hi>Aranit</hi> came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King, that the Turks forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd themſelves, and did intend to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them within few days; but <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg</hi> was no leſs formidable in his joy than in his ſorrow, and was not much frighted at <hi>Amurat</hi>'s deſigns.</p>
               <p>All the moments he ſpent with the Charming <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> were attended with happineſs, and joy. <hi>Thopia</hi> alſo, who feared no longer any Rival, nor the King's oppoſition againſt his Love, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a perfect Tranquility, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa</hi>'s Proteſtations aſſured him of.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Amurat</hi> grievouſly vexed to know his Enemy's perfect happineſs, offered him the Battle again, and made a new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to oppreſs him. <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> who was well acquainted with Fortune's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, was afflicted at it; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Scanderberg</hi> aſſuring her ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently of the Victory, render'd her leſs concerned at his departure.</p>
               <p>And really he triumphed again, but after ſuch a glorious and advantagious a manner, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, and weakned, dyed ſome days after for ſhame and diſpair, after his laſt defeat; <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was not then in a capacity to make War any longer, ſeeing the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army exhauſted, left <hi>Arianiſſa,</hi> and <hi>Albania</hi> in the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Scanderberg</hi>'s hands, and went to <hi>Andrinople</hi> to be proclaim'd Emperor there. <hi>Acomat</hi> being at liberty to do what he pleaſed, followed him and parted from <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> after he had promiſed him an everlaſting Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which he religiouſly obſerved, being neuter in all the Wars, between <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the King of <hi>Albania.</hi>
