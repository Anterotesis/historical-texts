            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erturbations are contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde, contrarye to reason or desires to much abounding in man.</p>
            <p>Phisitions affirme that chéerefulnes hath abyding in the Splene, Anger in the Gall, Lust in the Lyuer, and feare in the Hart: therfore it is better to slay then to plucke any thing out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, that is to alter the naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of man.</p>
            <p>Except there be passions and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations in man, there is no place for vertue: euen as there is no victorye, where as there is no aduersary: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be angry, to couet, to lust, is no offence. For it is necessary, that Perturbations should raigne, for the illustration of vertue: but an angrye, couetous &amp; lecherous man, deserueth great reproch. For albe-it we haue them, yet we must vse them well: And
<pb facs="tcp:28011:3"/>
therfore the end of our affections make them either good or bad. And thus brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the perturbations in generall.</p>

               <head>Of Pleasure, and hir partes.</head>
               <p>Pleasure is a certeine exultation, or an excéeding reioysing, sprounge of the euentes of things desired.</p>
               <p>Pleasure is of two sortes, one is saide of honest and good thinges, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of dishonest: In respect of honest things, it is called <hi>Voluntas</hi>: In respect of dishonest <hi>Voluptas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A wise man ought not to be puffed with pleasure: for it is the foode of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, it killeth the body, weakeneth the iudgement and taketh away vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>

               <head>Of Ill-will.</head>
               <p>Ill-wil is that which neuer speaketh wel, neither can take any plesure at the prosperity of anye man but hir owne: it is a token of an abiect &amp; seruile man, at an other mans prosperity to be grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or to reioyce at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hurt of any man: bicause the common state of mankinde is such, as none hath assuraunce of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall felicity. For Fortune is lyke glasse, which then may easily be broke, when it shyneth moste.</p>

               <head>Of Oblectation.</head>
               <p>Oblectation is a certeine bending, or inclination of the mynde, to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure gentle, and swéetely moliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yng the minde.</p>
               <p>This Oblectation in the beginning a man ought to restrayne by reason: For if it once come to a custome, it will easily come to a habite, and hauing got an habit in pleasure, impossible it is to put it away, and to be indued with vertue.</p>

               <p>If a wise man be defiled with this affection, it maketh him not only with pride to be puffed, but also ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Who immoderatly lyketh to praise him-selfe, is a good vice to make wise men sporte. As the shadow doth folow the body: so should Fame folow good déedes, it ought not to be hunted after.</p>
