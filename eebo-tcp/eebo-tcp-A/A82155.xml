            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>By Commiſſion from his highneſſe the Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>Henry Lyngen</hi> Knight, Collonell Generall of the ſaid Countie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O wave all miſconſtructions that may unhappily bee caſt upon our reall intentions in this preſent engagement, Wee thought it neceſſary to hint upon and publiſh ſome principles and motives that have induced us hereunto wherein wee ſhall bee very ſubmit in regard our fellow-Subiects even of the humbleſt fortunes and capacities are already not incenſible of them.</p>
            <p>After the ſtorme of the late Warre was blowne over, and the <hi>Scots</hi> calmed and retired within their owne confines, both they and wee in this vimdſall concernment ſtood at gaze, hoping to taſt of the ſweet and often promiſed fruits of the many Declarations and Proteſtations of the two Houſes and Armies for the ſettlement of the Kingdomes, Peace, Religion, Lawes, and His Maieſty in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime Rights with glory and ſplendor, equall to the beſt of his Progenitors.</p>
            <p>But our pregnant expectations herein miſcarried, for the King is iugled in the Ile of <hi>Wyght,</hi> barber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly miſuſed, traterouſly and deſperately conſpired againſt, being yet ſcarce a Priſoner of hope, his moſt Royall Conſort diſuorced, baniſht, and moſt of his Princely Race under an unnaturall reſtraine, the knowne and ancient Lawes (which are the principall ſecurity of the Subiects proſperity) diſpirret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and daily wounded by contradictory Votes and Ordinances upon every eſtates deſigne, Religion who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unioynted and in ſtead of a ſettled Peace, a Sciſmaticall Army is propagated with a propetuated ſupported of ſixty thouſand pound a Moneth, beſides Exciſe, Free-quarter, and imnumerable other vaſt and inſupportable preſtures, amongſt which wee cannot paſſe by the Arbitrary and uncontrolled power of the Committees and Governours of the ſaid Citie and County, by which our Purſes have, beene milked, our Perſons impriſoned, our Horſes taken away, our Cattle driven, and many of us plundred, and bloodily butchered at <hi>Kington,</hi> and elſewhere, without appeale or knowne Law whatſoever, and for the more firme intayleing of this uaſſalage upon us and our Poſteritie they have laid a foundation for the future of a new <hi>Militia</hi> to over-awe and and inſlave us to the Law-martiall for ever.</p>
            <p>Wherefore finding all their pretences in order to peace and ſettlement, to bee ſhaddowy (not to mention the Votes of new Addreſſes, whereby the doore of all pacification was lately bolted) and their dilatorie overtures ſtill to claſh with the Honour and Conſcience of his Maieſty, Wee have for the antecedeinge cauſes re-aſſmued our Armes and doe declare, that with the expence of our blood and uttermoſt hazard of our lives and fortunes wee will endeavour againſt all oppoſition whatſoever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint his Maieſty with glory and honour, to repeale the Queene from baniſhment, to enlarge the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Children under reſtraint, to eſtabliſh the true Proteſtant Religion, and knowne Lawes, to have a free Parliament, for the better ſettling of our differences, to preſerve the Union betweene us and the <hi>Scots,</hi> according to the Act of Pacification, and with the extirpation of all Arbitrary power nulling of all illegall Taxes, and disbanding of Armies, to obtaine a laſting well-grounded and honourable Peace, in perſuance of which ends (being fully authorized and encouraged by his Highneſſe the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Captaine Generall of his Maieſties Forces by Sea and Land, within the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> from whom the charge and Cammanded in chiefe of the City and County com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to Sir <hi>Henry Lyngen,</hi> (under Hand and Seale) We are confident that all the good and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subiects of this and the adiacent Counties, for we ſhall have others to their demirits will riſe and engage with us, or contrubute aſſiſtance to us, declining all obedience to any other authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in which engagement (wee by Gods grace) hope to demeane our ſelues, that the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall ſee wee ſquint not upon ſelfe-ends, but firmely fix our eyes upon the publike intreſt.</p>
            <closer>And ſo God ſave the King and bleſſe our endeavours.</closer>
