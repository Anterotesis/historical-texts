            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if it may be <hi>demonstrated</hi> (or made much more probable than the contrary) as I verily think it may: I. That it is

not repugnant to the government setled in and for the Church by the Apostles. II. That it is as complyable with the Reformation of any evill which we desire to reform either in Church or State, or the introduction of any good which we desire to introduce as any other kind of Government: And, III. That there is <hi>no</hi> Law, <hi>no</hi> Record of our Saviour against it: Then, I hope, it will not be thought an unreasonable Motion, if we humbly desire those that are in Authority, especially the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That it may not be sacrificed to Clamour, or over-born by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and though (which God forbid) the greater part of the Multitude should cry, <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie</hi>; yet our Governours would be so full of Justice and Courage, as not to give it up, until they perfectly understand concerning Episcopacy it self, <hi>Quid mali fecit?</hi>

Whereof I conceive this which follows is as clear a Demonstration, as any thing of this nature is capable of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this Government was received universally in the Church, either in the Apostles time, or presently after, is so evident and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the most learned adversaries of this Government do themselves confess it.</hi>

                  <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> in his Tract, <hi>De triplici Episcopatûs genere,</hi> confesseth in effect the same thing.

                  </gap>, and so advantagious to their adversaries purpose) had not the evidence of clear and undeniable truth enforced them to it. It will not therefore be necessary, to spend any time in confuting that uningenuous assertion of the anonymous Author of the Catalogue of Testimonies, for the equality of Bishops and Presbyters, who affirms, <hi>That their disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan long after the Apostles times:</hi> But we may safely take for granted that which these two learned Adversaries have confessed; and see, whether upon this foundation laid by them, we may not by unanswerable reason raise this superstructure;</p>

               <p>For so great a change, as between Presbyterial Government and Episcopal, could not possibly have prevailed all the world over in a little time. Had Episcopal Government been an aberration from (or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of) the Government left in the Churches by the Apostles, it had been very strange, that it should have been received in any <hi>one</hi> Church so suddainly, or that it should have prevailed in <hi>all</hi> for many Ages after. <hi>Variâsse debuerat error Ecclesiarum: quod autem apud omnes unum est, non est erratum, sed traditum. Had the Churches err'd, they would have varied: What therefore is one and the same amongst all, came not sure by error, but tradition.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very probably, from the consent of the Churches of his time, not long after the Apostles, and that in matter of opinion much more subject to unobserv'd alteration. But that in the frame and substance of the necessary Government of the Church, a thing alwayes in use and practice, there should be so suddain a change as presently after the Apostles times; and so universal, as received in all the Churches; this is clearly <hi>impossible.</hi>

               <p>For, What universal cause can be assigned or faigned of this <hi>universal</hi> Apostasie? You will not imagine that the Apostles, all or any of them, made any decree for this change, when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Testament, when they were dying, This were to grant the question; to wit, That the Apostles, being to leave the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches themselves, and either seeing by experience, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing by the Spirit of God, the distractions and disorders, which would arise from a multitude of equals, substituted Episcopal Government instead of their own. General Councels to make a Law for a general change,

for many ages there was none. There was no Christian Emperour, no coercive power over the Church to enforce it. Or, if there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the Christians of those times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not <hi>then</hi> learnt to <hi>fight</hi> for Christ) but their obedience to any thing <hi>against</hi> his Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learn't to <hi>die</hi> for him.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no power then to command this change; or if there had been any, it had been in vain.</p>

               <p>What device then shall we study, or to what fountain shall we reduce this strange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters and other Christians then, being the Apostles Schollers, could be generally ignorant of the Will of Christ, touching the necessity of a Presbyterial Government? Or, dare we adventure to think them so strangely wicked all the World over, as against knowledge and conscience to conspire against it?

In the mean time, while these things remain thus incredible, and, in humane reason, impossible, I hope I shall have leave to conclude thus:</p>
               <p>Episcopal Government is acknowledged to have been universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, presently after the Apostles times.</p>
               <p>Between the Apostles times and this presently after, there was not time enough for, nor possibility of, so great an alteration.</p>
