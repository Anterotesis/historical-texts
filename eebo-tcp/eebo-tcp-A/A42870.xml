            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Joy</hi> in the firſt five verſes; and it
ariſeth from ſeveral <hi>Springs,</hi> or <hi>Heads;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>Readineſs</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
in that ſolemn Religious Tranſaction,
Verſ. 1, 2. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us
go into the Houſe of the Lord, Our Feet ſhall ſtand
within thy Gates, O Jeruſalem.</hi> The People encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
one another to go up with the Ark, and even
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42129:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
animated the King to uſe no delays about it; <hi>They
brought It up with ſhouting, and with the ſound of the
Trumpet,</hi> 2 Sam 6. 15. The <hi>good King</hi> was glad to
ſee his <hi>Subjects</hi> ſo forward in that pious ſervice. And
indeed, it's matter of great Joy, to ſee a joyful har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Worſhippers</hi> in the Service of God, to ſee
<hi>Families</hi> and Houſholds encouraging one another to
ſerve the Lord, to hear <hi>Neighbour</hi> calling to <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>

(as Iſai. 2. 3.) <hi>Come and let us go up to the Houſe of the

Jeruſalem</hi> was <hi>Conjuncta ſibi pariter,</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>at uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

was divided,</hi> but they could all joyn together in
the ſame ſervice. Here was <hi>Uniformity</hi> without an <hi>Act.
Thither the Tribes went up, even the Tribes of the

for <hi>Cephas,</hi> it muſt needs make a <hi>Rupture</hi> in the

make eternal breaches in the <hi>Affections</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>3. From the due <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice</hi> in that
Religious City, Verſ. 5. <hi>There were ſet Thrones of
Judgment, the Thrones of the houſe of</hi> David. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
and <hi>Religion, Piety</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> went here hand
in hand.<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 16.</note> And this is matter of great <hi>Joy,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> go out and in together; <hi>Moſes Aaron</hi>'s
<hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>Aaron Moſes mouth.</hi> Theſe two, I mean,
<hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> are the two <hi>Pillars</hi> upon which

Injury, to the utter Ruin and Deſolation both of
Church and State.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Joy;</hi> next we come to
his <hi>Devotion.</hi> He firſt exhorts others to pray, <hi>Pray

and withal preſcribes them a Form, or Method
of Prayer to this purpoſe; <hi>Peace be within thy Walls,
and proſperity within thy Pallaces.</hi> I am to meddle

            <p>Now in handling of theſe, I ſhall</p>
            <p>1. Speak a word or two for the <hi>Explication</hi> of
the Text.</p>
            <p>2. A word to each <hi>Branch</hi> in particular; and ſo
ſhut up all with all with a ſhort <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be taken here in a twofold <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</hi>
'Tis a trite Obſervation, and I ſhall but touch
it. As it was (now that the Ark was brought thither,
and placed in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> that <hi>David</hi> had pitched
for it) the place of Gods Worſhip,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The place he had
choſen out of all the Tribes to put his Name there;</hi> as
it had the <hi>Tabernacle, and Oracles of God, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and Divine Service,</hi> Heb. 9. 1. ſo it muſt be
taken for the <hi>Church. Thither the Tribes went up, the
Tribes of the Lord, unto the Teſtimony of Iſrael,</hi> i. e.
to the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> which contained the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of Gods preſence</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 25.
21, 22. But then as it was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and had the <hi>Thrones of Judgment,</hi> where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<hi>Juſtice</hi> was adminiſtred to the <hi>Nation,</hi> verſ. 5.
ſo it muſt be taken for the <hi>State.</hi> Joyn both together,
and to pray for the <hi>Peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> is, to pray
for the <hi>Peace</hi> both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> in which we
live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42129:6"/>
2. <hi>Peace</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew Idiome</hi> is uſually taken for
all manner of <hi>Proſperity.</hi> And this is an <hi>Obſervation</hi>
as common as their Vulgar <hi>Salutation, Peace be unto
you,</hi> which is equivalent to that of ours, <hi>I wiſh you
all happineſs.</hi> Peace being ſuch a <hi>voluminous Bleſsing,</hi>
that it contains all other bleſſings (as it were) in its
belly. And hereupon they uſed the word upon all
occaſions, inſomuch, that it is ſometimes put, by a
<hi>Catachreſis,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>proſperous ſucceſs</hi> even of
<hi>Warr</hi> it ſelf. So 2 <hi>Sam. 11. 7. David</hi> demanded of
<hi>Uriah,</hi> How <hi>Joab</hi> did, and how the People did,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Concerning the Peace of
the Warr,</hi> that is (as our <hi>Tranſlators</hi> render it) <hi>How
the Warr proſpered.</hi> But here the <hi>Bleſsing of Peace</hi>
muſt keep correſpondence with the ſubject of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its twofold notion, <hi>viz. Jeruſalem</hi> as referred
both to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State. The Peace of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
under the firſt ſenſe, is the publique tranquillity
and quiet State of the <hi>Church,</hi> when it is not rent by
<hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> within, nor torn in pieces by
<hi>Perſecuters</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> without. <hi>The Peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
under the ſecond ſenſe, is the tranquillity of the
<hi>Weal-Publique,</hi> when it is free from <hi>inteſtine broyls,</hi>
and <hi>civil commotions</hi> at home; and from <hi>forrain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions</hi>
and <hi>Warrs</hi> abroad.</p>
            <p>3. It will not be amiſs to take notice of a twofold
<hi>Elegancy</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf; which carries in its own
boſom a <hi>ſecret,</hi> but <hi>ſerious</hi> Invitation to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
duty.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (whoſe peace we are exhorted to
pray for) doth ſignifie <hi>The Viſion of Peace.</hi> At firſt
it was called only <hi>Salem, Peace, Melchiſedech</hi> King of
<hi>Salem,</hi> that is, King of <hi>Peace; Heb.</hi> 7. 2. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

we <hi>ſee</hi> it, and bleſs God for it. O then, <hi>Pray for
the peace of this Viſion of Peace;</hi> that is, Pray for the
<hi>Continuance</hi> of it, that it may be long, and ever ſo.
<hi>And curſed be he that riſeth up again to build</hi> Jericho;
who ever he be that <hi>takes the Sword to that intent, let
him periſh by the Sword.</hi> That's the firſt <hi>Elegancy,</hi>
and ſo farr we can trace it in our own <hi>Language, Pray
for the Peace of the Viſion of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But the other <hi>Elegancy</hi> lies deeper in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
words of the Text, and is not renderable in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Tongue.</hi> Each word in the Original doth, as it
were, <hi>Eccho</hi> to his fellow in ſuch a delightful <hi>Parono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſia,</hi>
that a learned man affirms, There is ſcarſe ſuch
another piece of <hi>Rhetorique</hi> in the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Methinks the <hi>elegancy</hi> of
the words do (as it were) beſpeak the <hi>excellency</hi> of
the Bleſſing, <hi>Jeruſalems Peace;</hi> and the <hi>excellency</hi>
of the Duty, of <hi>Praying</hi> for it. And ſo I come now
from the Explication in General, to the Particulars of
my Text; <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Pray for Peace,</hi> and for this
Peace eſpecially, the <hi>Peace of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Pray. The effectual fervent Prayer of a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man availeth much,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> ch. 5. 16.
And the Apoſtle in that place ſhews us the ſoveraign
<hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Prayer; which for me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon here, would look as if I thought I were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42129:7"/>
preaching to an <hi>Heathen Auditory;</hi> and ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that theſe I talked to did not know it. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen;</hi>
the ſoul's climbing up by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Ladder</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven, and by it we converſe chiefly with God
while we are on Earth. A duty ſo <hi>incorporated</hi> into
Chriſtianity, that <hi>Prayer</hi> is that to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which
<hi>breathing</hi> is to other <hi>creatures. Qui per fidem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt,
ſpirant per preces</hi> (ſaith one;) they that <hi>live</hi>
by Faith, do <hi>breathe</hi> by Prayer; otherwiſe it is ſign they
are <hi>dead</hi> in ſin. It is a Chriſtians <hi>wreſtling with God,
and prevailing, Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. Such pious <hi>Lips</hi> drop
<hi>Balm</hi> upon the Countreys and places where they live;
and ſuch <hi>healing tongues</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them)
are a <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> Prov. 15. 4. And when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do thus break their <hi>Alabaſter-boxes</hi> to anoint their
<hi>Saviour</hi>'s feet, the ſmell of the perſume fills the houſe,
and the <hi>odours</hi> of theſe <hi>golden Vials aſcend up before
God,</hi> Rev. 5. 8. with 8. 4.</p>
            <p>Now then, if God alone can give Peace, and he is
the Author of it, (<hi>I make peace, and create evil,
ſaith God,</hi> Eſa. 45. 7. and, <hi>Thou Lord wilt ordain
Peace for us,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12.) then
certainly <hi>Prayer</hi> is the great <hi>Engine</hi> to draw down
<hi>Peace,</hi> to <hi>procure</hi> ſuch a bleſſing from Heaven, and
<hi>continue</hi> it to us when procured. They are <hi>praying
Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>pump</hi> hard, and ſtop the <hi>leaks,</hi> to
ſave the <hi>Veſſel</hi> from drowning, whileſt <hi>prophane</hi> ones
are faſt aſleep in the midſt of a ſtorm. <hi>What
meaneſt thou (O ſleeper?) ariſe and call upon thy
God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42129:8"/>
But every one that <hi>calls</hi> is not <hi>anſwered,</hi> Prov. 1.
28. There is a <hi>holy Art</hi> in Prayer, which none but
the truly <hi>ſpiritual Chriſtian</hi> is acquainted withall.
There muſt be <hi>Fire</hi> put to the <hi>Incenſe</hi> to make it
<hi>ſmoak,</hi> and this <hi>Fire</hi> muſt come from <hi>Heaven.</hi> If
God do not <hi>kindle</hi> his own <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> (as he did
<hi>Elijah's</hi>) it will not accepted.<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 38.</note> The great Art is to
fetch fire from heaven. As the <hi>Phoenix</hi> (they ſay)
by fluttering and clapping her Wings, ſets her <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatique
Reſt</hi> on fire: ſo ſhould a Chriſtian by
rouzing his <hi>Affections</hi> inflame his <hi>Devotions.</hi> It
is not the <hi>talking Tongue,</hi> but the <hi>flaming Heart</hi>
that God regards. <hi>To pray,</hi> and <hi>ſay ones prayers,</hi> are
two things; though they may be done both at once.
Look what the difference is between a <hi>Parrots,</hi> and
a faithful <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſaying of his <hi>Creed,</hi> and that
is the difference between a <hi>prophane</hi> and a <hi>pious</hi>
perſon's Prayers. The words may poſſibly be the
ſame, but <hi>by Faith Abel offered unto God a more
excellent Sacrifice than Cain,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. To make
Prayer <hi>effectual,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith it muſt be <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;</hi>
and that is reckoned by one among the four
hard labours,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Woman</hi> in travel, a <hi>School-maſter</hi>
in the School, a <hi>Commander</hi> in Warre, and
one that <hi>prays</hi> in the Church. There's many a
cold, earthly-minded Petitioner, that deals by
Prayer, as a child that ſnaps in a <hi>Fire-lock,</hi> and
quarrels becauſe it will not go off, when there is
nothing but <hi>Aſhes in the Gun.</hi> Their hearts are
charged with <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and they want heavenly <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
to drive their <hi>Supplications</hi> into Heaven. For
want of this it may poſſibly be, that ſome complain
they are not <hi>edified,</hi> and find fault with our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42129:8"/>
when they ſhould lay the blame upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
One and the ſame Duty may be like the

               <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 20.</note> that conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> towards
<hi>Iſrael</hi> a <hi>bright flame,</hi> towards <hi>Egypt</hi> a <hi>black clowd.</hi>
But let Prayer be fervent, and what wonders will
it do? Men may think, there are nearer wayes to
<hi>Peace,</hi> than by <hi>Prayer;</hi> the <hi>Arms</hi> of the mighty,
the <hi>Counſels</hi> of the wiſe, may do more good. But
certainly, it is much to be feared, that, if <hi>Prayer</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ruffia. hiſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. lib. 2. c. 9.</note> And it was an Argument how
much that great man <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, when, in the midſt of the <hi>Tumults</hi>

to you the practice of a late Reverend <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
of our own Church, Dr. <hi>Steward,</hi> who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>France,</hi> would have nothing written on his
<hi>Tombe</hi> but this, <hi>Quòd vivens aſſiduè oravit pro
pace Eccleſiae.</hi> A <hi>Monument</hi> (I take it) of greater
Honour, than any that could be faſtened on the
Tombes of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
or any of the World's <hi>Warriours,</hi> He lived (and
dyed) Praying for the Peace of the Church; which
minds me of my third Particular, <hi>The ſpecification</hi> of
this Peace, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Peace of Jeruſalem. Private</hi> Peace is
lovely, but <hi>publique</hi> Peace much more. It is good
to have Peace in a <hi>Family,</hi> but much better in a
<hi>Kingdom.</hi> And indeed, our private Peace is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
on the publique Peace. Our <hi>Countrey</hi> is
the <hi>Ship,</hi> and we the <hi>Paſſengers;</hi> if the Ship daſh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42129:11"/>
againſt a <hi>Rock,</hi> we muſt not look that either
our Perſons, Eſtates, or Religion, will eſcape
without <hi>wrack.</hi> And then the Peace of Church
and State is involved, and incircled one in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Viſion,</hi> there is a <hi>Wheel</hi>
within a <hi>Wheel;</hi> they move one in another,
and one with another; ſo, that if you diſturb
the Peace of one, you <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Peace of
both.</p>
            <p>1. If you pull down the <hi>Gates of Sion,</hi> the
<hi>Wall of Jeruſalem</hi> will fall after it. It was
the grand <hi>Policy</hi> of the late <hi>Anti-monarchical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
to ſecure their own <hi>Intereſts</hi> by laying
<hi>Sion</hi> in the duſt. No ſuch way (they thought)
to keep the <hi>Swine</hi> out of their own <hi>Incloſures,</hi>
as to turn them all into the <hi>Lord's Vineyard.</hi>
And becauſe the <hi>Height of Sion</hi> ſtood princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in their Light, they cryed out with the
<hi>Children of Edom in the day of Jeruſalems</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
<hi>Down with it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 137. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Down with it, even to
the Ground.</hi> But God hath turned the <hi>Wiſdom</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Achitophels</hi> into <hi>Fooliſhneſs;</hi> and others
(if they pleaſe) may now learn from them, <hi>That the
Peace of Jeruſalem is centred in the Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And as the <hi>Temple</hi> muſt not be pulled
down to build the <hi>Town-wall:</hi> ſo on the other
ſide, <hi>Jeruſalems Walls</hi> muſt not be demoliſhed,
under a pretence of <hi>repairing the Temple.</hi> King
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> never intended ſuch a <hi>Fanatical fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
as to deſtroy the <hi>Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi>
to make way for the ſetting up of <hi>His;</hi> but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42129:11"/>
took care ſo to have his own <hi>Rents</hi> paid him,
that nothing which is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Right</hi> might be
taken from him.<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Render to Caeſar the things
that are Caeſar's, and to God the things that are
God's:</hi> So that, whoever they are, that part what
God hath joyned together, diſturbing the <hi>Peace
of the Church,</hi> whileſt they would ſeem ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for the <hi>Peace of the State;</hi> or diſturbing
the <hi>Peace of the State,</hi> whileſt they pretend to
be endeavouring the <hi>Peace of the Church,</hi> they
are but <hi>Troublers of Iſrael,</hi> though they would
be thought to pray for the <hi>Peace of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now but a few words more to ſet the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
on, and make it <hi>practical.</hi> Since <hi>Jeruſalems Peace</hi>
is ſo great a bleſſing, and <hi>Prayer</hi> ſo powerful
a means for the continuance of it, That we
may not pray in vain, let us obſerve theſe few
Rules.</p>
            <p>1. Do not pray for the continuance of your
Peace for <hi>ſinful ends:</hi> O do not pray for Peace
to <hi>conſume it on your Luſts,</hi> leſt ye ask and
not receive. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye
ask amiſs, that ye may conſume it on your Luſts,</hi>
Jam. 4 3. I am afraid?, that many pray for Peace
upon no other account, but that thay may <hi>grow
rich,</hi> wax <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>wanton,</hi> and ſinne the more
ſecurely: That they may have Peace, What to
do? Why, <hi>To walk after the ſtubbornneſs of their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42129:12"/>
Hearts, and to add drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> Deut.
29. 19. Thus doe men <hi>proclaim Warre</hi> againſt
Heaven, even while they are <hi>Petitioning</hi> Heaven
for Peace. Whereas the great work of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is to improve <hi>temporal</hi> peace to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
and, in a time of Peace, to make ſure
of that <hi>Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note> which was made for us <hi>through
the Bloud of the Croſs.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> uſual Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was,<note place="margin">Biſh. <hi>Davenant</hi> on Col. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Peace be unto you;</hi> but the <hi>Apostles</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation,
is, <hi>Grace and Peace</hi> Let us pray for, not
a bare <hi>Jewiſh Peace</hi> without grace, but an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical
Peace,</hi> with grace annexed unto it. If
we could but make a <hi>Match</hi> betwixt theſe two,
<hi>Grace and Peace,</hi> we were the happieſt people in the
world.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Act</hi> in your ſeveral Stations for Peace, as
well as <hi>Pray</hi> for Peace: Chriſtians ſhould be
<gap reason="foreign">

make Peace,</hi> Jam. 3. 18. Alas! How many have
been <hi>Praying for Peace,</hi> when they have been
<hi>making of bate,</hi> and blowing the <hi>Trumpet of Warr;</hi>
at the ſame time when they have been <hi>Praying
for Peace?</hi> And when with their Lips they have
cryed out, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> the Prophet's character was
but too fitly appliable to them, <hi>The way of Peace
they have not known.</hi> They had the <hi>words</hi> of
Peace, but not the <hi>way</hi> of Peace. Let us have

               <hi>both,</hi> or we were as good have <hi>neither. Live</hi>
in peace (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and the God of Peace
ſhall be with you,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 11.</p>
            <p>3. Be ſure to keep up a <hi>continual Warr</hi> with
your ſins, as ever you do expect a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of your Peace.</hi> Sin is the grand <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
of Iſrael,</hi> the great <hi>Diſturber</hi> of all our
peace, External, Internal, and Eternal. Theſe
<hi>Luſts</hi> of ours are great <hi>Fighters,</hi> great <hi>Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi>
if you will believe St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.
11. <hi>Dearly Beloved, I beſeech you as Strangers
and Pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which
warr againſt the Soul.</hi> They warr againſt the
<hi>ſoul,</hi> but they warr againſt the <hi>State,</hi> and
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> too. <hi>Is it Peace, Jehu?</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Joram,</hi> 2 King. 9. 22.) But ſee his anſwer;
<hi>What Peace, ſo long as the Whoredoms of thy
Mother Jezebel, and her Witchcrafts are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi>
It is indeed the wonderful mercy of God
(conſidering the groſs <hi>Abominations, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>Impieties</hi> that the Land groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that we have any peace at all. Do we
live like a <hi>People</hi> that have been lately <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and ſo <hi>miraculouſly redeemed,</hi> that the World
ſtands amazed at it? Do we behave our ſelves
like a People that have <hi>ſeen miracles,</hi> that have
ſeen the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> dryed up, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
drowned, and have our ſelves gone through on
<hi>dry foot?</hi> Or rather, are we not like thoſe <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
who were no ſooner out of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi>

               <hi>and ſinned yet

or add <hi>new</hi> ſins to thoſe <hi>old</hi> ones. And may

take their turn againſt the Word of

right, who think, A <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Fool</hi>
are <hi>terms convertible.</hi> And what is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt a <hi>ſeduced Quaker,</hi> that would
ſerve God if he <hi>could tell how;</hi> and a <hi>prophane
Epicure,</hi> that is ſatisfied <hi>how</hi> he ought to ſerve
God, but <hi>will not?</hi> O kill this Atheiſm, theſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42129:13"/>
groſs Abominations, that will elſe undoubtedly be
the <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of our Peace.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, In all our Prayers for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi>
Peace, there are four things in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that
muſt not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>1. Forget not the <hi>Throne of David.</hi> Pray
heartily for his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that his <hi>Crown</hi> may
flouriſh on his <hi>Head,</hi> that his <hi>Sword</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
in his <hi>Hand,</hi> having <hi>Charles the Great's Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
upon it, <hi>Carolus Cuſtos decem praeceptorum,
Charles</hi> Lord Keeper of the Ten Commandements.
<hi>Our</hi> Life is bound up in the <hi>King's</hi> Life, our
<hi>Peace</hi> in his <hi>Peace.</hi> And therefore let not any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
Lips</hi> pray ſo for the <hi>King,</hi> as ſome
<hi>Male-contents</hi> did heretofore, whoſe very <hi>Prayers</hi>
for him were very <hi>Libels</hi> againſt him. Which being
ſo worded, that the Law might not ſpell <hi>Treaſon</hi>
out of them, were <hi>poured into the Ears of the
People,</hi> under a pretence of <hi>offering them up to
God.</hi> Whether <hi>God heard</hi> ſuch Prayers or no, it
mattered not, they were ſure <hi>the People did;</hi> and
it was from that <hi>great Idol</hi> they principally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
an anſwer to their <hi>Petitions.</hi> Let me ſhew
you <hi>a more excellent way</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who
gives us the ſubſtance of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi>
Prayers, even for <hi>Heathen Emperours;</hi> and what
would they have done, if they had had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

pray, for them, <hi>Vitam prolixam, Imperium ſecurum,

               <hi>Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. Forget not the <hi>Seats of Judgment,</hi> that
they may be filled up ſucceſſively, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

know, and practiſe, better than I can teach you;
but I would willingly teach the <hi>People their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
to you; of which, Prayer for you is not the
leaſt. The Apoſtle wills, that <hi>Prayers and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
be made for Kings, and for all that are in
Authority,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2. And as we are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our ſelves to the <hi>King as Supreme,</hi> (I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how that Title came to give offence,) ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
unto <hi>Governours that are ſent by him, for
the puniſhment of evil Doers, and for the praiſe of
them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 14. As therefore our
Saviour tells his Diſciples, Luk. 10. 16. <hi>He that

Commiſſion from him: ſo by the ſame Reaſon,
he that deſpiſeth you, <hi>deſpiſeth him that ſent you,</hi>
that is, his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Pray then for the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi>
Pray for the <hi>Judges,</hi> that God would aſſiſt them,
and give them a meaſure of his Spirit proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their work.</p>
            <p>3. Forget not the <hi>Teſtimony of Iſrael;</hi> that is,
the <hi>Church.</hi> And what can we pray for in her
behalf more ſeaſonably, than, That God would
<hi>heal all our Breaches,</hi> and <hi>unite,</hi> if not all our
<hi>Heads,</hi> yet all our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and fill up every <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick</hi>

in their Lives, as well as <hi>Preachers of Truth</hi>
in their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>4. Laſt of all, Forget not the <hi>Tribes of Jacob;</hi>
Pray for them, the whole Body of the People, that
they may be,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Unanimous;</hi> not any longer divided in
<hi>principles</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> in hearts and affections, but
all as <hi>one man</hi> ſtanding up in the Cauſe of God
