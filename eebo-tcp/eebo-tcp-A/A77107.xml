            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat your Petitioners Father being a ſervant to the late King, was unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged with him, in the firſt war againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament were pleaſed to invite all thoſe who were engaged with the ſaid King to leave him, promiſing thereupon to paſſe by and remit the offence by them committed, ſo that by a day certain they would return to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners Father having not been engaged above halfe a year dyed about Michaelmas 1643. which was before the day of Grace and Favour appointed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, your Petitioner being then under the Age of 3. years.</p>
            <p>That immediately after the death of his Father, your Petitioners Mother being in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> where your Petitioners land lies, was by ſeverall proceſſe iſſuing out of the Court of Wards ſent unto, and by them threatned, that unleſſe he would find an Office and compound for the Wardſhip of your Petitioner, that the Wardſhip of your Petitioners body and Eſtate ſhould be granted away, which was uſuall in ſuch Caſes, as Councell did then informe.</p>
            <p>That in obedience to the ſaid Court, he did find an Office, and Compound with the ſaid Court, paid and ſecured a fine of 200 l. took a Leaſe of the Lands of your Petitioner during his Minority under the Great Seal, which Office and the charges thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, the fine, the paſſing of the Leaſe, and the rent which hath been payed, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted unto more then a Compoſition would have come unto, had he Compounded according to the rules then ſet.</p>
            <p>That Councell did adviſe that your Petitiones Father dying before the day of coming in, that the offence was excuſed, and my Lord <hi>Say</hi> being then Maſter of the Wards, did promiſe that upon payment of this fine, the Sequeſtration ſhould be taken off, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected an Order to the Committee of <hi>Kent,</hi> to free the ſame from Sequeſtration.</p>
            <p>The Committee of the County of <hi>Kent</hi> informed, that they could not free the Eſtate from Sequeſtration, but directed, that application ſhould be made to the Committee of Lords and Commons for Sequeſtrations, where having attended 2. years, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was diſſolved.</p>
            <p>That ſince he hath applied to the Barons of the Exchequor, where after a years atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance he was referred to Goldſmiths Hall, where the cauſe lately coming to hearing, he was directed for relief to this Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>The attendance hereupon hath bin for this 6. years, in which your Petitioner hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended above 400 l. and the Eſtate in poſſeſſion is not worth above 50 l. and in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not above <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
