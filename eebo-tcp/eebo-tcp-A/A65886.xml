            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>I. Concerning the true Worship and Meetings which God hath called us to; and of what he hath called us from.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>LORD GOD</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered us by his <hi>mighty Power</hi> out of the worlds <hi>Ways, Worships</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> which were never set up by the Power of God, and <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world, which are made and set up by the <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> who preach for <hi>filthy lucre</hi> and <hi>gain</hi>; which thing was ever <hi>abhorred</hi> and <hi>denyed</hi> by all the <hi>true Ministers</hi> and <hi>holy People</hi> of the Lord, who <hi>feared God</hi> and <hi>hated Covetousness</hi> in all Ages; as also we are brought by the Power of the Lord God <hi>out</hi> of the Worlds <hi>Temples,</hi> or <hi>Houses,</hi> (which are falsly called <hi>Churches</hi>) and brought into the Worship of God, which is <hi>in the Spirit</hi> and <hi>in the Truth,</hi> Joh. 4. VVhich Worship <hi>Christ</hi> taught, when he foretold the end of that Worship which was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in the Temple which once God commanded to the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law; which, with the <hi>outward things</hi> that pertained to it, and to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Worshippers</hi> in that <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (as outward <hi>Musick, Instruments, Singing, Tythes, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>) were all to <hi>cease,</hi> as <hi>Figures,</hi> or <hi>Types,</hi> when a more <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>mysterious Way</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> in the Spirit was brought in and revealed by Christ, to the Saints and Christians of the <hi>New Testament</hi>; who (as they grew in the power of God to enjoy the <hi>enduring Substance</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi>) they grew out of these <hi>outward things</hi> (that were but as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures) into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>glorious Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of its <hi>Fellowship,</hi> which <hi>outshined</hi> and <hi>transcended</hi> all these <hi>shadows</hi> under the Law. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. &amp; chap. 10. which <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> and <hi>Mystery</hi> we are come to know and witness, to the praise and glory of our God. And to this Testimony did the holy Apostles and Ministers of Christ bear large Witness; as did the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he preached Christ (whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to hear in all things; and he that would not hear,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58917:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was to be cut off, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.37. and 3.23.) and called them <hi>stiff-necked</hi> and <hi>uncircumcised in hearts</hi> and <hi>ears</hi>; who were in their blind zeal for the <hi>outward Temple,</hi> and so witnessing to Christ the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of the Temple, He told them, <hi>The most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands</hi>; and for his Testimony he was stoned to death, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.47, 48, 51. And so we being brought to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>learn</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> the Prophet, whom the People were to hear <hi>in all things,</hi> lest they were destroyed; and being made a <hi>spiritual house, Church,</hi> and <hi>living Temples</hi> in which God dwells and walks according to his Promises, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. who hath brought us out from the <hi>Idols Temples, false Worships</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi>: we may not <hi>uphold</hi> nor <hi>joyn with</hi> that <hi>Worship</hi> that is upheld in these places, which the world calls <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> which God never commanded nor set up; but the <hi>Papists</hi> and such as were <hi>apostatized</hi> from the Life of the Saints into men's <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi>; neither ought the Magistrate to <hi>compel</hi> us to these places of <hi>Worship</hi> against our Consciences; but as it is the just duty of the Civil Magistrates to punish evil-doers, and to be a praise to them that do well, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 14.) So they ought rather <hi>to protect</hi> (than hinder) our <hi>peaceable Meetings,</hi> which are in the <hi>Worship</hi> into which God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us by his Spirit.

            <p>ALso the <hi>PRIESTS</hi> have <hi>often said</hi> in their <hi>Confessions, that they sin in their best Performances,</hi> as in <hi>their Preaching, Praying</hi> and <hi>Worshipping</hi>; and that they had need to pray, <hi>that the sins of their holy Duties,</hi> and <hi>iniquities of their Holy things may be forgiven</hi>: from which it follows, that they may pray for <hi>Forgiveness</hi> all their life-time, and be <hi>no better,</hi> in that they sin in their <hi>praying,</hi> or <hi>holy Duties,</hi> as they <hi>confess</hi>; so that alwayes when they <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>preach,</hi> they sin, and have the sin thereof to crave <hi>forgiveness</hi> for; And therefore it is contrary to our Faith to joyn with them in their <hi>sinful worship</hi> and <hi>performances,</hi> or to give them <hi>money</hi> for them: for the <hi>true Ministers</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> performed their Duties to the Lord <hi>in his Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and preached the <hi>Truth</hi> as of <hi>sincerity</hi>; and <hi>as of God,</hi> so spake they <hi>in Christ,</hi> in whom is <hi>no sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.</p>

            <head>X. Of the Trade of their Preaching.</head>
            <p>ANd so we finding the Priests, both of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Episcopal men</hi> (so called) so much <hi>in error,</hi> both as to the manner of their <hi>Education</hi> to their <hi>Ministry,</hi> and in <hi>covetous practices, envy, pride,</hi> and <hi>false worship,</hi> we have just cause <hi>to deny them,</hi> who are brought up to be <hi>Teachers</hi> as <hi>natural men</hi> to a <hi>Trade,</hi> and make a <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Preaching</hi> (and so serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies) And this appears the more against the Priests, in that when I <hi>queried</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Scholars</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> about their Degrees: viz. <hi>Why they have these names, Batchelers of Arts, Masters of Arts, Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Divinity, Doctors of Divinity?</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58917:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shewed <hi>what Trades-men they are.</hi> Also, <hi>Sixty one Priests</hi> in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> in their <hi>Seasonable Exhortation</hi> (as they call it) directed to their <hi>Congregations,</hi> They say in the Third Particular, <hi>That other Causes and Symptomes of God's Wrath hanging over their heads, is, The frequent disappointment from time to time of all hopes of coming to any settlement in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Nation, occasioned by strange Confusions</hi> (which they say) <hi>is a clear Evidence, that God hath in displeasure darkened their eyes, and hid Counsel from them,</hi> &amp;c. From which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, 1. That the Priests <hi>depend</hi> not upon the Lord for <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>maintenance</hi> in their Trade of Preaching, but upon the <hi>Magistrates.</hi> 2. And when they think the Magistrates are at any time like to fail them, then their <hi>hearts</hi> begin to <hi>fail</hi> them, and <hi>fear</hi> surprizes them, as when they, called <hi>Protectors</hi> &amp; their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> were overturned; after which time the <hi>Priests</hi> made this sad Complaint. 3. The <hi>Wrath</hi> of God <hi>hanging</hi> over the <hi>Priests,</hi> and God having in <hi>displeasure</hi> darkned their eyes, and hid <hi>Counsel</hi> from them; we may not go to <hi>follow them,</hi> nor seek <hi>Counsel</hi> at them from whom it is hid.</p>
            <p>But some will object and say, <hi>We know that the National Ministers are corrupt enough in their Practices, and that they are proud and covetous; but we must do as they say, and not as they do: What have you against their Doctrine</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Their <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>evil practices</hi> give occasion <hi>enough</hi> for them to be <hi>denyed</hi> and turned <hi>away from</hi>; as the Apostle commanded, to <hi>turn away</hi> from such <hi>as have a form of Godliness, but deny the power,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. and the Lord hath called <hi>to come out from among such,</hi> and <hi>be ye separate, and touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, and I will receive you saith the Lord:</hi> But the <hi>Priests</hi> of the Nation do not only <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> in their <hi>Practices,</hi> but also the <hi>true form of Godliness</hi> in their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> as they are in errors about the principal things that partain to Salvation, as is hereafter shewed concerning the Principles of the Priests and Professors, both of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Independents,</hi> and others of the same root, who have long been in fashion and esteem in the Nation, in many of whose Principles, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> men (who for a time have been lesse in fashion) are one with them.</p>

               <p>And now with the Light of the Lord (who it is that fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth the Child in the womb) are we come to see the two Seeds, and the two Births; the one of which is shapen in <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and <hi>conceived in Sin,</hi> and this the Judgment and Hatred of God follows, and takes hold upon; but the other hath the Lord <hi>covered in the womb,</hi> and <hi>written all its Members in his Book when they were not fashioned,</hi> Psal. 139.

But in opposition to these Oaths, as ending them, Christ said, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 5.33, 34. Now he that sweareth by Heaven, <hi>sweareth by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon,</hi> Matth. 23.22. So that, from Christ's Command, we are now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58917:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to swear by neither: And the Apostle <hi>James</hi> (as confirming to the same Testimony) said, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, swear not, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, left you fall into condemnation,</hi> Jam. 5.12. And as to that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. where it's said, <hi>For men verily Swear by the Greater, and an Oath for confirmation, is to them an End of all Strife</hi>; which the the Priests object for <hi>Swearing.</hi> In this they are very dark; for the Apostle doth but mention this, as a Practice which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were under the Law, and such as were in the Strife, but he gives no Command for <hi>Swearing,</hi> neither doth he vindicate it, any more than he doth <hi>receiving of Tythes,</hi> in his saying, <hi>here men that die receive Tythes, Heb.</hi> 7.8. which was but a mentioning that as a practice which the <hi>Jews</hi> upheld, as was the other of <hi>Swearing</hi>; for he witnessed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment disanulled, by which Tythes were received, and the Priesthood changed by which they were upheld, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12, 18.

               <p>ANd neither do we ever read in Scripture, That Christ's Ministers did give the people of the world <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in a <hi>Steeple-house</hi> at certain times of the year, and call it <hi>a Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Communion,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and preach it up so to continue in the Church, as the Priest do. Herein do the Priests make an Idol of outward Bread and Wine, and keep people in <hi>shadows</hi> instead of bringing them to the <hi>substance</hi>: For, 1. they have no proof in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to call Bread and Wine a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but from the <hi>Papists.</hi> 2. The <hi>true Communion</hi> stands not in outward Bread and Wine, but in the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, which is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of outward Figures and Shadows. 3. The Bread and Wine which the Priests give People in Steeple-houses at <hi>Easter,</hi> and <hi>Appointed times</hi> (like the <hi>Papists</hi>) cannot be the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; for Drunkards, Covetous, Proud and prophane Persons, who are in their sins (and so <hi>eating at the Table of Devils</hi>) can receive their pretended Sacrament of Bread and Wine, who cannot eat at the Table of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. nor come to his Supper, as <hi>to sup with him, and he with them,</hi> as they do who open to him when he knocks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20. 4ly. Neither is it proper to call a little Bread and VVine (which people receive on the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) a Supper, it being more like a Dinner; for in this the Priests are both out of the Form of Christ, and the Saints Practice, and out of the Power; for it was in the Night in which Christ was betrayed that he was at Supper with his <hi>Disciples,</hi> (not with the VVorld) and gave <hi>Them</hi> (not the VVorld) the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup, to shew forth his Death till he come:</hi> And at his Supper he ate the <hi>Passeover</hi> with them, according to the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. which the Priests do not so much as truly imitate: but the <hi>Passeover,</hi> and these outward things were but Figures, and to cease as other Figures under the Law were, which Christ passed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58917:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through in the dayes of his flesh, and fulfilled them, <hi>and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the hand-writing of Ordinances, and nailed it to his Crosse.</hi> So that after Christ had suffered and fulfilled the Figures [that related to that state under the Law] and did manifest his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the Power of his <hi>Resurrection in the Saints,</hi> these Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Figures were not of force by a Law, though some of the Churches did use them for a time by permission; But the Apostles laboured to bring them from off these Shadows and outward things, to the <hi>knowledge of the Mystery of Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>; for, said the Apostle, <hi>If ye be dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the World, why as though living in the World are ye subject to Ordinances, &amp;c. Touch not, tast not, handle not, which are all to perish with the using, after the Commandments and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men,</hi> Col. 2. Eph. 2.15. So Christ through suffering made way for a further dispensation of the Mystery of Life, than was in the Shadows or Figures; and they who were come into this Mystery, were come to witness, that the <hi>Bread which they brake, was the Communion of the Body of Christ; and the Cup which they drank was the Communion of the Blood of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. and <hi>Christ the living Bread is in the Saints,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. and we are come <hi>to sup with him, and he with us,</hi> and so are come to his Table and his Supper, which <hi>Drunkards, Covetous Worldlings</hi> and <hi>Earth-worms</hi> [who can receive the Priests Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament so called] cannot eat nor drink at; and by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Mystery, which is <hi>CHRIST WITHIN,</hi> are we come to see beyond the Shadows and Figures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Traditions and Inventions of men, which the world are doting about; And we may not turn back again, from the <hi>Substance</hi> into the <hi>Shadows,</hi> nor into the <hi>Traditions</hi> of men, like the world, nor yet eat with them in their <hi>Idol-Temples,</hi> (or <hi>Popish Mass-houses</hi>) contrary to the Apostle's Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>

natural Learning to be according to the Scriptures and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the true Ministers, then have they fled to that of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.

               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were <hi>Elders</hi> in the true Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. but they were not brought up at <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colledges</hi> to their Ministry; neither did they say, <hi>that Revelation and Prophecying was ceased,</hi> like the Priests, but were <hi>Fishermen,</hi> who through following <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Life and Power,</hi> came to be <hi>fishers of men,</hi> and <hi>true Ministers</hi>; so that such as are out of their Doctrine, Life and Spirit, as the <hi>hireling Priests</hi> are, who are set up and ordained by the wills of men as corrupt as themselves, are neither fit to ordain others, nor to minister to others.</p>
