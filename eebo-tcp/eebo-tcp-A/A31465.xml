            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Malice Defeated: Or a Brief Relation of the Accuſation and Deliverance OF Elizabeth Cellier.</head>
            <p>I Hope it will not ſeem ſtrange to any Honeſt and Loyal Perſon, of what way or Religion ſoever, that I being born and bred up under Proteſtant Parents, ſhould now openly profeſs my ſelf of another Church.</p>
            <p>For my Education being in thoſe times, when my own Parents and Relations, for their Conſtant and Faithful <hi>Affection to the King and Royal Family, were perſecuted,</hi> the King himſelf Murthered, the Biſhops and Church deſtroyed, the whole <hi>Loyal Party meerly for being ſo, oppreſt and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined</hi>; and all as was pretended by the Authors of theſe Villanies, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſts and Idolaters, the conſtant Character given by them <hi>to the King and his Friends to make them odious,</hi> they aſſuming to themſelves only the Name of Proteſtants, making that the Glorious Title by which they pretended Right to all things.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſort of Proceedings, as I grew in underſtanding, produced in me more and more horrour of the Party that committed them, and put me on Inquiry into that Religion, to which they pretended the greateſt Antipathy, wherein I thank God, I found my Innate Loyalty, not only confirm'd, but encourag'd; <hi>and let Calumny ſay what it will,</hi> I never heard from any Papiſt, as they call them, <hi>Prieſt nor Lay-man,</hi> but that they and I, and all true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, owe our Lives to the defence of our Lawful King, which our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sovereign <hi>Charles</hi> the Second is, whom God long and happily preſerve ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſorts of Doctrines agreeing to my Publick Morals, and no way as ever I was taught, contradicting my Private ones, commending at the ſame time to me, Charity and Devotion, I without any ſcruple, have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to followed, glorying to my ſelf to be in Communion with thoſe who were the humble Inſtruments of His Majeſties happy Preſervation, from the fatal Battel at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and whom though poor, no Temptation could envite, to betray him to thoſe, who, by a pretended Proteſtant Principle, ſought his Innocent Blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe Truths I hope, may ſatisfie any indifferent perſon in my firſt Change, nor can they wonder at my continuance therein, notwithſtanding the Horrid Crimes of Treaſon and Murther laid to the Charge of ſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98195:3"/>
perſons conſiderable, for their Quality and Fortunes in that Party.</p>
            <p>For when I reflected <hi>who were the Witneſſes,</hi> and what unlikely things they depoſed and obſerved, that many of the chiefeſt Sticklers for the Plot, <hi>were thoſe, or the Sons of thoſe,</hi> that acted the principal parts in the laſt Tragedy, which Hiſtory told me too, had the Prologue of a pretended Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p>I ſay, theſe things made me doubtful of the whole; and the more I ſearch'd for Truth, the more I doubted that the old Enemies of the Crown were again at work for its deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I being fully confirm'd in this, thought it my duty through all ſorts of hazards to relieve the poor impriſon'd Catholicks, who in great numbers were lock'd up in Goals, ſtarving for want of Bread; and this I did ſome Months before I ever ſaw the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> or any of thoſe Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons that were accuſed, or receiving one penny of their money direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly, till about the latter end of <hi>January</hi> (78.) the Priſoners increaſing very much, and being in great wants, I went at the requeſt of Captain <hi>Pugh</hi> then in priſon, with his Letter to her Ladyſhip, to make known their condition, and alſo to ſhew her a Letter written by <hi>Titus Oats</hi> his own hand, being</p>
            <div type="narrative">
               <head>A Narrative</head>
               <p>Of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Beddo</hi>'s Acquaintance in <hi>Spain,</hi> and how <hi>Beddo</hi> under the Name of the Lord <hi>Gerrard,</hi> robb'd <hi>Oates</hi> of ten pieces of Eight, which he ſaid was all he had, and had quite undone him. And alſo, how <hi>Beddo</hi> cheated Maſter <hi>Francklyn</hi> the Merchant at <hi>Bilbo,</hi> of three hundred Doubloons, at 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Doubloon, and in his way to <hi>Bruges,</hi> robb'd a poor Prieſt of four Royals, which he ſays, is about Eight pence <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and cruelly beat him becauſe he had no more money, and after that, the ſame day, robb'd a poor <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryar of his Bread and Cheeſe, and that there were Writs out in the nature of an Hue and Cry to take him; and that the ſaid <hi>Oates,</hi> though quite ruined by the loſs of his money, yet was not half ſo much griev'd at it, as for the diſhonour that was thereby done to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>This Letter was read before the King and Council the laſt time Maſter <hi>Medborn</hi> was brought thither, and by him delivered to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Lautherdale,</hi> in whoſe hand it ſtill remains.</p>
               <p>I alſo gave her Ladyſhip an account, that the moſt part of the foregoing year, <hi>Beddo</hi> lay priſoner in the Common ſide in the <hi>Marſhalſeas,</hi> and was fed out of the <hi>Alms-basket,</hi> having ſold his Linnen and other neceſſaries to the Sutler for Bread and Drink.</p>
               <p>After this her Ladyſhip taking the diſtreſſed condition of the Priſoners into her Conſideration, through her pious and charitable Endeavours, there was a weakly Charity collected, of which I had the diſpoſing, but was ſo far from the diverting any part thereof, that I ſtill went out of Purſe, of which truth, both the Priſoners and others have been very ſenſible ſince my Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>About this time I went daily to the Priſons, to perform thoſe Offices of Charity I was obliged to. And on <hi>Thurſday, January</hi> the 9<hi>th</hi> (78.) I Din'd in <hi>Newgate,</hi> in the Room called the <hi>Caſtle</hi> on the Maſters Side
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98195:3"/>
Debtors, and about four in the Afternoon, I came down into the Lodge with five Women, of which, three were Proteſtants, and we all heard Terrible Grones and Squeeks which came out of the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> called the Condemn'd hole. I asked <hi>Harris</hi> the Turnkey, what doleful Cry it was, he ſaid, it was a Woman in Labour. I bid him put us into the <hi>Room</hi> to her, and we would help her, but he drove us away very rudely, both out of the Lodge, and from the Door; we went behind the Gate, and there liſſened, and ſoon found that it was the voice of a ſtrong man in Torture, and heard, as we thought, between his Groans, the winding up of ſome Engine: theſe Cries, ſtop'd the Paſſengers under the Gate, and we ſix went to the Turners Shop without the Gate, and ſtood there ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the Horror and Dread of what we heard; when one of the Officers of the Priſon came out in great haſte, ſeeming to run from the Noiſe,</p>
               <p>One of us catcht hold of him, ſaying, Oh! What are they doing in the Priſon.</p>

               </sp>
               <p>We heard theſe Groans perfectly to the end of the <hi>Old-Baley</hi>; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till near ſeven of the Clock, and then a perſon in the Habit of a Miniſter, of middle Stature, gray hair'd, accompanied with two other men, went into the Lodge, the Priſoners were lock'd up, and the outward door of the Lodge alſo, at which I ſet a perſon to ſtand, and obſerve what ſhe could; and a Priſoner loaded with Irons, was brought into the Lodge, and examin'd a long time, and the Priſoners that came down as low as they could, heard the perſon examin'd with great Vehemency, ſay often, <hi>I know nothing of it, I'm Innocent: he forc'd me to belye my ſelf, What would you have me ſay? Will you murther me becauſe I will not belye my ſelf and others</hi>?</p>
               <p>Several other ſuch like Expreſſions they heard ſpoken as by one in great Agoney. About four of the Clock the next morning, the Priſoners that lay in a place above the Hole, heard the ſame Cry again two hours, and on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning again, and about eight a Clock that morning a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I employ'd to ſpy but the Truth of that Affair, did ſee the Turn-keys carrying a Bed into the Hole, ſhe asked who it was for, they told her it was for <hi>Prance,</hi> who was gone Mad, and had tore his bed in pieces. That Night the Examiners came again, and after an hours Conference, <hi>Prance was led away to the Preſs-yard</hi>: This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many things of the like Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made me very Inquiſitive to know what paſs'd in the Priſon.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, <hi>Francis Corral</hi> a Coach-man, that had been put into <hi>Newgate,</hi> upon Suſpition of carrying away Sir <hi>Edmund-bury-Godfrey's</hi> body and lay there 13 weeks and three days in great Miſery, got out, I went to ſee him, and found him a ſad Spectacle, having the Fleſh worn away, <hi>and great Hole in both his Legs,</hi> by the weight of his Irons. And having been Chain'd ſo long double, that he could not ſtand upright; he told me much of his hard and cruel Uſage, as that he had been ſqueez'd and haſped into
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98195:4"/>
a thing like a Trough in a Dungeon under ground; which put him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Torment, inſomuch that he ſoonded, and that a perſon in the Habit of a <hi>Miniſter, ſtood by</hi> all the while. That a <hi>Duke</hi> beat him, pull'd him by the Hair, and ſet his drawn Sword to his Breaſt three times, and ſwore he would run him through; and another great <hi>Lord,</hi> laid down a heap of Gold, and told him it was five hundred pounds, and that he ſhould have it all, and be taken into the aforeſaid <hi>Duke</hi>'s Houſe, if he would confeſs what they would have him; and one <hi>F.</hi> a Vinter, that lives at the Sign of the half-moon in <hi>Ch-ſi,</hi> by whoſe Comtrivance he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, took him aſide, and bid him name ſome Perſon, and ſay, they imploy'd him to take up the dead body in <hi>Somerſet-yard,</hi> and gave him money for ſo doing; that if he would do this, both <hi>F.</hi> and he, ſhould have money enough. He alſo told me, that he was kept from <hi>Thurſday</hi> till <hi>Sunday</hi> without Victuals or Drink, having his hands every Night chain'd behind him, and being all this time lock'd to a Staple which was driven into the Floor, with a Chain not above a Yard long, that in this great Extremity, was forc'd to drink his own Water; and that the Jaylor beat his Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe brought Victuals, and prayed that he might have it, and threw Milk on the Ground, and bid her be gone, and not <hi>look at him,</hi> &amp;c. For the Readers further Satisfaction of his great and cruel Sufferings, I refer to the Party himſelf now living in <hi>Gunpowder-alley</hi> in <hi>Shoe-lane,</hi> and well known by his Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>After this, hearing that <hi>Mary White</hi> had been much abus'd, and though big with <hi>Child,</hi> ſeveral ways tortur'd in the Priſon, and lay only for want of her Fees, I paid them, hoping to find out the Truth by that means, ſhe told me of many Cruelties that were daily uſed in the <hi>Goal,</hi> and that there was a perſon there that by Misfortune had been catch'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Coyners, and though wholly innocent, had been cruelly uſed, becauſe, <hi>as ſhe ſaid,</hi> he was a Catholick, and for a week together had worn a pair of Sheers that weighed forty pound, becauſe he would not go up to the <hi>Chappel.</hi> That this perſon had made it his Buſineſs to inſpect the Uſage of the Priſoners, and had drawn up <hi>Articles</hi> againſt the Keepers.</p>
               <p>About the tenth of <hi>April</hi> (79) I went to the Grate at <hi>Newgate,</hi> to ſpeak with him, he was in Irons and Raggs, and ſaid his name was <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and that he was Nephew to a perſon of Quality I knew of that name; And with great bemoanings told me that being juſt come from <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was lodg'd by Chance in a houſe where <hi>Coiners</hi> lodg'd; he was taken among them on Suſpition, and though acquitted at the Seſſions, yet the Diſgrace had ſo diſpleas'd his Uncle, that he would do nothing for him, and he having no Parents nor Friends, was in great Danger of periſhing there, and in very humble and religious words begg'd my Charity, and gave me the following</p>

               <p>That about a year ſince was in cuſtody, as a Convict for Tranſportation, one <hi>Elizabeth Evans,</hi> who had given in Bail to the Recorder to Tranſport her ſelf, according to the form of the Pardon, but was ſo indebted to the

Gaol, as he pretended, that ſhe could not raiſe moneys for the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſends for the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> and often requeſted her to refer her ſelf to him, (to the end he might make good his Market with the Merchant) which ſhe did, but when he brought a Maſter of a Veſſel to take the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> away, ſhe refuſed to go, and told the Gaoler, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give her the Fees and turn her out; but that now ſhe did perceive 'twas only to expoſe her to Sale, which ſhe would not conſent to, upon which refuſal, the Jaylor forthwith ordered her to the Condemn'd Room, there to be double Iron'd, and kept without ſuſtenance, or any converſe, till his farther Order, which came not in two days, then he himſelf exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her again, whether ſhe would conſent, but ſhe refuſed, and then the Jaylor thought fit to employ ſome other Engines of his Tyranny, amongſt which, was a certain thing (by him called a Cap of Maintenance,) which was fixed to her head with a thing like the Rowel of a Spur, being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Mouth, cleaves to the Roof with ſuch extream Torture, that is not to be expreſt; this the Woman endured ſeveral times, till at laſt, by making her Addreſs to ſome good people, and telling the manner of her uſage, they did contribute to the Gaolers demands, and ſo ſhe with great difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her Liberty.</p>
               <p>That the Jaylor has ſuffer'd perſons after a Commitment,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Perſons whoſe Names are on the Margent, either are or have been Sufferers in this, or ſome part of this kind, which may be eaſily produced to give Teſtimony according to the Truth, and no more.</p>
               <p>Theſe Articles were put into Parliament that <hi>April,</hi> and they with the Priſoners Caſe, were referr'd to the Judges, where they ſtill remain; and the poor Priſoners are yet in hopes, that their Honours will find a time to Examine both, ſome there affirming, there have been many more cruel things acted in that Manſion of Horror, as the Story they tell of one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Clarke,</hi> who being Priſoner only for Debt, was lock'd up in a little dark hole two days and two Nights, having no other company but the Quarters of two Executed perſons, the extream ſtench of which had perhaps kill'd him, had he not took the miſerable relief of holding a foul Chamber-Pot to his Noſe.</p>
               <p>Upon my receipt of the Articles, I gave <hi>Willoughby</hi> two ſhillings ſix pence, for which he was very thankful, ſaying, <hi>He had eaten nothing in two dayes</hi>; and upon his frequent ſolicitations for Relief, I did ſend him at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, whilſt he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſixteen ſhillings, and no more, till the day he went out, and then I ſent him money to pay his Fees by my Maid <hi>Margaret Jenkins,</hi> and did pay ſixteen ſhillings by her hand to fetch his Coat out of Pawn.</p>
               <p>And about that time, having been told by Mr. <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> then Priſoner in the Kings-Bench, that <hi>William Stroud</hi> there Priſoner, pretended to know much of the Plot, and had Papers in his Cuſtody, that would proved <hi>Beddo</hi>'s actions to be Villany, and a Letter of <hi>Beddo</hi>'s own hand-writing, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he knew no more of the Plot, but what he had from his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>; nor did he ever ſee Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> alive or dead, and that it was very eaſie for him the ſaid <hi>Stroud,</hi> to be inſtructed, and become the Kings Evidence, if he were willing.</p>
               <p>A Copy of this Letter <hi>Stroud</hi> gave to Mr. <hi>Keymiſh,</hi> and I received it from him, he ſaying moreover, That <hi>Stroud</hi> told him, that the Earl of S. was inſtructing of him, and ſetting him up for a new Evidence, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, did daily ſend one <hi>Johnſon</hi> a Servant of his Lordſhips, to meet him in the Lodge, as many perſons are ready to teſtifie upon Oath; and that the ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> frequently brought him money, with promiſes of Pardon for the Murther he was then Condemn'd for, and promiſed him <hi>Great Preferments if he would ſwear ſtoutly</hi> what he ſhould be inſtructed in; but that the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> ſaid, he would not Forſwear himſelf for all the world, but when he was Sworn for a Witneſs, he would tell the Truth, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all <hi>Beddo</hi>'s Villany.</p>
               <p>I believing this to be meer Roguery, invented to inſnare Mr. <hi>Keymiſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> did pay <hi>Willoughbys</hi> alias <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Fees in <hi>Newgate,</hi> intending to ſet him upon the diſcovery of it, and he being at that Inſtant arreſted, I removed him by <hi>Habeas-Corpus</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and ſent my Maid <hi>Margaret</hi> to him to bid him get acquainted with <hi>Stroud,</hi> and uſe his utmoſt Endeavour to obtain a ſight of the Papers, and find out the truth of the tranſactions between the Earl of S— and <hi>Stroud. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby</hi> then acknowledged that he had been a Criminal, but expreſt much ſorrow for his paſt Crimes, and made great proteſtations of future Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaying, that <hi>Stroud</hi> and he had been long acquainted, and <hi>that they often had been a Robbing together,</hi> and he doubted not to Effect what I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And in order to it, would keep him company, and every day ſet down what he could get out of him.</p>
               <p>On the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he was carried to the <hi>Bench,</hi> and on the 20<hi>th</hi> ſent me this following account of that affair by <hi>Magaret Jenkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 13<hi>th, Stroud</hi> did acquaint me, that about 15 years ſince he knew <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who was then ſervant to <hi>Alderman Blackwel</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and was ſo Poor, he had ſcarce Shooes and Stockings to his Feet; but <hi>Strode</hi> denyes he ever ſee <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſince, till he and <hi>Oates</hi> came to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to view the Priſoners, and once ſince that Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> came with his Brother, who was the night after wounded. He denies the holding of any correſpondence with Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> either by Letter or otherwiſe, but ſayes that one <hi>Philip Marſh</hi> (who is either a friend or a Servant to Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> (is his friend) that is to ſay, <hi>Strodes</hi> friend) and that they ſaid <hi>Phillip Marſh</hi> has often ſent Letters to <hi>Strode,</hi> in which Letters it has been deſired that the anſwers thereto ſhould be left at <hi>Bedlows</hi> lodging; but the Contents of the ſaid Letters either were not worth while to repeat, or he was unwilling ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 14. 1679. <hi>Strode</hi> told me this day, that <hi>Bedlows</hi> occaſion of giving him Money was to the intent he ſhould conceal ſomething he knew of <hi>Bedlow,</hi> which if diſcovered, would be of conſequence enough to hang him, if proſecuted on the ſame; and the ſums which <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſent him were the greater, for that <hi>Strode</hi> ſhould take particular notice of the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Prieſts which are here, and who they did correſpond with; which <hi>Strode</hi> has done, and has ſent ſome to follow divers perſons which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98195:6"/>
have come to Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> which perſons and their abodes, are as <hi>Strode</hi> ſayes, well enough known, and hereupon ſwore <hi>Damn his ſoul,</hi> if they ſhould not be better known if ever he could obtain his liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 15. <hi>Strode</hi> acquainted me, that either his buſineſs was either paſt, or in great probability ſo to be; and when he could get his enlargement, there were ſome in the world ſhould ſoon feel the effects of his fury: But amongſt the reſt, Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who as <hi>Strode</hi> ſaid, was very uncertain of ever being ſo near his liberty; but if there be ever any probability for <hi>Anderſons</hi> liberty, <hi>Strode</hi> makes no doubt but to prevent the ſame. By this I find <hi>Strodes</hi> thoughts to be laden with venome (as having been thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his temper by ſome of the <hi>Catholicks</hi>) and to his power he deſigns a Revenge on them, but for what I know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 16. <hi>Strode</hi> did this day acquaint me, that his wife had in a <hi>Cabinet</hi> at home in the Country, the original papers which concerned Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and when he can be at liberty to go home, he will be very brisk in expoſing the ſaid matters contained in the ſaid papers to a publick view; but whileſt he remains in cuſtody, he will not impart the ſaid matters to any perſon whatſoever, for that he will not bring himſelf under Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> Laſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 17. <hi>Strode</hi> did tell me, that one Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> (a Servant to the Right Honourable Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>) did often come to viſit him, and bring him Guinneyes, in order to the prevailing with him for to joyn Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Bedlow</hi>: but <hi>Strodes</hi> anſwer was (as he informed me) that he would not perjure himſelf for Ten thouſand worlds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 18. <hi>Jones (Strodes</hi> Bedfellow) did inform me, that he had this day ſeen in <hi>Strodes</hi> hands ſome papers which did contain the whole matter of the Popiſh Plott, in a more plain manner than either <hi>Oats</hi> or <hi>Bedlow</hi> could make out.</p>
               <p>And that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s ſervant (whoſe Name was Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>) came often to <hi>Strode,</hi> to Court him to give his Teſtimony againſt the Lords in the Tower, and had offered <hi>Strode</hi> moſt conſiderable ſums of money if he would do the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 19. <hi>Jones</hi> did tell me, <hi>Strode</hi> had in ſome diſcourſe informed him, that <hi>Bedlow</hi> in the time of his Padding was entertained at <hi>Strodes</hi> houſe, and particularly when there had been a Robbery committed but a day before, and at the ſame time a Hue and Cry was all over the Country to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him: And that it is not long ſince that <hi>Strode</hi> ſent to his wife at <hi>Shepton Mallet</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> for the Copies of ſome Writings which were in her Cuſtody, which ſaid writings are the original of thoſe he ſhewed <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 20. <hi>Jones</hi> ſayes, <hi>Strode</hi> has often prayed his advice what to do in a matter of ſuch weighty Conſqeuence as was to be made out from the aforeſaid papers: <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered him, that in regard he was in Reverſion of a good Eſtate, and had divers good and honourable Relations to ſupport him, it would perhaps be much more both for his Credit and advantage to be ſilent in things of ſuch a nature than to ſtir, unleſs he could make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular thereof viſible by a lively Teſtimony. Upon which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>Strode</hi> did promiſe to let it fall, rather than run the hazard of diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Relations and Friends, and become altogether obnoxious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98195:7"/>The foregoing informations, written by <hi>Willoughby</hi>'s own hand, were found between the Pewter in my Kitchin by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> when he ſearch'd my Houſe, <hi>and by him Carry'd before the Lords of the Council</hi>; and as the Father of Lyes did once tell truth, ſo he hath inſerted <hi>this one truth</hi> in his lying Narative.

                  <hi>Thomas Hill</hi> Gentleman maketh Oath, That <hi>William Stroud,</hi> Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> did about <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> (79) very much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune this Deponent to Joyne with him, the ſaid <hi>Stroud, Oates</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> to be the Kings Evidence, <hi>and to ſwear that the Queen and their Royal Highneſſes, the Duke and Dutcheſs of</hi> York, <hi>and the Lords in the</hi> Tower, <hi>were</hi> Traytors, <hi>and Guilty of the Plot</hi>; and the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> told this Deponent, that it ſhould be worth two or three Thouſand Pound to him, and his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for ſo doing; and the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> told this Deponent and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent him <hi>what money he would ſpend</hi> for the Carrying on of the Plot againſt the Duke and Lords in the <hi>Tower:</hi> And that his Lordſhip ſent a ſervant of his, called Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> very often to Incourage and Drink with the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> in the Lodge, and gave him money, <hi>as the ſaid Stroud told me.</hi> There alſo came a Steward of his Lordſhips, called Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edward Stroud,</hi> to hear what the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> would <hi>ſwear againſt the Duke and the Lords in the Tower</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lordſhip would procure the ſaid <hi>Strouds</hi> Pardon: Since then, the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> hath made Affidavit to the ſame purpoſe, where he nameth his Royal Highneſs and the Dutcheſs; and his Confederate <hi>Dangerfield</hi> got an order to bring this Deponent before <hi>Stephen Harvy</hi> and <hi>Thomas Poſter</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, about the 9th of <hi>December</hi> (79) to come and take an Affidavit of this Deponent, ſaying, the ſame would much corroborate the Evidence the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had given corncerning the Plot, and what the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> had Depoſed alſo, and that the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in purſuance thereof, did urge and perſwade this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent to ſwear to the ſaid <hi>Strouds</hi> Affidavit, and would not let this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent read the ſaid <hi>Strouds</hi> Affidavit; but the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> did both read the ſaid <hi>Strouds</hi> Affidavit, and alſo write what this Deponent ſaid, <hi>but he omitted reading that which concern'd the Duke and Dutcheſs of York,</hi> and ſo thought to put a trick upon this Deponent, and bring him in as an Evidence againſt them, but that Juſtice <hi>Foſter</hi> did eſpie it, and ask'd this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent concerning the particulars <hi>relating to the Duke and Dutcheſs,</hi> and then this Deponent truly ſwore he never heard their Names ſo much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning the Plot. Since that, the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> hath ſet out a Narrative where he mentions this Deponents Name in ſeveral particulars, which is very falſe; he hath alſo ſworn againſt Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi> in his tryal, where he mentions this Deponents Name to that which is very falſe. The 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> or thereabouts, <hi>William Stroud</hi> came to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and told this Deponent before another Gentleman, that if he had joyn'd with him, <hi>Dangerfield, Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> in giving in his Evidence againſt <hi>the Queen, Duke and Dutcheſs, and Lords in the Tower,</hi> he had been free from all his Troubles, and His Debts paid; but ſince he did not do it, <hi>he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98195:7"/>
ſhould ſuffer Impriſonment all his life, and in a worſe Place</hi>; and that very night this Deponent was lock'd up in a little hole <hi>under Ground,</hi> and hath ever ſince been much oppreſt; and further this Deponent ſaith, he hath been very much perſwaded not to appear at Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> tryal, and ſeveral have uſed means to the contrary, but this Deponent being Subpoena'd thereunto, is obliged to ſatisfie the truth therein, and will ſwear this Affidavit before a Judge, and carry it into Court, it being a Brief of what he hath already ſworn before Sir <hi>George Jeffreys.</hi>

               <p>And after my Lords Steward and <hi>Mr. Edward Stroud</hi> was gone, I asked the Priſoner <hi>Mr. William Stroud,</hi> how he could carry it ſo fairly with <hi>Mr. Anderſon,</hi> when I knew he had given in Articles againſt him; he told me, he durſt do no otherwiſe than what he did, becauſe if he did not do it, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> would not get him his Pardon out, he being under a Reprieve for Murther at that time.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Ann Moſeley</hi> do teſtifie, that I have heard <hi>William Stroud</hi> often ſay, that he could <hi>hang Bedlow if he would,</hi> and that he was maintained by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to come and Evidence againſt the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi>: That <hi>Johnſon</hi> my Lord <hi>Shaftsburys</hi> Man, threatned him from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that his Pardon ſhould be obſtructed, if he did not joyn evidence with <hi>Bedlow</hi> againſt the Lords, although he ſaid, if he were ſubpoena'd in, as infallibly he ſhould, he would then declare my Lord <hi>Shaftsburys</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with him.</p>
               <p>Other times I have heard him ſwear, that being ſo importuned from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> by his man <hi>Johnſon, he was now reſolved to ſtick at nothing, nay for an hundred Pound, he would ſacrifice his own Father and Mother.</hi> As for <hi>Mr. Anderſon,</hi> I do believe that what he alledges againſt him, as offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him five hundred Guinneys, is falſe, for to my knowledge, he always ſhunned him as a Devil, knowing him from his firſt Impriſonment to be a great Rogue; but <hi>Mr. Anderſon</hi> being an abſtimious melancholy man, drank nothing but ſmall Beer, which <hi>Strode</hi> after a Debauch always Coveted, threatning, that he would hang him if he denied him; this I have often heard <hi>Strode</hi> ſwear: I have often ſeen <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and been in his Company with <hi>Strode,</hi> as alſo ſeen monys which <hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> gave him, to all this I am ready to ſwear, which I gave <hi>Mr. Bedlow</hi> notice

               <p>I being often in the company of <hi>William Strode,</hi> amongſt other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, hapning to talk of the riſe of ſome men, he the ſaid <hi>William Strode</hi> did often ſay, that they were beholden to their own Induſtry, and that if he were out of Priſon, he would not make any ſcruple for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds to Sacrifice any Perſon, nay his Father for a conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and that he was kept here for a Spie, as he ſaid himſelf; and hath ſhewed me Silver and Gold, which he ſaid he received from one Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s man, and of one Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> for ſuch Service. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Marſhal finding it fit to remove <hi>Strode</hi> out of his Chamber, and place Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi> in it, he was ſo tranſported with Rage, that he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gallery to me, and ſwore that he would be Revenged: Nay, that he would ruin Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi> with the firſt opportunity. And this I took the more notice of, becauſe he hath ſwore to me, that nothing Sacred ſhould tie him to Truth or Lie, farther than to gratifie his Gain or Revenge, and gloried in other Murthers he ſaid he had Committed beſides that he had his Pardon for, which is the averment of a Perſon of unſpotted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that is not willing to be expos'd in Print, but is ready to make Oath of it when thereto required.</p>
               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies I hope may ſatisfie an indifferent perſon, that <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> once writ Truth.</p>
               <p>After this, he frequently by <hi>Margaret</hi> and others, ſent his humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to beg the Charity of his Inlargement, proteſting that he never would attempt an ill thing again, but would get a Service, and take any pains for an honeſt Livelihood: and upon his reiterated Intreaties, I collected ſome monys for him, and did pay five Pounds to buy off the Debts he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not a Penny more, as appears by the General Releaſes from his Creditors, which were taken among his Papers, and carried before the Council.</p>
               <p>And the day he came out of Priſon, I did give him, not five Pounds as he ſays, but 10 ſhillings, that he might not ſteal for want of bread, and at the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Tryal, did employ him as a Meſſenger to go up and down to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98195:8"/>
fetch Victuals and Drink for the Witneſſes, to wait on them, and to help them into Court, call Coaches, and other ſuch like Services, which he performed ſo well, that ſeveral perſons asked me, <hi>whoſe diligent Footman he was,</hi> for indeed, being in an old Frize-Coat lin'd with Blew, Blew Stockings and Breeches, and a Grey Hat tuckt up, to prevent flapping about his Ears, he could not well be taken for any other than an ill clad Footman, though now he be <hi>Dubb'd Knight of the Poſt, and wear a Pearl in his Ear,</hi> to ſhew that the Executioners were kind to him, and did not Nail his Ears to the Pillory, neither at <hi>Salubury, Wilton, Winborne,</hi> nor any of the other places where he was Mounted upon the Wooden Engine, and peep'd through it like <hi>Don Quickſot</hi> through his Helmet, when he was mounted upon <hi>Roſinant,</hi> and going to encounter with the <hi>Windmil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About that time I ſent for him to <hi>Powis</hi> Houſe, and there told him in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Henry Nevil</hi> alias <hi>Paine,</hi> that now I would put it into his power to be an honeſt man, if he had a will to be ſo; and would get him either an Enſigns place under the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was then preparing to go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or elſe an Imployment to go to Sea: he made choice of the later, which while they would enquire; for my Husband ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Thouſands of Pounds due to him, which was ſo deſperate, that I could never make any thing of them; he told me he underſtood ſuch buſineſs, and doubted not to get in many of them if he had but a Suit of Cloaths, a Hat, and ſome few neceſſaries, that he might be in a condition to follow them, which he promiſed to do very diligently. I conſidering he could not wrong me, for that no perſon would pay mony without my Husbands diſcharge: And that he having no other buſineſs but to perſue the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, it was poſſible he might get in ſome of them; I agreed with him, that he ſhould have ſix ſhillings in the Pound for what he received, and did give him a Stuff Suit, a Hat, Shooes and Stockings, and a little Linnen, all which coſt about 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> and accordingly he proceeded, and did get in ſome mony, and Bail'd out ſeveral Priſoners, and very often would bring me News of the great Deſigns of the Factious, and that they talked Treaſon publickly in the Coffee-houſes. I encouraged him to keep them company, and learn what he could of their Practices, in order to diſcover them to His Majeſty; and I having heard by ſome very Eminent among them, that heided with them, only to break their Meaſures, that they had drawn Forces into the City whilſt His Majeſty was ſick at <hi>Windſor,</hi> with intention to ſubvert the Government; and that if His Majeſty had died, which at that time was the fears of the Loyal, and hopes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, they would have knock'd the Lord Mayor of th' head, with ſuch Aldermen as would not Conform; and that by the help of their Partizans in thoſe places, they doubted not but to have been Maſters of the <hi>Tower, Portſmouth, Dover</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> and moſt places of ſtrength within the Kingdom, and that the <hi>Scots</hi> would advance to their help, with much more to the ſame effect, which I gave in my Depoſitions before the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>And having been inform'd by <hi>perſons to whom they had been preffer'd,</hi> that <hi>Manſel</hi> and <hi>Waller,</hi> did both offer Commiſſions to disbanded Officers, with promiſes that they ſhould enter into <hi>preſent Pay,</hi> and adviſed them, and all honeſt fellows, to linger about the Town, for there would ſoon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98195:9"/>
be hot ſervice; and having alſo heard that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſaid Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Southwark,</hi> before perſons of conſiderable quality, <hi>That there would be a Rebellion before Michaelmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe diſcourſes being then almoſt General, made me the eaſier Credit him in particulars, as that in order to this deſign, many of the <hi>Old Rump Officers were new rigg'd,</hi> and had Penſions paid them by the Gentlemen of the <hi>Kings head Club,</hi> and that Commiſſions were given out by the Relicts of the Rump, under the names of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England</hi>; and that he was promiſed one among them, and had ſeen ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that they were made of Parchment with thirteen Label Seals: I incouraged him to go on, and gave him money to defray his Charge, and bid him obſerve their Actions and Deſigns, and write down his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they might be made known to His Majeſty; and be ſure to write nothing but the Truth, for one Lie would diſcredit all the Truths he told.</p>
               <p>After that, he writ down at ſeveral times, that which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found by Sir <hi>William Wallet</hi> in my <hi>Meal-tub,</hi> and as what I did was truly in Zeal for His Majeſties Service, ſo that very night he came to Town from <hi>Windſor,</hi> I went to the Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and acquainted him with it, and he preſently handed us to his Royal Highneſs, to whom <hi>Willoughby</hi> delivered the foreſaid Paper, to be given to His Majeſty, and His Majeſty was pleaſed to give it to <hi>Mr.</hi> Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Willoughby</hi> to attend upon Collonel <hi>Halſal</hi> with what further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he could make, and ordered him forty Pounds, the better to enable him to proceed therein.</p>
               <p>About this time the tranſactions concerning Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> happened, and I believing then, <hi>as I ſtill hope,</hi> that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> abhorring the diſloyal Practices of thoſe he called Friends, was willing to come into the Kings Intereſt, and help the Government againſt thoſe that ſo ſubtilly ſought to deſtroy it: I then made the meeting between the Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> at <hi>Mr. Gadburies</hi> houſe, and did afterwards go with Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to the Duke, and his Royal Highneſs received him kindly, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> made Proteſtations to ſerve His Majeſty faithfully for the future, as <hi>I hope he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part it was no motive but my Loyalty and Duty to His Majeſty, and Love to Truth and Juſtice, that ingaged me in this affair, believing I ſhould do His Majeſty good ſervice, by bringing back as many as I could of the <hi>Incenſed or Miſled, to their Duty</hi>; and I cannot yet think I erred in ſo doing. About the later end of <hi>September, Dangerfield</hi> daily brought me Stories of the great preparations of the Factious, and that they publickly owned their Treaſonable deſigns, and that the Parſons, <hi>Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Alſop,</hi> and the reſt of that Gang, made great Collections amongſt the Brethren, in order to the carrying on their Rebellions Deſigns; and that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had three hundred Horſemen privately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quartered in Town, that would be ready for Action in an hours warning; and was the Party that ſhould lead up the Rabble of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to ſeize <hi>White-Hall:</hi> That the City was ready to Riſe, and expected only the word from the <hi>Confederate Lords.</hi> About this time <hi>Willoughby</hi> got drunk, and pick'd a quarrel at the <hi>Rainbow-Coffee-houſe</hi> with one <hi>Keyniſton,</hi> about Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98195:9"/>
thereby made himſelf obnoxious to the Republicans; and having loſt the hopes of obtaining a Commiſſion for himſelf, he then ſought to get one by means of other perſons, and then ſwore, <hi>God Dam him,</hi> now the Papiſts will give him no money, <hi>he would go to the Presbyterians, and they would give him enough</hi>; but of this I then knew nothing, and he ſtrictly charged thoſe he treated with in this affair, not to tell me any thing of their Proceedings, as appears by the Oath of <hi>Thomas Curtis,</hi> taken before Juſtice <hi>Warcup, vide,</hi> the ſaid Affidavit in <hi>Dangerfields</hi> firſt Narrative, Pag. 72, 73.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> he pretended, that by Information from a Perſon that by his order haunted Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Club at <hi>Weſtminſter Market-place,</hi> he underſtood that ſeveral Treaſonable Papers importing the whole deſign of the Factious, were kept in a houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that if he could get a Warrant, and ſearch that Houſe, he doubted not but that he ſhould lay open the whole Conſpiracy, and in order to it, he went to his Majeſty to pray a Warrant, and was by his Majeſty referr'd to Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> but Mr. Secretaries great wiſdom made him ſuſpect him and his <hi>Shallow contrivance,</hi> inſomuch that he would not give him a Warrant, but I, as I ſaid before, being induc'd to Credit him <hi>in thoſe things which related to the ſame ends, others not inconſiderable among them had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd with me,</hi> and being zealous to have the danger plainly Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it might be prevented, did upon his complaining that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd a Warrant, adviſe him to go by the Cuſtom-houſe way, which he did, and the ſeiz'd the Papers, which I ſuppoſe were eaſie to be found, being in all likelihood put there by himſelf, in order to his being digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the Magnificent Title of the Kings Evidence.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 22 of <hi>October</hi> (79) <hi>Willoughby</hi> was taken Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and went upon Bail till <hi>October</hi> the 24, which day I having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and heard much talk of him and his Plot, came home and found him at my Houſe, he came to me, and pray'd to ſpeak with me, for that he was going before the Councel after Dinner; and did believe he ſhould be Committed.

               <p>That Night I was not at home, but the next Morning hearing Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> intended to be at my Houſe, I made haſt home to meet him, and about Noon he came and made a diligent ſearch among my Papers, and told me, I muſt go along with him to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> I replyed,</p>

                  <p>I have no buſineſs with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip have any with me, he might have ſent one of his Servants to tell me ſo, and I would have waited on him, as I am ſtill ready to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being had before a Juſtice of Peace. — <hi>But what Authority have you to carry me thither</hi>?</p>

                  <p>You are a dangerous Woman, and keep corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Traytors, and harboured the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths—I took them out of your Houſe.</p>

                  <p>What if I did? they came over at His Majeſties command and therefore I preſume it was no Crime to Lodge them.—And none can be properly call'd Traytors, but thoſe that are Convict of Treaſon; And do you know any ſuch I keep correſpondence with? <hi>I am ſure I know none.</hi>

                  <p>Have you any Authority to offer them to me? I ſuppoſe you have none except here were another Juſtice preſent; but if there were, I am a Forreign Merchants Wife, and my Husband, both by the General Law of Nations, and thoſe of this Kingdom, ought to remain unmoleſted both in his Liberty and Property, till a breach happen between the two Crowns, and the King hath declared as much in his Royal Proclamation, and if you violate the Priviledges my Husband ought to have as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-ſtranger, the King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Subject my Husband is, has an Ambaſſador here, by whom we will complain to His Majeſty, and I hope we ſhall obtain Redreſs.</p>
                  <p>If your Husband and any other perſon will paſs their word for your forth-coming, I'le leave you here till I come back from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They paſs'd their words for me, and he went away and left me, preſently after <hi>Willoughby</hi> ſent for <hi>Suſan Edwards</hi> my Servant to the Priſon, and he Howled and Lamented to her, and ſent me a long Epiſtle; I have forgot the words now, but the Effect was, that he had been Tortured that Night, yet would be Torn in pieces rather than bely me, or any other <hi>Innocent Perſon,</hi> and deſired to know what I was accuſed of, or by whom, and what <hi>Waller</hi> ſaid to me: Then I ſent her to him again with the following Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have ſaid you were taken into my houſe to get in deſperate Debts. They bring me to</hi> L. S. <hi>They will ask me who encouraged me to go to him, I will ſay it was you, it cannot worſt you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I ſaid, becauſe it was Truth, which I always thought the beſt way to defend my Life and Fame. Upon the Receipt of this Note he made great Lamentations to her, expreſſing his fears of being Hang'd or Starv'd there, but told her, though he had been proffer'd great Advantages, yet he would Periſh rather than do any ill thing; and pray'd her to ſpeak to me, that he might have Victuals ſent him from my Houſe daily, <hi>And that I would ſend him a promiſe of it by her of my own writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this I perceiv'd he was already a Rogue, and endeavouring to get ſomething of my writing, to make ill uſe of, I then Conſidered, that if I refus'd to promiſe him Victuals, I gave him an occaſion to commit Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany for want of Bread; and therefore bid her tell him, that I would take order at my houſe that he ſhould have Victuals ſent him every day, as he had when he was under the Meſſengers hands. And to aſſure him of it, ſent him the following words under my hand. It being a Motto my Parents had uſed, and I my ſelf alſo, 
<q>I Never Change.</q> 
Knowing that if he were honeſt, that was enough to ſatisfie him: If a Rogue, not enough to do me any miſchief.</p>
                  <p>About nine a Clock at Night Sir <hi>William</hi> came again, and found me at Supper with ſome Friends, but was very Civil, and would not diſturb us; and about Ten he ſent me to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> with a Note to <hi>Church</hi> to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98195:11"/>
Lodg me in his own houſe; the Cauſe expreſt in my Commitment, being for <hi>Harbouring and Correſponding with Traytors; though he could not tell me who they were, nor when Convicted of Treaſon</hi>; and for refuſing the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, <hi>which were never tender'd me.</hi> All that night he and his Crue kept their Rendevouz in my houſe, tearing and pulling down the Goods, and filling his own and his Footmans Pockets and Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with Papers of Private concern, which he never carry'd before the Councel, nor as yet reſtor'd, though ſome of them be of <hi>Conſiderable value.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next morning <hi>his Worſhip</hi> ſent to know how I did, and to tell me, if I thought he could do me any ſervice, he would come and viſit me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, if he could, I knew he would not, and therefore deſired him to ſpare his pains and my trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> the laſt of <hi>October,</hi> I brought my ſelf to the <hi>Kings-bench</hi> Barr, in hope to be Bail'd; but then at the Barr, <hi>Church</hi> oppoſed it, ſaying, <hi>His Worſhip</hi> had ſent in an accuſation <hi>of high Treaſon againſt me,</hi> though I had as yet no Accuſer; <hi>And by the Law, no perſon ought to be committed for Treaſon, till accuſed by two honeſt, ſufficient, lawful, and credible Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, witneſſing one and the ſame Individual Fact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> the firſt, I was examin'd before His Majeſty and the Lords of the Councel, where <hi>the Fable of the Husband-man, and the ſtarved Snake, was proved a Truth</hi>; for <hi>Willoughby</hi> accuſed me of all the Forged Stories he tells in his Lying Narrative; and I unfeignedly told the Truth, and the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth. But the Lord Chancellor told me, no body would believe a word I ſaid, and that I would Dye.— To which I replyed, <hi>I know that my Lord, for I never ſaw an Immortal wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in my life:</hi> And then kneeling down, ſaid,</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
                  <p>I beſeech your Majeſty that I may not be Tortur'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>The Law will not ſuffer it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
                  <p>Such things are frequently done in <hi>Newgate</hi>; and I have more reaſon to fear it than any other perſon, becauſe of what I have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Keeper, and therefore I beſeech your Majeſty, If at any time I ſhould ſay any thing contrary to what I have now ſaid, that you will not believe me, for it will be nothing but lies forc'd from me by <hi>barbarous uſage,</hi> what I have now told you, being the truth, and the whole truth, to the utmoſt of my knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Then I was ſent away to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the next day was brought again before the Councel, and then a Lord ſaid, <hi>Turn up your hoods Mrs. Cellier,</hi> I did ſo; The Lord Chancellor ask'd me, if I had not been at the <hi>Tower</hi> to tell of <hi>Willoughby</hi>'s Commitment, and bring inſtructions for him.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
                  <p>I proteſt I have not been at the <hi>Tower</hi> Since. — Then the Lord Chancellor Interrupted me, ſaying, <hi>She cannot ſpeak three words of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray my Lord be pleaſed to hear me out, <hi>and do not Judge me till then,</hi> — I have not been at the <hi>Tower</hi> ſince <hi>Thurſday</hi> was ſeven-night.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Chan.</speaker>
                  <p>That was the Time, what did you there?</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Chan.</speaker>
                  <p>Had you no talk concerning <hi>Willoughby?</hi> tell us the Truth, for the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> hath told us all.</p>

ſure her Ladiſhip will tell nothing elſe: I told her that Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> and <hi>Manſel</hi> had been at my Houſe to demand him, and my Husband had paſt his word for his forth-coming. Then I was commanded to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>And underſtanding, ſoon after, that I ſhould be Cloſe Confin'd, the dread of being lock'd up on the top of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and attended on by Fellons, as Mrs. <hi>Preſcick</hi> had been, though big with Child, and ſo troubled with Fits, that they came upon her every hour, which cauſed Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> to Pitty her, and take her into his own Houſe; but ſome had been Locked up there a full year, and kept in Irons above Six months of the time, the fear of this, or worſe uſage, did ſo oppreſs my ſpirits, that though I be not the moſt timorous of my Sex, and never had any kind of Fit before, I fell into ſuch Convulſions, that I had like to have died at <hi>White-hall</hi> Gate. Then I was carried to the Keepers Houſe, and laid upon a Couch, and being a little come to my ſtrength and ſenſes, I told Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> that if I ſhould die in that deſolate place, as it was like I might that very Night, moſt perſons would believe that he had caus'd me to be Murthered, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Articles I put into Parliament againſt him; whereupon he bid me be of good Comfort, for I ſhould not be carry'd to the top of the Goal, but lye in his own Houſe, which promiſe ſo revived me, that within an hour, I was able to go up into the Garret, where I had a very Good Bed, and a Maid ordered to lye in the Room by me; ſhe tended me very diligently, and ſeem'd very much to Commiſerate my Condition, <hi>being, I ſuppoſe, ſet on to do ſo, that ſhe might the more eaſily betray me</hi>: I had brought Pen, Ink, and Paper from the Gate-houſe, and eaſily prevail'd with her <hi>for money,</hi> to carry a Note home to my Houſe, <hi>in a Bottom of Thred,</hi> ſhe carried and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried three or four, ſhewing them firſt to the Jaylors Wife and Siſter, and they took Copies of them, and ſent them to the Councel, perſwading themſelves they ſhould make ſtrange Diſcoveries, but I had Committed no Crime, and therefore <hi>nothing but Innocence could be found in my Letters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they ſaw this ſhare would not take; <hi>then they laid another for my Life,</hi> and brought <hi>Willoughby</hi> to a Window over againſt mine, to talk with me, having (as I then thought, and now know) ſet another Rogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, to hear what I ſaid.</p>

                  <p>No, but God is merciful, and if I live, I may repent; I was diſſerted by every Body, and if I had not been Hang'd, I ſhould have been Starv'd—It is a ſad thing to depend upon an ungrateful and diſunited Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple— If any care had been taken of me, to remove me to the Bench, they could only have <hi>Pillored Me,</hi> and I would never done this, nor any other Villany; But ſince no body took any care of me, I had reaſon to take ſome of my ſelf, which I will do. Thoſe I belong to now are very kind to me, and <hi>ſend me great Incouragements,</hi> I ſhall have a Pardon within two or three days, and be ſet at Liberty, but before I go, I ſhould be very glad you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your own Condition, <hi>and not ruin your Family,</hi> your Maid <hi>Suſan</hi> will Swear againſt you, and there are two Perſons found, that will lay worſer things to your Charge, than I have done.</p>

                  <p>But I laugh'd at all this, and receiv'd his proffers as they deſerv'd, and ſaid, <hi>Cowardly Wretch,</hi> you are worſe than your Elder Brother <hi>Judas,</hi> for he having betray done Innocent, left thoſe that hired him, to ſeek falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98195:12"/>
for themſelves, and repented, and brought again the Thirty pieces of Silver, and had <hi>Courage enough to hang himſelf</hi>: But you have betray'd and belyed many Innocents, and yet are ſuch a Coward to waite for the <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> for hang'd you will be.

And then by the fit Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of other places of Scripture, I ſhook him ſo, that he Howl'd like a Dog that had the Tooth-Ach. And again ſhewed his Arms, where the <hi>Irons or Cords had worn off the Skin,</hi> telling me, he had been Rackt, and otherwiſe cruelly uſed to force him to accuſe me.</p>

                  <p>Ah Cowardly wretch! would you ſhed the blood of ſo many Innocents, to ſave your life?

Look there, do you ſee the Devil ſtand at your Elbow, aſſure your ſelf he'l tear you to pieces alive; Then he howl'd again, and wrung his hands, pretending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and told me, that againſt to morrow he would write down all the Intrigue, with the Names of <hi>thoſe Lords and others,</hi> that ſet him on, and give it me, if I would give him any hopes of a Pardon for my ſelf and others he had wrong'd.</p>

                  <p>It is not poſſible for you, nor any other Devil Incarnate, to wrong me more than I can forgive, if you Repent and leave your Villany; but do not diſſemble, for diſſembled Piety is double Iniquity.</p>

Then I went from the Window—</p>
                  <p>Next Morning he was waiting at his Window by Day-break, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little Coals at mine—About Nine or Ten a Clock I went to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, hoping to perſwade him to tell the Truth, <hi>But like the Dog, was returned to his Vomit,</hi> and propoſed to me, if I would not belye the Duke, to ſay the Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> gave me thoſe Papers, and that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Thouſand pounds in Gold of Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi> to pay him for the Murthering the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and to raiſe Souldiers againſt the King: But I received this Propoſition like the former, and Anſwered:</p>

                  <p>Wretched Villain! Innocence fears nothing; I have done no Evil, nor I fear none.—And ſhut to the Window, and would ſpeak no more to him. All that day at times he hancred about the Window, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crokadils tears, holding up his hands, and making beſeeching ſigns to me to come to my Window. About four in the Afternoon I went, ſaying, <hi>Blood-thirsty ingrateful Villain, what have you to ſay to me</hi>? Then he wrung his hands and Lamented, ſaying, <q>Now he was fully reſolved to tell
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98195:13"/>
the Truth, and if I would promiſe he ſhould be Pardoned, would ſhow me how to turn the Devices of the Malicious upon their own Heads, and had writ it all out for me, and would tye a Coal to it and throw it in; but he would firſt try if he could fling in an Apple he had in his hand, he try'd, but the Apple fell down— He ſaid there is ſomething in it, and Ran down in great haſt to fetch it—</q> But I ſuppoſe thoſe that ſet him on, had more fears I ſhould Convert him, than hopes he ſhould Pervert me, and would not let him appear any more at the Window, but preſently I heard a great Noiſe in the Goal, and it was pretended, the Jaylor had diſcovered our interview, and Sir <hi>John Nicholas</hi> came that Night to ſearch and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me, I told him the Truth, but conceal'd that part which related to the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and Sir <hi>Allen Apſley,</hi> and would not own that I underſtood for what reaſon he ſhewed me Gold, as not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a fitting time to tell ſuch Truths, I having too many Enemies already.</p>
                  <p>Then the Window ſhutters were nail'd up on that ſide of the Chamber, and the Caſement on the other ſide, and from that time I had not a breath of Air: I did but take out a Pain of Glaſs, and they put in another, and unfolded and ſearch'd all my Linnen, and cut my very Bread in pieces; and ſearch'd every thing with all imaginable ſtrictneſs; yet Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> let me go when I would into a Room that look'd towards the Doctors Garden, where the Window was open, but there was ſuch a noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſmell in the Room, that I rather choſe to be lock'd up in my own alone, than in that with a great deal of bold Company; for the Rats and Weezles plaid at Barly-break, and <hi>boldly Robb'd me before my face,</hi> and did not Dance without Muſick, ſqueeking as they ran up and down: And the worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> came likewiſe to viſit me and ask'd if he could do me any Service, and fawning on me, with many flattering Expreſſions, <hi>which I valued much like the Muſick of my other Viſitants</hi>: He pretended a great deal of pity that ſuch a Woman as I ſhould be engaged among ſuch a wicked and ungrateful people that Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at me, ſaying, I was the worſt of Women, but if I would confeſs, as he would have me, and come to them, <hi>I ſhould be received according to my Merits.</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord, I have been with him lately; and (if you pleaſe) I will tell you the occaſion. In</hi> April <hi>laſt Sir</hi> W. Waller <hi>was very buſie about my Houſe, inſomuch as I was forc'd to leave it, and I (having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be quiet at home) writ the ſtate of my Caſe to my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and prayed his Favour; He bid the perſon that carried the Letter, ſend Sir</hi> W. Waller <hi>to him; and from that time I had no further trouble, till about ten or twelve days before</hi> Dangerfield <hi>was taken. He told me that my Name was enter'd into Sir</hi> W. Waller's Black Bill, <hi>and he would ſearch my Houſe that Week, and therefore he advis'd me to write again to the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>I told him I durſt not preſume to do that, but I would go to his Lordſhip, and thank him for the former favour, and pray a continuance of it, and deſired him to go with me, becauſe being known in the Houſe, as he ſaid, and might the eaſier bring me to ſpeak with his Lordſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dangerfield.</speaker>
                  <p>Madam, I cannot at all advantage your Cauſe, but injure it, for I have <hi>told my Lord Lies,</hi> and have been catch'd in them; but if you pleaſe to let the Coach drive cloſe to the Gate, and ask for Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> and deſire him to bring you to the Figure of one, he will bring you to his Lordſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I did ſo that very night, and after I had thank'd his Lordſhip for his former Favour, and intreated him that I might not be troubled with Sir</hi> W. Waller, <hi>he anſwered me,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, I am for the propagation of the Proteſtant Faith; yet, becauſe I think you an excellent Woman, though of another Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I promiſe you I will do you all the good I can.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>When I came before the Council they ſpoke not a word of the old matter, but queſtioned me concerning Sir</hi> Robert Peyton <hi>then preſent; I told the Truth, as I would have done long before if they asked it; and deſired Pen, Ink and Paper to recollect my Memory, and to ſee my Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Keeper, which the King ſaid was but reaſonable, and bid make an Order for it, which was done, yet the Keeper would never let me ſee him in</hi> 11 <hi>or</hi> 12 <hi>weeks that I was confined after that, but one quarter of an hour; Yet to give him his due, he was as civil (to me, as the ſtrictneſs of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement would admit of,) and his Wife alſo, all the time I was in their own Houſe.</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord, It is good to be diligent in all that one undertakes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which anſwer was the laſt I had opportunity to make to any in Authority until my <hi>Arraignment,</hi> which (in confidence of my own Innocence) I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſt for.</p>
                  <p>Not but that I knew the danger, as to this Life, of encountring the Devil in the worſt of his Inſtruments, which are <hi>PERJ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RERS INCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAGED</hi> to that degree as that profligated Wretch was, and has been ſince his being expoſed to the World in his true colours both at mine, and at anothers Tryal.</p>
                  <p>But the Sence that all I had done, or endeavoured to do, was prompted by <hi>a Diſintereſted Loyalty to the King, and Charity to Innocence oppreſt,</hi> without the leaſt mixture of Mallice to any Creature breathing, <hi>Made me with hopes expect the worst thoſe Devils incarnate could do unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if any thing in the World could give a probable Light where the true Plot is manag'd, mine, and my accuſers Caſes would do it.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Singly and Alene,</hi> without the Advice or Aſſiſtance of any Catholick breathing, <hi>Man or Woman,</hi> I was left to ſtudy, manage, and to ſupport my ſelf in all my troubles to my Expence and Loſs <hi>much above a thouſand Pounds,</hi> never receiving one penny towards it, directly or indirectly, but ten pounds given me by the hands of a condemn'd Prieſt, five days before my Tryal; nor have I ſince received any thing towards my Loſſes, or the leaſt civility from any of them.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Dangerfield</hi> (when made a Priſoner for apparent <hi>Recorded Rogueries</hi>) was viſited by and from Perſons of conſiderable Quality, with great Sums of Gold and Silver, to encourage him in the <hi>new Villanies</hi> he had undertaken, not againſt Me alone, but Perſons in whoſe Safety all good Men (<hi>as well Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as others</hi>) in the three Kingdoms are concern'd.</p>
                  <p>For I hope no reaſonable man can believe me ſo vain, as to think my Life or Fame worth the conſideration of an <hi>Induſtrious Faction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I laid open the Truth of my Caſe, to be believed or not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as Reaſon, Sence, and Probability ſhall guide Men.</p>
                  <p>And as to my own Sex, I hope they will pardon the Errors of my Story, as well as thoſe bold Attempts of mine that occaſion'd it, ſince in what I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with, as to Sir <hi>Robert Peyton and others</hi> (that are yet among them undiſcovered like <hi>Huſhai,</hi> and I hope will have as good ſucceſs to confound the crafty Contrivances of all the old <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and the <hi>Headſtrong Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Practices of young Abſalom</hi>) though it may be thought too Maſculine, yet was it the effects of my Loyal (more than Religious) Zeal to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites to his Service.</p>
                  <p>And in all my defence, none can truly ſay but that I preſerv'd the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, though not the Timorouſneſs common to my Sex. And I believe there is none, but had they been in my Station, would, to their power, have acted like me; for it is more our buſineſs than mens to fear, and conſequently to prevent the Tumults and Troubles Factions tend to, ſince we by nature are hindered from ſharing any part but the Frights and Diſturbances of them.

                  <hi>My Lord, for ſaving the time of the Court, I pray that no Gentleman that has been on any of the former Juries, and found the Indictment againſt any of them that lately had the like accuſation, may be ſworn against me</hi> (And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard a great part of my Charge is for endeavouring to throw the Popiſh Plot upon the Presbyterians) <hi>therefore I except againſt all thoſe that had not lately taken the Sacrament, as Perſons that cannot be indifferent.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, the Jury ought to be choſe out of the unconcern'd Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and every Diſſenter from the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a party against whom the Fact</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be committed, therefore none but Church of</hi> England <hi>men ought to be of my Jury.</hi>

            <p>The Jury being ſworn, the Kings Councel called the Witneſſes, and firſt Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> who atteſted that he knew not a tittle of the Plot one way or other, except what he heard by Common Report, and read in the Prints, nor of any deſign I had againſt the Life of the King; but acknowledges that he was Privy to, and active in bringing over Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> to the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, (at the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert's</hi> requeſt) and to bring Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to kiſs his Royal-Highneſs's hand by my means; and ſaid, That I did always expreſs my ſelf with all Duty and Loyalty; and that I told him I had carried the names of four Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> Friends to the Duke, in hopes that if they were put into Commiſſion of the Peace, it might conduce much to the breaking the meaſures of the Factious. And Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> further Declared that one <hi>Smith</hi> formerly a School maſter at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and another Gentleman with him came to him, and deſired his Advice about going to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> pretending he could declare ſtrange things againſt Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> which might prove advantagious to them.</p>
            <p>In order to <hi>Indicting him for Perjury,</hi> which he ſaid I was forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and ſaid, that I did not care if I were at Ten Pounds Charge to have it effected, but he ſaid he refus'd to adviſe Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to concern him himſelf either with Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> or the Lords.</p>
            <p>He further aver'd, that I told him I heard <hi>Dangerfield</hi> talk of a <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98195:20"/>
Plot,</hi> and how he frequented their Clubs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had ſo far inſinuated into the favour of ſome of them, that he was promiſed a Commiſſion among them, and that ſeveral Commiſſions were given out already. After that, Mr. <hi>Gadbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> being interrogated by the Attorny General, to ſeveral paſſages ſignified in an Atteſtation which he himſelf had drawn up for the Privy Council, which ſeemed more to affect me than any thing he had hitherto ſaid, ſhewing the ſame unto him, which when he had perus'd, he did own to be his hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſaid, That what was contained therein was true, but when he wrote the ſame, he confeſſed that he raked up all that ever he could againſt me, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating every Circumſtance to the utmoſt, and that by that reaſon when he was in Priſon, ſome perſon or perſons whom he did not name to avoid refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Threatned him with Hanging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they told him two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes had ſworn Treaſon poſitively againſt him, and that I now accus'd him, and made a third; and he knowing I muſt ſwear falſe, as the reſt had done, and being Menac'd as before, Drew up the ſaid Accuſation againſt me, aggravating the ſeveral expreſſions therein, in hopes thereby to leſſen my Evidence againſt him, and thereby to ſave himſelf.</p>
            <p>Then he was again interrogated, whether I did not tell him I hoped to ſee <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> full of <hi>Benedictine Monks,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> with <hi>Fryers:</hi> he anſwered, That his ſufferings had very much weakned his Memory, but as far as he remembred, I did not ſpeak of any hope, but believes it was thus, What if you ſhould ſee <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> filled with <hi>Monks</hi> again? and that this was in ordinary Diſcourſe as they paſs'd through the <hi>Abby</hi> together; And that he looked upon thoſe Words to be no way maliciouſly ſpoken, nor regarded it further than common Diſcourſe.</p>

               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then he went on with his Evidence, ſaying, That when the King was Sick at <hi>Windſor,</hi> I asked him whether he thought his Majeſty would live or dye, ſuppoſing as he thought that he might have taken ſome notice of the effect by obſerving the beginning of the Diſtemper; but ſays, That I did not deſire him to erect a Scheme for that purpoſe, nor to Calculate the Kings Nativity, and that he believes I had talked at this rate five or ſix times, <hi>always expreſſing great fears of his Majeſties Death, and the Troubles that may thereupon ariſe through the reſtleſs Malice of the turbulent Factious Party,</hi> and that he with as great Trouble told me, he durſt not preſume to Judge of ſuch and ſo weighty an Affair as that was.</p>
            <p>But that he remembers he Calculated a perſons Nativity for me, to know whether he would be juſt to me in gathering in ſuch Debts as were due to my Husband who was a <hi>French</hi> Merchant; And that from thence he cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd me to beware of him, but that he knew not the ſaid perſon was <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> till he came before the Counſel, bringing onely the time and Place of his Birth, without making any mention of his Name, but that the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> thence took occaſion to ſwear him into the acquaintance of the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Honourable Lords, whoſe Faces he never ſaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Evidence.</p>

Then I produc'd a Copy of his Pardon, but remembring I was not oblig'd to believe that he had a Pardon, till he himſelf had produc'd it, I call'd for it back again, then the Court went off the Cauſe, and heard motions; but</hi> Dangerfield <hi>ſtaying long, they began to examine Witneſſes on his behalf.</hi>

                  <hi>A Pardon cannot make him an honeſt Man, as all ought to be that are Witneſſes in Treaſon, Nor can the King give him an Act of Grace to my prejudice, as this Pardon will be, if it make him a good Witneſs to take away my Life.

And ſhall this prodigous Wretch that has been burn'd in the Hand, Whipt, Pillory'd, Convict of all manner of Crimes, and ſtands out-law'd for Fellony, be allow'd a good Witneſs to take away my Life, and ſuch a Gentleman as Mr.</hi> Reading <hi>be denyed to give Evidence to ſave, becauſe he had been on the Pillory for endeavering to do that which if he had done, it had not amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one of thoſe many Crimes this Villain Pleaded Guilty to.

               <p>Then <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſubmiſſively bowing; ſaid My Lord, this is enough to diſcourage any one hereafter, from entring into good and honeſt Principles.</p>

            <p>Then the Lord Chief Juſtice gave ſhort directions to the Jury, telling them he knew nothing they had to do, for that nothing material appeared againſt me.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Dangerfield</hi> having none, the Lord Chief Juſtice ſaid, Take him away, take him away, and ſecure him. Then was <hi>Dangerfield</hi> preſently diſarmed, who trembling, and looking as if he had been juſt going to be Hang'd, Cryed out, Whither muſt I go? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will you carry me? Then he ſhed Tears in the Court, and was by the Officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conveyed to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Priſon with a numerous Train of Attendance, where the Gentlemen Priſoners received him according to his Merit. But he not liking his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, deſired to be locked up till the Marſhal came home and then for his better ſecurity was ſent to the Common-Side, where the Priſoners had like to have Pump'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98195:23"/>But his Phanatick friends bringing him good ſtore of Mony, both Gold and Silver, he ſpent it very freely among them, ſo by that means eſcap'd that Storm, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the cuſtody of the Marſhal, till he was brought to the Bar by order of Court, and pleaded a general <hi>New-gate</hi> Pardon, in which his name was inſerted, and ſo was diſcharged, with good advice to leave off his former wicked courſes, and take up ſome imployment to live honeſtly, for his thread of Life was ſo fine ſpun, that he could expect no more favour from any Court.</p>
            <p>The tryal being over, the Gentlemen of the Jury ſent for me up into the Room where they Din'd, and told me, there was a Guiny a Man due to them, I Anſwer'd, <hi>I had coſt my Husband a great deal of Mony alerady, much more than my Perſon was worth, and was not willing to put him to any Charge I could avoid; And I hop'd they would conſider my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not expect Mony from me.</hi> They reply'd if I had been caſt, the King muſt have paid them a Guiny a Man, upon which I promis'd if it were a due Debt I would ſend it to Sir <hi>Philip Matthews</hi> on <hi>Munday,</hi> but finding it was not, I ſent him this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter.</p>

               <hi>Monday</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> the Jury ſent one Mr. <hi>Squire,</hi> a very civil and underſtanding Gentleman, to demand the Guinies of me, we argued the Caſe a while, and he went away very well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning another came, that was as rough and inconſiderable; and among other things he told me, that the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> gave them two Guinies a Man. I replyed, If I had been a Dutcheſs, I would have given them five; But I was a poor Woman, and had been much wrong'd, and to prevent further inconvenience, I would not injure my Innocence, not their Juſtice, ſo much as to give them any thing but my humble Thanks, which I pray'd him to accept of, and give to them all. He went away in a great heat, expreſſing his reſentment in ſuch Language as I will not ſpoil Paper with.</p>
            <p>This is all I can call to mind, of what paſt at my ſeveeal Examinations, and Tryal, and I hope the judicious Reader will pardon what is either forgot, or not well expreſs'd, in conſideration that I was forc'd to defend my Life, both againſt the Knights and the Dragon, for in this unequal Combate there was no St. <hi>George</hi> to defend me againſt him, but Sir <hi>C</hi>—Sir <hi>J</hi>—Sir <hi>R</hi>—and Sir <hi>George</hi> alſo ſtood by my accuſer, to manage his Malice againſt me.</p>
            <p>Yet I could not but pity thoſe learned Gentlemen, (one of which would have been infinitely too hard for all theſe together,) which have been accuſed in this accurſed Plot, that ſo many of them ſhould come arm'd and arrayed againſt me, and be forc'd to bluſh at the weakneſs of their Combatant.</p>
            <p>But God, the Protector of Innocence, hath for this time delivered me from the rage of that wicked Enemy, and his Fellow-plotters.</p>
            <p>But how long either my ſelf, or any other Loyal Subjects, ſhall be ſecure from the like Conſpiracy, God only knows.</p>

               <hi>He ſent from above, he drew me out of many Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He delivered me from my ſtrong Enemy, and from them which hated me, for they were too ſtrong for me.</hi>

            <head>A Poſtſcript to the Impartial Readers.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Monday</hi> the 16<hi>th.</hi> of this Inſtant, the Sheet <hi>F</hi> was taken in the Preſs, and my Self and the <hi>Printer</hi> brought by Meſſengers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and he caus'd us to give Bonds and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to appear before the Lords of the Council, and in the mean time not to print any further.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> I appear'd before their Lordſhips, and teſtified the truth of what I had written, ſaying, <hi>I publiſh'd it becauſe I would come again before their Lordſhips</hi>; and did then accuſe Sir <hi>William Waller, Manſel, Dangerfield,</hi> and their Confederates, of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> for endeavouring <hi>to raiſe a Rebellion, and for conſpiring againſt the life of his Royal Highneſs.</hi> And proffered to make good my Charge, by the Teſtimony of perſons of <hi>Honours, Perſons of middle Quality,</hi> and <hi>unſpotted Reputation,</hi> and by ſome of their own Companions. And their Lordſhips were pleaſed to promiſe that we ſhould be heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> According to their Lordſhips order, I came to Mr. <hi>Guin,</hi> the Clerk then in waiting, to give ſecurity for my good Behaviour, and to appear at the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar</hi> the firſt day of the next Term, and though ſeveral good Houſ-keepers proffer'd themſelves, he would accept of none but ſuch as himſelf knew; which, though it was very difficult for me to obtain, I was forc'd to do it. After Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given, he would not let me depart, till I had paid 3 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6.<hi>d. And though I told him that two Juſtices</hi> of the Peace expected me at that hour, to go with them to <hi>take the Examination of a Perſon that then lay Sick,</hi> and deſired him to let me go, and I would ſend the Mony to him, as ſoon as I came home. Yet he commanded <hi>Otterbury</hi> the Meſſenger to <hi>take me into cuſtody till I paid it</hi>; and I was forced to ſtay till I ſent home for Mony, and by theſe delays loſt the Opportunity of meeting the Gentlemen, and could not examine the party that day; <hi>and the next he was taken Speechleſs, as he ſtill continues.</hi> By this means I loſt a moſt material Witneſs; Yet doubt not but to make good my Charge, if the reſt may be heard.</p>
            <p>I hope the Readers have not forgotten, that after it had been proved before the Lords of the Council, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſtood <hi>in the Pillory at</hi> Salisbury, Yet, <hi>upon his ſingle Evidence,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and other perſons of conſiderable Quality, were Committed, and I was cloſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98195:24"/>
two and twenty weeks, and after that, Tryed for my Life, <hi>June</hi> the 11<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though Treaſonable Practices have been ſworn againſt <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> by Juſtice <hi>Foſter,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Harvey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Hill,</hi> and my ſelf; Yet the Gentleman walks abroad undiſturbed, and <hi>daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with his Confederates, how to act new Villanies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things make me very ſenſible of the great Difficulties and Diſcouragements I am like to meet with; But I hope the God of Truth and Juſtice will protect me, and bring me through them all, and pluck off the vails, and diſcover both Truth and Frauds bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.</p>
            <p>And whenſoever his Majeſty pleaſes, to make it as <hi>Safe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to ſpeak Truth,</hi> as it is apparent it hath been Gainful and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to do the contrary, there will not want Witneſſes to teſtifie the truth of more than I have written, and Perſons that are above being made <hi>The Hangman's Hounds for weekly Pentions,</hi> or any other Conſiderations whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And though I have been <hi>two and twenty Weeks confined,</hi> and two and thirty Weeks a Priſoner, and my Charge and Loſſes much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Thouſand Pounds, I do not yet ſo much fear the ſmell of <hi>New-gate,</hi> as to be frighted for telling the Truth; nor is Death ſo great a Terror to me, but that I am ſtill ready to ſeal the ſame with my Blood.</p>

               <hi>old Tricks</hi>; then (as he ſays) he turn'd <hi>Mendicant</hi> from Dore to Dore for about a Month; after which he became a <hi>Soldiers Boy,</hi> and not being able to live on Three Halfpence a Day, he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to fall to the practice of the <hi>Roguery he had ſo long ſtudied,</hi> and attain'd to a great perfection in the <hi>Thieving Trade</hi>; And amongſt other <hi>Virtues,</hi> he alſo learn'd to <hi>Guild Copper Cobs,</hi> and made them paſs for <hi>Gold,</hi> and plaid ſuch Pranks, that (being too young to be put to Death) he was mark'd by the Ezecutioner of <hi>Port Ferara</hi> with an <hi>N</hi> and a <hi>G</hi> in large Gun-powder Letters on the Back of his Right Hand, and then laſht out of the Town. And being almoſt ſtarv'd, a Maſter of an <hi>Engliſh Veſſel</hi> in Charity brought him back for <hi>England,</hi> being now about 14 or 15 years of age. Then the wandring <hi>Don</hi> return'd to the Father he formerly deny'd to own; But he refus'd to receive him, yet had Compaſſion on his miſerable condition, and put him as an Apprentice to a <hi>Barber,</hi> from whom he ran, and fell ſo cloſe to the <hi>Thieving Trade,</hi> that by his own Confeſſion, and the Teſtimony of others, he was condemn'd to be hang'd before he was 17, but obtain'd a Pardon of Tranſportation, and went into <hi>Flanders</hi>; But though he chang'd Countries, Qualities he chang'd not, for in a few years he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo great a proficient, that he counterfeited the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Hand and Seal, and was committed to the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he lay long, and had been ſtarv'd, (as himſelf ſays,) but for the Charity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nuns, who every day ſent him Meat and Drink. About 12 Weeks after his Commitment, he was try'd and condemn'd to be <hi>Hang'd</hi>; But Father <hi>Worſly,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt, (after the charitable example of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nuns at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who not only fed this ſtarv'd Snake, but alſo ſav'd and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Captain <hi>Spurn-Cow in the like Danger</hi>) by earneſt ſolicitations procured his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and brought it at the critical Minute, when one end of the Halter was about his Neck, and the other <hi>tied to the Gallows,</hi> and the Ladder ready to be taken away.

            <p>Some Months after, he was 18 years old, he arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> and fell cloſe to his old Trade, and had ſuch ſucceſs therein, that in the 19<hi>th.</hi> year of his age, and,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Wilts.</hi> ſſ. At the ſame Aſſizes he was indicted of the like Fact, for uttering a falſe Guiny at <hi>Broad-Chalk,</hi> he pleaded Guilty, and was fined five Pounds, and to ſtand on the Pillory three hours at <hi>New-Sarum</hi> another Market day, with a Paper; on his Forehead, as before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wilts.</hi> ſſ. At the ſame Aſſizes he was indicted for the like Fact, he Pleaded Guilty, and was fined five Pounds, and to ſtand on the Pillory at <hi>Wilton</hi> three hours, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on his Forehead.</p>
            <p>He ſtood on the Pillory twice at <hi>Sarum,</hi> and broke the Goal before he was to ſtand the third time.</p>

               <hi>Midleſex.</hi> ſſ. In the 30<hi>th.</hi> year of his now Majeſties Reign, he was indicted at <hi>Hicks's Hall,</hi> before Sir <hi>Reginald Foſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Matthews, Thomas Harriot</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Aſſociates, by the name of <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> alias <hi>Willoughby,</hi> alias <hi>Moor,</hi> Labourer, for uttering 20 falſe Guinnies in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Leonard Shoreditch.</hi> The Bill was found againſt him.</p>
            <p>That Seſſions he was tryed and convict at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and was fin'd fifty Pounds, and to lie in Priſon till he paid it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he lay in Priſon for his Fine, he there <hi>Practiced Forgery,</hi> as Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> teſtified upon Oath, <hi>October</hi> the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 1679. before the Lords of his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Counſell; as alſo, that he never had in his Cuſtody a more <hi>Notorious Rogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December</hi> following, he broke a hole through the Priſon with the help of his fellows, pretending he would teach them how to make an eſcape; but by a Letter to Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> gave him notice of their Intentions, and they were ſurpriz'd going forth, and rewarded according to their merit; But the <hi>Don</hi> eſcap'd Scot-free, and in reward of this Service, Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> in the <hi>January</hi> following, got him into a general <hi>New-gate</hi> Pardon, for which he hath ſince rewarded him with the ſame gratitude wherewith he has ever repay'd his Benefactors; proving the old Proverb true, <hi>Save a Thief from the Gallows, and he will hang thee if he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There he lay till the <hi>May</hi> following, for want of Mony to pay his Fees, at which time I paid them, and what elſe I did for him, and upon what inducements you may read Page the 12. and 13. How he has required me I need not relate, <hi>His Gratitude is Publickly Notorious</hi> like his other virtues; in purſuit of which, I ſearched till I found his Name Recorded in 28 places, having been Tranſported, Burnt in the Hand, five times Adjudged to the Pillory, ſeven times Fin'd, twice Out-law'd for Fellony, and broke the Goal in ſeveral places eight times; but the great Charge forced me to deſiſt, though I have been credibly inform'd that his Acts were Recorded in many places more, both in <hi>England, Wales, Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but to give him his due, not one of theſe Records that I know of, is for Robbing on the High-way. He is too tender of his own ſafety, and has too great a Veneration for the memory of his Murther'd Mother, to expoſe her Son to any ſuch audacious enterpriſe; all his Atchievements are Houſe-breaking, Picking of Pockets, Cheats, Forgeries, and Petty Larcenies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Gentlemans Narrative, wherein he ſays <hi>Page</hi> 24 on the top of the leaf, that his pretended Confeſſor Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> injoyn'd him for his Pennance, that twice a night, for five nights following, he ſhould walk bare-footed from <hi>Powis</hi> Houſe in <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields,</hi> to <hi>Lincolns-Inn back gate,</hi> and back again, which he ſaith he did accordingly, and that every morning for five mornings he ſhould Diſcipline his naked ſhoulders with ſome <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Cords which he gave him, and bid him be ſure to follow his Advice, if he would eſcape Damnation.</p>
            <p>Surely the Gentlemans Wits were gone a Wool-gathering, elſe he would have told his Confeſſor, that if laſhing could ſecure him from Damnation, he had enough of that both in <hi>England, Cornwal, Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> having perform'd many memorable Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of that kind; and particularly that of <hi>Reading,</hi> where he marched bare-footed, and bare-headed before the Beadle to the Towns-end, attended by all the Youth of the Place, being ſcourged all the way, and at the end of the Town, had 20 laſhes given him extraordinary, becauſe he had not money to pay the Goaler.</p>
            <p>And having thus exerciſed his <hi>Paſſive Valour</hi> to the ſatisfaction of all the Spectators,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98195:26"/>
he was with great ſhoutings and acclamations, turn'd off to ſeek his Fortune; in purſuit of which he went to the next Town, where a Company of Soldiers was then quartered, and with great Lamentation told them he had been ſet upon by Foot-Pads, and by them robbed of a conſiderable ſum of mony, and moſt cruelly beaten. Theſe honeſt Souldiers received him with much humanity, fed and cloathed him as well as they could, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him to prevail with their Captain to receive him into the Company; But the next day the fraud was diſcovered, for ſome Perſons coming from <hi>Reading,</hi> made known his good qualities, with the exemplary Reward he had ſo lately received: The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were ſo offended at their miſplaced Charity, that they beat and kickt him up and down like a foot-Ball, reſolving to laſh him ſeverely with their Matches; and in order to it, pluckt off his venerable Coat, and the bloody Rag he called his Shirt, but when they ſaw his back ſo pittifully mortify'd, they (to uſe his own words) ſcorned to fling water upon a drowned Mouſe, but let him go whither he would, and he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his courſe towards <hi>London,</hi> where he arrived in great ſtate, riding upon his Fathers two legg'd Colt, having been entertained on the way by the Charity of well-diſpoſed Perſons, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly, had he told Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> his Story, he could not have been ſo ſevere to him; eſpecially, if he had produced that undenyable proof he always carries about him, as plainly appeared to ſome Gentlemen that went into the Water with him laſt Summer, and are ready to depoſe that the <hi>Marks of the Laſhes</hi> which have been ſo freely laid on are ſtill viſible on his back in long <hi>blue Stigma's</hi>; Yea, as viſible as the Letters on his right hand, and much more then that in the brawn of his left Thumb. <hi>This Heroe</hi> is too well markt to be forgotten, though his modeſty has made him ſo ſilent in his own praiſe, that he has omitted moſt of his ſtrange and unparallell'd Adventures in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and elſewhere on the Coaſt of <hi>Guiny and Barbadoes, &amp;c.</hi> Together with the Juſt and Generous Entertainments he found in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Caſtles of <hi>Chelmsford, Newgate, Antwerp, York, Callice, Salisbury, Winbourn, Weſt-cheſter, Reading, Abbington,</hi> the <hi>Gate-houſe, Dublin,</hi> the <hi>Counter,</hi> the <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> with many more, too long to be related, and too Chargeable for me to take off the Records.</p>
            <p>But as the skilful Statuary could gueſs at <hi>Hercules</hi>'s height by the length of his foot, ſo I doubt not but the judicious Reader by the ſight of the Records I have produc'd, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be perſwaded to believe the reſt, and think his life ſo remarkable, that it exceeds all the Worthies of his quality that have gone before him, and is unmatchable, <hi>Even in this Age,</hi> That produces ſuch Monſtrous Gigantick <hi>Maſters of the Diabolical Arts,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Captain Spurn-Cow</hi> the Horſe-ſtealer; <hi>Parſon lack La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; Don Cappadocia,</hi> Squire of the Plow-tail; <hi>Horſe Proud, The Narrative Collonel, Merry Tom</hi> of St. <hi>Anns Lane, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
