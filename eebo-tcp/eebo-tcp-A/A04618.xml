            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

things, meaſure all durations; <hi>Aeternitie, Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Time. Aeternitie</hi> hath neyther beginning nor end;
and is proper only to God, who is euerlaſting. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie</hi>
hath beginning, but none end; and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <hi>Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Angels,</hi> and mens ſoules, that once
<pb facs="tcp:8294:5"/>
were not, and yet now cannot die. <hi>Time</hi> hath both
beginning and end, and is proper to all bodies, ſuch
as are poſſible and corruptible ſubſtances: of whom
tis ſaid, <hi>omniaorta occidunt &amp; aucta ſeneſcunt:</hi> Now
then Chriſt conſiſting of Godhead, ſoule, and bodie,
hath theſe his three <hi>Natures</hi> limited by theſe three

and his bodie by <hi>Time.</hi> Thus in reſpect
not of his <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> but his <hi>Humanitie,</hi> the maker of
Time was made in time, and <hi>Time</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is the
meaſure of motion, but <hi>Paul</hi> here ſhewes vs more
ſtrange Philoſophie, that it is the meaſure of the firſt
Mouer it ſelfe. Would yee not wonder (<hi>Deere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>)
to heare that a <hi>Gyants</hi> foote ſhould bee thruſt
into a childes ſhooe, or that the <hi>Ocean Sea</hi> ſhould bee
intruded into a bottle, and aſmuch then may you
maruell at this that God who is infinite, ſhould bee
borne in a time finite, but this doubt is thus diſſolued
three things, <hi>vt ſupra &amp;c.</hi> And as our Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>in the fulneſſe thereof.</hi> As places, ſo time haue their
fulneſſe and emptineſse, ſome places are emptie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
nought but ayre in them, and ſome are repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with ſiluer, with Gold, Pearle, Precious ſtones,
and ſuch like treaſure, like ſo of times, ſome are void
of ſtrange accidents, and ſome are full of memorable
and admirable occurrents, &amp; in ſuch a time was our
Sauiour borne, as the age of the world, the yeare,
moneth, day, houre, theſe parts of time may impart
vnto vs; <hi>Touching the Worlds age,</hi> know that it was
<pb facs="tcp:8294:6"/>
the ſixth. The firſt age was from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah.</hi> The
ſecond from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The third from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to <hi>Dauid.</hi> The fourth from <hi>Dauid</hi> to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
from <hi>Babylon.</hi> The fifth from that to <hi>Chriſts
Natiuitie,</hi> which fell in the ſixth age: where note an
excellent myſterie, how correſpondent Gods workes
of our creation, and recreation are. As in the worlds
ſixth day God did make man: ſo in the worlds
ſixth age hee did redeeme man. In the worlds
ſixth day the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made, in whom wee are
deformed: and in the worlds ſixth age was the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> made, in whom wee are reformed. Here
ariſe now two queſtions: why God louing man ſo wel,
had not beene borne before or preſently after mans
fal, ſith <hi>Gratia ab officio quod mor a tar dat abeſt.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
why God minding to die for the ſinnes of all the
world, had not defer'd his comming to the end of the
world. <hi>Six</hi> is a number neyther diminute nor ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant,
but perfect, ſith all his partes put together
doe make the whole, as 1. 2. and 3. make ſix: ſo then
in the number of perfection came the author of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
By ſixe ſtaires did men aſcend to <hi>Salomons</hi>
throne, and by ſix ages came the word to the throne
of grace. Theſe ſcruples thus I remoue. Firſt, for
Chriſt to haue beene borne before <hi>Adam</hi> fel, had bin
an action ſuperfluous. For the end of his comming
being (<hi>vtinquit Euang.</hi>) to ſeeke the loſt Sheep of the
houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to bind vp the broken hearted, to call
ſinners to repentance, and by it to ſaluation: what
needed this ſeeker before man was loſt? what needed
this Phiſition before man was ſick? what needed this
<pb facs="tcp:8294:6"/>
Sauiour before <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſinner? Againe for Chriſt
to haue come preſently after mans fall, had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very inconuenient. Man ſinned by pride, and by
pride was throwne into calamitie: from which if
ſtraightwayes hee ſhould haue beene freed, perhaps
the ſpirit of loftineſſe and inſolencie might haue
come vpon him againe. God therefore ſixe ages leſt
him in his miſerie, that he might know his fault, &amp;
knowing it, be humbled for the ſame. Farther it was
meet, that as the entrance of a King into a Citie, ſo
the comming of ſo worthie a perſon as the ſonne of
God into the World, ſhould bee foreſhewed by the
predictions of ſuch worthie meſſengers, as were the
<hi>Patriarckes</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> which could not haue beene
had <hi>Chriſt</hi> beene borne in the time of <hi>Adam.</hi> As for
the deferring of his birth to the end of the <hi>World,</hi>
Theſe reaſons diſproue it. Firſt, the teſtimonie of
<hi>Abacuc.</hi> 3. where it is ſaid of God there, the workes
of his mercie ſhould bee reuiued <hi>in medio annorum.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
why ſhould Chriſt then bee borne on earth,
when men ſhall haue no faith to beleeue on him, no
Charitie to loue him, and no Religion to worſhippe
him? But theſe things ſhall happen in the latter daies
(as the Euangeliſts write) and therefore the Worlds
end is a ſeaſon, rather for Chriſt to come in iudgment
to reuenge, then in mercie to redeeme. This for the
age. Now for the yeare. It was the two and fortieth
of the reign of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> the Roman Emperor:
in whoſe time that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne, it was in regard
of the manie reſemblances that were between them.
As <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was a temporal, ſo was <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:8294:7"/>
Monarch. As <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the ſecond Emperour
of Rome, ſo was <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſecond perſon in <hi>Trinitie.</hi>
As <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſo called, becauſe hee did amplifie
his Regiment, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo called, becauſe he doth
annoint vs his ſeruants: as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> taxing the
world receiued tribute from men and regiſtred their
names. So Chriſt preaching vnto the world had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
yeelded vnto him, and noted ſuch as ſerued
him in the Booke of life. As <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hauing van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
his enemies; planted peace among his people
(for in his dayes the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> was ſhut, that
elſe in the time of warre was wont euer to bee open)
ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> hauing ſubdued his foes, Death and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
placed quietneſſe in the conſcience of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who before were diſtreſſed with many troubles;
from the age and the yeare, come we to the <hi>Month
and the Day. Chriſt</hi> was borne on the fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day of <hi>December,</hi> then being the ſhorteſt day of
the yeare and <hi>Sunday:</hi> as both by the fathers is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and by calculation may be proued, wherof note
with me eyther the reaſons or myſtries. <hi>December</hi> is
the tenth moneth and in it was he borne, that came
to make ſatiſfaction for our tranſgreſſion of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ten Commandements. <hi>December</hi> concludes the
old yeare, and giues way to a new, and <hi>Christ</hi> now
born gaue an end to the old Ceremonies of the Law,
and brought in, in ſteed thereof the new ordinances
of grace. Ten degrees went the Sunne backward to
ſignifie to ſicke <hi>Ezechiah</hi> that he ſhould not die, and
<pb facs="tcp:8294:7"/>
ten moneths in aſſuming our fleſh did <hi>Chriſt</hi> goe back
as it were for his Majeſtie to aſſure vs of his mercie,
the number of ten is the firſt Article: compound of
the figure, 1. and a cipher 0. and in the tenth moneth
was he borne, whoſe perſon did conſiſt of the figure
of his <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> and the cipher of his humanitie. <hi>In
the ſhorteſt day</hi> is the <hi>Sunne</hi> in his greateſt and loweſt
South declination, and when was the ſonne of God
euer farther from the <hi>Aequinoction</hi> of his glorie and
lower in baſeneſſe, then when hee came out into the
world, clothed with our fleſh. In the ſhorteſt day the
Sunne is ſaid to be in his Tropick, that is ſo called of
the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to turne, &amp; when ſo graciouſly
as now in his birth did the ſonne of God turne vnto

<hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was borne the longeſt day of the
yeare, and therefore being at the higheſt his time muſt
decreaſe: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne in the ſhorteſt, and
therefore being at the loweſt, his time muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
<hi>In the ſhorteſt Day,</hi> the <hi>Sunne</hi> beginnes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
that turnes joy and comfort to liuing thinges,
and <hi>Chriſt</hi> now put his firſt foot in that race, that
yeelds bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe to all Chriſtians:
in the ſhorteſt day, the cold is greateſt, and therefore
ſayth <hi>Bernard, Christ</hi> choſe a time trouble ſome to his
fleſh, that we ſhould learne not to pamper ours: on a
<hi>Sunday,</hi> GOD the Father in his power beganne the
<pb facs="tcp:8294:8"/>
world: and now on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> GOD the ſonne in his
mercie began to redeeme the world. <hi>Sunday</hi> was firſt
made before any other time: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> theron borne,
is called the firſt begotten of al Creatures. On <hi>Sunday</hi>
God made the light, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> now produced
was he, that is the true light, lightning euery one that
comes into the world, as alſo all thoſe that ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; the ſhadow of death. To proceed yet to more
particulars. What part of the day? &amp; what houre was
<hi>Chriſt</hi> borne in?<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Luc.</hi> 2 records that it was in the night,
when the Shepheards were watching their flockes,
that though the Angell ſaid to them, there is borne
this day to ye a <hi>Sauiour,</hi> ye are to vnderſtand it ſpoken
not of the artificiall day, that holds from <hi>Sun</hi> to <hi>Sun,</hi>
but of the naturall day that containes the ſpace of
foure and twentie houres. Thus in the time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was hee borne, that came to diſſolue
the power of darkneſſe; ſhining in darkneſſe,
when the darkneſſe could not comprehend him.
<hi>Nox</hi> is ſo called <hi>a nocendo,</hi> becauſe if men then walke
without light, they may eaſily hurt themſelues: and
now as a Phyſition in the beſt opportunitie came the
great helper in the time of hurting; to ſhew that hee
was ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then the deuil. <hi>Chriſt</hi> va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed the deuil
in his own time, the Prince of the night, in the night.
Farther, touching the houre, if we may beleue <hi>Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
that great Phyſition &amp; Aſtronomer, it was about
tenne of the clock, and fifteene minutes. For he in his
Comment vpon <hi>Ptolemies</hi> quadripartite, treating
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Natiuitie, makes the eleuenth degree of <hi>Virgo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8294:8"/>
to aſcend <hi>in prima domo,</hi> which could not bee but at
that time. The Fathers write that hee was borne at
midnight, as <hi>Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Bernard:</hi> which of theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
is trueſt, I will not decide. Myſteries there are
in both of them. If <hi>Cardan</hi> ſay true, then it fitly fell
out, that the Sonne of a Virgin was borne when the
heauenly figure <hi>Virgo</hi> did aſcend. If the Fathers ſay
true, then opportunately came he <hi>in medio noctis,</hi> that
was to be the <hi>medium</hi> betweene God and man. The
greateſt obſcuritie is at midnight; and then therefore
was produced the greateſt light; hee that was the
brightnes of his fathers glorie. Thus then in the ſixth
age of the World, in the two and fortieth yeere of
<hi>Auguſtus Caeſars</hi> Reigne, in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi>
in the fiue and twentieth and ſhorteſt day, on <hi>Sunday,</hi>
betweene ten and twelue at night, was our bleſſed

Gods promiſes, the <hi>Patriarches and Prophets predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
actions, and affections,</hi> fulfilled. And therefore
moſt excellently is it termed <hi>the fulneſſe of time.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

wherein as it is. <hi>Col</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note>

promotion,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>We taking them out of his fulnes</hi> as <hi>Ioh.</hi> ſaith.
And who can denie this to be <hi>the fulneſſe of time?</hi> To
this let me addo, that the world was now ful of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
Now the Angels ſang in heauen and comforted
ſhepheards on earth: Now a ſtrange ſtarre guided the
wiſemen to <hi>Christ:</hi> Now a wel-spring in <hi>Rome</hi> did
runne with Oyle: Now three Sunnes appeared, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
firſt ſeuerally, and then joyntly: Now <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
his <hi>aeternum palatium,</hi> that was propheſied neuer
to fall before a Virgin did beare a child, was ruinated
to the ground: Now <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> aſking one of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bils</hi>
whether there were any where a greater perſon
then himſelfe, ſaw in the <hi>Sunne</hi> a Virgin giuing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
ſucke, to whom afterwards hee dedicated an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and called it, <hi>Aram Coeli,</hi> the Altar of Heauen.
And thus yee ſee it proued, that it was <hi>the fulneſſe of
time,</hi> when he, that as <hi>S. Ioh.</hi> ſaith, <hi>full of grace &amp; truth</hi>
was borne amongſt vs. <hi>The Iewes</hi> expect yet a <hi>Meſstas</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8294:10"/>
to come: denying <hi>Ieſus</hi> whom wee beleeue on,
to bee the Worlds <hi>Sauiour.</hi> And the <hi>Turkes</hi>
dare to compare him with their <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But
this doctrine of <hi>the fulneſſe of time,</hi> wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was born, doth moſt plainly and forcibly confute
them. For ſith all the promiſes and mercies of
God; ſith the propheſies, figures, and deſires of
our famous forefathers, and manie admirable
Miracles, met in the time of <hi>Christs Natiuitie;</hi>
and that neuer <hi>Mahomet</hi> had the like; nor any
Creature can haue the like: wee are fully to bee
reſolued, by this <hi>fulneſſe of time,</hi> the true <hi>Meſstas</hi>
to bee borne. I could ſpend more time in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
vpon this time, but that greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
viz. <hi>The cauſes of Chriſts birth</hi> doe now
offer themſelues vnto mee in theſe wordes, <hi>God
ſent his ſonne:</hi> Where the Efficient cauſe is <hi>God;</hi>
the formall cauſe <hi>his ſending;</hi> and the materiall
cauſe <hi>his Sonne Christ</hi> himſelfe: <hi>God ſent.</hi> Who?
the Father, the Sonne, or the Holy Ghoſt?
Surely all three of them. For know, that
<hi>opera a Trinitatis ſunt in-diuiſa:</hi> and, vnleſſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
reſpects, euermore in Eſſentiall actions,
what one doth they all doe; as now in this worke
of <hi>Christs</hi> birth, the whole <hi>Trinitie</hi> ſhewed
their induſtrie.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 42. 5. 36. 37.</note> 
               <hi>The Father ſent mee</hi> ſaith <hi>Christ,
Ioh.</hi> 13. 20. Here the Father labours. <hi>I went out
from the Father and came into the World:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> Here is
the labour of the Sonne.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The Holy Ghost ſhall come
<pb facs="tcp:8294:11"/>
vpon thee</hi> quoth the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the bleſſed
<hi>Virgin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 5. 35.</note> when ſhe was to conceiue <hi>Chriſt:</hi> this is
the labour of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus the
three perſons, being one GOD, had each of
them their action in CHRISTS Incarnation;
and that moſt fitly: ſith it being a worke of great
power, Wiſdome, and goodnes, it was requiſite
that the Father with his power, the Sonne with
his Wiſedome, and the Holie Ghoſt with his
Goodneſſe, ſhould accompliſh it. What more
powerfull a thing, then to joyne two ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
diſtant Natures as the Creatour and
the Creature together! It is GODS eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
power in compound bodies, to joyne
the foure Elements together; it is greater
power to joyne our bodie to our created ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that is to ſay, our ſoules. But to joyne all
theſe to the increated ſpirit, God; this is a might
aboue all meaſure.</p>
            <p>Againe what more wiſe thing, then that to the
perfection and complement of the whole; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and the end of a worke ſhould hang
together. And now note this myſterie. The
Word was the beginning of the VVorld: for by
it GOD made the World; and <hi>Adam</hi> was
the laſt Creature of the VVorld. The Word
then becomming Man, the firſt and the laſt,
that is to ſay GOD and man, were vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Againe what greater goodneſſe can
<pb facs="tcp:8294:11"/>
bee, then that the Creatour ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelfe to the Creatures? It is his great
kindneſſe, that God giues himſelfe to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
by his eſsence, preſence, and power: it is
his greater kindnes that he giues himſelfe to good
men by his grace: but that hee ſhould giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to our nature, by Vnion with it, that is to
ſay, by aſſuming our Humanitic into his Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
this ſurmounts all fauour that may bee ſaid
or thought vpon. Thus I ſay the Fathers power,
the Sonnes wiſdome, and the Holy Ghoſts good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
were all <hi>Actors</hi> in clothing <hi>Chriſt</hi> with our
fleſh. To the doing whereof what moued them?
our merits? no; (<hi>Brethren</hi>) but their mercies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God ſoloued the World,
that he ſent his ſonne, &amp;c. Loue</hi> is manifeſted three
wayes: <hi>Dono, paſsione, opere,</hi> in giuing, ſuffering,
and working. The Father ſhewed his loue, when
he gaue vs his Sonne: the Sonne ſhewed his loue,
when hee ſuffered Death for our ſinnes; and the
Holy Ghoſt ſhewes his loue, in ſetting vs forward
in good workes. Thus the manifeſtation of the
bleſſed Trinities power, wiſdome, goodneſſe, and
mercie, are as it were the foure wheeles, vpon
which the Charriot of Gods prouidence brought
<hi>Chriſt</hi> into this world: Who came as ſent, <hi>God
ſent</hi> ſayth my text. Heere is a doubt worthie to
be diſcuſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was neuer ſeparated from God
his Father. For when Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw him vpon
<pb facs="tcp:8294:12"/>
earth, hee yet acknowledged him to bee <hi>in the
boſome of his Father ſecundum id</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18:</note> 
               <hi>cap. vnigeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
quie ſt in ſinis patris, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo that hee was
in Heauen,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>ſecundumid</hi> tertio capite, <hi>nemo aſcendit,
&amp;c. qui eſt in coelo;</hi> yea that hee was in the world
before his birth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 3.</note> ſith hee made the World; as it is
<hi>cap.</hi> 1. and how then may it be ſaid, that <hi>God ſent
him,</hi> when hee neuer went from him? An Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
ſhall make euident all this. <hi>Miſsio,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> commenting vpon this place, <hi>fuit
aſſumptio Carnis, non depoſitio maieſtatis: Chriſt</hi>
left not to bee God, when hee became man; but
tooke more vnto his Godhead when hee became
man, viz. our Humanitie into his Diuinitie: that
through our viſible nature aſſumed, he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
vs with his inuiſible excelencies, which els
could neuer haue beene known of vs. As the <hi>Sun</hi>
ſhining in his perfit brightnes, can not be looked
vpon; but in a Cloud or miſt, hauing his beames
refracted, may bee beheld ſo God, in his infinite
and incomprehenſible eſſence, being conſidered
of vs, cannot be knowne of vs, for he is too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an object for our weake vnderſtanding; but in
our Nature, by his ſonne aſſumed, hauing his
glorie and Majeſtie contracted, wee may take a
full view of him. And thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> his incarnating
is his proper ſending. But why ſent God his ſonne
the ſecond perſon in <hi>Trinitie?</hi> Wherefore had not
the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, come to be man
<pb facs="tcp:8294:12"/>
aſwel as the Sonne? (<hi>Brethren</hi>) this is a high point
in Diuinitie, requiring judiciall and attentiue
eares: which if yee lend mee, thus then I reſolue
yee.</p>
            <p>Truely there wanted no power in any of
thoſe perſons to performe this; for they are all
Omnipotent, and able to doe what ſoeuer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them. But yet why the ſonne did it rather
then the reſt; great reaſons are to bee alleaged.
Firſt, It was meete that by what inſtruments God
made the World, by the ſame he ſhould repaire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the World: But God by his ſonne made the
World, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and therfore as it is 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
well was God in <hi>Chriſt, by whom hee reconciled the
World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2. Cor. 5.</note> Secondly, It was fit that hee who was the
ſonne in the <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> ſhould alſo bee the ſonne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in <hi>Humanitie:</hi> leaſt if the Father or the Holy
Ghoſt had bin the ſonnes of men, they had then
beene temporall ſonnes to the Eternall ſonne.
Thirdly, the Father is of himſelfe alone, and the
Sonne is of the Father. Now then more ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
it is that he be ſent, who is of another, then he
that is of himſelfe. Fourthly, the Sonne was
ſent to be man, that wee might know how the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
father did loue man in ſending ſo precious a
thing to redeeme man therby, thus to ſtrengthen
our languiſhing hope, that ſith God thought not
his Sonne too good forvs, how can wee doubt
but that hee will beſtow all other things on vs
<pb facs="tcp:8294:13"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whatſoeuer wee begge of him? Fiftly, GOD
<hi>bath predeſtinated vs</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul Romans</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note>
               <hi>to bee conformable to the Image of his ſonne:</hi>
that therefore had hee not ſent his Sonne,
how could wee bee like to his Sonne? had
not he come that was the Naturall ſonne; wee
ſhould neuer haue beene adopted ſonnes. The
ſonne of God therefore was made the ſonne of
man, that we ſonnes of men might bee made the
ſonnes of God. Sixtly, God the ſonne is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> perſon betweene God the <hi>Father,</hi> and God
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and therefore was fitteſt to bee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſent <hi>to bee the mediator betweene God and man.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly,
He that was to worke our redemption
was to be an interceſſor and ſupplicator to God
for vs. But theſe properties are more proper to
a ſonne, then a Father: for a ſonne is to intreat
the Father, and not the Father the ſonne. And
therefore did God beſt to ſend his ſonne. Laſt of
all; the Mediator betweene God and man was to
pacifie, ſo to teach and guide man to be obedient
vnto God. Now then <hi>Chriſt being the word of God
and wiſdome of God,</hi> as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> and <hi>Saint Paul</hi>
affirme: meeteſt was hee, the ſonne, to be mans
Teacher and Counſailor. Why God ſent his Son
yee ſee the Reaſons. <hi>Now</hi> behold wee in what
manner he ſent him: the third thing I am to ſpeak
of. It is ſaid <hi>made of a woman and made vnder the
law.</hi> What is written before in my text of him,
<pb facs="tcp:8294:13"/>
that <hi>in the fulneſſe of time God ſent him,</hi> pointes to
his Diuinitie, and his glorie: but that now Hee
is <hi>made of a Woman and vnder the Law,</hi> this
ſhewes his Humanitie and Humilitie: How
the two Natures Godhead and Manhood were
vnited together in the vnitie of his perſon. <hi>Paul</hi>
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. talkes of a great myſterie of pietie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>How
God was manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpirit,
was ſeene of Angels, was preached to the Gentiles,
beleiued on in the World, and aſſumed into glorie.</hi>
And heere behold this production of God, <hi>to be
made of a woman,</hi> is the beginning of it; opening
as it were the doore to the other moſt admirable
actions. But what a ſtrange thing is this, that the
maker of the World ſhould thus bee made of a
woman: and that the Creatour ſhould haue his
being from a Creature. This rightly to conceiue,
ye are to note this. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
was increated; in reſpect of his ſoule he was
created; and in reſpect of his bodie he was made
of a woman. As we Chriſtians are borne, firſt,
naturally of our Parents, and afterwards are born
ſpiritually of the Holy Ghoſt: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> beeing
God, was begotten naturally of God; and now
being man, was made temporally of a woman.
<hi>Verbum caro factum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Saint Iohn cap.</hi> 1.
<hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth 2.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. Heb. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. that <hi>he came of the ſeed of
Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. that <hi>no where hee tooke on him the
Angels, but the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>tooke he on him,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8294:14"/>
and all this by being made of a woman, <hi>Of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'?</hi>
yee will ſay what reaſon had God to effect
ſo ſtrange an action: I will tell yee; to aduance
his glorie, and doe vs the more good. O how
kind did God ſhew himſelfe in taking vpon him
our fraile nature! Hee might haue come to vs as
he did to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinay</hi>
in thundering, lightning, fire, and ſmoake: hee
might haue come to vs in the ſubſtance of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell</hi>
aſsumed, but yet becauſe hee loued man, to
man he came in the eſtate of man. O how juſt did
God ſhew himſelfe to bee made of a Woman!
The Deuill before had conquered all fleſh in the
firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> and now the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> took fleſh
in it to ſubdue the Deuill. O how wiſe did God
herein ſhew himſelfe, that when one man by
ſinne had diſpleaſed him, another man by his
righteouſneſſe ſhould pacific him! I meane <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
who being God, <hi>therefore became man to be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
betweene God and man:</hi> Which office no
other Creature neyther man nor <hi>Angell</hi> could
poſſibly haue executed, ſith infinite being the
Maieſtie of him that by ſinne was offended, by
no perſon but him that is of infinite goodneſſe
it could be appeaſed. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore tooke God
and man into the vnitie of his perſon to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
God and man into the vnitie of affection.
Theſe &amp; ſuch like inuiſible excellencies of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Iuſtice, Wiſdome, to make viſible vnto vs,
<pb facs="tcp:8294:14"/>
he took on him our viſible nature in mercie des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to vs; ſith wee in might could not aſcend
to him. Secondly, <hi>Chriſtus factus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> As for
the promotion of his owne glorie, ſo for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of our good, in many things to help vs;
to inſtruct our faith which could not but beleeue,
when ſhe heard God himſelfe to ſpeake; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
our hope which could not but bee cheered,
when ſhe ſaw God vnited to our nature; to kindle
our charitie, that could not but loue God, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
perceiuing how God loued man, to draw our
actions to vertue, that could not but imitate God,
giuing himſelfe for an example; and to make vs
partakers of his Diuinitie, that as God was the
ſonne of man, ſo wee men ſhould bee made the
ſonnes of God. Againe, <hi>Chriſtus factus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> to
remoue many euils from vs, that the deuill the
author of ſin, though hee were an Angell ſhould
not be preferred before vs; that man conſidering
the dignitie of his nature, how it is in vnion with
God, ſhould not ſpot it with ſinne, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
with the thought of Chriſtes merites,
our pride with the remembrance of his humilitie,
and the feare of death and hell with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his perſon, might bee daunted and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Further, <hi>Dei filius factus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> to verifie
his Incarnation. <hi>Valentine</hi> held Chriſt to haue
brought a body with him from heauen, and to
haue taken no fleſh from his Mother, <hi>Marcion,
<pb facs="tcp:8294:15"/>
Apelles, Cerdonius,</hi> and <hi>Manes,</hi> affirmed Chriſt to
haue but a phantaſtical body, ſuch as Angels and
ſpirits aſſume. The <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> imagine
Chriſt to bee the breath of God, whom becauſe
God ſaw that the Iewes would crucifie, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffered Chriſt to delude their eyes, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to doe and ſuffer what hee did not. But
theſe hereſies are notably confuted in this, <hi>That
he was made of a woman.</hi> For if a woman were his
true Mother, bearing him ten Monethes in her
wombe, bringing him forth &amp; giuing him ſucke:
then vndoubtedly he was a true man, and had a
true, naturall, and not a celeſtiall and phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body, Laſt of all, <hi>Chriſt was made of a Woman,</hi>
to grace women kind with his birth, that before
had diſgraced it ſelfe with the deuils temptation.
A woman in Paradiſe, was a meane to make man
a ſinner, and a woman in <hi>Bethlem</hi> was an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bring forth to man a Sauiour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an ancient Father ſaith thus; Becauſe the
male kind is more noble, Chriſt would be a man:
and yet that woman ſhould not bee contemned,
hee was borne of a woman. But why doth <hi>Paul</hi>
here name ſo expreſſly a woman, and not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a man? Becauſe indeede man had no action in
Chriſts generation: For as our Sauior being God
had a Father, &amp; no mother: So being man he had
a Mother, but no Father. Where note, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is brought forth foure kind of wayes. <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8294:15"/>
was made without man or woman: <hi>Eue</hi> was
made of a man without a woman: We are made
of men and women; and Chriſt was made of a
woman without a man. If yee aske of what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
I anſwere yee, <hi>Marie</hi> the Virgine, <hi>Whom all
generations doe call bleſſed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 1. 48.</note> Of her bloud or ſeede,
by the working of the Holy Ghoſt was Chriſt
made. O what ſtrange birth was this, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
was the Mother, and God the Sonne! ſaith
<hi>Bernard.</hi> It became not God to haue any Mother
but a maiden: and it beſeemed a maide to haue
no ſonne but God.</p>
            <p>Wonders are in this mother, and in this ſonne.
This mother was ſanctified with the fulneſſe of
grace, with the ouer-shadowing of the Holy
Ghoſt, and the inhabitation of the Sonne of God.
Shee was, ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard, Sinepudore foecunda,
ſine grauamine granida, ſine dolore puerpera.</hi> By
bearing Chriſt, ſhee was the ſtarre that gaue light
to the Sunne, the branch that bare the Vine, the
Riuer that yeelded the fountaine, the daughter
that brought forth her Father, the creature that
gaue being to the Creatour: ſhee was I ſay the
Mother of her Father, and the daughter of her
Sonne, yonger then her birth, leſser then what
ſhee contained, a maiden, and a Mother, to haue
a Sonne with God the Father: whereas Virgines
were curſed for barrenneſſe, and wiues for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth with ſorrow, <hi>Marie</hi> was free from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:8294:16"/>
of theſe: For being a Virgine ſhee was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and bringing forth child ſhee felt no paines.
As the Sunne ſhines through glaſſe and corrupts
it not: So God came made of a Virgine without
breach of her chaſtitie. And becauſe ſhee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
without ſinne, ſhee was therefore deliuered
without paines. Aganie, wonders are in this
Sonne. In the inſtant of his conception, and now
by ſucceſſion of time he was a perfit man in ſoule
and body, voide of ſinne and full of grace. Hee
had a father in heauen, and a mother on earth,
but yet a father without a mother, and a mother
without a father. Further by being <hi>made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
of a Lord he became a ſeruant, of eternall he
was made temporall, of infinite he became an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
of high he became low, of incomprehenſible
locall, of intelligible, ſenſible: borne hee was in a
womans wombe, himſelfe bearing the World,
and ſuck he did at a maidens breſts, himſelfe <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
food to all things.</hi> Thus <hi>of a woman was Chriſt
made,</hi> and not onely ſo, but alſo <hi>Vnder the Law:
made of a woman</hi> is the humilitie of his birth; <hi>made
vnder the Law</hi> is the humilitie of his life: in birth,
in life, and in manie other thinges crying out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, that <hi>we would learne of him, to bee humble
and meeke.</hi> Among the Iewes diuers lawes were
in vſe in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, the <hi>Morall, Ceremoniall, Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi>
and vnder all theſe our <hi>Sauiour</hi> was made.
Yee will object how can this bee? They (<hi>ſaith
<pb facs="tcp:8294:16"/>
Paul) Gal. 5. that are led by the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>are not vnder
the Law:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was led by the ſpirit, and was
full of the ſpirit, and therfore the law had nought
to doe with him. For anſwere accept this. To
<hi>be vnder the Law</hi> carrieth a double ſenſe; to bee
vnder eyther the obſeruance of the Law, or the
oppreſſion of the Law. Now then <hi>Chriſt</hi> was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obſeruance of the Law. For he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
the eight day, preſented afterwardes
in the Temple, and did thoſe things that the law
required: but not vnder the oppreſſion of the
Law, ſo as the breach thereof did any way bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
him; ſith hee was harmeleſſe and innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And yet in reſpect of our ſinnes, the guilt wherof
in mercie he vndertooke, he was vnder the lawes
oppreſsion. Alſo for the puniſhment due to our
offences, the Law inflicted on him; it accuſed
him, and condemned him before the Tribunall
of God of all the ſinnes of the World; it made
his bodie ſweat water and bloud, it made his
ſoule heauie to the death; and on the Croſſe ſo
perplexed his whole humanitie that he cried out,
<hi>My God my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me.</hi> Thus
the bleſſed maker of all thinges was twiſe now
made. Firſt, <hi>Of a Woman,</hi> to entertaine our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſecondly, <hi>Vnder the Law,</hi> to ſuſtaine our
ſinnes. And all this to what end? It followes in
the end of my Text, which ſhewes the end why
<hi>Chriſt</hi> came, &amp;c. <hi>To redeeme thoſe that were vnder
<pb facs="tcp:8294:17"/>
the Law, that we might receiue the adoption of ſonnes.</hi>
See (<hi>Deere Chriſtians</hi>) how proportionable Gods
meanes are to the effecting of his purpoſes! <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was made <hi>vnder the Law</hi> to redeeme vs from the
Law, and was made <hi>the ſonne of a Woman,</hi> that we
might receiue <hi>the adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the ſons of God.</hi> Two
generall and ſingular bleſſings containing all that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done for vs, are heere conueighed vnto
vs: Redemption, and Exaltation, Freedome, and
Aduancement: Redemption and freedome to be
exempted from the Law; and Exaltation and
Aduancement to haue the adoption to bee Gods
ſonnes. The Law, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, did <hi>domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: playing the Tyrant amongſt
men, as <hi>Pharao</hi> did among the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> it ſtil cried
out, keep the Commandement; with infinite cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to thoſe that eyther would not, or could not
keep euery jot of it. It impoſed, vpon men an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
burden, it aggrauated ſinne, it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the conſcience,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.</note> and as it is 2. <hi>Cor. 2. it was the
adminiſtration of death and damnation.</hi> Now then
<hi>Chriſt made vnder the Law,</hi> did free men from this
Law; and how but by his fulfilling of it for vs?
His humilitie ſatisfied the Law for our pride, his
faſting for our gluttonie, his Chaſtitie for our
wantonneſſe, his mildneſſe for our wrath, his
kindneſſe for our enuie, his obedience for our
negligence, his excellencies for our infirmities:
that when the Law gaping ſo for righteouſneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:8294:17"/>
as a Lyon for his prey, hauing the morſell of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> perfection and holineſſe, throwne into her
mouth, ſhe was preſently ſatiſfied and appeaſed,
and vpon that doth feed yet at this houre, which
otherwiſe could not not be contented with anie
thing which poore man could yeeld vnto her. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as before <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, wee were <hi>bondſlaues
vnder the Law:</hi> So were we Baſtards in nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
from that Holineſſe and righteouſnes
wherein we were created, aud thereby depirued
of our Heauenly inheritance. And now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
by being <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> doth make <hi>vs
to be true ſonnes</hi> againe; for hee by clothing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with our nature becomming <hi>our brother,</hi> as
<hi>Paul</hi> termes him <hi>primogenitꝰ inter multoſfratres,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> by
a conſequent drawes vs in to be the ſonnes of his
father; ſo giuing vs of his ſpirit to be the children
of God, as hee tooke of our fleſh to bee the
ſonne of man: he by our fleſh counted the Virgin
his Mother, and we by his ſpirit (as the Apoſtle
ſayth) <hi>crie Abba Father.</hi> Thus not onely to make
vs freemen, but alſo ſonnes; the ſonne of God
came. The ſumme of this point is briefly this,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> came as <hi>Manna</hi> from Heauen to feede vs
being hungrie, as the cluſter of Grapes out of the
Vineyard, to ſatiſfie vs being thirſtie, as Oyle
powred out to cure vs being wounded. Hee came
as our head, that giues vs ſpiritual ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as our Mediatour, that being God and man
beſt reconciles God and man; as our foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:8294:18"/>
which we build our faith; as our doore giuing
paſſage to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> as our Shepheard feeding vs;
our ſacrifice expiating vs; our Prieſt praying for
vs; as our way in example, life in reward. Hee
came as a man to make vs gods, as a ſeruant to
make vs Lords, to earth to lift vs vp to Heauen.
He came mortall to make vs immortall, poore
to make vs rich, and baſe to make vs glorious. In
a word, <hi>He that was the bread</hi> was hungrie that we
might be fed: he that was <hi>the fountaine</hi> was dry,
that wee might be ſatisfied. Hee that was joy
was ſad, that we might be comforted; and he that
was <hi>the way,</hi> was wearied, that we might be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to heauen. And thus haue yee heard the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his comming: the Time,
Cauſes, Manner, End. The Doctrine wherof, for
a concluſion; let vs put to theſe vſes. Firſt, Sith <hi>in
the fulneſſe of time</hi> came he that was full of grace
and truth, let vs alſo fulfill our times that wee
ſpend in godly labours: In time of prayer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout;
in time of preaching, attentiue; in time of
proſperitie bountifull; in time of pouertie, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;
in time of feaſting, temperate; in all times
vertuous and honeſt, and then no time ſhal paſſe
emptie of dutie. Next, ſith <hi>God ſent his Sonne,</hi>
Let vs acknowledge the benefit hereof, how
much we are bound to the Lord, that ſo great a
perſon as hee would beſtow ſo great a gift on vs
moſt vnworthie Creatures, and withall prouide
<pb facs="tcp:8294:18"/>
our hearts to haue ſuch roomes in them, as may
be fit to enteraine ſo honourable a gueſt thus <hi>ſent</hi>
vnto vs: let our repentance ſweep cleane the
chambers of our ſoules, let a good conſcience be
his bedding, and let graces and vertues be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of his lodging. Next ſith he was <hi>made
of a Woman,</hi> and <hi>vnder the Law,</hi> let vs learne that
ſith he hath ſo dignified our nature, as with it to
cloth himſelfe, to haue a care that wee ſpot it not
or defile it with ſinne. A poore maide married to
a King, ought to forget her baſe bringing vp, and
to forgoe her clowniſh qualities: and our Nature
married to God muſt vnlooſe the filthie actions
of her corrupt generation, and <hi>put on the new man,</hi>
to be like to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Further ſith <hi>vnder the Law,</hi>
let vs remember what a heauie burden hee tooke
on him to eaſe our ſhoulders, and ſo be the more
willing to beare any croſſe that he ſhall lay vpon
vs. Finally, ſith hee hath redeemed vs from the
Law, and makes vs <hi>adopted ſonnes:</hi> let vs carrie our
ſelues as men that haue Chriſtian libertie, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<hi>Sinne, Death, Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Deuill;</hi> that with
the chaines of ſlauiſh feare would ſtil keep vs cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.
Laſt of all, ſith we are <hi>his ſonnes by adoption,</hi>
let vs doe our dutie to our Heauenly Father: Let
vs loue, feare, and ſerue him with all our hearts
ſoules and ſtrength: let vs bee taught with his
precepts, let vs be guided with his counſailes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
with his promiſes, terrified with his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8294:19"/>
but eſpecially be wonne with his mercies.
Then as gracious ſonnes will hee reward vs with
the glorious inheritance of his Heauenly
Kingdome. <hi>To the which place</hi> hee
that was borne for
vs, bring vs.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
