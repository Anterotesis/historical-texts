            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>, to Custome</hi>; And moreover the <hi>Synod</hi> doth decree a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Observation of that <hi>Custome</hi> in these solemn words, which the Church truly Catholick did perpetually reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as an <hi>Oracle, viz. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>That Churches should have their priviledges preserved.</hi> The same is clearly evident from the words in the second Canon of the first <hi>Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Council,</hi> which most expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands each Church in every Diocess to be governed according to that <hi>Custome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51928:12"/>
of the Fathers</hi> which had prevailed, the priviledges being preserved which by the <hi>Nicen Canons</hi> have been granted to the Churches.</p>
               <p>The second part of the Position (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Councils have confirmed the Rights of Patriarchates</hi>) is manifest both by the former Paragraph, and principally by that Illustrious Canon, which is the last save one of the Oecumenick <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Chalcedon</hi> (that is the 206 Canon of the Universal Church) <note n="a" place="margin">This very 28th.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> wherein yet the same Canon is to bee read; so that wee may justly question the fidelity of the later <hi>Roman Copies,</hi> which have it expunged.</note> neither the truth nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity whereof hath any one questioned, unlesse carried away violently with an affection to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51928:13"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> partie. The words of the said Canon are most emphatical. Behold the very marrow and vigour of it express'd.</p>
               <p>First, The Catholick Ancients do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that they in this decree, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where follow the definitions of the Holy Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Priviledges of the Elder Rome,</hi> they say not (are founded by <hi>Christ,</hi> or by <hi>Peter,</hi> or by <hi>Paul,</hi> but) <hi>are indulged by the Fathers,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They adjust the reason of this Prerogative, and that not divine, nor indeed so much as Ecclesiastical, but meerly secular, to wit (as wee shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate in the third Paragraph) <hi>the Imperial Authority, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because that City was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse of the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Fathers, moved by the same consideration, declare, <hi>That they</hi> (as much as lyes in them) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>will communicate equal Priviledges
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51928:13"/>
to the most holy Throne of New</hi> Rome. <hi>Rightly judging</hi> (they are the words of the very Canon) <hi>that Constantinople,</hi> which they call <hi>New Rome, being honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both with Empire and Senate, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy equal Priviledges with the Elder Rome; and in Ecclesiastical affairs, no less than she, be extolled and magnified, as her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or next unto her:</hi> hitherto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>second,</hi> to wit, in order, but no way obnoxious in jurisdiction to <hi>Rome,</hi> as is plain by her equality with <hi>Rome,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way asserted in the Canon, and will afterward more clearly appear both out of the 8th. Canon of the first <hi>Ephesine Council,</hi> as also the ninth Canon of the <hi>Council of Chalcedon</hi>; both which Canons are cited and illustrated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Position.</p>
               <p>The third part of the Position, <hi>viz. The Rights of Patriarchates Emperours have established,</hi> is confirmed both by reason and by practice; and that first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, then special likewise.</p>
               <p>The general Reason, being as it were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51928:14"/>
the foundation of this whole discourse deeper laid, is farther to be reached.</p>
               <p>First, Therefore wee say, That <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families</hi> were at first both <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Priests.</hi> Moreover, as the supplicate of the whole <hi>Gallick</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acta inter Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. Pulch. &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifac.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>King Philip the Faire,</hi> almost four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years since, very rightly observeth against <hi>Pope Boniface, Melchisedec</hi> is expresly said to be <hi>King</hi> before <hi>Priest,</hi> and consequently the <hi>King</hi> taketh not from the <hi>Priest,</hi> nor ought to acknowledge that hee owes unto the <hi>Priest</hi> his Crown, or the rights thereof (such as the external Regiment of the Church is proved to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wee say, That by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Families, and their amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation into Cities, and Communities, the Oeconomick Authority in process of time, became politick.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wee assert, That in the first institution of the <hi>Priesthood, Moses</hi> took away no part of the supream jurisdiction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51928:14"/>
from the Politick Authority; Therefore the Royal Power remained the same it was before, both <hi>Legislative</hi> and <hi>Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary,</hi> as well in Sacred as Civil Affairs. For <hi>Moses,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">Deuter. 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.5.</note> 
                  <hi>King in Iesurun,</hi> was constituted by God himself, the keeper as well of <note n="†" place="margin">Numb. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>both Trumpets,</hi> as Tables; now what pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Moses</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> is every Kings due. This very comparative Argument, as rightly consequent from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine the Great,</hi> after the revolutions of so many ages, <hi>Eusebius</hi> five or six times applies to establish the Imperial Authority about the Convocation and confirmation of the first <hi>Nicene Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, As <hi>Moses,</hi> not <hi>Aaron,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Ceremonial Law: so, long after <hi>Moses,</hi> King <hi>David</hi> instituted the courses of the <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> thrust out <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High Priest.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When Christ inaugurated his Apostles, hee furnished them with great powers of his own, such as are the Administration of Sacraments, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51928:15"/>
power of the Keyes; but all that Christ bestowed on his Apostles cumulatively, nought at all privatively: for indeed our Lord Christ would neither by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Priesthood, nor his whole first Advent, have any thing detracted from the Jurisdiction or Authority of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers; nor that Kings, because Christians, should have their Prerogative abated.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Wee say, That <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>Kings,</hi> ought to be the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgick Officers</hi> of Christ;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.6.</note> and so far <hi>Kings</hi> in their degree may, yea ought to be <hi>Ministers of the Church,</hi> and, as it were, <hi>External Bishops</hi> of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Government, (as <note n="s" place="margin">You are Bishops as to the interiour, I, as to the exteriour.</note> 
                  <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> said wisely of himself) That same the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Title of Christ himself, <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth,</hi> seems to erect for all <hi>Kings</hi> of right, although in fact most of <hi>Kings</hi> are not, yet by vertue of this title they are obliged all to bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51928:15"/>Seventhly, We say, That there are very many things pertaining to the external Polity of the Church, which although they belong properly and primarily to the King alone, yet in case of necessity, as they say, and secondarily are out of course devolved upon the <hi>Clergy.</hi> For instance, To call Synods; ordain Fasts or Festivals; distinguish Parishes into Diocesses, or Provinces; to fix and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Hierarchical degrees of <hi>Bishops,</hi> so as this man is a <hi>Bishop,</hi> that a <hi>Primate,</hi> the third a <hi>Metropolitane</hi>; that this <hi>Bishop</hi> should be under the jurisdiction of that <hi>Metropolitane,</hi> and contrarily, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some weighty or lawful either occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, necessity, or publick commodity of the Church, that this should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the other under whom hee was before. These, and very many of like sort, according to the various state of the Church, pertain both to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest.</hi> For those two most different times of the Church's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ought not to be confounded, I mean of persecution, and peace. Because
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51928:16"/>
in time of persecution under Infidel <hi>Kings,</hi> so long as <hi>Princes</hi> are altogether and every way dis-joyned from the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Princes,</hi> the divine order ceaseth, and the <hi>Royal</hi> Succession suffer's necessarily interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I say <hi>interruption,</hi> not <hi>abolition</hi>) For so long the case is plainly extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and, while so, <hi>the Woman</hi> is in <hi>the Desart,</hi> and the Church supplies this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Princes</hi> as she can. As when the Husband is absent or sick, the Matron governs the Family. But the divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Order re-entring, the ordinary state of the Church returneth also; so soon as <hi>Kings</hi> resume the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the partition-wall presently falls down, and then by due right <hi>Kings</hi> take again their exteriour power over the Christian <hi>Church.</hi> Otherwise we should say, that in order to the Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> there ought to be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi>; nor, as to dominion in sacred Affairs and the right use thereof, that this <hi>Emperour</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51928:16"/>
any more with the <hi>Church,</hi> than the other; which would be dissonant, not onely from right Reason, but also from holy Scripture. Therefore the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 49.23.</note> so soon as hee becomes Christian, ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his restitution intire. And this in this Argument is the matter of right, or general Reason, which wee lay down as the Base of that right which belongs to the <hi>Emperour</hi> in establishing the external limits of the Ecclesiastical Government.</p>
               <p>As to the matter of fact, or practice, that is both general or Catholick, and also special.</p>
               <p>The general practice (beside the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the second Argument which was proved before) consists in an induction of Councils, as well General as Provincial, all which as they suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the <hi>Emperour</hi> himself the very convocation of councils: so do they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the same <hi>Emperour</hi> every one of their decrees, even those in matters of Faith, which although, as to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsec Authority, they depend onely
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51928:17"/>
on the Word of God, and Truth it self; yet, as to their extrinsec Authority, they depend on the <hi>Imperial</hi> Sentence: but if those of Faith, how much more those which are onely of the bare Regiment of the Church, such as is the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> lye all under the Imperial decrees? to wit, in this sense, That the Canon of the <hi>Church</hi> may have the force of a Law, that wholly proceeds from the Authority of the <hi>Prince.</hi> Thence is it, that every one of the Ancient Councils, all the Ancient Catholick <hi>Bishops</hi> (even the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> himself) present them alwaies to the <hi>Emperour</hi> to be supplied, amended, perfected; and so humbly petition from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> not a naked <hi>protection,</hi> or late execution; but an intire <hi>ratification</hi> and confirmation of every Council, without which, as to the external effect, they are to become unattired, void, and plainly of no force. Concerning this Truth, I appeal not onely to the Councils of <hi>Cavalion, Mentz</hi> and <hi>Toures,</hi> with the rest of the less sort; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51928:17"/>
I produce the very four general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, concerning the first of which, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Nice, Eusebius</hi> expresly relates, that the <hi>Emperour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, confirming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synod, did fortifie them,</hi> as it were <hi>with his seal.</hi> I appeal also to the first Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the very Epistle of the Council to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Theodosius,</hi> wherein all the holy Fathers petition the <hi>Emperour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. to have the Suffrage of the Synod confirmed.</hi> Yea, I appeal to <hi>Leo</hi> himself <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> (whom I beleeve not to have been of the most abject spirit among those in that <hi>Pontificate</hi>) who in every one of his <note n="†" place="margin">Lett. 23, 24, 25.</note> Letters to three <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> humbly <hi>petitions</hi> (not <hi>commands,</hi> much less <hi>decrees</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but) <hi>beseecheth, supplicates,</hi> that the <hi>Emperour</hi> would <hi>command,</hi> &amp;c. But it may suffice to have declared these things, though somewhat at large, yet but by the way, to the evincing (by a general rule from the whole to the part) <hi>That the rights
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51928:18"/>
of Patriarchates introduced by Custome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confirmed by Councils, were established by Emperours,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was the last lemme of our Position.</p>
               <p>The same will appear more evidently in the special practice of the Catholick <hi>Emperours.</hi> For by what Authority <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Iustiniana prima</hi> to a new <hi>Patriarchate,</hi>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51928:20"/>Thirdly, Let us grant (which yet is undetermined) that the <hi>Roman Patriarch</hi> had obtained an extraordinary or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi> Jurisdiction over all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Italick</hi> Diocese, as his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbicaries,</hi> and that they were those <hi>ten</hi> in number, <hi>viz.</hi> the three Islands of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie, Corsica,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the <hi>seven other</hi> placed <hi>on the Continent.</hi> Which ten Provinces some do assign to the same Diocese, induced by that ancient Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from which it appears, that the Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction of the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both for the beauty and benefit of order and unity, as also to insinuate a mutual harmony (which ought, as much as may be, to be cherished between the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Republick</hi>) in a certain accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate imitation, was so coextended with, and adjusted to, the temporal Regiment of the secular Vicars, that the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick <hi>Patriarchates</hi> or <hi>Primacies</hi> were not enlarged farther than the temporal Jurisdiction of the Vicars, that is, to the limits of those Dioceses, the Cities whereof, in which resided the Vicars,

were <hi>Metropolies,</hi> where was fixed the <hi>Praetory</hi> it self, which was the highest Tribunal of all causes, and all appeals likewise in the Provinces subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The very same government of the Church was retained for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Unity, unto which was had special regard by that singular and excellent subordination of the lesser Clerks to their <hi>Bishops</hi> in every City; of the <hi>Bishops</hi> unto their <hi>Metropolitanes</hi> in every Province; and of the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> to their <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese.

               </argument>
               <p>TO the first, whatsoever the Rebels at this day on either side falsely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the contrary, it appears out of very many Histories, and the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Chronicles, that the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath been an <hi>Empire,</hi> and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the world, which was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by one supream <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> both in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and <hi>Temporals,</hi> and that wholly independent of any forein <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Supremacy</hi> whatsoever on earth.</p>
               <p>This is the very marrow expressed from the formal words of a statute at

               <p>But upon this whole <hi>Britannick</hi> affair, the thing most worthy our observation is, That this decree, for the liberty of the <hi>Britannick Churches</hi> was not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a new Law, as in spight to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> new upstarts calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate, who are either ignorant of, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to, the <hi>Britannick</hi> priviledge: but the said decree was onely declarative of an Ancient <hi>Custome,</hi> which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly prevailed in <hi>England,</hi> eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years since, and so many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:

                  <hi>Bede</hi> testifieth the same, where hee relates that <hi>Colman</hi> the <hi>Bishop (Finanus</hi>'s Successour in the <hi>Pontificate</hi> of the <hi>Northymbrians) with his fellows, chose rather to desert Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and Monastery, than their Ancient Manners.</hi> Which fact of <hi>Bishop Colman</hi> is worth observation, lest, what some falsely pretend, onely the Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> may seem to have rejected <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> against whom, charged upon them, this was the Legitimate defence of the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> these being their very words out of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51928:28"/>
And truly this answer of the <hi>Britains</hi> was grounded on very irrefragable, very Catholick reason, and that because this unwonted subjection had contradicted the sixth Oecumenick Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Ancient Manners to bee kept.</hi> This had also destroyed the eighth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the first <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, by which first such usurpation, to wit, in the case of the <hi>Cyprian Church,</hi> is called in Hypothesis, <hi>a thing innovated beside Ecclesiastick Constitutions and Canons of the Holy Fathers,</hi> which, as common diseases, therefore needs a greater remedy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the dammage is greater which it brings. Secondly, Therefore the Holy Synod (in <hi>Thesi,</hi> as they say, or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) commands, <hi>that that should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in all Dioceses and Provinces wheresoever</hi> (Behold the Authentick Charter of the <hi>Britannick Liberty.</hi>) Thirdly, That <hi>no Bishop</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> not excepted) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade any other Province, which from the beginning hath not been under his, or his

predecessours jurisdiction</hi> (as, for instance, did <hi>Augustin</hi> the Monk.) Fourthly, The <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Canon goes on, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years, more or less, before <hi>Augustins</hi> invasion of the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> as it were fore-seeing it, by provision declares it to be void, in these most weighty words. <hi>That if any one shall invade it, and make it his own by force, hee shall restore it.</hi> Fifthly, Yet further (for the following words are most emphatical, and which, as by and by shall appear, seem chiefly to regard the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> himself.) The Holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod warneth, <hi>that the Canons of the Holy Fathers be not passed by, nor that the pride of secular power creep in under the specious pretence of administring sacred Affairs, and by little and little unawares wee lose that Liberty which our Lord Iesus Christ, the deliverer of all men, hath purchased for us by his blood.</hi> Yea the Holy <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Synod, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enforcement, yet again repeats the decree. <hi>It hath therefore pleased the Holy and Universal Synod [to decree] that to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51928:29"/>
every Province be preserved pure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, the rights which it had from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning, according to ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> every <hi>Metropolitane</hi> (and so the <hi>Britannick</hi>) having liberty to take Copies of the Act for his Security. Yet the Holy Synod concludes according to its Oecumenical Authority: <hi>If any one shall bring any Sanction</hi> (every word is most general) <hi>repugnant to those which now are defined, it hath pleased intirely the Holy and Universal Synod, that it bee void.</hi> Hitherto for the Liberty of the Churches [extends] the most express Canon of the Catholick Church, which after the matter of fact first declared, completes the matter of right in favour as well of the <hi>Britannick,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> Church. For since, as out of the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises appears, the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> in the <hi>West</hi> enjoyed the same priviledge wherewith the <hi>Cyprian Church</hi> was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the <hi>East,</hi> why may not shee lawfully resume what is her own, in time of peace, which was taken from her, by tumult and force, in a turbulent time of the wars?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:51928:30"/>The sum of the whole most Inculent Canon is this; The ancient and truly Catholick Church would have the rights of every Church preserved, not taken away, and if they be taken away by force or fraud, what <hi>Patriarch</hi> soever doth it, his fact is declared void, and moreover hee is commanded to restore that Province which he hath made his own.</p>
               <p>Now that this Canon was establisht in a tacite opposition to the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> himself, is, not obscurely, to bee collected out of the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>The Britannick Church persevering in its Primitive Exemption from the Roman Patriarchate, so far is it from that it ought, or can be therefore called Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, that rather in the very same respect (before truly Catholick Iudges) that Church appears both to have been, and yet really to bee, by so much the more every way Catholick, by how much that Church, more than others, is an Assertour of the whole Ancient Catholick Liberty, which by so many sacred Canons of four General Councils, the <hi>Nicene, Constantinopolitan, Ephesine</hi> and

               <p>First, Therefore, whether the causes of our withdrawing were sufficient, is no way a matter of Faith, but wholly matter of fact, whereto the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> himself (that I may speak the truth as gently as may be) was at least accessory, and therefore can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge of the cause, but rather, if the business would bear a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, it were to be presented to a truly <hi>Oecumenical</hi> or general free Council, rightly and legitimately called.

                  <hi>Britannick Church</hi> doth so reverence the General Councils, that she hath provided by a special Statute, <hi>That not any one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with spiritual jurisdiction, shall declare or administer his Ecclesiastical censures, or adjudge any matter or cause to be heresie, but onely such as before had been determined, ordered, or adjudged to be heresie by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by the first four General Councils, or any of them, or by any other General Council.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the second, it is to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much observed, That the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> at the time of her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, was not truly in <hi>fact,</hi> much less by <hi>right,</hi> subject to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having been — years before her reformation under <hi>Edward</hi> 6. altogether exempt from the <hi>Roman Patriarchate,</hi> to wit, by the <hi>Imperial</hi> Authority, and by that of <hi>Prince Henry the eighth,</hi> whom to have been impowred to do it by right appears before in the first Position.</p>
               <p>But what occasion soever of the withdrawing at that time shall bee

pretended, it cannot prejudice the <hi>Royal Right,</hi> or any way derogate from the ancient <hi>Custome</hi> of the <hi>Britannick Church.</hi> Nay, the <hi>British</hi> Nation could not have opposed either of the two, without being hainously guilty both of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> especially since that whole business of the Church's restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was transacted with the express consent of the <hi>Britannick Clergy</hi> (then <hi>Romane</hi>) a Provincial Council of which alone, in defect of a General<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was at that time the supream meerly Ecclesiastick tribunal of the <hi>Britannick</hi> Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, onely, the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> ought to be, or indeed could be subject, because in that article of time, no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, truly general, sate. As for that of <hi>Trent,</hi> which afterward followed, it was at highest onely <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> to which consequently the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> before exempt by lawful authority from the <hi>Romane Patriarchate,</hi> was no way subject. Whereas therefore the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> can be said to have opposed it self to no lawful <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51928:34"/>
Authority at all, which notwithstanding inseparably is of the essence of Schism, certain it is, that Church is no way Schismatical, but, on the contrary side, the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> according to the singular moderation and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love she perpetually sheweth toward all Christians, as she keeps off from her external Communion no Christian of what ever communion he be (so that he hold the foundation intire) but (unless a most just excommunication put a bar) opens her Catholick bosome, and draws forth her holy breasts to any genuine Nursling of the Catholick Church; so as well in Faith, as the internal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Charity, as likewise in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of the Catholick <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and <hi>Liturgy,</hi> yea and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies also, she yet cherisheth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth an undivided peace and consent with the Catholick Church, from which the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> never did, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will separate her self, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies most tenacious of the whole truly Catholick foundation. For one thing it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51928:34"/>
is (on the hinge of which just distinction is the whole state of this great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie turned) one thing, I say, it is, to separate her self from the Catholick or Universal Church, and to form to her self a Congregation or Religion apart different from the Catholick Church, as in times past the <hi>Donatists</hi> did; another, not to communicate in all with some one particular Church (as for instance, the <hi>Latine</hi>) or rather to abstain from the external worship which is used by some persons, in some places, under an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Protestation</hi> (for thence is sprung the modest and innocent title of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>) under <hi>Protestation,</hi> I say, so soon as the occasion of scandal should be taken away, of reconciliation, and under a vow (not so much out of any absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, as for publick peace, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick unity's sake) of returning to the Communion of that particular Church, from which that the Protestants were estranged, yea in the latter age violently driven away by thunder, and sword, and fire, is better known out of history, than
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51928:35"/>
to want any proof, or further amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in this, as I may say, her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive state of separation from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> is wholly free from all blemish of Schism, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the <note n="m" place="bottom">For full ten years after the <hi>Reformation,</hi> under <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> without scruple, communicated with the <hi>Protestants,</hi> until <hi>Pius</hi> the sixth by his interdictory <hi>Bull</hi> disturbed all.</note> 
                  <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> himself first of all interrupted Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> and yet further inderdicteth the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> his communion, and in that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the <hi>Pope</hi> extolleth himself above a General Council lawfully called (unto which the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> hath ever attributed the decisive judgement) while in his <note n="n" place="bottom">How well this new Interdiction agreeth with the ancient Oath of the Pope, the Reader may judge, when (as <hi>Cardinal Deus-dedit</hi> very well notes in his Collection of the Canons) the ancient form of the Popes Oath, which is yet extant, <hi>Canon.
