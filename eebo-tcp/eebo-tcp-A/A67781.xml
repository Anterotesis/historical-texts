         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>LUcian</hi> tells of an <hi>Egyptian King,</hi> who had <hi>Apes</hi> taught (when they were young) to <hi>dance,</hi> and keep their poſtures with much <hi>art:</hi> theſe he would put into <hi>rich Coats,</hi> and have them in ſome <hi>great preſence</hi> to exerciſe their <hi>skill;</hi> which was to the admiration of ſuch as knew them not, what <hi>little</hi> ſort of <hi>active, nimble</hi> men the <hi>King</hi> had got: And ſuch as knew them, thought it no

leſs ſtrange; that they ſhould be trained up to ſo <hi>man-like,</hi> and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a <hi>deportment.</hi> But a <hi>ſubtile Fellow</hi> that was once admitted to ſee them, brought and threw amongſt them, a handful of <hi>Nuts:</hi> which they no ſooner ſpied; but they preſently <hi>left off</hi> their dance, <hi>fell a ſcrambling, tore</hi> one anothers <hi>rich Coats;</hi> and to the diriſion of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders (who before admired them) they diſcovered themſelves to be <hi>meer Apes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe enſuing <hi>Notions</hi> (which I have purpoſely taken, as a <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> out of the whole <hi>ſack,</hi> to ſquander away amongſt my <hi>acquaintance)</hi> are ſuch <hi>Nuts,</hi> as will diſcover not a few (who are <hi>men</hi> in <hi>appearance,</hi> and their own <hi>opinion)</hi> to be as wiſe, and well affected as <hi>Aeſops Cock;</hi> that preferred a <hi>barley Corn,</hi> before a <hi>Pearl:</hi> or <hi>Plinies Moal,</hi> that would <hi>dig under ground</hi> with great <hi>dexterity:</hi> but was <hi>blind,</hi> it brought <hi>into the Sun.</hi> Or <hi>Diaphontus,</hi> that refuſed his mothers bleſſing, to hear a ſong: Or the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who preferred <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> before <hi>Quails</hi> and <hi>manna.</hi>

                  <hi>Men</hi> no more differ from <hi>Beaſts, Plants, Stones;</hi> in ſpeech, reaſon, ſhape, than ſome differ from others, in <hi>heart,</hi> in <hi>brain,</hi> in <hi>life.</hi> Whence the very <hi>heathen Poets</hi> uſually &amp; moſt fitly compare ſome men to <hi>ſtones,</hi> for their hardneſs, and inſenſibleneſs; others to <hi>plants,</hi> that only fill their veins; a third ſort to <hi>beaſts,</hi> that pleaſe their ſenſes too; a fourth to <hi>evil Angels,</hi> that only ſin, and cauſe others to ſin; a fift to <hi>good Angels,</hi> that are ſtill in motion, alwayes ſerving <hi>God</hi> and doing <hi>good,</hi> yet ever reſt.</p>
               <p>Again, Experience teaches, that mens <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>cenſures</hi> are as various, as their <hi>pallats:</hi> For what one <hi>admires,</hi> another <hi>ſlights;</hi> as is evident by <hi>our Saviours Auditors;</hi> of which ſome <hi>admired,</hi> others <hi>cenſured,</hi> a third ſort <hi>wept,</hi> a fourth <hi>ſcoft,</hi> a fift <hi>trembled,</hi> a fixt <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi> when they heard him. And how ſhould it be otherwiſe, when the greater part, are as deeply in <hi>love</hi> with <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>error;</hi> as the reſt are with <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> When mens <hi>conditions,</hi> and <hi>conſtitutions</hi> vary as much; as their <hi>faces.</hi> As the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> intimates, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſeveral men, to almoſt every ſeveral creature in the <hi>Univerſe.</hi> Nor is the Epicure more like a <hi>ſwine,</hi> the Luſtful perſon a <hi>Goat,</hi> the Fraudulent man a <hi>Fox,</hi> the Backbiter a <hi>barking Dog,</hi> the Slanderer an <hi>Asp,</hi> the Oppreſſor a <hi>VVolf,</hi> the Perſecutor a <hi>Tyger,</hi> the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robber a <hi>wild Bore,</hi> the Seducer a <hi>Serpent,</hi> yea a <hi>Devil,</hi> the Traytor a <hi>Viper,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 12, 13, 16, 20, 21. &amp; 74. 13, 14, 19. &amp; 80. 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15, 17, &amp;c. then every of them is unlike another.</p>
               <p>Amidſt ſuch a world of variety, I have choſen to ſet forth, how one man differs from, and excels another in <hi>brain,</hi> and to prove, that to be <hi>wiſe indeed,</hi> is the <hi>portion</hi> but <hi>of a few,</hi> even amongſt us. And this diſcovery alone (as I deem) will be richly worth my pains, and each mans ſerious Obſervation.</p>

                        <hi>Senſual.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For if you obſerve it, ſome men like the <hi>Moon at Full,</hi> have all their light towards <hi>earth,</hi> none towards Heaven: Others like the <hi>Moon at VVaine,</hi> or Change, have all their light to <hi>Heaven</hi> wards, none to the earth: a third ſort like to the <hi>Moon in eclipſe,</hi> as having no light in it ſelf, neither towards <hi>earth,</hi> nor towards <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching theſe <hi>three degrees of compariſon,</hi> you ſhall find, that the one exceeds the other (in wiſdom) as the <hi>ſtars exceed one another in glory.</hi> Of which particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is no leſs difference, between the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>ſenſual,</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>ſimple,</hi> the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned,</hi> than there is between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beaſts;</hi> as <hi>Menander</hi> ſpeaks. Or between the <hi>living</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> as another hath it. And yet the <hi>Rational,</hi> do not ſo far excel the <hi>ſenſual,</hi> as the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> excel the <hi>rational.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Senſual men</hi> are ſo be-nighted, and puzled with blindneſ, that they know no other way than the <hi>fleſh leads</hi> them. It is the <hi>weight</hi> that ſets all their <hi>wheels</hi> a going; the <hi>horſes</hi> that draw their <hi>chariot,</hi> the very <hi>life</hi> of their <hi>corruption,</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> of their <hi>life,</hi> without which they do nothing.</p>
               <p>The minds of brutiſh men, that have been ill bred, are ſo drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſin, and ſenſuallity; and their ſpirits ſo frozen, and pitifully benumed with worldlineſs, and wicked cuſtoms, that they cannot judg aright, either of ſpiritual matters, or rectified reaſon. Yea, in matters experimental, they are of as deep a judgement as was <hi>Callico,</hi> who ſtuft his pillow (a braſs pot) with ſtraw, to make it ſoft.

And which leaves them without all hope of being wiſer, they had rather keep <hi>conſcience blind,</hi> that it may <hi>flatter them,</hi> than <hi>inform</hi> it, that it may give a <hi>juſt verdict againſt them,</hi> counting it leſs trouble, to believe <hi>a favorable falſhood,</hi> than to examine whether it be <hi>true.</hi> So that it is impoſſible for fleſhly minded men, to believe what ſots they are, touching the good of their ſouls.

               <p>SEcondly, There is another degree of Knowledge, that is accrued or obtained, by <hi>education</hi> and <hi>learning, obſervation</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> called <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſpeculative knowledge,</hi> or <hi>reaſon improved.</hi> For <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning,</hi> is as <hi>oyl to the lamp</hi> of our <hi>reaſon,</hi> and makes it burn cleerer: but <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>illumination</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> more than doubles the ſight of our minds; as a <hi>proſpective glaſs</hi> does the <hi>corporal ſight, Matth.</hi> 16. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. to 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 46. For as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is the <hi>lamp</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>religion</hi> of reaſon, and <hi>faith</hi> of religion: ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. &amp; 8. 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>ſun of the ſoul; reaſon</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>two eyes:</hi> reaſon diſcerns <hi>natural objects,</hi> faith <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> We may ſee far with our <hi>bodily eye ſence,</hi> farther with the <hi>minds eye reaſon;</hi> but farther with the <hi>ſouls eye faith</hi> than with both.

               <p>Now of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſpeculative knowledge,</hi> the wicked have as large a ſhare as the godly: but of <hi>spiritual, experimental,</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> and <hi>deſcendeth from above,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. <hi>and keepeth a man from every evil way,</hi> Prov. 2. 12. the <hi>wicked</hi> have no part with the <hi>godly.</hi> Whence all men in their natural condition are ſaid to be <hi>blind and in darkneſs,</hi> Matth. 4. 16. &amp; 15. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18, 19. &amp; 5. 8. Whereas <hi>believers,</hi> are called <hi>children of light, and of the day,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Nor is this kind of knowledge, any way attainable, but by Grace from above. No learning, experience, or pains in ſtuddy and <hi>Books,</hi> will bring them to it, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 17, 18. &amp; 3. 19. except they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>new creatures,</hi> have <hi>hearts, eyes,</hi> and <hi>eares</hi> ſanctified from above; and that the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> becomes their teacher, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi>

               <p>Nor is it ſaving knowledge that they ſeek after: For though many of them, be great ſeekers after knowledge, great pains-takers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe: yet it is not divine and ſupernatural knowledge, that they labor for, or deſire.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the largeſt ſenſe, hath ever carried that ſhew of excellency with it, that not only the <hi>good</hi> have highly <hi>affected it,</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> who <hi>ſtudied</hi> for wiſdom; and <hi>Solomon</hi> who <hi>prayed</hi> for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> who <hi>travelled</hi> for wiſdom; and <hi>David</hi> who to get wiſdom, <hi>made the word his counſellor, hated every falſe way, and was a man after Gods own heart)</hi> but the very <hi>wicked</hi> have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored for it, who are aſhamed of other vertues; as, O the pleaſure that rational men take in it! <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 10, 11. &amp; 10. 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledge</hi> is ſo <hi>fair a virgin,</hi> that every <hi>cleer eye</hi> is in <hi>love</hi> with her; it is a <hi>pearl</hi> deſpiſed of none but <hi>ſwine,</hi> Prov. 2. 3. 10. 11.

Kill the Child in the womb,</hi> and <hi>never hurt the Mother?</hi> How the <hi>waters</hi> ſhould <hi>ſtand</hi> upon a heap, and yet <hi>not over-flow the earth?</hi> Why the <hi>clouds</hi> above being <hi>heavie</hi> with <hi>water,</hi> ſhould not <hi>fall</hi> to the <hi>earth</hi> ſuddenly, ſeeing <hi>every heavy thing deſcendeth?</hi> Except the reaſon which <hi>God</hi> giveth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 6. &amp; Job 38 8. to 12. &amp; 26. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 9. But we know the myſtery of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and what it is to be <hi>born a new,</hi> and can give a ſollid <hi>reaſon of our faith:</hi> we know that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>reconciled</hi> to us, the <hi>Law ſatisfied</hi> for us, our <hi>ſins pardoned,</hi> our <hi>ſouls acquitted,</hi> and that we are in <hi>favour</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> which many of theſe with their <hi>great learning</hi> do <hi>not know.</hi> And thus the <hi>godly</hi> are proved <hi>wiſer</hi> than the <hi>wiſeſt humaniſt</hi> that wants grace. You have likewiſe <hi>the reaſons</hi> why theſe <hi>great knowers, know nothing</hi> yet as they <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to know: that is to ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are <hi>miſtaken</hi> in the thing; they take <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107266:8"/>
                  <hi>knowledg</hi> for <hi>ſoul wiſdom; &amp; soul ſaving wiſdom</hi> to be <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>madneſs.</hi> Now if a man take his <hi>aim</hi> amiſs, he may <hi>ſhoot</hi> long enough ere he <hi>hit</hi> the <hi>white:</hi> and theſe men are as one that is <hi>gone</hi> a good <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>journey,</hi> but muſt <hi>come back again</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>miſtaken</hi> his <hi>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> and want the <hi>Eye of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For that they <hi>ſeek</hi> not to <hi>God</hi> for it who is the <hi>giver</hi> thereof, and without whoſe <hi>ſpirit</hi> there is no attaining it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe they are <hi>proud,</hi> and ſo ſeek not after it, as <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> they <hi>have it</hi> already.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Becauſe if they <hi>had</hi> never ſo <hi>much</hi> knowledge, they would be <hi>never the holier,</hi> or the <hi>better</hi> for it, but rather the <hi>worſe;</hi> nor would they <hi>imploy</hi> it to the <hi>honour of</hi> God, or the <hi>good of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, Becauſe they either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>would do miſchief</hi> inſteed of <hi>good</hi> with their knowledge.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Becauſe they will not <hi>conſult</hi> with the <hi>word</hi> about it, nor <hi>adviſe</hi> with <hi>others</hi> that have already attained to it. Or thus, They <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> the Scriptures and mind not, (I mean the <hi>spirituallity of the word)</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> and underſtand not, or <hi>underſtand</hi> and remember not, or <hi>remember</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> not. No, this they intend not of all the reſt; and they that are <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>obey, God</hi> thinks <hi>unvvorthy</hi> to <hi>know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Serpent</hi> taught knowledge, he ſaid, <hi>If ye eate the forbidden fruit, your eyes ſhal be opened, and you ſhal know good and evil:</hi> But <hi>God</hi> teacheth another leſſon, and ſaith, If ye will <hi>not eate the forbidden fruit,</hi> your eyes ſhall be opened, and you ſhall know good and evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. See <hi>Pſa.</hi> 111. 10. &amp; 119. 97, 98, 99, 100. Or if you do eat it, you ſhall be like <hi>images that have ears and cannot hear,</hi> Rom. 11. 8. Iſa. 6. 10. Matth. 13. 14. Pſal. 115. 6.</p>
               <p>From all which Reaſons we may collect, That there are but a <hi>few</hi> amongſt us, that are <hi>wiſe indeed,</hi> and to purpoſe; For theſe <hi>Seven Hinderances</hi> are applyable to ſeventy ſeven parts of men in the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Beſides, if theſe <hi>great knowers know</hi> ſo <hi>little,</hi> how <hi>ignorant</hi> are the <hi>rude rabble,</hi> that deſpiſe all knowledge? Nor can it be denied but all impenitent perſons, all <hi>unbelievers</hi> (who prefer their <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> before <hi>pleaſing</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> as <hi>Herodias</hi> prefered <hi>John Baptiſts head</hi> before the one <hi>half of Herods kingdom,)</hi> are <hi>arrant fools;</hi> yea, fools in folio: For if they were wiſe, ſayes <hi>Bernard,</hi> they would foreſee the <hi>torments of Hell,</hi> and prevent them.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> are the <hi>godly,</hi> for they prefer <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>Gods favour,</hi> before <hi>ten thouſand worlds.</hi>

world to miſtruſt my ſelf; wherefore <hi>good Sir,</hi> tell me how I ſhall be able <hi>to get ihis ſpiritual</hi> and experimental knowledg? this divine and ſupernatural <hi>wiſdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By obſerving theſe <hi>Five Rules:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Let ſuch a willing and ingenuous ſoul, reſolve to <hi>practiſe</hi> what he <hi>does</hi> already <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> hereafter be acquainted with from the <hi>word of God</hi> and <hi>Chriſts faithful Meſſengers:</hi> For <hi>he that will do my Fathers will,</hi> ſayes <hi>our Saviour, ſhall know the doctrine, whether it be of God orno,</hi> Joh. 7. 17. <hi>A good underſtanding have all they that keep the commandments,</hi> (ſayes <hi>holy</hi> David) Pſal. 111. 10. and proves it true by his own <hi>example</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> I <hi>underſtood</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>more than the Antient, and became wiſer than my teachers, becauſe</hi> I <hi>kept thy precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119. 97, 98, 99, 100. <hi>To a man that is good in his ſight, God giveth knowledg and wiſdom,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 26. <hi>The ſpiritual man underſtandeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 15. <hi>VVicked men underſtand not iudgment, but they that ſeek the Lord, underſtand all things,</hi> Prov. 28. 5. <hi>Admirable incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> for men to become <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>consciencious;</hi> I mean <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If thou wouldeſt get this precious grace of ſaving knowledge; the way is, to be <hi>frequent in hearing the word</hi> preached, and to become <hi>ſtudious in the Scriptures,</hi> for <hi>they</hi> and they alone <hi>make wise to Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>Ye err</hi> (ſaith <hi>our Saviour) not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 22. 29. Mark 12. 24. We muſt not in the ſearch of heavenly matters, either <hi>do as</hi> we ſee <hi>others do;</hi> neither muſt we follow the <hi>blind guide carnal reason,</hi> or the <hi>deceitful guide</hi> our corrupt <hi>hearts;</hi> but the <hi>undeceivable,</hi> and infallable <hi>guide</hi> of <hi>Gods word</hi> which is truth it ſelf: and great need there is; for as we cannot perceive the <hi>foulneſs of our faces</hi> unleſs it be told us, or we take a <hi>glaſs</hi> and look our ſelves therein: ſo neither can we ſee the <hi>blemiſhes</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> which is a notable degree of ſpiritual Wiſdom, but either <hi>God</hi> muſt make it known to us by his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or we muſt collect the ſame out of the Scriptures, that <hi>coeleſtial glaſs;</hi> though this alſo muſt be done by the <hi>ſpirits help.</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou wilt be <hi>Soul-wiſe</hi> and truly profit by ſtudying the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> be <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> who is the only <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of it, for the direction of his <hi>holy ſpirit:</hi> For firſt, humble and faithful <hi>Prayer,</hi> uſhered in by <hi>meditation,</hi> is the <hi>cure of al obscurity.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially being accompanied with <hi>fervor</hi> and <hi>fervency;</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>If any lack wisdom,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James, let him ask of God who giveth to al men liberally and reproacheth no man, and it ſhal be given him,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. Mark the words, it is ſaid <hi>if any;</hi> wherefore let no man deny his ſoul this comfort. Again, <hi>ask and have;</hi> It cannot come upon eaſier terms. Yea, <hi>God</hi> ſeems to like this ſute ſo well in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as if he were beholding to his Creature, for wiſhing well to it ſelf. And in vain do we expect that <hi>alms of grace,</hi> for which we do not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107266:9"/>
ſo much as <hi>beg.</hi> But in praying for Wiſdom, do not <hi>pray</hi> for it <hi>without putting difference;</hi> deſire not ſo much <hi>brain-knowledg</hi> as to be <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,</hi> and then you will <hi>imploy</hi> your <hi>wisdom</hi> to the <hi>glory of the giver.</hi> Let thine hearts deſire be <hi>to know God in Chriſt, Chriſt in Faith, Faith in good works;</hi> to <hi>know Gods vvill</hi> that thou mayeſt <hi>do it;</hi> and before the knowledg of all other things, deſire to <hi>knovv thy self;</hi> &amp; in thy ſelf, not ſo much thy <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as thy <hi>vveakneſs:</hi> Pray that thine heart may ſerve thee inſteed of <hi>a commentary,</hi> to help thee underſtand ſuch <hi>points</hi> of Religion as are <hi>moſt needful</hi> and neceſſary, and that <hi>thy Life</hi> may be <hi>an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ſition</hi> of thy <hi>invvard man,</hi> that there may be a ſweet <hi>harmony</hi> betwixt <hi>Gods VVord, thy judgment,</hi> and <hi>vvhole conversation,</hi> that what the <hi>natural man</hi> knoweth by <hi>roat,</hi> thou mayſt <hi>double by feeling</hi> the ſame in thine <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> As indeed <hi>experimental</hi> and <hi>saving knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> is no leſs <hi>felt</hi> than <hi>knovvn;</hi> and, I cannot tell how, comes rather <hi>out of the abundance of the heart,</hi> than by extreme <hi>ſtudy;</hi> or rather is <hi>sent by God unto good men,</hi> like the <hi>Ram</hi> that was brought to <hi>Abraham</hi> when he would have <hi>Sacrificed</hi> his ſon <hi>Isaak.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt taught in the Temple, they asked, Hovv knovveth this man the Scriptures, seeing he never learned them?</hi> So it is a wonder what <hi>learning</hi> ſome men have, that have <hi>no learning!</hi> Like <hi>Priſilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> poor <hi>Tent-makers,</hi> who were able to <hi>school Apollos</hi> that great Clerk, a man <hi>renovvned for</hi> his <hi>learning:</hi> What can we ſay to it? For no other reaſon can be given but as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Father so it pleaseth thee:</hi> For as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of his <hi>venison,</hi> when his <hi>Father</hi> ask'd how he came by it ſo <hi>suddenly? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord thy God brought it suddenly to my hands.</hi> So holy and righteous men do more eaſily underſtand the words of <hi>God,</hi> than do the wicked, becauſe <hi>God</hi> brings the meaning ſuddenly to their hearts; as we read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. That <hi>Chriſt (ſtanding in the midſt of his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vvas risen from the dead) opened their underſtandings, that they might underſtand clearly the Scriptures, and vvhat vvas vvritten of him in the Lavv of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and in the</hi> Prophets, <hi>and in the</hi> Pſalms, verſ. 44. 45. Lo how ſuddenly their knowledge came unto them! But ſee what <hi>a general promise (God</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>wisdom)</hi> hatth made <hi>to all that serve him,</hi> Prov. 1. <hi>Turn you at my reproof, and behold I will pour out my spirit unto you, and make known my words unto you,</hi> verſ. 23. And Pſal. 25. <hi>The secrets of the Lord are revealed to them that fear him, and his covenant is to give them underſtanding,</hi> verſ 14. Theſe <hi>secrets</hi> are <hi>hid</hi> from the wicked, neither hath he made any ſuch covenant with them but the contrary: As ſee, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Unto you it is given to knovv the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to others in Parrables, that they ſeeing ſhould not see, and hearing they ſhould not underſtand,</hi> Luke 8. 10: Mark: 3: 11: Matth: 13: 13:</p>
               <p>Again, It is not enough to <hi>pray,</hi> except alſo it be <hi>in Chriſts name,</hi> and <hi>accrding to his vvill, believing to be heard for his sake,</hi> and that it be the <hi>interceſſion of Gods ovvn spirit</hi> in you: And (being truly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107266:9"/>
ſenſible of your <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>wants)</hi> that you chiefly pray for the <hi>pardon of ſinne,</hi> the <hi>effuſion of grace,</hi> and for the <hi>aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit:</hi> that you may more <hi>firmly believe,</hi> more <hi>ſoundly repent,</hi> more <hi>zealouſly doe,</hi> more <hi>patiently ſuffer,</hi> and more <hi>conſtantly perſevere</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of every duty.</p>
               <p>But above all you muſt know, that as <hi>Sampſons companions,</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found out his <hi>Riddle,</hi> if they had not <hi>plowed with his heifer:</hi> ſo <hi>no man can know the ſecrets of God, but by the revelation of his Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17. Yea, ſuppoſe a man be not inferiour to <hi>Portius,</hi> or <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who <hi>kept all</hi> things in memory, that ever they had <hi>read, heard,</hi> or <hi>ſeen:</hi> To <hi>Virgil,</hi> of whom it is reported, that if <hi>all Sciences</hi> were <hi>loſt,</hi> they might be <hi>found</hi> again in him: To <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, that <hi>if Knowledge had put out her candle,</hi> at <hi>his brain</hi> ſhe might <hi>light it</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and that his <hi>head</hi> was <hi>a throne of wiſdome:</hi> or <hi>Joſephus Scaliger,</hi> who was <hi>skilled in thirty Languages:</hi> Yet if he want the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to be his teacher, he is a dunce to the meaneſt, and moſt illiterate <hi>believer.</hi> For one excellent, and neceſſary <hi>prerogative of the ſpirituall man</hi> is this; he hath <hi>God for his teacher;</hi> he <hi>learns</hi> the <hi>Counſels of God,</hi> of that <hi>ſpirit</hi> which onely knoweth <hi>Gods counſels, Luk.</hi> 21. 15. which is no ſmall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: for the <hi>ſcholar learns quickly,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is his <hi>teacher;</hi> the <hi>Eye ſees distinctly,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth <hi>enlighten it.</hi> With the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits helpe,</hi> the <hi>meanes</hi> can never be <hi>too weake:</hi> without, never <hi>ſtrong</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 44, 45. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 23.</p>

               <head>§ 51.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, Thou muſt get <hi>an humble conceit of thine own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The <hi>firſt ſtep to knowledge,</hi> is to know our <hi>own ignorance.</hi> We muſt <hi>become fools</hi> in our own opinion, before we can be <hi>truly wiſe,</hi> as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſets it down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. And indeed, the <hi>opinion of our knowing enough,</hi> is one of the greateſt <hi>cauſes of our knowing ſo little:</hi> For what we preſume to have <hi>attained,</hi> we <hi>ſeeke not</hi> after. Yea, the very <hi>firſt leſſon</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is <hi>humility. He will teach the humble his way,</hi> Pſalm. 25. 9. Jam. 4. 6. 1 Pet. 5. 5. And he that hath not learned the <hi>firſt leſſon,</hi> is not fit to <hi>take out a new. Pride</hi> is a <hi>great let to</hi> true <hi>wiſdome:</hi> For <hi>God reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. 1 Pet. 5. 5. Whence it comes to paſſe, that few proud wits are reformed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 39. And for this cauſe alſo did <hi>our Saviour</hi> propound his <hi>woes</hi> to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> his <hi>doctrines</hi> to the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>heart</hi> full of <hi>pride,</hi> is like a <hi>veſſell</hi> full of <hi>aire:</hi> This <hi>ſelf opinion</hi> muſt be <hi>blown out</hi> of us, before <hi>ſaving knowledge</hi> will be <hi>poured into us. Chriſt</hi> will <hi>know</hi> none but the <hi>humble,</hi> and none but humble <hi>ſouls</hi> truly <hi>know Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the way to become humble, is, by taking a ſerious <hi>view</hi> of <hi>our wants.</hi> The <hi>Peacocks pride</hi> is much abated, when ſhe looks on the <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of her <hi>legs</hi> and <hi>feet.</hi> Now ſuppoſe we know never ſo much; yet <hi>that</hi> which <hi>we know,</hi> is <hi>far leſſe</hi> then that which <hi>we are ignorant of:</hi> and the

               <p>Fifthly, Thou muſt labour to get a true and lively <hi>faith:</hi> For as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>faith</hi> we cannot <hi>pleaſe God:</hi> ſo without <hi>faith,</hi> no man can <hi>know God.</hi> Faith moſt cleerly beholds thoſe things which are hid both from the <hi>eye of ſenſe,</hi> and the <hi>eye of reaſon, John</hi> 12. 46. <hi>Unregenerate men,</hi> that waht faith, are like <hi>blinde Sampſon</hi> without his <hi>guide:</hi> Or like <hi>Poliphemus,</hi> who never had but <hi>one eye,</hi> and that <hi>Ulyſſes put out.</hi> For ſo does the pleaſure and cuſtome of ſinne blinde the Senſualliſt.</p>
               <p>We muſt have <hi>mindes</hi> lifted <hi>above nature,</hi> to ſee and love <hi>things above nature: heavenly wiſdome,</hi> to ſee <hi>heavenly truth;</hi> or elſe that <hi>truth</hi> which is ſaving, will be to us <hi>a myſtery,</hi> Mark. 4. 11. If it ſeem not <hi>fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 14. <hi>To them that are loſt, the Goſpel is hid,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Believer diſcerns all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. 12. 15, 16.

Theſe are the <hi>five ſteps,</hi> which lead up to the <hi>palace of wiſdome,</hi> which all muſt aſcend by, that mean to enter. If you have once attained this precious grace of <hi>ſaving knowledge,</hi> you will as much as in you lies, <hi>employ the ſame to the glory of the giver,</hi> And ſo much to prove, that he is <hi>the wiſeſt</hi> man, whoſe knowledge lies in <hi>the beſt</hi> things, (as the <hi>weaker veſſel</hi> may hold the <hi>better liquor)</hi> and that if men be never ſo learned, except they have learned the <hi>Myſtery of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>what it</hi> is to be <hi>borne again</hi> by their own experience, (which few with their great learning do indeed know) they are in <hi>Gods account,</hi> no better then <hi>fooles.</hi> I come now to prove, that the <hi>greateſt Politician</hi> is a <hi>verier fool</hi> then the <hi>former.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, If we ſhall look upon the moſt <hi>cunning Politician,</hi> with a ſingle eye: <hi>judge righteous judgement, and not according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance onely,</hi> we ſhall finde that the <hi>greateſt Polilician</hi> is the <hi>greateſt fool.</hi> For he turns all his <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> into <hi>Statiſme,</hi> yea, into <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> making <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> a very foot-ſtool to <hi>policy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe they <hi>are wiſer in their generation, then the children of light;</hi> and are ſo acknowledged by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 8. But why? not that there is a deficiency of <hi>power</hi> in the godly, but will: for could not <hi>David</hi> go as far as <hi>Achitophel?</hi> could not <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew as much cunning as <hi>Tertullus?</hi> Yes, ſurely if they would: But becauſe their <hi>Maſter, Chriſt,</hi> hath commanded them to be <hi>innocent as doves;</hi> They have reſolved in an heroical diſpoſition with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14. 22. <hi>that the King of Sodome ſhall not make them rich.</hi> No crooked, or indirect meanes, ſhall bring them in profit; they will not be <hi>beholding to the king of Hell for a ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And hereupon the <hi>Foxes wiles,</hi> never enter into the <hi>Lions head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſpeak of them as they are: Theſe <hi>cunning Politicians,</hi> in ſtead of being <hi>wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> they are <hi>wiſe ſerpents.</hi> They are ſo arted in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107266:10"/>
through time and practice, that they are neer upon <hi>as wiſe,</hi> as that <hi>old ſerpent the Devill.</hi> Indeed he hath <hi>one trick beyond all theirs;</hi> for like a <hi>cunning fencer,</hi> he that <hi>taught them all their tricks, kept this</hi> one to himſelfe, namely, how <hi>to cheate them of their ſoules.</hi> But take a ſhort <hi>Character</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>They are ſuch <hi>cunning diſſemblers,</hi> that like <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the ſixth, what they <hi>thinke,</hi> they never <hi>ſpeak. Why is this cast away,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iudas? Crafty cub,</hi> he would have had it himſelf. They are like a <hi>fellow that rides to the pillory,</hi> they <hi>goe</hi> not the <hi>way</hi> they <hi>look.</hi> They will <hi>cut a mans throat under colour of courteſie,</hi> as <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> by <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>forged letters,</hi> was the meanes of <hi>ſtoning Palamides,</hi> even while he <hi>made ſhew of defending him.</hi> And then to wipe off all ſuſpition from themſelves, their <hi>geſture</hi> and <hi>conntenance</hi> ſhall be like <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s; who ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi>'s head fell a weeping, as if he had been ſorry for it, when by his onely meanes it was cut off. So like <hi>Rowers in a boat,</hi> whileſt in their <hi>pretence</hi> they <hi>look one way,</hi> in their <hi>intent</hi> they <hi>goe the</hi> quire <hi>contrary:</hi> As our <hi>Saviour</hi> found it to fare with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Sadducees, Matth.</hi> 16. 1, 3. which made him to conclude, with, <hi>O hypocrites!</hi> Nor ſhall any man be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, either by their <hi>geſture, words,</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> what they reſolve, though like <hi>Hebrew letters,</hi> you <hi>ſpell them backward.</hi> Onely this you may be ſure of, that they do not <hi>intend,</hi> what they <hi>pretend;</hi> Like as in <hi>jugling feats,</hi> though we know not how they <hi>are done,</hi> yet we know well, that they are <hi>not done</hi> as they <hi>ſeem</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>Now if they can any way advantage themſelves by anothers ruine, and do it cunningly; as <hi>Iezabel</hi> did, when ſhe <hi>killed Naboth, by ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning falſe witneſſe against him, and proclaimed a Faſt before the murther:</hi> Though all ſuch <hi>policy</hi> be but <hi>miſery,</hi> and all ſuch <hi>knowledge, ignorance,</hi> Yet, ô how wiſe they think themſelves! but they are groſly miſtaken: for wherein does this their great wiſdom conſiſt? but firſt; in being <hi>wiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others:</hi> as the <hi>Old ſerpent did our firſt Parents;</hi> or ſecondly in the end <hi>to deceive themſelves,</hi> as the ſame <hi>ſerpent</hi> did, which brought a <hi>curſe upon himſelfe</hi> for ſo doing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The crafty <hi>Fox</hi> hugg'd himſelfe to think how he had cozened the <hi>Crow</hi> of her <hi>break-faſt:</hi> but when he had <hi>eaten it,</hi> and found himſelf <hi>poyſoned with it,</hi> he wiſht the <hi>Crow</hi> her own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Wealth got by deceit, is like a piece of <hi>butterd ſpunge, an Italian trick,</hi> it <hi>goes down</hi> glib; but in the <hi>ſtomack ſwells,</hi> and will never be <hi>got out again.</hi> The gains a man gets by deceiving, at laſt he may put in his eye, and yet ſee himſelfe miſerable. <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>greateſt cheater</hi> in the world, for it <hi>deceives the deceiver.</hi>

               <p>That it is ſo with them, and all others who goe to Counſell, and leave the <hi>God of wiſdome</hi> behind them: let their caſe be viewed in other perſons.

                  <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as though they would moſt wiſely prevent their own ſalvation. <hi>Joſephs brethren,</hi> to prevent his having dominion over them, (as his <hi>dreames</hi> imported) thought they had taken a very wiſe courſe, in <hi>ſelling him to the Iſhmaelitiſh Merchants,</hi> which was indeed the onely meanes to effect it. <hi>They murther Chriſt, leſt the Romans ſhould come:</hi> and by ſo doing, their coming was haſtned.

               </p>
               <p>See here in theſe few Examples, you have the <hi>depth</hi> and ſolidity <hi>of our greateſt</hi> and wiſeſt <hi>Politicians,</hi> and yet lewd men, moſt ridiculouſly and abſurdly, call <hi>wicked policies, wiſdome,</hi> and their <hi>ſucceſſe, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> But herein <hi>Satan</hi> makes them <hi>of all fools the ſuperlative,</hi> in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking <hi>villany</hi> and <hi>madneſſe</hi> for the <hi>beſt vertues.</hi> And what is the <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma totalis</hi> of all but this? <hi>Faux-</hi>like, they <hi>project other mens over-throw, purchaſe their owne.</hi> Neither hath any man been <hi>wiſe to do evill,</hi> but his wiſdome hath had <hi>an evill end.</hi> As ô the multitude of <hi>Examples</hi> that are <hi>recorded,</hi> to give credit to this Doctrine! Was not the <hi>wiſdome of the Serpent</hi> turned into a curſe? the <hi>wiſdome of the Phariſees</hi> into a woe? the <hi>wiſdome of Achitophel</hi> into folly? the <hi>wiſdome of Nimrod</hi> into confuſion? the <hi>wiſdome of the unjuſt Steward</hi> into expulſion out of <hi>Heaven?</hi> the <hi>wiſdome of Jezabel,</hi> into a ſhameful death? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in the iſſue, their caſe proves but like the <hi>ſpiders,</hi> that was <hi>weaving a curious net to catch thè ſwallow:</hi> who when ſhe came, bore away both <hi>net,</hi> and <hi>webb,</hi> and <hi>weaver</hi> too.

               <p>Again, admit them the moſt, they are not <hi>wiſe in good,</hi> though they be <hi>wiſe to do evill:</hi> Or if you will, <hi>wiſe in goods,</hi> not <hi>wiſe in grace:</hi> For as that <hi>old Serpent</hi> ſeemed to boaſt, that he was richer then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>All theſe are mine, Matth.</hi> 4. 9.

               <p>A godly man being demanded, what he thought was the <hi>ſtrangeſt, and fooliſheſt thing in the world,</hi> anſwered, <hi>an impenitent ſinner,</hi> or <hi>an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:</hi> For, ſaid he, that a man ſhould provoke <hi>God,</hi> ſo gracious and mighty, that he ſhould believe <hi>Satan</hi> the father of lies and cruelty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own death ſo imminent and in-evitable; obey the command of his Fleſh, a Drudge ſo ignoble, admire the world ſo fickle and dangerous, prefer it before <hi>Heaven</hi> ſo bleſſed &amp; glorious; wilfully caſt himſelf into <hi>hell,</hi> a place ſo woful and dolorous, and all for vanity, ſuch a wretched emptineſſe; that he ſhould <hi>feare the blaſts of mens breath,</hi> and not the <hi>fire of Gods wrath;</hi> weep for the loſſe of <hi>friends,</hi> &amp; not for his <hi>ſoul:</hi> And laſtly, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould <hi>ſtand at the door of his heart,</hi> craving for entrance, that he may remedy all, and make him everlaſtingly happy; and <hi>God</hi> call him every day, either by his <hi>Word</hi> in the mouthes of his <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> or by ſtrange <hi>judgements,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>mercies</hi> upon <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> and all in vain Such an one, ſayes he, is the <hi>moſt fooliſh and degenerate</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alive:</p>
               <p>Thus I might go on to <hi>Traytors, Murtherers, Back-byters, Seducers, Drunkards, Blaſphemers, Perſecutors</hi> of the godly, <hi>proud</hi> perſons, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Thieves, Atheiſts,</hi> and what other ſinners you can name: and prove them <hi>all fools alike.</hi> But I have already (upon one occaſion or other) done it in ſome other Tract. Nor do I love to <hi>tautologize,</hi> except it be for a great advantage to my Reader, and for others good: though in ſuch a caſe, I can, I thank <hi>God, diſhonour my ſelfe,</hi> that I may <hi>honour my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi> The which if men did well ponder, they would be more ſparing of their cenſures; How-ever I could wiſh, that our <hi>Reverend Divines</hi> would afford themſelves more liberty in this caſe then they do. There be ſome expreſſions, that we borrow from our <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> that deſerve to be mentioned, or uſed (by a <hi>Miniſter</hi> that remains perhaps twenty, or <hi>thirty years in a Pariſh)</hi> more then once, though it be to the ſame Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for that which takes not, or is not minded at one time, may at another: and how many have been converted, by that onely argument? that <hi>God ſeeth all things</hi> even in the <hi>darke,</hi> when the <hi>doors</hi> are <hi>ſhut,</hi> and the <hi>curtains drawn.)</hi> Nor do I think, that <hi>a dull</hi> and <hi>flat tool,</hi> or <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> would be uſed, when a more <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>ſharp</hi> one may be had at as <hi>eaſie a rate,</hi> and perhaps <hi>neerer at hand.</hi> But we are moſtly (even the beſt of us) loth to deny our ſelves; though it be for our Maſters, (&amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Brethrens great gain and) advantage.

Nor think the worſe of our ſelves, if ſuch ſhall reproach us never ſo: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> exceedingly ſlighted <hi>Paul,</hi> he was this, and he was that; But what ſays <hi>Paul?

Will the <hi>Merchant</hi> be diſcouraged becauſe <hi>his wine</hi> pleaſeth not a <hi>ſicke mans palate?</hi> Much leſſe cauſe have we to be diſcouraged by their diſtaſte, or diſlike of us and our actions, as having more certainty to rely upon; they perhaps have <hi>ſenſe, reaſon,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> to rely upon, but we have them with the advantage of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Faith, three infallible witneſſes.</hi> Yea, we have great cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that they revile, and ſpeak evil of us. For his <hi>is</hi> both <hi>a token of perdition to them, and to us of ſalvation, and that of God,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> phraſeth it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
               <p>True, they may raiſe any ſlander upon the beſt of us, as the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> did upon <hi>our Saviour,</hi> Math. 28. 13, 14. and that ſlander may be believed time out of minde, (as <hi>the Jewes to this day believe that his Diſciples ſtole him cut of the Sepulchre) Matth.</hi> 28. 15. to the hardning of many in their <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Unbelief:</hi> For what ſhould hinder? When <hi>Naboth</hi> was proved to be <hi>a blaſphemer of God,</hi> and <hi>Suſanna</hi> a whore upon oath; and the ſame recorded to poſterity; when <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was reported to be <hi>an enemy to the State?
