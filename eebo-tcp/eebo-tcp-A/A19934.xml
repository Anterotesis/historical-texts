            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Are extant in these dismal daies, to alter mans amisse?</l>
            <l>But yet (ah wo to vs therefore) no Reformation is</l>
            <l>Of sinful life: the lesse our praise, the greater our perdition.</l>
            <l>The more our woe, the lesse our weale, the neerer our destruction:</l>

            <l>Our Peace (I say) procures our Pride, our Pride our Lust inflameth,</l>
            <l>Our peace, our pride and lawlesse lust, our gracelesse liues defameth:</l>

            <l>For while we liue, we liuing die in sin and foule offence:</l>
            <l>Our daies (as holy <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) in length are but a span,</l>
            <l>Our time is like a blast of winde, soone come, and quickly gone.</l>
            <l>

            <l>We must forsake (though nere so loth) when pleaseth God to call,</l>
            <l>Yet such is the condition of this vale of vaine delights,</l>
            <l>It so bewitcheth all our thoughtes, and rauisheth our sprights.</l>
            <l>Whilst here we are, that litle thought we haue of heauen or hell,</l>
            <l>But feed our vaines, like Epicures, whilst we on earth do dwell.</l>
            <l>This world is such a <hi>Syren</hi> sweet, enchanting with her voice,</l>
            <l>Her laies and warbling Lullabies, our sleeping soules reioice,</l>
            <l>Her pleasures rockes vs fast on sleep, in cradle of security,</l>
            <l>Whilst Sathan lurks in shape vnseene, to take his opportunity.</l>
            <l>O wayward, wicked, wanton world, O gaping gulfe of griefe,</l>
            <l>O sinke of sinne, O sea of shame, of miseries the chiefe.</l>
            <l>O cursed <hi>Caos,</hi> so confusde with heapes of hatefull sinne,</l>
            <l>O Laborinth most intricate, for turnings out and in.</l>
            <l>Thy painted shewes are shadowes vaine, which vanish with the Sun,</l>
            <l>Thy greatest glory shall decay, when mortall life is done.</l>
            <l>Who trusts a broken staffe, we see, doe fall ere they be ware,</l>
            <l>Who sowes his seed in mischiefes mould, shall reape the crop of care.</l>
            <l>What meane we then so much to make, of such vncertaine trash,</l>
            <l>Which at vnwares, when least we ween, wil leaue vs in the lash?</l>
            <l>All these and thousands more such illes, which in this world we find,</l>
            <l>Are motiues which should mooue vs al, an other world to mind.</l>
            <l>That world where the triumphant Church from such extreams is free,</l>
            <l>Where God in matchlesse glory raignes, there should we long to be.</l>
            <l>Where holy ones with heauenly hymmes, do laud his blessed name,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Halleluiahes</hi> sweet are sung, in honor of the same:</l>
            <l>Where that which <hi>Paule</hi> could not expresse, the same do there abound,</l>
            <l>Where sweet of sweets, wher blisse of blisse, wher ioy of ioies are found.</l>
            <l>Yea, there, ah there, if once we were, then should we happy be,</l>
            <l>Til there we find this happinesse, vnhappy stil are we.</l>
            <l>Then let vs leaue this wretched world, and cleaue vnto the Lord,</l>
            <l>And turne from all our wicked waies, in thought, in deed aud word:</l>
            <l>That God from vs may turne his plagues, which we deserued haue,</l>
            <l>That whilst we liue, we so do liue, that he our soules may saue.</l>
            <l>That when our liues giue place to death, then death may swallowed be</l>
            <l>Of life again, in heauen to dwell with God in persons three:</l>
            <l>In endlesse glory there to rest, and that it so befall,</l>
            <l>My heart, my mind, my tongue and lips doo pray: Amen say all.</l>
