            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE <hi>DVBLIN</hi>-Bills of Mortality, 1681. AND THE State of that CITY</head>
                  <p>THE Observations upon the <hi>London-Bills of Mortality</hi> have been a new Light to the World; and the like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation upon those of <hi>Dublin,</hi> may serve as Snuffers to make the same Candle burn clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>London</hi>-Observations flowed from <hi>Bills</hi> regularly kept for near One hundred years; but these are squeezed out of Six stragling <hi>London</hi>-Bills, out of Fifteen <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Bills,</hi> and from a Note of the <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Hearths</hi> in each <hi>Parish</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi>; which are all digested into the one <hi>Table</hi> or Sheet annexed, consisting of Three Parts, markt <hi>A, B, C</hi>; being indeed the <hi>A, B, C,</hi> of <hi>Publick Oeconomy,</hi> and even of that <hi>Policy</hi> which tends to Peace and Plenty.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Observations upon the Table</hi> A.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Total of the <hi>Burials</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> (for the said Six stragling years men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Table <hi>A</hi>) is 120170; whereof the Medium or Sixth part is 20028; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Burials of <hi>Paris,</hi> as may appear by the late Bills of that City.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Births,</hi> for the same time, are 73683, the Medium or Sixth part whereof is 12280, which is about Five eighth parts of the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi>; and shews, that <hi>London</hi> would in time decrease quite away, were it not supplyed out of the Countrey, where are about Five <hi>Births</hi> for Four <hi>Burials,</hi> the proportion of Breeders in the Country being greater than in the City.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Burials</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> for the said Six years, were 9865, the Sixth part or Medium whereof is, 1644, which is about the Twelfth part of the <hi>London</hi>-Burials; and about a Fifth part over. So as the people of <hi>London</hi> do hereby seem to be above Twelve times as many as those of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Births</hi> in the same time at <hi>Dublin,</hi> are 6157, the Sixth part or Medium whereof is 1026, which is also about five eighth parts of the 1644 Burials; which shews, that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60296:7"/>
proportion between <hi>Burials</hi> and <hi>Births</hi> are alike at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that the Accompts are kept alike; and consequenly are likely to be true, there being no Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy for that purpose: Which if they be true, we then say,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Births</hi> are the best way (till the Accompts of the people shall be purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken) whereby to judge of the Increase and Decrease of People, that of <hi>Burials</hi> being subject to more Contingencies and variety of Causes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If <hi>Births</hi> be as yet the measure of the People, and that the Births (as has been shewn) are as Five to Eight, then Eight fifths of the Births is the number of the Burials, where the year was not considerable for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sickness or Salubrity; and is the Rule whereby to measure the same. As <hi>for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</hi> The Medium of Births in <hi>Dublin</hi> was 1026, the Eight fifths whereof is 1641, but the real Burials were 1644; so as in the said years they differed little from the 1641, which was the <hi>Standard of Health</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, the years 1680, 1674, and 1668, were <hi>sickly</hi> years, more or less, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the said Number 1641; and the rest were <hi>healthful</hi> years, more or less, as they fell short of the same number. But the City was more or less <hi>Populous,</hi> as the Births diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60296:8"/>
from the Number 1026; <hi>viz. Populous</hi> in the years 1680, 1679, 1678, &amp; 1668: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes of this difference in Births, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occult and uncertain.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. What hath been said of <hi>Dublin,</hi> serves also for <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. It hath already been observ'd by the <hi>London</hi>-Bills, That there are more <hi>Males</hi> than <hi>Females.</hi> It is to be further noted, that in these Six <hi>London</hi>-Bills also, there is not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance either in the Births or Burials to the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It hath been formerly observ'd, <hi>That in the years wherein most dye, fewest are born, &amp; vice versâ.</hi> The same may be further observ'd in <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Females, viz.</hi> When fewest Males are born, then most dye: for here the Males dyed as Twelve to Eleven, which is above the mean proportion of Fourteen to Thirteen; but were born but as Nineteen to Eighteen, which is below the same.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 FRom the Table <hi>B,</hi> it appears, That the Medium of the Fifteen years Burials, (being 24199) is 1613. whereas the Medium of the other six years in the Table <hi>A,</hi> was 1644, and that the Medium of the Fifteen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60296:8"/>
years Births (being in all 14765) is 984, whereas the Medium of the said other six years, was 1026. That is to say, there were both fewer Births and Burials in these Fifteen years, than in the other six years; which is a probable sign that at a Medium there were fewer People also.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Medium of <hi>Births</hi> for the Fifteen years being 984, whereof Eight fifths (being 1576) is the <hi>Standard of Health</hi> for the said Fifteen years; and the triple of the said 1576, being 4728, is the standard for each of the Ternaries of the Fifteen years within the said Table.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That 2952, the triple of 984 Births, is for each Ternary the Standard of Peoples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and decrease from the year 1666 to 1680 inclusive, <hi>viz.</hi> The People increased in the second Ternary, and decreased from the same in the Third and Fourth Ternarys, but re-increased in the Fifth Ternary beyond any other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the last Ternary was withal very healthful, the Burials being but 4624, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 4728, the Standard.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Observations upon the Table</hi> C.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. FIrst, from the Table <hi>C,</hi> it appears, 1. That the Housing of <hi>Dublin</hi> is such, as that there are not five Hearths in each House one with another, but nearer five than four.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That in <hi>St. Warburghs</hi> Parish are near six Hearths to an House. In <hi>St. Iohns</hi> five. In <hi>St. Michaels</hi> above five. In <hi>St. Nicholas within</hi> above six. In <hi>Christ-Church</hi> above seven. In <hi>St. Iames</hi>'s, and <hi>St. Katherines,</hi> and in <hi>St. Michans,</hi> not four. In <hi>St. Kevans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in <hi>St. James</hi>'s, <hi>St. Michans, St. Brides, St. Warburgh, St. Andrews, St. Michaels,</hi> and <hi>St. Patricks,</hi> all the Christnings were but 550, and the Burials 1055, <hi>viz.</hi> near double; and that in the rest of the Parishes the Christnings were five, and the Burials seven, <hi>viz.</hi> as 457 to 634. Now whether the cause of this difference were negligence in Accompts, or the greaterness of the Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is worth inquiring.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is hard to say in what order (as to greatness) these Parishes ought to stand, some having most Families; some most Hearths, some most Births, and others most Burials. Some Parishes exceeding the rest in two,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60296:9"/>
others in three of the said four particulars, but none in all four. Wherefore this Table ranketh them according to the plurality of the said four particulars wherein each excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the other.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>London-Observations</hi> reckon eight heads to be in each Family; according to which estimation, there are 32000 Souls in the 4000 Families of <hi>Dublin</hi>; which is but half of what most Men imagine; of which but about one sixth part are able to bear Arms, besides the Royal Regiment.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Without the knowledge of the true <hi>number of People,</hi> as a Principle, the whole scope and use of the keeping Bills of Births and Burials is impaired; wherefore by labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conjectures and Calculations to deduce the number of People from the Births and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, may be Ingenious, but very preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If the number of <hi>Families in Dublin</hi> be about 4000, then Ten Men, in one week (at the Charge of about Five pound, Surveying Eight Families in an hour) may directly, and without Algebra, make an Accompt of the whole People, expressing their several Ages, Sex, Marriages, Title, Trade, Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and those who survey the Hearths, or the Constables or Parish Clarks, (may, if requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) do the same <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60296:10"/>
Charge, by the Command of the Chief Governor, the Diocesan, or the Mayor.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Bills of <hi>London</hi> have since their beginning, admitted several Alterations and Improvements; and eight or ten pound <hi>per annum</hi> surcharge, would make the Bills of <hi>Dublin</hi> to exceed all others, and become an excellent Instrument of Government. To which purpose the Forms for Weekly, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and Yearly Bills are humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>WHereas you complain, that these Observations make no sufficient Bulk, I could answer you, That I wish the Bulk of all Books were less; but do never-the-less comply with you in adding what follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Parishes of <hi>Dublin</hi> are very unequal; some having in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Six hundred Families, and others under Thirty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Thirteen Parishes are too few for Four thousand Families; the midling Parishes of <hi>London</hi> containing One hundred and twenty Families; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:60296:11"/>
to which rate, there should be about Thirty three Parishes in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is said, that there are Eighty four thousand Houses or Families in <hi>London,</hi> which is Twenty one times more than are in <hi>Dublin</hi>; and yet the Births and Burials of <hi>London</hi> are but Twelve times those of <hi>Dublin:</hi> which shews, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> are more crowded and streightned in their Housing, than those of <hi>London</hi>; and consequently, that to increase the Buildings of <hi>Dublin,</hi> will make that City more conformable to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. I shall also add some Reasons for altering the present forms of the <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>-Bills of Mortality, according to what hath been here recommended, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We give the distinctions of Males and Females in the Births onely; for that the Burials must, at one time or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; be in the same proportion with the Births.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:60296:11"/>2. We do in the Weekly and Quarterly Bills propose, that notice be taken in the Burials of what numbers dye above Sixty and Seventy, and what under Sixteen, Six, and Two years old; foreseeing good uses to be made of that distinction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We do in the Yearly Bill, reduce the Casualties to about Twenty four, being such as may be discerned by common sense and without Art; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that more will but perplex and imbroil the Account. And in the Quarterly Bills, we reduce the Diseases to Three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Contagious, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and Chronical; applying this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to Parishes, in order to know how the different Scituation, Soil, and way of living in each Parish, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Men to each of the said Three Species: and in the Weekly Bills we take notice not only of the Plague, but of the other Contagious Diseases in each Parish; that strangers and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:60296:12"/>
Persons may thereby know how to dispose of themselves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We mention the Number of the People, as the Fundamental Term in all our proportions; and without which, all the rest will be almost fruitless.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We mention the number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages made in every Quarter, and in every year; as also the proportion which Married Persons bear to the whole; expecting in such Observations to read the improvement of the Nation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As for Religions, we reduce them to Three, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Those who have the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> for their Head. 2. Who are Governed by the Laws of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. 3. Those who rely respectively upon their own private Judgments. Now whether these distinctions should be taken notice of or not, we do but faintly recommend, seeing many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> for the same: and therefore although we have mentioned it as a matter fit to be considered, yet we humbly leave it to Authority.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Table hath been made for the Year 1682, wherein is to be noted,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60296:14"/>1. That the Houses which <hi>Anno</hi> 1671, were but 3850 are <hi>Anno</hi> 1682, 6025; but whether this difference is caused by the real encrease of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or by fraud and defect in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Accompts, is left to considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Burials or People have increased but from 1696, to 2263, according to which proportion, the 3850 Houses <hi>Anno</hi> 1671, should <hi>Anno</hi> 1682 have been but 5143, wherefore some fault may be suspected as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, when Farming the Hearth-mony was in agitation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Hearths have encreased according to the Burials, and ⅓ of the said increase more, <hi>viz.</hi> The Burials <hi>Anno</hi> 1671 were 1696, the ⅓ where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is 563, which put together makes 2259, which is near the number of Burials <hi>Anno</hi> 1682. But the Hearths <hi>Anno</hi> 1671, were 17500, whereof the ⅓ is 5833, making in all but 23333; whereas the whole Hearths
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60296:14"/>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1682 were 25369, <hi>viz.</hi> ⅓ and better of the said 5833 more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Housing were <hi>Anno</hi> 1671, but 3850, which if they had encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Anno</hi> 1682 but according to the Burials, they had been but 5143, or according to the Hearths, had been but 5488, whereas they appear 6025, encreasing double to the Hearths. So as 'tis likely there hath been some errour in the said Account of the Housing, unless the new Housing be very small, and have but one Chimney apiece, and that ¼ part of them are untenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. On the other hand, 'tis more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that when 1696 dy'd <hi>per An.</hi> there were near 6000; for 6000 Houses at 8 Inhabitants <hi>per</hi> House, would make the number of the People to be 48 Thousand, and the number of 1696 that died according to the Rule of One out of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0, would have made the number of Inhabitants about 50 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: For which reason I continue to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60296:15"/>
believe there was some Errour in the Accompt of 3850 Houses as aforesaid, and the rather because there is no ground from experience to think that in 11 year, the Houses in <hi>Dublin</hi> have encreased from 3850 to 6025.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I rather think that the number of 6025 is yet short, because that number at 8 heads <hi>per</hi> House makes the Inhabitants to be but 48200; whereas the 2263 who died in the year 1682, according to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Rule of one dying out of 30 makes the number of People to be 67890; the <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt which number and 48200 is 58045, which is the best estimate I can make of that matter, which I hope Authority will ore long rectifie, by direct and exact Enquiries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to the Births, we say that <hi>Anno</hi> 1640, 1641, and 1642<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> just before the Troubles in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion began, the Births were ⅚ of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60296:15"/>
Burials, by reason I suppose of the greaterness of Families in <hi>London</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Country, and the fewer Breeders, and not for want of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string. Wherefore deducting ⅙ of 2263, which is 377, there remains 1886 for the probable number of Births in <hi>Dublin</hi> for the year 1682; whereas but 912 are represented to have been Christen'd in that year, though 1023 were Christen'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1671, when there died but 1696; which decreasing of the Christnings, and increasing of the Burials, shews the increase of Non-registring in the Legal Books, which must be the increase of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The scope of this whole Paper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, That the People of <hi>Dublin</hi> are rather 58000, than 32000; and that the Dissenters, who do not Register their Baptisms, have encreased from 391 to 974: but of Dissenters, none
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60296:16"/>
have increased but the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> whose Numbers have encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from about 2 to 5 in the said Years. The exacter Knowledge whereof, may also be better had from direct Enquiries.</p>
