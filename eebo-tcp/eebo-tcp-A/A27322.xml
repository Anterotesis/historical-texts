            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WItts, like Physitians never can agree,</l>
            <l>When of a different Societie.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Rabels</hi> Drops were never more cry'd down</l>
            <l>By all the Learned Doctors of the Town,</l>
            <l>Than a New <hi>Play</hi> whose Author is unknown.</l>
            <l>Nor can those Doctors with more Malice sue</l>
            <l>(And powerful Purses) the discenting Few,</l>
            <l>Than those with an Insulting Pride, do raile</l>
            <l>At all who are not of their own Caball:</l>
            <l>If a Young Poet hitt your Humour right,</l>
            <l>You judg him then out of Revenge and Spight.</l>
            <l>So amongst men there are Ridiculous Elves,</l>
            <l>Who Monkeys hate for being too like themselves.</l>
            <l>So that the reason of the grand debate,</l>
            <l>Why Witt so oft is damn'd, when good <hi>Plays</hi> take,</l>
            <l>Is, that you Censure as you love, or hate.</l>
            <l>Thus like a Learned Conclave Poets sit,</l>
            <l>Catholique Iudges both of Sense and Wit,</l>
            <l>And Damn or Save, as they themselves think fit.</l>
            <l>Yet those who to others faults are so severe,</l>
            <l>Are not so perfect but themselves may Erre.</l>
            <l>Some write Coract indeed, but then the whole</l>
            <l>(Bating their own Dull stuff i'th' <hi>Play</hi>) is stole:</l>
            <l>As Bees do suck from Flowers their Honey dew,</l>
            <l>So they rob others striving to please you.</l>
            <l>Some write their Characters Gentile and fine,</l>
            <l>But then they do so Toyl for every line,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:98343:2"/>
That what to you does Easie seem, and Plain,</l>
            <l>Is the hard Issue of their labouring Brain.</l>
            <l>And some th' Effects of all their pains we see,</l>
            <l>Is but to Mimick good Extemporie.</l>
            <l>Others by long Converse about the Town,</l>
            <l>Have Witt enough to write a Lew'd <hi>Lampoon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But their chief skill lyes in a Bawdy Song.</l>
            <l>In short, the only Witt that's now in Fashon,</l>
            <l>Is but the gleenings of good Conversation.</l>
            <l>As for the Author of this Coming <hi>Play,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I ask't him what he thought fit I shou'd say</l>
            <l>In thanks for your good Company to day:</l>
            <l>He call'd me Fool, and said it was well known,</l>
            <l>You came not here for our sakes, but your own.</l>
            <l>New <hi>Plays</hi> are stuff'd with Witts, and with Deboches,</l>
            <l>That Crowd and sweat like <hi>Citts,</hi> in <hi>May-Day</hi> Coaches.</l>

            <p>This Play had been sooner in Print, but for a Report about the Town (made by
some either very Malitious or very Ignorant) that 'twas <hi>Thomaso</hi> alter'd;
which made the Book-sellers fear some trouble from the Proprietor of that Admirable
Play, which indeed has Wit enough to stock a Poet, and is not to be peec't or mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any but the Excellent Author himself; That I have stoln some hints from it,
may be a proof, that I valu'd it more than to pretend to alter it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had I had the
Dexterity of some Poets, who are not more Expert in stealing than in the Art of
Concealing, and who even that way out-do the <hi>Spartan</hi>-Boyes. I might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
all to my self, but I, vainly proud of my Iudgment, hang out the Sign
of <hi>Angellica,</hi> (the only stoln Object) to give Notice where a great part of the Wit
dwelt; tho if the Play of the <hi>Novella</hi> were as well worth remembring as <hi>Thomaso,</hi>
they might (bating the Name) have as well said, I took it from thence: I will
only say the Plot and Bus'ness (not to boast on't) is my own: as for the Words
and Characters, I leave the Reader to judge and compare 'em with <hi>Thomaso,</hi> to
whom I recommend the great Entertainment of reading it, tho had this succeeded ill,
I shou'd have had no need of imploring that Iustice from the Criticks, who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
so kind to any that pretend to usurp their Dominion, they wou'd doubtless
have given me the whole Honour on't. Therefore I will only say in <hi>English</hi> what
the famous <hi>Virgil</hi> does in <hi>Latin; I make Verses, and others have the Fame.</hi>
