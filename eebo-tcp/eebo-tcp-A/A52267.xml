            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Engliſh Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, being now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with convenient helps, for the inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Schollars in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Arithmetick, Geometry, Muſick and Aſtronomy; I come to theſe two liberal Arts, which are in themſelves the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and difficult; This of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, and the other of Logick. Theſe are the Arts and Sciences of which Children are the leaſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and therefore I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them for the laſt place; and for this reaſon it is I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe


<pb facs="tcp:60168:3"/>
that Logick is generally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as</hi> a noli me tangere, <hi>an Art by no means to be taught in ſchools, but muſt be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſerved for the Univerſity; but for as much as Rhetorick is permitted the Grammar Master without controle, and that it is ſo nearly allied to Logick, as that it cannot be attained (the Oratorical part eſpecially) without ſome knowledge of it, let me without any further dint of argument, beg thus much favour of thee, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art into whoſe hands theſe Tracts ſhall fall, not too ſeverely to prohibit a ſmall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, a ſhort introduction to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to bear Rhetorick company, if it be but to compleat our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh

Academy (of which this is the ſixth part:) Perhaps the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that our young ſtudents ſhall reap, by being inſtructed in this ſcience before they ſmell the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity air, may make thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for thy indulgence. Tell me I pray thee, is it not reaſonable that the terms which Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans uſe, being borrowed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts, eſpecially from Logick, ſhould be explained; and if this which cannot be fairly denied, will but be granted me, I will not fear their being ſlighted, for their homeſpun garments in which they are clad; for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that none will be againſt their ſpeaking Engliſh, but ſuch illiterate Schoolmaſters,


<pb facs="tcp:60168:4"/>
who being ſent to the Univerſity before they were fit for it, and compelled for want of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, very quickly to forſake it again, do think it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to teach Engliſh, when yet alas, it is many times very little, very little indeed that they underſtand of other Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nay and it were well if they did underſtand the Rules for reading and writing of their own; all others, if they are not already, will eaſily be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe, that it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing for a man to be an Orator or Rhetorician in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and that the precepts of Rhetorick may be beſt taught and practiſed, in mens native tongue,

as much conducing to and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating their learning of them, in a ſtrange one; but in what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſoever the precepts of this Art are firſt taught, me think's it is an unreaſonable task, that is that is impoſed upon young Lads at School, not much unlike the burthen, that the Aegyptian task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters laid upon the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>when they required of them ſuch a tale of Brick, and yet would allow them no ſtraw.

thinks convenient for that time; how much to his preſent purpoſe; he doth as little care as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and for his next part, the narration of his ſentence in other explicatory words, he ſo little underſtands how to do it, that ſetting aſide the form for that purpoſe, which is alſo tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from thoſe books, you hear but little of it; to find matter for confirmation is all his trouble, now for a</hi> Wits commonwealth, <hi>and if he find any thing there, all his care is to tranſlate it Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically true; as for the reſt, theſe forms</hi> Reuſner's <hi>Symbols and</hi> Licoſthenes, <hi>are the books that muſt enrich him, and if he can but inſert two or three phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

that he did collect from his late lectures, he is a diligent boy, and has done his Tax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> roundly, when alas if the lad did but ſee his own exerciſe in his vulgar tongue, he would laugh at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for writing ſo many words, and thoſe none of his own neither, and all to ſo little purpoſe; and can we expect that ever this ſhould be amended, unleſs you reſpite theſe exerciſes, till lads are acquainted with the Rules of invention, have read and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſome good Histories and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcourſes, and have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with matter from their own reading, and have been inſtructed how to diſpoſe of it in his paper books, that he may

know where to find whatever he hath formerly read of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and whether this may not be more ſpeedily done in every ones native language, and to as good purpoſe, as in a language with which they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, is I think very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thy conſideration.

more true and ſolid knowledge, in this of Rhetorick alſo, than now they have, though their time at School is wholly ſpent in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, and the getting of a few Latine and Greek words and phraſes; and were they but thus prepared for theſe languages, by a competent and a well grounded knowledge in their own, and their affections engaged to the love of learning, by that skill in the ſciences which they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And <hi>Firſt,</hi> we are to conſider what it is that we are to invent; and the thing or matter which we are to invent or find out, is the ſcope and purpoſe, of the intended Oration; that is, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome certain propoſition, to which we mean to direct our ſpeech; and of thoſe ſeveral propoſitions which may be raiſed from the Subject propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhould ſtill make choice of that, which is moſt agreeable to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given, moſt ſuteable to the preſent occaſion, moſt profitable, and that which the Auditors may probably beſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. But now a dayes our Oratours do much labour to find out ſome acute propoſition, and that propoſition is ſo ſtilled, which under ſome Allegory doth expreſs a ſimple and a received truth: as in this expreſſion; I would adviſe you to ſet the Campe in order: the meaning is, I would adviſe you to prepare for War: ſuch propoſitions are not to be found fault with; but yet we muſt take heed of affectation, yea and of lightneſs too, becauſe gravity doth become an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; though young ſtudents may do well to pitch upon the moſt plain and obvious propoſitions; and ſuch eaſie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you have reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your propoſition, then you are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelf of ſome Arguments by which that propoſition may be confirmed: for <hi>an argument is a probable reaſon brought, to perſwade the Auditours of the truth of the Propoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I call it <hi>a probable reaſon,</hi> becauſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of two ſorts; ſome are certain, evident and neceſſary, and theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing: as, that <hi>Peter is not a beaſt, becauſe he is induced with reaſon;</hi> others are probable carrying with them ſome ſhew of truth; that is, they ſeem to be true either from the general received opinion, or for the ſimilitude that they have with the truth, or from the event; and theſe are the Arguments, which an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour ſhould chiefly enquire after; not but that he may alſo uſe ſuch are Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable and undeniably true: but becauſe he many times hath to doe with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as cannot be demonſtrated, or if they can, yet he uſeth probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the moſt part, becauſe he is to

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60168:16"/>
general wayes of inventing Arguments from the very matter propounded, as are <hi>common to all three caſes or cauſes;</hi> and they being well underſtood, the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Judicious Oratour will need no direction for each ſeverall kind of cauſes in particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Topicks</hi> or <hi>Heads</hi> for invention in the General are theſe following.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Definition. 2. Diviſion. 3. Notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. Conjugation. 5. Genus. 6. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. 7. Similitude. 8. Diſſimilitude. 9. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. 10. Oppoſites. 11. Compariſon. 12. Cauſes. 13. Effects. 14. Adjuncts. 15. Antecedents. 16. Conſequents.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Topicks</hi> from whence <hi>Intrinſical</hi> or <hi>Artificial</hi> arguments may be raiſed, are contained in theſe or may be derived from them.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Topicks I call <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And, <hi>Definition is a ſpeech explaining or declaring what a thing is.</hi> The <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Definition</hi> according to the Logicians are theſe two 1. The <hi>Genus or general name;</hi> that is, a name that doth agree with the thing defined, and alſo with ſeveral other things beſides. 2. The <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>ticular name,</hi> that is, a name which doth only agree with that which


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60168:17"/>
is defined; for example, <hi>Man is a living Creature endued with Reaſon.</hi> But ſuch Definitions are ſeldome uſed by Orators, becauſe they afford but little matter for an Oration; but other wayes of Defining things, which may be called Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather, and ſuch are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>One way of <hi>Defining</hi> things, much uſed by Oratours, is, <hi>to deſcribe it by the parts thereof,</hi> which may be ſometimes large and yet elegant: of this way we have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xample in <hi>Cauſinus,</hi> who doth deſcribe a <hi>Butterflie</hi> in this manner. <q>A Butterflie, ſaith he, is a ſmall Animal, ſeldome ſeen in Cities but very frequently in the fields; it is of a full, tender, ſoft, and flexible body, growing ſmaller and ſmaller to a little length, on which a diſperſed gentle down doth neatly ſhine; there ſtand out as it were extended Horns, ſmall as thrids, between which a pleaſant light of his ſhining eyes doth ſparkle; but a ſpecial wonder is in his Wings, far beyond the bulk of his little body, they are bedecked with flowers, adorned with Purple, ſhine like Gold, and glitter with ſtars; being poyſed with theſe, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ies as it were with Oares into the air, diſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60168:17"/>
himſelf, and cleaving almoſt to every ſtalke: ſometimes he ſucks the juice of leaves with his moſt delicate trunk, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſweetly repoſeth amongſtdelight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full odors, other while with a renewed flight he ſoars aloft and eſcapes the hands of inſulting boyes, drawing in the air ſix hundred Meanders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> way by which Oratours do <hi>define</hi> or rather <hi>deſcribe</hi> things, is by ſuch <hi>effects, as do proceed from the four cauſes,</hi> and this way doth as it were open a gate to a large field; only you muſt take heed, that you reckon not every <hi>minute</hi> or <hi>ſmall matter</hi> for an <hi>effect;</hi> according to this way Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth deſcribe <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> to be an <hi>incentive of madneſs, the fomenter of luſt, and the poyſon to wiſdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> way is by <hi>ſimilitude;</hi> but not according to the uſual way of expreſſing them, by the particle, <hi>As:</hi> but by bare affirmation omitting the uſual way of compariſon: for example: <hi>What is our life? It is a market in which we buy and ſell; in which one deceiveth another, and in which every one doth mind his own buſineſs; and hath a care of his own wealth: it is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, in which every one doth act his own part, this man the part of a King, and that of a peaſant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60168:18"/>
A <hi>Fourth</hi> way is by <hi>Synonomie,</hi> as thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>What elſe is a Lilly, but an ornament to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Stars do Heaven; giving as great a luſter to other flowers, as the Jaſper ſtone doth to Gold, and as much delighting the eye as the Sun the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> way is by thoſe <hi>cauſes</hi> by which <hi>effects</hi> are produced; as the <hi>Material, formal, efficient</hi> and <hi>finall cauſes.</hi> For example, the Edifice which <hi>Daedalus</hi> hath raiſed with his own hand, of ſtrong and hewed ſtone, in a round form, is not only fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the injury of weather; but hath alſo ſo much gracefullneſs in it, that it eaſeth the mind of all care, yea and filleth it with delight; it is ſo neatly built, that you would think it Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> way is by <hi>negation;</hi> when we firſt ſhew what a thing is not, and then what it is: Thus <hi>Babuſius L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b. 3. Epigr.</hi> doth deſcribe a <hi>Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Friend <hi>is not a bare voice, or empty nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel, but a Friend is known by his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and behaviour, by his words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60168:18"/>
A <hi>Seventh</hi> way is by <hi>adjuncts</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties;</hi> Thus our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> is called, <hi>The Aſſertor of humane liberty, the maſter of Sanctitie,</hi> and <hi>abſolute perfection, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fountain of all vertues.</hi> Thus <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is deſcribed: <hi>Solomon that great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and Oracle of humane Wiſdome, the Maſter or Tutor of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Eighth</hi> way, is firſt to deſcribe the thing Ironically according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, and then to explain the ſame, as in truth it is, or at leaſt according to your own thoughts and apprehenſions of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Topick</hi> for <hi>Invention</hi> is <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or <hi>Diſtribution of the matter propounded into its parts;</hi> thus the <hi>life of Man</hi> may be divided, into <hi>Infancy, Childhood, Youth, middle age, old-age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arguments may be raiſed from the <hi>parts</hi> unto the <hi>whole,</hi> three wayes. 1. By <hi>affirming</hi> that of the <hi>whole,</hi> which may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of <hi>all the parts;</hi> as if you would prove the <hi>whole Fabrick of a Huſe</hi> to be defective; you may divide the houſe, into <hi>the walls, the roofe, and floores;</hi> and ſhew the defects in each of theſe.</p>

               <p>This Topick may be elegantly uſed by way of <hi>Interrogation, Repetition, Subjection, Preterition,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtrophe.</hi> An example whereof, may be this excellent deſcription of a Garden, as it is ſet forth by <hi>Drexelius</hi> in his <hi>Nicetas.</hi> 
                  <q>There was, ſaith he, a moſt pleaſant Garden as it were a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the ſmiling Trees ſtood with their leaves budded, which with a delightfull odour made the ſhadows gracefull, the gentle motion of whoſe boughs made a ſweet whiſtling noyſe, amongſt theſe a murmuring Rivulet, clearer than any Chryſtal, with running ſtreams which did ſmoothly glide, diſturbing the pible ſtones with its ſinging waters: ſo that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof was almoſt a Muſicall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

On either ſide were flowers, with <hi>Zephyrus</hi>'s copious family; on the one hand the ſilver Lillies from the green bank did ſmile (upon you) on the other the purple Roſes did glitter, from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part the Daffidillies white as Snow or Ivory, were ſet off with the Hyacinths red as blood, yellow as gold; moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant gales of wind breathing from every part.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third Topick</hi> is <hi>Notation,</hi> or <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> which is <hi>the interpretation of the word, ſhewing as well the original thereof, as the ſignification:</hi> as <hi>a Senate</hi> is ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>convention of the Seniors,</hi> that is of old men. <hi>Etymology</hi> is more frequent amongſt <hi>Grammarians,</hi> than <hi>Orators,</hi> yet ſometimes there may be an occaſion for it amongſt them, even for ornament and ſweetneſs ſake.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth Topick</hi> is <hi>Conjugation:</hi> and <hi>Conjugation</hi> is either when <hi>one word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

                  <hi>Conjugation</hi> and <hi>Notation</hi> differ in this; <hi>Notation explains the word; Conjugation ſhewes its derivation and various termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth Topicks</hi> are <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species:</hi> now that is called <hi>Genus,</hi> which doth comprehend <hi>ſeveral things</hi> under it which are <hi>really different</hi> from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that is called <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Species,</hi> which may with other things be referred to <hi>one common Genus:</hi> And thus this word <hi>(Art)</hi> is a <hi>Genus</hi> in reſpect of the ſeven liberal ſciences, as <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick,</hi> &amp;c. And theſe ſciences <hi>Grammar, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> &amp;c. are the <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> which are contained under this <hi>Genus</hi> or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral term (Art.)</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Topicks namely that which is called <hi>Genus,</hi> doth many times afford the Oratour plenty of matter; for by this meanes a finite propoſition, that is a propoſition that is confined to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, place and ſuch like, is reduced to an infinite, and hath all thoſe reſtrictions taken from it. From theſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks we may argue two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is ſpoken of the <hi>Genus</hi> may ſometimes be alſo ſpoken of the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Species;</hi> as thus, <hi>if vertue be to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60168:20"/>
then Temperance ought to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is denied of the <hi>Genus,</hi> may be alſo denied of the <hi>Species;</hi> as thus, <hi>if no liberal Art be neceſſary for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; then Rhetorick is not neceſſary for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh Topick is <hi>Similitude;</hi> and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude <hi>is the comparing of two or more things together, which are in themſelves diverſe, but do agree in ſome particular.</hi> For Example, <hi>a ſhadow</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> are in themſelves very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things: but yet they agree in this, that the ſhadow doth accompany the body, and glory vertue. And hence <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Glory is the ſhadow of vertue. Similitude</hi> may be collected, either from words, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or fable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The eighth Topick is <hi>Diſſimilitude;</hi> and Diſſimilitude <hi>is the diſagreeing of two or more things in ſome particular;</hi> from this Topick we argue thus: that which agreeth with one thing that is unlike, doth not neceſſarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with another; &amp; that which doth not agree with ſome one thing, may yet agree

               </p>
               <p>The ninth Topick is from <hi>Contraries;</hi> and thoſe things are ſaid to be contraries, <hi>which cannot both at the ſame time agree with one and the ſame thing:</hi> thus no man can be ſaid to be wiſe in that thing, in which he is a fool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contraries</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>four</hi> ranks or kinds: <hi>Adverſe, Privitive, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Contradictory;</hi> in theſe ſeverall kinds of contraries we are wont to argue either by way of affirmation or by way of negation.</p>
               <p>In thoſe <hi>Contraries</hi> which we call <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> we argue rightly, if we deny that of one thing or perſon, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm of another, as thus; <hi>there is no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Warre, all men doe therefore deſire peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thoſe <hi>Contraries,</hi> which are <hi>Privative,</hi> we argue rightly, when one privative is denied of that perſon, of which another is affirmed, as thus: <hi>you wiſh me poverty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you envy my proſperous and wealthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60168:21"/>
In <hi>Relative contraries,</hi> we argue rightly, when one is inferred from the relation which it hath unto the other; for example, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Contradictory contraries,</hi> we argue rightly, when one being denied, the other is affirmed, or the contrary; as thus, <hi>He is juſt, he is not juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth Topick is from ſuch things as are <hi>oppoſite</hi> to one another: And they are ſaid to be <hi>oppoſites</hi> to one another, which can never agree together: as <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>friendſhip;</hi> from which ſort of Topicks, the way of arguing is, to deny that of one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite which is affirmed of the other; as thus, <hi>If</hi> Peter <hi>have a mind to kill</hi> Paul, <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he can have no love for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the uſe of theſe Topicks we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how things that are <hi>contraries, unlike</hi> or <hi>oppoſite,</hi> do differ from one another. Thoſe things are ſaid to be <hi>contrary,</hi> which cannot agree with one another; things that are <hi>unlike</hi> doe not diſagree, but are diverſe; but in things that are <hi>oppoſite,</hi> when one of the <hi>contraries</hi> is expreſſed, we are to anſwer it by the <hi>effect</hi> of the other; as thus, <hi>to love</hi> and to <hi>hurt;</hi> for <hi>to hurt</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>hatred,</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> is <hi>contrary unto love.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The efficient cauſe is that which maketh a thing:</hi> Thus the Sun cauſeth or maketh the Day; to this may inſtruments and all other things be referred, which do only aſſiſt in the making as well as thoſe which make the thing: as a Pen is an aſſiſtant in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From this cauſe we argue thus: If the cauſe be denied, we deny the effect; if the cauſe be granted, we grant the effect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: if it be praiſed or diſpraiſed, we praiſe or diſpraiſe the effect alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Material cauſe is that of which a thing is made, or is imployed in;</hi> as money of Gold, and an Oratour about every matter or thing. From this cauſe we argue thus; If matter be afforded, there may be ſuch an effect, and the goodneſs or the badneſs of the effect depends upon the goodneſs or the badneſs of the matter.</p>

                  <hi>The formal Cauſe is that by which the thing is what it is, or that by which it is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from other things.</hi> Thus a Ship and a Timber houſe do differ by the diverſe diſpoſing of the parts. In this cauſe we argue from the excellence or the meaneſs of the form; the more excellent the form is, the better is the thing, and any defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the form doth make it the worſe: and every thing ſhould be proportionable to his ſorm: and hence a man ſhould aim at immortal things, becauſe his ſoul (which is his form) is made immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The final cauſe is that for which a thing is made:</hi> and the end for which we do any thing, is generally one of theſe three, becauſe it is either honeſt, profitable or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.

                  <p>Every <hi>Theam</hi> or <hi>propoſition</hi> doth conſiſt of three parts, a <hi>Subject,</hi> a <hi>Predicate,</hi> and a <hi>Copula.</hi> That is called the <hi>Subject,</hi> of <hi>which we ſpeak;</hi> The <hi>Predicate, that which is ſpoken of the Subject;</hi> and the <hi>Copula is ſome Verbe which joynes the ſubject with the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> In this propoſition <hi>Clodius</hi> is the <hi>Subject,</hi> becauſe it is of him that we are to

                  </p>
                  <p>Now therefore if you would find out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on this Subject, Conſider well, which is the <hi>Subject,</hi> and which is the <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> in your propoſition: Then take the <hi>Subject</hi> and go through every Topick: firſt go to <hi>Definition,</hi> and ask what it is, what is the nature of it, and how it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other things. Then go to <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and ſee into how many parts the <hi>Subject</hi> may be divided; and ſo forward from Topick to Topick. And ſtill obſerve to your ſelf every argument, which doth by this means ariſe from the <hi>Subject,</hi> and applie it to the <hi>Predicate,</hi> ſo ſhall you eaſily ſee, whether it doth fully confirme your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and when you have done with the <hi>Subject,</hi> take the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and run through the ſeveral Topicks, with that alſo; but if the matter require it, and that you judge it more convenient to take the whole propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, than <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>predicate</hi> apart by themſelves, you may in that manner run through all the heads of <hi>Invention,</hi> but ſtay not too long upon any one, for if matter offer not it ſelf in one head go to another, for every head perhaps may not afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

at leaſt not ſuch as is apt and fit.

               <head type="sub">Of the Sharpneſs and ingenuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an Oration.</head>
               <p>SUch is the Curioſity of this age in which we live, as that it is grown weary of theſe plain and ordinary waies, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or expecteth in the very ſtyle ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary; inſomuch that now a daies he is not worthy the name of an <hi>Orator,</hi> that knowes not how to bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh an Oration, by ſome ſharp and witty flouriſhes. And therefore, that we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the preſent times, we will alſo ſpeak ſomething of that ſharpneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, with which an oration ſhould be adorned.</p>
               <p>And firſt I will ſhew you what is meant by <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> or <hi>ingenuity:</hi> as <hi>Material ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> then, is <hi>the meeting of two lines or ſides in one point:</hi> ſo <hi>Metaphorical ſharpneſs is the concourſe, or diſagreeing concord, of the ſubject and the predicate in an Oration.</hi> Or thus, <hi>Sharpneſs is an agreeing diſcord, or a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing concord,</hi> that is, we are then


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60168:26"/>
ſaid to ſpeake <hi>ſmartly</hi> or <hi>wittily, when the predicate and ſubject of an oration, do agree with one another in one part, and diſagree in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> or <hi>acuteneſs</hi> is threefold, <hi>unnatural, praeternatural, or natural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unnatural ſharpneſs</hi> is, when two things agree that are in themſelves unlike, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and contrary, or any way differing; or when there is a different application of the ſubject and predicate; as thus:
<q>
                     <l>The fire doth ſcorch and burn, and oftimes flame,</l>
                     <l>Yet ſee, cold blaſts do now come from the ſame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is againſt nature that cold ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fire. Yet ſeeing that many by that meanes have defended their chaſtitie, and reſtrained the heat of luſt, it is fitly ſaid, that cold proceeds from fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Praeternatural ſharpneſs</hi> is that, which is not indeed againſt nature, but yet is very unuſual: as, <hi>Martial:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Deliciae populi quae fuerunt Domini.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural ſharpneſs</hi> is that which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60168:27"/>
with the nature of the thing; as <hi>Martial:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Impenſis vitam Principis annumeres.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>It is the Kings grace that you are alive.</hi> As if he had ſaid thus, You are beholding to the King for your life; whereas naturally, it becomes a King to preſerve the lives of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The beſt of theſe three is that which is called <hi>unnatural,</hi> becauſe it begetteth great admiration.</p>
               <p>The wayes by which this <hi>diſagreeing concord</hi> between the <hi>ſubject</hi> and the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> may be made, are chiefly four:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By annexing to the ſubject a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Epithite; as, <hi>an innocent ruin: a confuſed order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By annexing to the ſubject another diſagreeing ſubſtantive. as, <hi>The Sun is a fountain of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By a <hi>Catacreſis</hi> either in the <hi>Adjective,</hi> in the <hi>Subſtantive,</hi> or in the <hi>Verb.</hi> Firſt in the <hi>Adjective;</hi> as, <hi>a brazen forehead,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſhameleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Suſtantive,</hi> as if you call <hi>Almeſ, an holy rain,</hi> or <hi>a golden ſhower of piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Verb,</hi> as thus; <hi>the waters made


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60168:27"/>
the Souldiers valiant and compelled them to fight:</hi> that is they were the more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe being near the Sea it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to fly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the <hi>predicate</hi> is both affirmed and denied of the ſubject in a different ſence; as the Poet ſpeaking of a Virgin that loſt her beauty to preſerve her chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſaid: <hi>And then ſhe thought her ſelf moſt beautifull, when ſhe had loſt her beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matter</hi> in which to exemplifie theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes of making an agreeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the ſubject and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate in a propoſition may be had firſt from the Logicall Topicks of <hi>Definition, Diviſion,</hi> &amp;c. for there is none of them ſo barren from whence with a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration you may not collect ſomething that is ſmart and ingenious. <hi>Biderm.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Matter</hi> may be had from ſome <hi>Paradox,</hi> or ſome unuſual ſpeech.</p>

               </p>

               <p>Fifthly, From ſome <hi>Trope</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> in Rhetorick, eſpecially from ſome <hi>Metaphor, Allegory, Catachreſis, Metonymie, Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now though theſe directions, for the finding out of ſomething in a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60168:28"/>
that is ſmart and ingenious are in themſelves good, yet methinks they are not clear and perſpicuous enough; here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſet down what <hi>Horatius P. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Sarbievius</hi> hath more plainly expreſt by way of <hi>Praxis,</hi> though much to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Praxis</hi> is, when ſome magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, bulk, majeſty, authority, largneſs, or deſtruction is fitly applied to any thing, in a doubtful ſence; and is indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be taken really or Morally. Thus <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Epiſt.</hi> 66. ſaith, <hi>that Scaevola being-lame and unarmed, made war, and with that lame hand he overcame two Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Praxis</hi> is the contrary unto this, when a thing is diminiſhed either in quantity, or eſtimation, and in a doubtfull ſence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Praxis</hi> is when this Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth actually contain the cauſe, or doubtfully inſinuate ſome truth of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Praxis</hi> is from the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome word or ſentence, as when it doth in truth ſignifie one thing, but it is intended to ſignifie another. Thus when <hi>Julius Montanus</hi> was repeating his verſes,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60168:29"/>
and having deſcribed the <hi>riſing</hi> of the Sun, and began to deſcribe the manner of his <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> one of the company would have gone his way; and being asked the reaſon, ſaid, <hi>Could I heare him any longer than from Sunriſe, to Sunſet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fifth Praxis</hi> is, when that is applied to an inanimate thing, which is proper to a thing that hath life, yet ſo, as that the ſence and meaning is underſtood, by ſome action of the thing of which we ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to ſomething of a contrary nature. Thus <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaking to one, that went to plough, after he had gotten the victory in battaile, ſaith: <hi>The earth rejoyceth to ſhew it ſelf to one that is victorious, and being tilled by a conquerour, ſhe waxeth proud with her early fullneſs of princely fruites.</hi> And thus Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> upon theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>I am the true light,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Riſe then thou ſluggard, the way it ſelf doth come unto thee, and rouzeth thee from ſleep, riſe and walk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo ſpeaketh acutely, who appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth naturall things to things artificial.</p>
               <p>Thus the Poet, of one that had a long noſe, ſaith,</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60168:29"/>
                  <l>Si tuus ad Solem ſtatuatur naſus, hiante</l>
                  <l>Ore, bene oſtendet dentibus hora quota eſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Hold ope your mouth, your noſe to th' Sun direct,</l>
                  <l>So will your teeth the hour of th' day detect.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The <hi>Sixt Praxis</hi> is, when that which doth agree with real perſons, is applied to thoſe that are not real. So he in <hi>Plautus, Our hands have eyes, and think they ſee.</hi> But this way is moſt pleaſing, when in one and the ſame thing, the application is both true and falſe: ſuch is that of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when he ſaid, that <hi>he had two nice daughters, which he was compelled to beare with;</hi> the one was <hi>his daughter Julia;</hi> and the other <hi>the common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another way of Inventing that which is ſharp and witty; that is by comparing the matter with the Oratorical heads and Topicks: this may be done <hi>three</hi> wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> by comparing the matter in hand with every topick ſeverally; by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the thing is which we are to ſpeak, what the <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Genus, Species, adjuncts</hi>


                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60168:30"/>
and the reſt. Thus doth that <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, deride the conſulſhip of <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> by reckoning up the parts of the year in which he was not Conſul: <hi>There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a wonderfull thing in the year of</hi> Vatinius, <hi>for while he was Conſul, there was neither Spring, nor Autumn, neither Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nor Winter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> by comparing one head of the matter in hand, with another different head of the ſame thing: as the <hi>definition</hi> of the thing with its <hi>adjuncts,</hi> or of the <hi>effects</hi> with the <hi>Cauſes.</hi> Thus <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the <hi>Material</hi> cauſe with the <hi>Formal,</hi> that is by comparing the body with the ſoul, finds out this ſmart commendation of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia: Lucretia,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that mirrour of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man chaſtitie, whoſe manlike courage was by an evil miſtake of fortune, confined to a female body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by comparing the Topicks of one order, with other Topicks of the ſame order, as <hi>definition</hi> with <hi>definition, cauſe</hi> with <hi>cauſe</hi> &amp;c. as for example, <hi>The King whom</hi> Mutius Scaevola <hi>could not conquer by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rmed hand, he made to fly, by ſetting his hand on fire.</hi> Here the acuteneſs lies, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of one cauſe with another, that is his armed hand, with his hand in the flames. And thus much concerning <hi>Invention.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of Diſpoſition.</head>
               <p>DIſpoſition <hi>is the orderly placing of thoſe things which are Invented.</hi> It is two fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Natural,</hi> in which things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in that order in which they were done, or in which according to nature, they ſhould be done: as if you were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a perſon, you ſhould firſt begin with his childhood, next his youth, and ſo to the other degrees of his age.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> way is <hi>Artificial,</hi> which doth either for delight, or profit diverſly mingle and confound the matter, putting that in the end which ſhould be in the beginning, and the beginning in the end, that ſo he may both delight the Auditours and hold them in ſuſpence; which in an unexpected event doth not a little pleaſe and delight the hearers. Thus doth <hi>Virgil</hi> do in his <hi>Aeneades,</hi> in which he ſpeaketh of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> but not in the ſame order in which he began: thus doth <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>


                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60168:31"/>
in his <hi>Argenes,</hi> and thus do all that write either Comedies or Tragedies.</p>
               <p>The Orator then having reſolved of his propoſition, muſt <hi>firſt</hi> conſider of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, whether ſingle or conſiſting of ſeveral parts, and which of the parts ſhould be firſt handled, which next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He muſt chooſe ſome few of the beſt arguments he hath invented, and place ſome ſolid argument in the beginning, thoſe that are leſs forcible in the midſt, reſerving ſtill the beſt and moſt convincing argument for the concluſion; becauſe the Auditor at the firſt being greedy of knowing muſt be prepoſſeſſed and convinced, but in the end he muſt be ſtrongly confirmed and forced.</p>
               <p>And the moſt perſwaſive arguments are thoſe, which proceed from the <hi>Definition, Diſtrubution, Genus, Cauſes,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the thing diſcourſed of, for theſe explain the nature thereof: The leſs forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſuch as are collected from ſome trivial adjuncts and conjectures.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60168:31"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He muſt conſider into what parts his Oration ſhould be divided. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two laſt, I will a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf: And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the Logical Diſpoſition of thoſe reaſons and arguments which are invented, by way of Syllogiſms, and the enlarging of thoſe Syllogiſms in an Oratorical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>A logical argumentation <hi>is the diſpoſition or explication of the argument, which when it is perfect doth conſiſt of three parts, of which that which is put in the firſt place, Logicians call the</hi> Major, <hi>Rhetoricians the</hi> Propoſition: <hi>That which is put in the ſecond place, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers call the</hi> Minor, <hi>Orators the</hi> Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>That which is put in the third place, is by Logicians called the</hi> concluſion, <hi>by Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians the</hi> complexion <hi>or</hi> inference. And theſe <hi>three propoſitions,</hi> when they are regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed, are called a <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> which muſt be framed from that propoſition, and cauſe or reaſon, which was before invented.</p>
               <p>For example, the propoſition was, <hi>That</hi> Clodius <hi>is juſtly put to death: the</hi> Argument or reaſon given for it is, becauſe <hi>he was a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous perſon.</hi> Now then form your Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm thus: Take this cauſe and joyn it with the predicate of your propoſition, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60168:32"/>
                  <hi>Every treacherous perſon doth deſerve to be put to death:</hi> and this is your <hi>Major.</hi> Then take the ſubject of your propoſition, and joyn that with the given cauſe and ſay, <hi>Clodius was a treacherous perſon;</hi> and that is your <hi>Minor:</hi> then bring in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position it ſelf, ſaying, <hi>therefore Clodius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth death,</hi> which is the concluſion, and maketh up the whole Syllogiſm. The like may be done in any other; but alwayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, with what reaſons, examples, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences or ſimilitudes your <hi>Major</hi> or <hi>Minor</hi> may be again confirmed, eſpecially if they be in themſelves weak &amp; but probably true; for if they be certain, they are not then to be proved, but handſomely expreſſed. This done, conſider how theſe Syllogiſms may be handled Oratorically; the which beſides many others may be effected nine ſeveral wayes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> and moſt uſual is ſo to place the parts of the Syllogiſm, as Logicians do, that is the <hi>Major</hi> firſt, and the arguments by which it may be proved. The <hi>Minor</hi> next with the arguments for that; And laſtly the <hi>Concluſion.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond part of an oration is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi> And the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is that part of the Oration in which the Orator doth brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver the ſumme of the whole matter of which he intends to ſpeak, and beſpeaks the hearers attention if need be. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth immediately follow the <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;</hi> ſometimes it follows the <hi>Narration;</hi> in what place ſoever it be put, it muſt be ſhort and clear, and fit for <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here it is to be obſerved firſt, that a <hi>Propoſition</hi> may de delivered two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Openly,</hi> when the Orator doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare the matter of which he meanes to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Darkly,</hi> when the matter of his Oration is ſufficiently known before hand, or may eaſily be diſcerned from the content, or when the thing to be proved is not laid


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60168:51"/>
down as a diſtinct part from the <hi>Exordium,</hi> but is inſinuated as a member thereof an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and further to be proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be obſerved, that when a propoſition is longer than uſual, it ought to be divided into certain parts, that ſo the Orator may the more fully explain the matter, and the Auditor the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Narration</hi> is another part of an Oration, by which a relation is made of the matter or thing done. And this is either a diſtinct part of the Oration, and then for the moſt part it doth immediately follow the <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> that the <hi>Propoſition</hi> with the <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof may be collected from it. Or elſe it is joyned with the <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which is to be done in ſuch Orations which aſſume the explanation of the thing done to prove the matter in hand; for example: <hi>if you were to prove that ſome valiant perſon, had been a Souldier in ſome warre; it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that you ſhould declare, what the particular actions were, in which he ſhewed his valour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now in that Narration which is made a diſtinct part of the Oration, the thing done muſt be briefly and ſimply declared without any exaggeration: and in ſuch a


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60168:52"/>
Narration as makes way for confirmation the things done may be illuſtrated, with great neatneſs of language with, ſentences and figures; &amp; ſome diſcourſes may be made concerning the worthineſs of the action, with ſome amplification from ſimilitudes and compariſons: In a word, where ever you make a <hi>Protaſis</hi> from any Hiſtory or Fable, and afterwards make an application thereof, there you muſt make your <hi>Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and this may be in any part of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, even in the <hi>Exordium:</hi> but theſe kinds of <hi>Narrations</hi> are moſt uſefull in ſuch Orations as are in commendation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of perſons, in which it is neceſſary to declare their vertues or their vices.</p>
                     <p>That your <hi>Narration</hi> may be ſuch as it ought, you muſt obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that the known matter muſt be briefely declared; the matter unknown more largely.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that there be in it ſome apt ſentences, and that it expreſs the manners of men, as their pride, covetouſneſs, and the like; and to this purpoſe an <hi>Hypotypoſis,</hi> or <hi>proſopopoea</hi> and ſuch like figures are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to wit, when ſome perſons are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their melancholy or ſtudious


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60168:52"/>
mood, or ſpeaking ſomething which doth declare and manifeſt what their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that it be plain &amp; clear. And that it may be ſo, you muſt avoid all circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the reckoning up of a multitude of things, and making large Catalogues of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with frequent and long perentheſes and uſeleſs digreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that it be probable. And that it may be ſo, you muſt have a care, that the circumſtances of time, manners, place and perſon be all ſuteable; beſides ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may be briefly named, unleſs the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whom the <hi>Narration</hi> is made be well known, and of good credit. But if any thing be mentioned, not altogether probable, ſome admoniſhment muſt be made thereof, either by adding the cauſe, as, <hi>a Covetous man throwes away his wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw his life in danger;</hi> or, <hi>a Fox deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth grapes, becauſe they are out of his reach,</hi> Or by confeſſing the improbability, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence can otherwiſe be made, and that either plainly thus; <hi>It is wonderfull if we may believe the Poets:</hi> or with ſome compenſation thus; <hi>It is ſtrang, but yet it is true:</hi> or by naming ſome witneſſes thus; <hi>I know not the reaſon, but thus it is affirmed by very ſole-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>


                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60168:53"/>
Or by deſiring the Auditors that they would at preſent admit the thing, which afterwards you will prove more fully.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, that all the things declared, may ctend to the end propounded and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>onfirmation may eaſily follow thereupon. Moreover in declaring any thing let the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator chiefly obſerve, the perſons, matter, time, place, manner, and cauſe, which do almoſt happen in all caſes; but yet all theſe circumſtances are not alwayes neceſſary to be expreſſed, but as many of them only, as the Oratour in his diſcretion ſhall think fit.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth part of an Oration is <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> is as it were the very heart and ſoul by which an Oration may be chiefly ſaid to live: or it is the chief part of an Oration in which the arguments are produced by which we would prove our propoſition, &amp; refute or anſwer the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion of our adverſary, if need require. What is neceſſary in this behalf, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from what hath been already ſaid. Seeing that <hi>Confirmation</hi> doth conſiſt of the arguments that are invented, and the right diſpoſition of them, both which have been fully enough declared before. Thus much only I will adde, that the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in <hi>Confirmation</hi> may do well to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60168:53"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> to name thoſe Arguments in the beginning of his <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the concluſion which carry with them the greateſt weight, and thoſe of leaſt concernment in the midſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to take care, that his Oration may ſtill gather ſtrength; and this will be done, if the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words be ſtill more ſignificant than the former, and that the affections be moſt moved in the very cloſe thereof. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let him take care, that all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments doe fully prove his propoſition. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that he urge not his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one and the ſame manner and forme, but that he uſe variety of figures, and propound them ſometimes by way of <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> ſometimes in an <hi>Enthymem,</hi> ſometimes ommitting the <hi>Major,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> as he thinks it moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> let him find out the <hi>Crinome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> uſe fit <hi>Tranſitions Sentences, Digreſſions</hi> and <hi>Amplifications.</hi> And the <hi>Crinomenon</hi> is that propoſition in the Argumentation, whether General or Particular, in which the whole, ſtrength doth lie, and that being proved, the whole matter ſeemeth to be proved alſo: this therefore the Orator muſt eſpecially declare and confirme.</p>
                     <p>Here then obſerve, 1. That the <hi>Crino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>


                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60168:54"/>
is ſometimes the ſame with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the whole Oration; and then the greater varietie of arguments may be found to prove the propoſition. <hi>For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> let the propoſition be this; <hi>I will ſhew you that a King ought to love his ſubjects and the Common wealth.</hi> The firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is; <hi>Becauſe the head ought to love the members; The King is the head, the ſubjects are the members:</hi> Therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Argument is; <hi>Every one ought to love his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. The common wealth is the Kings pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony:</hi> Therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee that ſeverall arguments may be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the propoſition, becauſe the <hi>Crinomenon</hi> is the ſame with the general propoſition of the Oration.</p>
                     <p>Note 2. That the <hi>Crinomenon</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times different from the Generall propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Oration, and then there is but one principal argument in the whole Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we muſt endeavour to confirme and amplifie. Moreover this <hi>Crinomenon</hi> may be diſcovered, if you put your principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments into a true Syllogiſticall form; for the <hi>Minor</hi> in the ſyllogiſm is ſometimes the <hi>Crinomenon,</hi> as in the firſt argument of the Oration, which <hi>Tully</hi> made for <hi>Milo. He that is a Traitor deſerves tobe kill'd,</hi> Claudius <hi>was


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60168:54"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> Traitor:</hi> Therefore; where the <hi>Major:</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, the <hi>Minor</hi> only is to be proved; this therefore <hi>Tully</hi> endeavours to do throughout that whole Oration.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Major</hi> is the <hi>Crinomenon,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Sextus Roſcius. No Son would kill his father, but for ſome great cauſe;</hi> Sextus Roſcius <hi>is a ſon:</hi> Therefore. In this Syllogiſm the <hi>Minor</hi> is undoubtedly true, and therefore the <hi>Major</hi> only is to be proved, for in that is the whole force. Sometimes the <hi>Crinomenon</hi> is in the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> both. For example, <hi>He killed Roſcius that was advantaged by his death: but the death of Roſcius was advantagious to Capiton;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Here the <hi>Major</hi> and the <hi>Minor</hi> are both to be proved. In the reading therefore, and in the compoſing of Orations, the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> muſt be regarded. But when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propoſition hath ſeveral parts, there are ſeveral <hi>Crinomenons</hi> to be regarded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Tranſitions,</hi> it is by them that the arguments for confirmation have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on one another, yea and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Oration alſo. And a <hi>Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a kind of ſpeech by which we expreſs what hath been ſaid in few words, and briefly ſhew what yet remaineth to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It is either <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>imperfect.</hi> That


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60168:55"/>
is a <hi>perfect Tranſition</hi> which repeats the things ſpoken, and infers the things that are to be ſaid: as if you ſhould ſay; <hi>Enough hath been ſaid concerning the neceſſity of Arms; let let us now ſee what advantage may come from them.</hi> An <hi>imperfect Tranſition</hi> is when we do not revoke the things that are ſpoken, but only proceed to the things that are to be ſpoken, with theſe or the like expreſſions. <hi>But now, furthermore, adde to this,</hi> and ſuch like. And note alſo that one argument doth then properly follow another, when in the end of one argument, ſuch a ſence thereof is given, as will eaſily open away of ſpeaking and arguing further.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sometimes the Orator may declare the argument by way of <hi>Sentence,</hi> and this may be twofold, <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>obſcure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>plain Sentence</hi> is the declaration of the truth in few words. Or, it is an univerſal ſpeech concerning the good that is to be done, and the evil that is to be eſchewed; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, religion, providence, and other things belonging to the life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men. For example;</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Nemo mortalium omnibus horis ſapit;</l>
                        <l>No man is wiſe at all times.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:60168:55"/>
An <hi>obſcure ſentence</hi> is a particular ſpeech deducted from a general, the circumſtances of perſons, time and place being added thereunto; as thus; <hi>It cannot be,</hi> O Peter, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt be always wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Occult ſentences</hi> are to be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in any part of an Oration, for they do adorn it much, and are very taking with the Auditors: <hi>Plain ſentences</hi> may be alſo uſed, but theſe do beſt become old men and ſuch as have experience; and are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be uſed in grave matters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Digreſſions</hi> are oft times and very grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed in <hi>Confirmation:</hi> in which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is touched upon, which ſeemeth little to the purpoſe, but yet doth ſerve to illuſtrate the matter in hand. And this may be done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>briefly,</hi> and then there needeth no <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;</hi> or elſe <hi>more largely,</hi> and then the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt recall himſelf, as from a long and a by-path to his preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Orator may uſe <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> when he is to ſpeak of univerſal and common things, as, of vices, virtues, ſlavery, liberty, life, death and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>As ſuppoſe one were to prove, that it were not fit to thruſt a learned man out of a City, he might make his digreſſion on the praiſe of learning, ſhewing as well the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60168:56"/>
as the profit of it. Expoſitions of things done and deſcriptions of places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, cuſtoms and ſuch like, may be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely uſed in <hi>digreſſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Amplification</hi> is a ſpeech, which doth augment that, which being nakedly related would ſeem ſmall and trivial, by deſcribing of it by adjuncts and circumſtances. It is twofold, of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amplification of words,</hi> is that by which the matter is augmented by the choice of words, and manner of ſpeech. And a <hi>ſpeech</hi> may be augmented from one word ſeveral ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the addition of fit Epithites; thus <hi>Tully</hi> doth amplifie and enlarge this one word <hi>War</hi> ſaying, that it is <hi>an horrible and a villainous war, and full of all wickedneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the uſe of ſuteable Adverbs; as, <hi>you may juſtly and deſervedly praiſe him.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <hi>A Meter</hi> is a poetical number conſiſting of certain feet, of which the laſt foot hath the laſt Syllable indifferent or common, that is, long or ſhort.</p>
               <p>In this kind of Poetical number, there is a liberty granted for a certain <hi>Metaplaſm</hi> or transformation of a word, namely when there is ſomething wanting in it, or when there is too much, or when there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing changed.</p>
               <p>There are four kinds of <hi>Metaplaſms.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. By Eliſion or taking away ſomething from the end of a word, in the ſcanning of a verſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Synalaepha</hi> is an eliſion or ſtriking out of one vowel before another in divers words; as, <hi>'tis,</hi> for <hi>it is.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ecthlipſis</hi> is when the letter <hi>m</hi> with his vowel is taken away, becauſe the word fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing beginneth with a vowel; as, <hi>Syncer' eſt,</hi> for <hi>Syncerum eſt.</hi>

But a greater care is to be had of the cloſe than either of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or middle of a ſpeech, for in that the perfection of number doth chiefly appear; but theſe things will be better underſtood by the practice of the meaneſt Orator, than the precepts of the moſt skilful.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Secundary Figures.</head>
               <p>TO theſe <hi>Primary Figures</hi> of words and ſentences there may ſome <hi>ſecundary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> be added in both kinds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60168:75"/>
The <hi>Secundary figures of a word</hi> are eight.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Ellipſis.</item>
                  <item>2. Pleonaſmus.</item>
                  <item>3. Aſyndeton.</item>
                  <item>4. Polyſyndeton.</item>
                  <item>5. Hyperbaton.</item>
                  <item>6. Zeugma.</item>
                  <item>7. Antitheſis.</item>
                  <item>8. Graeeiſmus.</item>
               </list>
               <p>An <hi>Ellipſis</hi> is, when ſome neceſſary word, to expreſs the passion, is omitted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; as, <hi>Iſaiah 1. 13. I cannot iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, I cannot bear iniquity.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pleonaſmus</hi> is, when there is ſome word in an oration, more than it ſeemeth to need; yet doth emphatically and eminently expreſs ſome vehemence and certainty; as, <hi>I ſaw it with theſe eyes.</hi> And that which hath not ſuch an Emphaſis is idle and vicious.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Aſyndeton</hi> is, when in a number of words, a conjunction copulative is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either through haſt, or vehemence of ſpeech; as, <hi>By thy folly and wickedneſs thou haſt loſt thy ſubſtance, thy good name, thy friends, thy parents, and offended thy Creator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Polyſyndeton</hi> is, when for gravity ſake, more conjunctions are uſed than ſeem need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but not without ſome Emphaſis; as, <hi>overmuch ſleep alſo, and wine, and banquets, and queaus, and bathes enervate and enfeeble the body and mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60168:76"/>
An <hi>Hyperbaton</hi> is a <hi>Tranſpoſition</hi> of words from the right order of conſtruction, into ſome more neat and compact form, for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and variety ſake; as, <hi>Epheſ. 1. And you bath he quickened who were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Zeugma</hi> is, when ſome verb or adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive but once expreſſed in a ſentence, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be referred to ſeveral others of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers genders, numbers or perſons, agreeing with that which is neareſt; as, <hi>lust overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth modeſty, boldneſs fear,</hi> and <hi>paſſion reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is threefold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prozeugma,</hi> when this common word is ſet in the beginning; as, <hi>For neither art thou he,</hi> Cataline, <hi>whom ſhame could at any time call back from diſhoneſty, fear from perils, or reaſon from madneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſozeugma,</hi> when in the middle; as, <hi>what a ſhame is this, that neither hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor fear of reproach could any thing move him, the perſwaſion of his friends, nor the love of his Country?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypozeugma,</hi> when in the end; as, <hi>the foundation of freedome, the fountain of equity, the ſafeguard of wealth, and cuſtody of life is preſerved by law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Antitheſis</hi> is, when the things oppoſed do anſwer one another; as, <hi>Flattery procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60168:76"/>
friendſhip, truth hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Graeciſmus</hi> is when the proper Idiom of the Greek is uſed in another ſpeech or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; as, <hi>Edm. Spencer Chap. 13. For not to have been dipt in</hi> Lethe <hi>lake, could ſave the ſon of</hi> Thetis <hi>from to die;</hi> that is, <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe may be added</p>
               <p>An <hi>Hyperologia</hi> or an <hi>Hyteron Proteron,</hi> when that which in the natural order ſhould be firſt ſpoken, is brought in laſt; as, <hi>he is in health and alive,</hi> for, he is alive and in health.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Antiptoſis,</hi> when one caſe is put for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Hypallage,</hi> when two words do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute or change caſes with one another; as, <hi>Thou haſt hid their heart from underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Job</hi> 17. 4. that is, thou haſt hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from their heart.</p>
               <p>The Secundary figures in a ſentence are ten.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Parrhéſia.</item>
                  <item>2. Eroteſis.</item>
                  <item>3. Parentheſis.</item>
                  <item>4. Paratheſis.</item>
                  <item>5. Periphraſis.</item>
                  <item>6. Synonymia.</item>
                  <item>7. Hypotypoſis.</item>
                  <item>8. Praemunitio.</item>
                  <item>9. Tranſitio.</item>
                  <item>10. Rejectio.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parrheſia</hi> is a free and a bold ſpeaking of


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60168:77"/>
ſuch things in their preſence whom we ſhould fear or reverence, as are diſpleaſing or may provoke them to envy.</p>
               <p>And this is either when we confidently acknowledge and defend a fault not proved againſt us, or when we boldly upbraid and rebuke others, for faults by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eroteſis</hi> is a manner of ſpeech, whereby we either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Demand a queſtion; as, <hi>How oft ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? till ſeven times? Matth.</hi> 18. 21. Or when we</p>
               <p n="2">2. Earneſtly affirm and reprehend; as, <hi>O faithleſs Generation! how long ſhall I be with you? how long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> Mark 9. 19. Or when we</p>
               <p n="3">3. Vehemently avouch the contrary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the interrogation be affirmative or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; as, <hi>can the blind lead the blind? ſhall they not both fall into the ditch?</hi> that is, the blind cannot lead the blind, they ſhall both fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parentheſis</hi> is the interpoſing of one or more words of perfect ſence, within another ſentence, for the perfecting thereof; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which interpoſition, the ſence would yet be perfect and entire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60168:77"/>
Concerning which, two rules are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the interpoſition ſhould neither be long, nor frequent, becauſe it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſentence obſcure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That one <hi>Parentheſis</hi> be but ſeldome inſerted within another; as, <hi>Are they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt (I ſpeak as a fool) I am more; 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paratheſis,</hi> is a figure of conſtruction, whereby one ſubſtantive is for declaration and diſtinction ſake added unto another in the ſame caſe; as, <hi>the river</hi> Isis, or <hi>the river</hi> Wye. Judas <hi>ſaith unto him, not</hi> Iſcariot. <hi>John</hi> 14. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periphraſis,</hi> is the explication of a thing by more words, which may be expreſſed by one.</p>
               <p>This figure is principally made four ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When ſome notable enterpriſe, ones native countrey, or ſome ſtrange ſect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is put inſtead of the proper name; as, <hi>The writer of the Trojan war</hi> for Homer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Etymology,</hi> when the cauſe or reaſon of a name is unfolded; as, <hi>a man ſtudious of wiſdom,</hi> for a Philoſopher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>Annotation,</hi> when by certain marks or tokens ſomething is deſcribed; as, <hi>Anger is a vehement heat of the mind, which brings


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60168:78"/>
paloneſs to the countenance, burning to the eyes, and trembling to the parts of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When a thing is deſcribed by defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as, <hi>the art of ſpeaking eloquently,</hi> for Rhetorick. <hi>An oppreſſor of the laws and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people,</hi> for a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Synonymia</hi> or <hi>Palilogia,</hi> is a heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of many words of one ſignification; as, <hi>Wiſdome in a poor man lyes as a thing deſpiſed, rejected, oppreſſed, buried and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypotypoois</hi> is a figure by which a whole matter is particularly and orderly expreſſed, as that it ſeems to be repreſented unto ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſpection; as, <hi>It is a place which now humbling it ſelf in fallowed plains, now proud in well husbanded hills, marries barren woods to cultivated valleys, and joyns neat gardens to delicious fountains,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Praemunition</hi> or preparation is, when we preſuppoſe what may be ſaid by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for thoſe, whom we intend to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or reprove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tranſition</hi> is that by which the parts of an oration are joyned together. And this is</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Perfect,</hi> by which is declared what hath been ſpoken, and what remaineth to be ſaid; as, <hi>hitherto we have ſpoken of tillage and Aſtronomy, now we will treat of</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60168:78"/>
2. <hi>Imperfect,</hi> by which is declared either what hath been ſaid, or what remaineth to be ſpoken.</p>
               <p>This may be done eight ſeveral ways.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>5. By ſomething that is divers; as,</hi> you have heard of his behaviour, I will now inform you of his learning.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>6. By preoccupation; as,</hi> We will now haſten to the reſt, only give me leave to adde this one thing.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>7. By reprehenſion;</hi> Why ſhould I dwell on this ſubject; I haſten to that which is the cauſe of all.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>8. From ſome conſequent or relative; as,</hi> you have heard what I have done for him; hear now how he hath required me.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejection</hi> is, when we deferre a thing to ſome other time or place, or wholly reject it as abſurd and impertinent, and by no


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60168:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
means to be admitted of; as, <hi>But of</hi> Luculus <hi>I will ſpeak in ſome other place: and I will ſpeak ſo, as that my ſpeech ſhall not falſely accuſe him, or yet derogate from his juſt praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much concerning <hi>Elocution.</hi> As for <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> which are the other two parts of Rhetorick, I purpoſely omit them, as being natural endowments, which may be better improved by conſtant practice, than by any precepts which can be given.</p>
