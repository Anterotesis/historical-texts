         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

City of LONDON
Are aſſerted againſt the ſcandalous Reflections he has made upon them.
IN A
LETTER
TO THE
LORD MAYOR
AND
Court of Aldermen.</head>
            <byline>By a Loyal Citizen.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord and Fellow Citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS it has been the opinion of many worthy Members of our City (ſince the
Election of this Sheriff) that we did very ill to call a Perſon to that Office
from his private ſtation in the Country (tho' not ſo qualified for this place
by the Laws as ſome others were) ſo it has been of very great trouble to
us to find him not anſwer either the Deſign or Honour of ſuch our Election.</p>
            <p>'Tis his pleaſure to acknowledge he was <hi>getting an Eſtate by Trade when the Rebellion
broke out in</hi> England; and that I ſuppoſe fitted him afterwards to bear a part in that
bluſtrous Government, as to have the honour to be nominated a <hi>Steers-man</hi> in that
<hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> which had like to have ruined the whole <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100438:2"/>
And yet, 'tis true, a man may be of very ill Principles in 1658. and become a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
good man again in 1660. when his beloved Eſtate and ſafety, begins to be call'd
in queſtion; which made the pleaſant Fellow, who (walking with a great Lanthorn
and Candle lighted at Noon-day, on the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> on the King's Return) ſaid,
<hi>That he had been ſeeking for a</hi> Round-head <hi>all that day, but verily and truly could not
find</hi> One <hi>from</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>to</hi> Aldgate.</p>
            <p>But to come to the point: Was there ever ſuch a man of Vertue heard of ſince
<hi>Adam</hi> (that managed a Trade) who thus confidently avers, <hi>That his converſation
has been ſuch, in all his dealings in the World, as to deſerve no reproach from any man
upon Earth?</hi> We all well know, that in Traffique and Trade in the World the juſteſt
man falls ſeven times a day, as occaſion may offer.</p>
            <p>And 'tis to be ſuppoſed, that a man that gets an over-grown Eſtate amongſt us in
a way of Trade, cannot get every peny ſo exactly juſt as not to be liable to the reproach
of any Tongue whatſoever; ſurely if that had been true which our Sheriff affirms,
he had never fallen under the preſent obloquy. But—</p>
            <p>Now after all this, ſince you called him forth from his private retirement to the
Honour he now enjoys: Behold, (good man) how <hi>he calls in one of the Prophets to
teſtifie against you, for maliciouſly reproaching, ſcandalizing and making his Office
troubleſom to him.</hi> Why now, let any man judge if ever Sheriff (ſince <hi>Richard</hi> the Ill's
time) was ſo abuſed by his fellow Citizens: ſurely we have not loſt our manners and
due regards to that Honourable Office, have we? Come let us but impartially enquire
into the reaſons of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſays, <hi>We charge him with being a Papiſt and a Jeſuit; and to colour our Lies
call in the Kings Evidence to teſtifie againſt him;</hi> Why truly this could not be ſaid
but by an errant <hi>Tory,</hi> or ſome <hi>Maſquerading Fellow;</hi> no loyal, honeſt or ſober Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
could have offer'd ſuch an affront to his Worſhip; And yet Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is a
ſhrewd man too at gueſſing;—But however, we may ſay there was an odd <hi>Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principle</hi> that actuated in the late times, to do even ſuch things as <hi>Jeſuits would if
they could;</hi> and ſo poſſibly there may be <hi>colour</hi> for ſome ſuch tittle tattle among the
People at the Election in <hi>Southwark: But when Dr.</hi> Oats <hi>comes to Town he will clear
this point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Election in <hi>Southwark,</hi> I may freely ſay this, That the Commoners did
very diſcreetly in Electing two unqueſtionable Loyal Perſons, Capt. <hi>Rich</hi> and Sir <hi>R. How;</hi>
And in ſuch Elections there do not want reflections on each Candidate; for I have
been told that ſome of the Sheriff's party did beſpatter them too with the Title of
<hi>Abhorrers, and I overs of Arbitrary Power;</hi> ſo that 'tis pretty even on both ſides.</p>
            <p>As for what he is accuſed of in <hi>being a Souldier of the late times,</hi> I am apt to believe
his Worſhip ſays truth; But what to ſay to that malicious whiſper of <hi>words ſpoken by
him at</hi> Hambrough <hi>about the King's Death, I leave that to be decided by Law;</hi> only
a man would think our Sheriff no good King's man, ſince he is thus traduced by
Perſons of the ſame Rank and Place he dwelt in, and his daily Companions.</p>
            <p>But for the next malicious ſlander, of <hi>his being one of thoſe in Vizards that aſſisted
at the Death of His late Majesty;</hi> I profeſs I wonder any perſon ſhould be ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to accuſe him; for after all the imaginable care and ſcrutiny to find the Truth,
(by the Council and the Parliament) upon His Majeſties Return, they never yet
could learn who thoſe bloudy Villains were that murthered our dear Sovereign o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
bleſſed memory; ſo that we might as well have ſaid they were two of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
as well as our Sheriff and another perſon in Maſquerade; ſo far I muſt do him
all the right I can. As to the ſtory of the <hi>Waterman's coat,</hi> 'tis very odd; ſuch a
thing might be; for all men are not in a good humour with Watermen at all times:
tho' a Kings Waterman (to ſome conſtitutions) is more obnoxious than a City Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And ſo much for that point too.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now come home to the matter in hand (ſo far as concerns us Citizens)
in taking notice of our Sheriff's Vindication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100438:2"/>
As for his Houſe-keeping, <hi>he does very elaborately let us know that he does not dwell
in a Garret, (nor hired Cellar or Pantry I ſuppoſe) and that if we had not anger'd
him, in chooſing Mr.</hi> Pilkington <hi>(a meer Commoner) Alderman of the Ward, and gave
him the go-by, he would have dwelt in a larger</hi> (Taylor's) <hi>Houſe, and eſtabliſhed his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and taken in Officers,</hi> &amp;c. Why truly this is a very good reaſon for a man to be
angry with Houſe-keeping and maintaining any part of the Repute and Honour of
the City; and ſo, for ought I ſee, we muſt be contented with it; for there is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
thriftineſs as well as an honourable prodigal laviſh Houſe-keeping, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
among the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and for a man to relieve poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
Citizens, and Priſoners, and others in want, when the Law of the Land
provides for them otherwiſe, is a thing ſo laviſh and prodigal, that no Sheriff
of <hi>London</hi> ought to evade it, eſpecially when the loſs of being Alderman of the
Ward and Knighthood is in the caſe. And then when a man conſults the <hi>wholſom
Laws againſt exceſs of Feasting, which our Sheriff ſays are the moſt wholſom,</hi> (nay more
wholſom Laws than the 35<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> or 16<hi>th.</hi> of our King ten to one:) why truly no
man breathing would feaſt every day, or endure it in his Houſe.</p>
            <p>When I came to one Paragraph, (which is a quotation out of ſome modern Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit)
I proteſt I ſtood amazed to hear of a <hi>meritorious congruity as well as condignity;</hi>
Now where there can be no <hi>congruity,</hi> there ought to be <hi>condignity,</hi> that's moſt clear;
and therefore ſince we could not agree to make him Alderman of the Ward, 'tis fit
he ſhould tell us of it by the way of <hi>condignity.</hi> And ſo much for a <hi>meritorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince the preferment is gone, and we have abuſed him into the bargain, he
tells you, <hi>That he cares not a F— for't, for he has tasted morepleaſure in a retired Life,
than ever to thruſt himſelf into troubleſom and lofty places:</hi> which yet to me ſeems
ſtrange; for if he had continued in his ſtate of privacy, and paid the uſual Fine to
the City, he might have been excuſed as well as others have been, and conſequently
undergon no reproach; but ſome think 'twas a fit time for ſuch men to up and be
doing ſomething againſt Popery and Arbitrary Government, and to preſerve Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Property, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to hinder wholſom Laws made againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters
from being put in execution: Truth is, I muſt needs ſay, that we that had ſo much
<hi>throng and ſweat to chooſe him,</hi> ought not to beſpatter him at the rate we have done;
for <hi>he could not honeſtly deny us when we choſe him ſo freely,</hi> as he ſaith; But yet not ſo
freely neither, but that there was tugging and pulling at it, and a world of pudder
made by the <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Tantivy party,</hi> viz. the folks of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the
old Proteſtants, who were generally againſt it.</p>
            <p>Then, in the next place, comes in three or four Paragraphs of Rhetorical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
upon the City to ſhew a further reaſon of not keeping up the <hi>Port and
Grandeur of his Office by generous and publick Houſe-keeping.</hi> Now here lies the point;
Can any Lord, Knight, Gentleman, Citizen, Stranger or Foreigner poſſibly make
a meal out of a diſh of Sheriffs Paragraphs? Can any of the poor Priſoners in any of
the Gaols feed on a Basket of Paragraphs? If they can, much good may they do
'em; I had, for my part, rather dine with my Countrey-man Sheriff <hi>Corniſh</hi> (who
I hear retains a Weſtern kind of generous Hoſpitality) than at ſuch a Feaſt.</p>
            <p>The next Paragraph is to diſplay the ſeveral Atchievments and common Cuſtoms
of the City, and (much like <hi>Jordan</hi>'s annual Lord Mayors Shew) tells us what we
obſerve and practice in relation to maintaining the publick Honour and Reputation
of the City, but begs your pardon for appearing in them himſelf on all occaſions.
Firſt, becauſe my Lord Mayor was not well lately. Secondly, that the <hi>Easter</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were at <hi>Sepulchre</hi>'s, when they ſhould have been at the <hi>Spittle.</hi> And another
reaſon may be too poſſibly, becauſe a Biſhop and a Dean preached; the latter having
lately wrote an excellent piece againſt Proteſtant Diſſenting Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now we are at</hi> Houſe-keeping again, <hi>and</hi> we will ſhew more and ſtronger reaſons
for no Feaſting than for feasting: <hi>And firſt, he ſays,</hi> 'Tis of no honour to the <hi>City,</hi> but a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100438:3"/>
reat prejudice and ſcandal to the Government. <hi>(Still our Worſhip ſaves our Bacon.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>That 'tis cuſtomary to feast</hi> Companies <hi>on ſet days, and entertain particular
Friends on others:</hi> From which I conclude our Sheriff loves not this formal Feaſting.
3dly. <hi>That the Honour the Sheriff gets by ſuch feaſting is not tantamount to the charge,
though two Guinies be given by every Livry-man for his double Treat and Spoon.</hi> I'le aſſure
you a very good caution theſe hard times to our City Livry: men: But then, 4<hi>thly.</hi>
and beyond all, his Worſhip compares this generous, honourable and hoſpitable way
of the Sheriff's Feaſting <hi>to a poor Countrey-wedding, the way being to invite a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to a great Feaſt,</hi> (which however is beyond ſome Sheriffs too, by your leave,) <hi>on
purpoſe to get Money and Houſhold ſtuff for them to begin the World with</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now how the
compariſon will hold in this caſe let any man judge: But then we Livry-men muſt
have a care what we do now, for we are forbid to <hi>hearken to either Maſter or Wardens
this year,</hi> ſince the Sheriff reſolves not to accept of our Guinies, for the ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>Well, in the next place, you <hi>the ſeveral former Sheriffs, that have emulated one
another in Feaſting on private days, and out-vy'd each other in ſplendour and gallantry,</hi>
(now one would think this ſhould mean the King's being treated at ſupper at ſome of
your Houſes not many years ſince,) I ſay you are ſeverely rebuked, and for ought
I perceive compared to <hi>the wantons of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>who with ſo much fulneſs of Bread and
Idleneſs provok'd the heavy Judgments of God to fall upon them.</hi> Now whether your
ſort of Feaſting be like theirs, that's the point: for my part I think hoſpitable Houſe-keeping
and feeding the poor and needy (as we may ſee at <hi>Lambeth Houſe</hi> every
day, and other good Houſes) are very laudable and honourable things, in no wiſe
offenſive, to God, to Religion and good Cuſtom; I think far from that riotous Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſo much for Feaſting without a Meal.</p>
            <p>And now who would think that this very ſin of Feaſting ſhould make our Sheriff
carefully and tenderly affraid, <hi>leſt an Angel he ſent from Heaven with the Plagues of</hi>
Sodom <hi>on our</hi> City <hi>too?</hi> God forbid we ſhould ever requite the Lord ſo for his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Goodneſs to us in our late Deliverances from the hands of <hi>Popiſh Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi>
and <hi>Lanatick Rage,</hi> and I am, with his Worſhips favour, and on better grounds
and reaſons, more afraid that the Whoredoms, falſe Oaths, rebellious Witchcrafts
(that ſtink in the Noſtrils of Heaven) will bring Judgments on us, as in the Caſe of
<hi>Korah Dathan and Abiram,</hi> than Innocent Feaſting, by Sheriffs or other Citizens.
And ſo much for this point too at preſent.</p>
            <p>But to conclude: Methinks among all the Worthy and Loyal Bookſellers in our
City, Mr. Sheriff might have pleaſed to have choſen one out of them to Print and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Vindication, rather than <hi>Frank Smith</hi> (his Priſoner for Treaſon, as ſome ſay;)
but however, every man to his fancy; for my part I would never have his Name to
any thing I ſhall ever write, for this very reaſon. That he never yet Printed any thing
(ſave our Worſhips Vindication) but was either Tinkerly Hereſie, or <hi>Seditious</hi> Naked
Truth, or <hi>Welſh</hi> Gloſſes on Divine ones: And ſo I wiſh him a ſafe Deliverance, and our
Sheriff well out of his troubleſom Office; Taking my leave and ſubſcribe,</p>
