            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall give you an account of what intelligence
these parts afford. On <hi>Tuesday</hi> morning we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
intelligence that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> &amp; P. <hi>Maurice</hi> were
at <hi>Banbury</hi> upon their march towards <hi>Newark,</hi> some
reported them to be twelve hundred, others six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
Vpon which Intelligence all the horse belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Garrison, being three hundred, and four
hundred more which lay at <hi>Stamford,</hi> were drawn to
<hi>Melton</hi> by Colonell <hi>Rossiter,</hi> to interpose betwixt the
King and the Princes, or to joyn with the Horse and
Dragoons under Colonell <hi>Manwaring</hi> then at <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and since gone to <hi>Derby</hi> to joyn with Colonell
Generall <hi>Points.</hi> Yesterday morning upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from <hi>Burleigh,</hi> that the report of Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perts</hi>
comming was false, and the King being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
backe to <hi>Newarke,</hi> our Horse were ordered to
march back to <hi>Grantham,</hi> no sooner were we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but from <hi>Leicester</hi> we recevied Intelligence that
the Princes were upon their march towards <hi>Belvoir,</hi>
we pursued them with all speed, they faced us twice
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41416:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as though they would have charged, but upon our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to them they run for <hi>Belvoir,</hi> we pursued them
close to the castle walls, took a Major, three Captains,
sixty Prisoners, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Trumpeter, Trumpet
and Banner, and about one hundred and forty Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we wounded and killed divers, some of quality,
the two Princes hardly escaping with about one
hundred more. Some of the Officers we have taken,
told us that the Princes sent the Lord of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
Regiment back to <hi>Banbury,</hi> and marched with
this small party onely to speake with the King, and
take their leaves of him. The King is now in <hi>Newark,</hi>
his Horse quartered betwixt <hi>Newark</hi> and <hi>Welbeck,</hi> part
of them: and as we hear, Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> with
the rest marched Northward, it is likely to releeve
<hi>Skipton Castle,</hi> Colonell Generall <hi>Points</hi> is come to
<hi>Derby,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Manwaring</hi> is gone to him, which
I hope will give us a further occasion of sending to
to you, Sir,</p>
