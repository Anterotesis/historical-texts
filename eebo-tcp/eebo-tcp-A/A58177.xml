            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAving been deſired by a learned and pious <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Elys.</note> 
               <hi>Friend</hi> to draw up ſuch a <hi>Perſuaſive</hi> as I now preſent the <hi>Reader</hi> with, finding my ſelf well at leiſure from other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and conſidering that it was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my Profeſſion, and preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as being conducive to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for that change which the pains and infirmities I laboured under ſeemed to threaten the near approach of; and might poſſibly be in ſome meaſure uſeful and beneficial to others: I was eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb facs="tcp:96633:3"/>
to comply with his Requeſt, and to employ thoſe Intervals I had of eaſe or remiſſion of pain, in Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject. I do not pretend to any thing new, or not delivered by others. Practical Divinity and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are ſuch beaten Subjects, and have exerciſed the Wits and Pens of ſo many thinking men, that there is nothing of this nature can be ſaid or written, which hath not already been ſo. But becauſe not every man, nay ſcarce any man, hath read all that hath been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this, or any other Subject, ſomething new to every Reader may perchance occur in this Writing: And yet if there does not, it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to read the ſame things over again, as the Apoſtle in effect ſaith, <hi>Philip.</hi> But to do every man right, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf to have borrowed a good part of my Matter out of the Right Reverend Father in God, Dr. <hi>John Wilkins,</hi> late
<pb facs="tcp:96633:3"/>
Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> his Treatiſe of <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> wherein he hath in my judgment written ſo well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Happineſs that attends a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life in this World, that little which is material can be added; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might well have ſpared my pains: Only this Tractate may poſſibly fall into the hands of ſome who never ſaw, nor would elſe have ſeen that; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them the reading of the whole.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="appendix">
            <pb facs="tcp:96633:4"/>

               <p>YET ought we not to reſt contented with this degree of love to God, but to labour after that which is more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and paſſionate; elſe how can we ſatisfie our ſelves in a time of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our Obedience to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands proceeds not rather from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Fear, or Self love, than of love to God.</p>

               <p>Indeed we are ſo made, as not much to value that which coſt us no pains; and on the contrary, as Dr. <hi>Cockburn</hi> well obſerves, the Mind of Man is never ſo well pleaſed, as when it uſeth its Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and always takes moſt delight in the things which it ſelf hath wrought. And therefore, as he proceeds, it was, and is wiſely provided, to ſet the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,

I might add, That the labour and exerciſe of the Body doth alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to the Health and Strength, and Well-being of that. For as <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> well ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unſlothfulneſs in Labour, if I may make ſuch a Word, is the means to preſerve health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Not only Bodily Neceſſaries, but the knowledge of the Myſteries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Works of God, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mathematical Speculation, is not to be obtained without Study and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. But by this uſe and exerciſe of our Intellectual Faculties, our Mind and underſtanding is highly advanced and improved to ſuch a degree, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to penetrate and comprehend the moſt abſtruſe and ſubtile Inventions and Notions of Naturaliſts and Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For as Weapons and Utenſils by lying by unoccupied do contract a Scurf or Ruſt, but do <hi>uſu &amp; tractatione ſplende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcere</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:96633:5"/>
become bright by handling and uſe, ſo do our Underſtandings alſo. And though this ſtudy and contention of mind be laborious and painful, yet the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Underſtanding, and acquiſition of Knowledge, and hitting upon uſeful Diſcoveries and Inventions, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly compenſate for that; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fill the Mind with unſpeakable joy and pleaſure. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was ſo overjoyed at the invention of the 49th Propoſition of the Firſt Book of <hi>Euclide</hi>'s <hi>El.</hi> that he ſacrificed a <hi>Hecatombe</hi> to the Gods: And I have read of a Smith, that upon the invention of an Engine to make Water to aſcend by deſcending, which was nothing elſe but <hi>Archimedes</hi> his Screw, and which had been invented, long before, though he knew nothing of it, was ſo overwhelmed with joy, that it broke his Brains, and quite diſtracted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> No wonder then that Vertue which is the moſt excellent of all acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be difficult to attain. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the difficulty and labour of attaining and exerciſing of it, makes it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or rewardable. And therefore though it be in it ſelf an excellent thing, and may be ſaid to be its own reward, yet becauſe it is difficult and uneaſy to Fleſh
<pb facs="tcp:96633:5"/>
and Blood, in this our lapſed and degenerate Eſtate, God is pleaſed for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to propoſe to us an ample reward, no leſs than Eternal Life and Happineſs. He hath promiſed to <hi>give grace and glory, and to with hold no good thing from them who lead a holy life.</hi> And if this be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to quicken our endeavours, and to encourage us to ſtrive, and wreſtle, and run, nothing can; for I am ſure a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this cannot be propoſed, it containing all the good we can deſire, or are indeed capable of enjoying.</p>

What Holineſs is.</head>
               <p>HOlineſs (as I have ſhewn in a former Treatiſe) is a Word of various ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications in Scripture.</p>
               <p>When it is attributed to God, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (as Dr. <hi>Owtram</hi> well <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. <hi>de Sacrific.</hi> Chap. 1.</note> obſerves) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. His tranſcendent Purity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and immutable volition of that which is right and good; which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propoſes to our imitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>As he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> 1 John 3.3 <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> Pſal 145. 17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> His glorious Majeſty, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts it ſelf in all Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, infinite Wiſdom, infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Might, ſovereign Dominion over all things; in reſpect whereof he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all Praiſe and Worſhip. So that Holy is often equivalent to <hi>great, and greatly to be feared, and had in reverence of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96633:11"/>
all that draw nigh to him.</hi> In this ſenſe God is often in Scripture called the <hi>Holy one of Iſrael</hi>; that is, that venerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity who is to be worſhipped by a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and incommunicable Worſhip, and his Name to be invoked with the moſt profound reverence and devotion.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Holineſs</hi> is attributed to other things beſides God, it ſignifies either, 1. A relative or outward Holineſs, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from a <hi>Separation from common and profane uſe, and application to a religious.</hi> God being the Sovereign Lord of all things, and himſelf holy, whatever is in a peculiar manner related to him, and appertains to his Worſhip and Service, whether Perſon or thing, hath a kind of relative Holineſs, and upon account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an eſteem and reſpect is due to it. Or 2. An inherent or inward Holineſs, or <hi>perfect conformity of heart and life to the Law and Will of God.</hi>: Which kind of Holineſs is proper only to Rational Beings.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, If Holineſs be ſuch a perfect conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then no Man ever was, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſhall be holy in this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life. Doth not the Scripture tell us, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>There is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi> Prov. 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I

have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> James 3.2. <hi>In many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all.</hi> 1 John 1.8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And an Heathen Man could ſay, <hi>Nemo invenitur qui ſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit abſolvere; &amp; innocentem quiſ<expan>

               <p>I anſwer, It is true, that perfect and ſinleſs Holineſs is not attainable by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Men in this preſent Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is pleaſed to accept of ſincerity of Obedience inſtead of Perfection; and ſo we may define Holineſs, ſo far as it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this imperfect ſtate, to be a <hi>ſincere and conſtant deſire and endeavour to obey God in all his Commands.</hi> More than this, we cannot perform, and leſs than this God will not accept.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Obedience muſt be univerſal, without reſerve or exception of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Whatſoever we ſhall be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be God's Will, and our Duty, we muſt ſet about it, and do it, be it never ſo uneaſy to Fleſh and Blood: Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ſhall be convinced to be contrary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96633:12"/>
thereto, though never ſo pleaſing, never ſo cuſtomary to us, we muſt reſolutely ſhun and avoid it. God muſt have the whole Heart; he admits no rival; Zeal for one Commandment will not compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the breach of another. We muſt with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>Eſteem all his precepts concerning all things to be right, and hate every falſe way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This deſire and endeavour muſt be ſincere and hearty; we muſt not harbour or entertain any ſecret inclination to any evil way. We muſt withdraw all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Affection from whatever is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or unlawful, or prohibited by God. The love or liking of any ſin, or even wiſhing it were lawful, cannot conſiſt with the love of God, which is the ſpring and ſource of ſincere Obedience. <hi>Quis coram Deo innocens invenitur, qui vellet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri quod vetatur, ſi ſubtrahas quod timetur.

What Happineſs is.</head>
               <p>HAppineſs in general may be defined to be the ſecure and conſtant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and enjoyment of whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, deſirable and delightful; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the abſence of whatever is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive and tormenting.</p>
               <p>It is deſcribed by <hi>Boetius,</hi> to be <hi>Status omnium bonorum aggregatione perfectus:</hi> An Eſtate perfect by the confluence of all good things. And by <hi>Cicero, Secretis malis omnibus cumulate bonorum poſſeſſio:</hi> An accumulated poſſeſſion of good things, all evil things being withdrawn.

                  <hi>Objective</hi> Happineſs is that <hi>Object</hi> or thing which renders us happy.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>g of the Law.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Note upon <hi>John</hi> 14.15. obſerves, that the Notion of loving God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96633:13"/>
but eſpecially in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeems moſt fitly to be taken from one moſt eminent Act and Expreſſion of Love amongſt all Men; that is, doing thoſe things which are moſt grateful and acceptable to the beloved. Now our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of doing things grateful to God, is our performing what he commands; and therefore it is conſequent, that our obedience to the Will or Commands of God, in the higheſt and moſt perfect manner, is ſtiled the loving of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed the prime, if not only way of demonſtrating our love to him, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:</hi> and ver. 23. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my word:</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5. <hi>He that keeps his word, in him is the love of God made perfect,</hi> &amp;c. Another Notion there is of the <hi>love of God, viz,</hi> a deſire of union and near conjunction with him; but this but ſeldom lookt upon in the Scriptures. Thus far Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Love is by ſome Divines diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Appreciative</hi> and <hi>Senſible,</hi> or rather <hi>Paſſionate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appreciative</hi> Love is ſuch an affection, whereby we prize or value any one Object above another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96633:14"/>
                  <hi>Senſible</hi> or <hi>Paſſionate Love</hi> is that which hath a greater influence upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and doth more ſtrongly move and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</p>
               <p>Our Love to God in this ſtate is of the firſt kind, ſuch an affection or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Soul, whereby we prize him above all things; ſo that neither Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor Mother, nor Wife, nor Child, though they may more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and paſſionately affect us, are ſo much eſteemed by us, we can be content to part with them when God pleaſes, and quietly to ſubmit to his Will. No Worldly advantage, much leſs the gratifying any Luſt, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us to break any one of his Commandments.</p>

Of the Diviſion of Happineſs.</head>
               <p>THough the ſupreme and chief Happineſs of Man conſiſts in the knowledge and love of God, yet there are other things which contribute to the completion of it, eſpecially in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe which tend to the making our preſent condition eaſy and comfortable to us; ſuch as <hi>Health, Wealth, Friends, Reputation</hi>: the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as <hi>Sickneſs, Bodily-pain, Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt, Diſgrace, &amp;c.</hi> would render it grievous and unpleaſant. The former of theſe are eagerly purſu'd by a great part of Mankind, as their chief good and happineſs. Could we therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate (and I think it not difficult to do) that Holineſs or obedience to God's Commands, is the moſt effectual means to procure and ſecure theſe outward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments to us, ſo far as there is any good in them; I think we ſhould need no other conſideration to recommend a Holy Life and Converſation to all ſorts and conditions of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96633:15"/>Which that we may do the more clearly and ſatisfactorily, it will be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to make a <hi>diviſion</hi> of Happineſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral ſtates of Man, and his ſeveral parts, and the particular ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, which make up the happineſs of each part, in each ſtate.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I cannot think of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall make uſe of that of Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Happineſs then of Man is either that of this <hi>preſent</hi> Eſtate, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines at Death; or that of a <hi>future</hi> Eſtate, which commences at Death, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Happineſs</hi> of this <hi>preſent</hi> Eſtate may be divided into, 1. <hi>External,</hi> Or, that of the <hi>Outward</hi> Man: Or, 2. <hi>Internal,</hi> Or that of the <hi>Inner</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>External</hi> Happineſs conſiſts principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in, 1. <hi>Health.</hi> 2. <hi>Safety, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Quiet.</hi> 3. <hi>Riches.</hi> 4. <hi>Pleaſures.</hi> 5. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi> 6. <hi>Friends</hi>: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Name I comprehend alſo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relations: As <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> who are uſually called ſo in common Speech; as when we ſay, Such a Man hath good Friends, or his Friends are well to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Internal</hi> Happineſs conſiſts in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96633:15"/>
knowledge and love of God, manifeſted by our obedience to his Commands; the improvement of all our Faculties; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace of Conſcience, Joy and Tranquility of Mind.</p>
               <p>The Happineſs of the <hi>future</hi> Eſtate, is the clear Viſion of God, likeneſs to him, and union with him by perfect love: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> This differs chiefly in degree from the precedent.</p>
               <p>Before I run over theſe Heads in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I ſhall premiſe two things in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That keeping of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is every way for the good, benefit and advantage of the whole world, and Mankind in general. Sin, which is the breach of God's Law, is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and productive cauſe of all the Evils and Miſeries, Troubles and Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are in the world. Did Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obey God's Laws, the whole Earth, which is now for the moſt part an <hi>Akeldama,</hi> or Field of Blood, would be turn'd into a very Paradiſe, into a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Men would then beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks. Men who now are Wolves and Tygers one to another, who bite and devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one another, would then be a protection and defence, and mutual help one to another. <hi>Whence come wars
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96633:16"/>
and fightings among you,</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi>) <hi>come they not hence, even of your luſts, which war in your members?</hi> Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over all the Commandments of God, I might eaſily deduce and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in particular, that each of them conduces to the publick good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Commandments of God are not grievous or uneaſy; his Law is holy, and juſt, and good, his Precepts equal and reaſonable; nay, ſo ſutable and agreeable to the Nature and Reaſon of Man, that I will be bold to ſay, They ought upon their own account to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and obeyed by us, were there no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to reward our Obedience, no Hell to puniſh our Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>This is the foundation of that <hi>Stoical</hi> Doctrine, That <hi>Vertue is its own Reward,</hi> and that Happineſs conſiſts in the very doing of Vertuous Actions: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe Man is ſatisfied with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of well-doing, and will not do any diſhoneſt or wicked thing, to avoid any Suffering or Torment whatſoever. The reaſon is, becauſe God hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Nature an averſation from Vice, and diſlike of it; ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but condemn our ſelves for doing any thing that is diſhoneſt or unjuſt: <hi>Se ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

                  </gap>nocent perſon is abſolved, himſelf being Judge. Nor can any terrour or torment acquit us from blame, if to avoid it we do any vile or diſhoneſt action. But on the contrary, if we reſolutely ſtick to that which is good, whatever we ſuffer for it, we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our own Conſciences, and rejoice in having done ſo, and gain the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and applauſe of all Men. The Evil of Sin is greater, and more to be avoided than the Evil of Pain or Suffering, tho that be a great Evil too; and that man be far from being happy, who labours under extreme Bodily Pain, eſpecially if without hope of deliverance: Such a Man's very Being would be a Burthen to him; it being a true ſaying, <hi>Praeſtat non eſſe quàm miſerum eſſe:</hi> Better not to be, than to be miſerable.</p>
               <p>But our gracious God hath not put us off with ſuch a Reward as this; (which notwithſtanding the Apoſtle ſaith of the Chriſtians of his time, <hi>That if in this life only they had hope, they would be of all men the moſt miſerable:</hi>) but hath promiſed to recompence our Obedience with Eternal Life and Happineſs; and particularly our Sufferings for his Cauſe, and for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake, with a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. And for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96633:17"/>
our encouragement hath permitted us to have a reſpect to this recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Man of God, and others of his Servants mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. had.</p>

Of Health.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HEalth</hi> is a Bleſſing ſo neceſſary to our Well-being in this World, that without it we cannot enjoy any thing elſe, no not our own ſelves: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the common ſalutation among us at every meeting of Neighbour or Friends is this, <hi>How do you?</hi> that is, are you in Health or no? And the Anſwer <hi>Well,</hi> or <hi>Ill</hi>; that is, in health, or not: As if Health were the chief or only good thing worth the enquiring after, in the preſence or enjoyment whereof we could not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable whatever elſe we wanted: Nor in the abſence, happy or well, whatever beſides we poſſeſſed. Indeed there is no taſte or reliſh, no comfort or delight in any worldly good, where health is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore it is by all Men highly valued and purchaſed at the deareſt rate, as Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> well obſerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96633:17"/>
                  <hi>Health</hi> is ſuch a juſt temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all the parts of the Body, both ſolid and fluid, as may inable the ſeveral Members and Faculties duly to perform their natural Functions, from whence proceeds not only an indolency or freedom from Pain and Sickneſs, but alſo vigor and activity, alacrity and light-heartedneſs, a pleaſant and delicious ſympathy in the Soul. To this head I refer freedom from Bodily Pain, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity whereof is altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Happineſs: St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, That he was compelled to conſent to <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> who affirmed Bodily Pain to be the greateſt Evil. Neither (ſaith he) did his Reaſon ſeem to me ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, <hi>viz.</hi> That Man being compounded of two parts, Soul and Body, of which the firſt is the better, the latter the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; the greateſt good muſt be the beſt thing belonging to the better part; that is, Wiſdom: And the greateſt Evil the worſt thing belonging to the worſer part; that is, Pain. Whether this Reaſon be ſolid and concluſive, let others judge; but I fully agree with him in the Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That of all Evils we are ſenſible of in this World, Bodily Pain is the ſoreſt; It drowning, as I may ſo ſay, and taking away the ſenſe of all other Evils, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96633:18"/>
wholly poſſeſſing the Soul. It is ſuch an afflictive and tormenting Paſſion, ſuch a Vultur or Tyger, tearing and gnawing upon the Soul, ſo abhorrent to Humane Nature, that an exceſſive degree of it muſt needs make a Man miſerable and unhappy; unleſs we can reconcile and unite extremes, the greateſt Evil that Man is capable of ſuffering, with the greateſt good he can enjoy. Hence the Torments of Hell are every where in Scripture ſet forth by conſuming Fire, unquenchable Fire, everlaſting Burnings; and Hell it ſelf called a Lake of Fire, a Lake which burns with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; becauſe Fire produceth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bodily Pain; than which nothing is more terrible to Humane Nature, and more likely to affright Men from Sin. On the contrary, St <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> conſidering the abſolute inconſiſtency of Pain and Happineſs, tells us, That in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> there ſhall be no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor any more Pain.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a degree of Bodily Pain, which may be ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not exceeding the meaſure of Man's Patience; and there is a degree which we are not able to bear, which takes up the whole Mind, not ſuffering
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96633:18"/>
it to divert its thoughts one Minute to any other Object.</p>
               <p>Away then with the fooliſh vaunts of the proud <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who boaſt that their Wiſe Man is happy in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull; whom <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt,</hi> 52.</note>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus ſmartly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly checks and confutes, <hi>If Life may be happy in extreme bodily torment, why do they adviſe a man afflicted with the moſt grievous Pains to depart out of it? Why does not their Wiſeman rather conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it, that he may enjoy the happiness of it? Is a happy life to be forſaken and fled from? But if ſuch a Life be really miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what elſe but pride hinders them from confeſſing it to be ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, Did not the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs endure the greateſt Bodily Torments with invincible patience, yea ſome of them with joy and exultation?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 'Tis true indeed they did ſo; but then I ſuppoſe, that as their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Sufferings were extraordinary, ſo they were extraordinarily ſupported under them; and that God (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) did not ſuffer them to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above what he enabled them to bear. It ſeems to me moſt likely, that he did quite take away, or very much mitigate the ſenſe of pain; poſſibly by obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thoſe Nerves which convey that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Brain, which excites ſuch a ſenſe, or how elſe it ſeemed beſt to his Divine Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to prove, that this Bleſſing is the portion of thoſe who lead a godly Life, who keep God's Commandments, and abide in his Love: And that, 1. From the Promiſes of God: 2. From the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſeveral Vertues commanded by him. Such are, 1. Temperance and Sobriety. 2. Labor and Induſtry. 3. A due government and moderation of our Paſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Long Life,</hi> (I put them together, the one for the moſt part being the conſequent of the other) are in Scripture promiſed as rewards to the obedience of the Commandments of God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.25. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord thy God — And I will take away Sickneſs from the midſt of thee.</hi> Deut. 7.15. <hi>And the Lord will take away from thee all Sickneſs, and will put none of the evil Diſeaſes of Egypt (which thou knoweſt) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</hi> Prov. 3.7, 8. <hi>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil: It ſhall be health to thy Navel, and Marrow to thy Bones.</hi> Prov.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96633:19"/>
3.16. It is ſaid of Wiſdom, <hi>That length of days are in her right hand.</hi> Pſal. 34.12. <hi>What man is he that deſireth life, and loveth many days, that he may ſee good?

preſcribing a moderate Diet, not only as a principal means to continue Health, but alſo to cure many Diſeaſes. Hence <hi>Hipocrates</hi> ſaith, 6 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>That a very ſpare and aſcetick Diet conduces much to Health and long Life, may be confirmed by many eminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the firſt <hi>Hermite</hi> (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Life reports) arrived to the Age of 115 Years, an hundred whereof he ſpent in the Wilderneſs, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining himſelf daily the firſt forty with a few Dates, and a draught of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and when Dates failed, with half a Loaf of Bread, which a Raven brought him. St. <hi>Anthony</hi> (as <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> witneſſeth) lived 105 Years, of which he ſpent 90 in the Deſert, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his Body with Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only, to which in his extreme old Age he added a few Sallet Herbs. <hi>Arſenius,</hi> The Emperor <hi>Arcadius</hi> his Tutor, lived 120 Years, fifty five where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpent in the Wilderneſs, in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful abſtinence.

Nobleman, when he had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfully to the 35th Year of his Age, being frequently afflicted with divers Diſeaſes, at laſt by the advice of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Phyſician, he uſed a reſtrained Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, whereby alone he gradually cured them all; by little and little diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quantity of his Meat and Drink, till he deſcended to fourteen Ounces of Meat, reckoning Bread, Fleſh, Eggs, and other Edibles, and ſixteen Ounces of Drink daily; perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in which <hi>Regimen,</hi> he produced his Life healthful, vigorous, and free from Diſeaſes above 100 Years, as himſelf witneſſeth in a Book he put forth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>The benefits and advantages of a ſober Life.</hi> Whence we may collect (ſaith <hi>Riverius</hi>) out of whoſe <hi>Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> I borrowed theſe Inſtances, That a ſpare Diet doth very much conduce, not only to the continuance of Health, but alſo to the curing of contumacious Diſeaſes, and of long continuance. For though Natural Heat having ſuddenly concocted that ſmall quantity of Food taken in, is afterwards employed about the ſuperfluous Humours, digeſting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipating, and by little and little expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them through the ſeveral Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96633:21"/>
of the Body, till at laſt the Body becomes pure and free from the Cauſes and Seeds of all Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Moreover, It is very remarkable, which the ſame <hi>Riverius</hi> adds, That if an exact Diet cannot quite take away ſome chronical and incurable Diſeaſes, yet doth it much alleviate them, and render them more tolerable, ſo that the Sick perſons may live a long time under them. So we ſee not a fewdaily, who produce their Lives many Years under an Ulcer of the Lungs, a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> of the Liver or Spleen, a Stone in the Reins or Bladder. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Problems witneſſeth, That there was a certain Philoſopher in his time, named <hi>Herodicus,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ough he laboured under a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet by a ſtrict obſervation of Diet, attained to 100 Years.</p>
               <p>The Benefits of Temperance will beſt appear from the Miſchiefs and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies the contrary Vices of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Exceſs bring upon us; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to the impairing and ruining of our Health, which is a natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof. For the Stomach by immoderate repletion being overcharged or clog'd, with more than it can digeſt, muſt needs ſlubber over its work, as a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96633:21"/>
Mill that is fed too faſt, and inſtead of a well concocted and benign Chyle, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the other Veſſels a Crude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Juice, full of many heterogeneous and noxious Particles or Qualities, that breed an univerſal Diſtemper and Diſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Body, and lay the foundation of many future diſeaſes; an error in the firſt concoction (as the old Phyſicians well obſerve) being ſeldom or never correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſubſequent.</p>
               <p>That moſt diſeaſes owe their original to exceſs in eating and drinking, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that they are cured by blood-letting, purging, vomiting, ſweating, and other Evacuations, whereby the abundance of ſuperfluous Humours is exhauſted. It is a Proverbial Saying, <hi>Plures occidit gula quàm gladius: The Throat hath ſlain more than the Sword.</hi> Rioting and drunkenneſs offer ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Nature, do ſo inflame the Blood, the vehicle of Life, waſte and diſſipate the Spirits, that Men guilty of them ſeldom live out half their days: Inſomuch that (as Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> well obſerves) no Man of ordinary prudence, who is to take a Leaſe for Lives, will be content (if he can well avoid it) to chooſe one whom he knows to be vicious and intemperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96633:22"/>It may be objected, that ſome who daily exceed all bounds in eating and drinking, feeding themſelves (as the Apoſtle ſaith) without fear, do yet live to an extreme old Age.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That there are but very few of theſe, and thoſe of exceeding firm ſtrength of Parts and temperament of Body; who yet if they lived tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, might hold out much longer, and would be more fit for all the Actions of the Mind and Underſtanding: For (ſaith <hi>Riverius</hi>) Thoſe who live intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt needs be fill'd with many noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humours, and often troubled with Sickneſs; neither can they, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their Health, be long intent on the difficult Functions of the Mind; both becauſe in them the whole force of Nature, and of the Spirits is ſpent in the concoction of Meats; from which, if by any contention of mind, they be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrawn, concoction will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and many crudities enſue; and alſo becauſe they have need of frequent Bodily Exerciſe to diſſipate, or Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to purge out their ill Humours they daily accumulate. So that though ſuch men ſeem to live long in the Body, yet in effect they live but little to their mind,

and to thoſe ends for which Life was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; being but a little while fit for the Functions of the Soul, the greateſt part of their time being neceſſarily beſtowed on the Service of the Body.</p>
               <p>And yet even in theſe the Body is not made of Steel or Adamant, the ſtrength of their Natural Temper cannot always reſiſt and hold out againſt the rude ſhocks and batteries of ſo many exceſſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, but muſt needs by degrees be weakened and impaired, and at laſt utterly marred and ſubverted.</p>
               <p>I might add further in commendation of this Grace of Temperance, that it conduces much to the preſervation of the External form and comlineſs of the Body, an Endowment highly valued by all men: Whereas on the contrary, Vicious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but eſpecially Intemperance, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the inward pulchritude of the Soul, do change even the outward Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance into an abhorred hue; as I have elſewhere noted out of Dr. <hi>Moor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould now diſmiſs this Particular, did not the great prevalency of this Vice of Intemperance, eſpecially in drinking invite me to ſuperadd ſomething further of the pernicious effects and conſequents of it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96633:23"/>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then this Vice hath a very ill influence upon the Spirit and Soul of Man, degrading it, and ſubjecting it to the Body. The generality of Heathen Philoſophers (as Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> obſerves) agree in this, That Sin is the Natural Cauſe of debaſing the Soul, immerſing it into a ſtate of ſenſuality and darkneſs, deriving ſuch an impotency and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the mind, as the moſt loathſome Diſeaſes do upon the Body. I ſhall add, but eſpecially Intemperance, which clouds the Underſtanding, diſabling it to any Studies of ſublime and ſubtile Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; the groſs fumes of ſtrong and inebriating Liquors, having a like effect upon the Underſtanding, as thick Foggs and Miſts upon our bodily Eyes, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing them from ſeeing things at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or diſcerning clearly Objects that are near. Neither doth it only darken the Underſtanding, but mightily weaken the Memory, dulling alſo and impairing all the Parts and Faculties of the Soul; depreſſing and faſtning down to the earth that Particle of the divine Breath: <q>Atque affigit humi Divinoe particulam aurae:</q> Stupifying and infatuating the Man by degrees, till at laſt there be little left of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96633:23"/>
him but the outward ſhape, and that too very much marred and deformed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Sin not only ſows the Seeds of future Diſeaſes, but very often is the occaſion of many preſent Quarrels, and Fightings, and Wounds, and even Death it ſelf. Prov. 23.19. <hi>Who hath wo? Who hath ſorrow? Who hath conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? who hath bablings? Who hath wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſs of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine.</hi> Nothing more frequent than quarrelling and brawling at drinking Meetings, and ſometimes challenging and duelling. Some alſo we now and then hear of, who being in Drink, by Falls from Horſes, or other Caſualties, have ruined or deſtroyed themſelves; and alas, in what condition muſt ſuch men die!</p>
               <p n="3">3. It occaſions an unaccountable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time, which by all Wiſe Men is eſteemed a moſt precious and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jewel; <hi>Cujus unius</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>honeſta eſt avaritia; which alone may honeſty be coveted.</hi> Sometimes whole After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons and Nights being ſpent in drinking bouts, and as much time more before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96633:24"/>
they can get clear of the evil effects of them. Time was not given us to waſte in the ſervice of our Luſts, but to beſtow on the duties of God's Worſhip, or ſome honeſt Calling, whereby in our Places and Stations we may be ſerviceable to our Generations, and do good in the World: No Man need want Employment, and yet if he did, he were <hi>better be idle, than not well occupied,</hi> as the Proverb is. He that hath no bodily Labor or Exerciſe to buſy himſelf in, may find Work enough in cultivating his mind, in advancing and improving his Faculties, in ſearching out the Myſteries of Nature, and Works of God; whereby he may be induced to glorifie his Creator, to admire and celebrate his infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, and may probably hit upon ſomething, which may be of publick uſe and benefit.</p>
               <p>When at the great day of account, the Supreme Judge of all Men ſhall demand of us, How we ſpent ſuch an Afternoon, or ſuch a Night, Think we, that we ſhall have the confidence to anſwer him, in drinking, or vain talking; or rather that we ſhall not ſtand mute, being aſhamed to confeſs how we ſpent them; or that he would be ſatisfied with ſuch an account
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96633:24"/>
ſhould it be given him? Let us then be careful ſo to husband and manage, ſo to expend and improve our time, that we may have a good account to make thereof at that day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Intemperance is a chargeable and expenſive Vice, unaccountably waſting the outward Eſtate. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20, 21. <hi>Be not among wine bibbers, among riotous eaters of fleſh: For the drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty. Deer it egentibus Aes laquei pretium:</hi> They ſhall not have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough to buy them a Halter. No Vice hath conſumed ſo many Eſtates, and reduced ſo many of the meaner ſort to poverty as this; which being ſo, men given to it would do well to conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, how unſupportable Poverty and Neceſſity will be to them who have lived plentifully; eſpecially ſeeing inſtead of being pitied and relieved, they are like to be reproach'd and ſcorn'd by others. If <hi>Poverty makes all men ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> as the Poet ſaith, much more then thoſe who have brought it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their own default. Men who by riotous courſes waſte Eſtates left them by their Anceſtors, I look upon as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their Poſterity; ſuch Eſtates being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96633:25"/>
not acquired by their induſtry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not theirs to diſpoſe of, or make away, but only to uſe for term of Life, according to the intention of their Progenitors, by whom they were raiſed and left them. However, all are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God for the expence of their Eſtates; <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, <hi>Tam expenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quàm acceptorum rationem eſſe redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>: We muſt give an account as well of what we ſpend, as of what we receive or get.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Intemperance is a Vice contrary to Charity and Juſtice, diſabling us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Poor, or contribute to any good Work. Can we think that he hath the leaſt ſpark of Charity, or indeed common Humanity in him, who will ſpoil and deſtroy that, which would ſerve to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintain the indigent and neceſſitous; who will rather miſchief himſelf, than benefit others; who will rather abuſe and ruine his own Body, than refreſh the fainting Spirits of his Brethren. Surely God intended that all that are born into the World, ſhould have a portion in the World, not that one ſhould devour and waſte more than is fit, and another ſtarve for want of Suſtenance. All came alike naked into the World, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96633:25"/>
if Providence hath divided to thee more than to another, it hath made thee but a Steward to diſpenſe thy Eſtate among others; which if thou be a good Man, poſſibly thou mayeſt do more to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge, than they would do themſelves, were they owners of it, or were it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided among them. And this thou art to look upon as the main reaſon why God hath given to thee more than to them. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Withhold not good from him to whom it is due</hi>; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief a debt to the indigent; but to diſcharge debts is a piece of Juſtice, and not of Charity.</p>
               <p>But if he be unjuſt who relieves not the poor, though nothing related to him, what ſhall we call them of the poorer ſort, who ſpend that at the Alehouſes, which ſhould ſerve to maintain their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies? who have Wives and Children at home that want Neceſſaries, and they conſume upon their Luſts what ſhould ſupport them; theſe Men are ſomething more than unjuſt, barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. We find them in the black Liſt of thoſe whom the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>are given up to a reprobate mind</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>

                  <hi>6ly.</hi> I might add, That this Vice is injurious to poſterity, entailing Diſeaſes upon them: Children do very often inherit the Diſtempers and Infirmities of their Parents, as well as the Shape and Lineaments of their Bodies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let men, as they love their Children, and tender their eaſe and well-being in this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld, have a care leſt by their debauches and exceſſes they contract diſeaſes and ill habits of body on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and derive them to their Iſſue; which if of the more painful ſort, as Gout or Stone, may give their Children (I will not ſay juſt) cauſe to curſe the day wherein they were born, and the Parents which begat and brought them forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This Vice blaſts a Man's Reputation, Honour and Eſteem in the World. As Vertue is honourable in the ſight of all Men, there being ſcarce any Nation ſo ſalvage and barbarous, but pays ſome reſpect and veneration to it: So is Vice reproachful and vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deſpicable; and among other Vices, eſpecially Drunkenneſs, which makes a man a laughing-ſtock, a ſcorn and deriſion to the very vulgar, nay, to his own
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96633:26"/>
Companions; none being more apt to deride him than they: It turns Reaſon out of doors, and transforms a Man into a Beaſt, or ſomething worſe.</p>
               <p>Here ſome may poſſibly demand, What meaſures of eating and drinking are we to obſerve? I anſwer, What are moſt agreeable to the ends of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thoſe are the ſupport of our Bodies, and preſerving them in the moſt perfect ſtate of Health. I need give no more ſevere Rules than Phyſicians preſcribe, and therefore I ſhall borrow two or three out of <hi>Riverius</hi> his Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. If you ordinarily take ſo much Meat and Drink, that afterward you feel a certain <hi>Torpor,</hi> heavineſs and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of body, when as before you were active, brisk, and cheerful, it is a ſign that you have exceeded the conveni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> meaſure of eating; and the quantity of Food is ſo long to be diminiſhed, till the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96633:27"/>
foreſaid inconveniencies appear no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If after Meat you find your ſelf unfit for Study, Meditation, Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Functions as well of the Mind, as of the Body, it is clear that you exceed the juſt meaſures of eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rules are to be obſerved chiefly by Scholars and Gentlemen, who are not exerciſed in continual bodily Labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Moderate Labour and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe conduces much to the maintenance and preſervation of Health, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>endring it more thin and fluid, leſs apt to ſtagnate or coagulate, and more eaſy to paſs the capillary extremes of the Veins and Arteries, and ſo to irrigate and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all the Muſeles and Members of the Body; by which means the Body becomes more robuſt, leſs obnoxious to external Injuries, and fit for any Action.</p>
               <p>Moreover, keeping the Blood in a due temper and degree of heat, it inables it by inſenſible perſpiration, to caſt off any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96633:27"/>
noxious Particles, which might ſpoil its <hi>craſis,</hi> and put it into irregular motions, and breed divers diſeaſes: Want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration being the cauſe of almoſt all diſeaſes. But of labor and diligence in our Callings, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak further under another Head.</p>
               <p>I might add ſomething concerning reſt or ſleep, the moderation whereof hath ſome influence upon bodily Health; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it leſs prejudicial to Wealth than to Health, bringing want and poverty upon thoſe that give themſelves up to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Love not ſleep, leſt thou come to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Open thine eyes, and thou ſhalt be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with bread.</hi> Prov. 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleep?

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Third thing requiſite to the preſervation and continuance of Health, is a due government and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Paſſions, the exceſs of which hath great force in altering the temper of the Body, and in bringing on grievous diſeaſes, and ſometimes death it ſelf. I ſhall inſtance in three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Anger,</hi> which if not ſuppreſt at firſt, but ſuffered to kindle in the Breaſt, breaks out ſuddainly into a violent flame, bearing down all before it, dethrones Reaſon, and turns the man into a Pherene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: <hi>Ira ſuror brevis eſt:</hi> Anger is a ſhort Madneſs; and if it be indulged to, and becomes unbridled, it may by the violent commotion of the Spirits, ſo alter and pervert the very <hi>craſis</hi> and temper of the Brain, as to introduce a laſting and perpectual one.

                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96633:29"/>As for <hi>Fear,</hi> if of Poverty or Want, we have God's Promiſe for our ſecurity, That proviſion ſhall be made for us of all thing neceſſary: Our Saviour tells us, <hi>That if we ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> theſe outward things <hi>ſhall be added to us.</hi> Death we need not fear, as being to the godly but a paſſage into a better Life; and conſequently are forbidden by our Saviour, to fear men, the worſt they can do to us being to kill the body.</p>

Now who can be ſo barbarous and inhumane as to injure them that truly love him, and ſeek his good? Moreover the Scripture tells us, <hi>That when a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16.7. And the Apoſtle puts the queſtion. <hi>Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> 1 Pet. 3.13. As for Contentions and Law-ſuits, another Apoſtle adviſeth us rather to ſuffer wrong than moleſt our ſelves and brethren with them. And for care and anxiety about worldly things, which is indeed a very tormenting Paſſion, we are forbidden it often in Scripture: And our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produceth many Arguments or Conſiderations to arm us againſt it.</p>

Of Riches.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, RIches</hi> are eſteemed a great ingredient of our happineſs and well-being in this world; though ſome are of opinion, that they contribute nothing thereto, but that a mean eſtate is the beſt; and therefore <hi>Agur</hi> prays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches.</hi> And the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.11. Saith of Riches, <hi>What good is there to the owners thereof, ſave the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> And the Heathen Poet <hi>Horace,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If we are well provided with Food and Clothing, what more can Kingly Riches add to us? And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. adviſeth us, <hi>That having food and raiment, we ſhould therewith be content</hi>; becauſe <hi>they that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare, and many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition.</hi> It is clear that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96633:31"/>
Riches do expoſe to the temptations of Pride and Luxury, and the ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, If Riches have ſuch an ill influence upon Mens Manners, why then are they propoſed in Scripture as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to vertuous actions? why are they made the effects and fruits of God's Bleſſing?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Riches if well uſed, and it is our own fault if we uſe them not well, are real Bleſſings, enabling us to do much good in the World; to be rich in good Works, to relieve the Neceſſities of others, to feed the Hungry, to cloth the Naked, to redeem Priſoners and Captives, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Oppreſſed, to miniſter to the Sick convenient Diet and Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And our Saviour tells us, That <hi>it is a more bleſſed thing to give, than to receive</hi>; and conſequently to have whereof to give.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now proceed to ſhew, That Riches are a Bleſſing promiſed to our Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and likewiſe a natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and effect of it, and in the firſt place to explain what is meant by <hi>Riches</hi>; but I find this ſo well done to my hand by <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Word <hi>Riches</hi> is capable of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſenſe.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. In the more <hi>abſolute</hi> ſenſe it may be defined to conſiſt in ſuch a meaſure of Eſtate, as may be ſufficient to ſerve a Man's occaſions and conveniencies; when his Poſſeſſions are ſo proportioned as fully to anſwer all the neceſſities of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afford him a comfortable ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence according to his Quality, and the ſtation wherein he is placed. In which ſenſe men of all ranks and degrees are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being rich. A Husbandman or an ordinary Tradeſman may as truly be ſtiled a Rich Man, as a Gentleman, a Lord, or a King. Though perhaps what theſe can very well afford to fling away upon their Diverſions be more than all the Eſtate and Poſſeſſions that the other can pretend to.</p>
               <p>And upon this ground all men grant, that a man may be as truly liberal in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Penny, or but a poor Mite, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in giving an Hundred Pounds; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things are to be meaſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96633:32"/>
to the different conditions of the givers, or proportion of their Eſtates: And a Man may as well be rich with a little, as liberal with a little.</p>
               <p>Now though this be the true notion of <hi>Riches,</hi> yet in the opinion of Moraliſts and Philoſophers is it not enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate a man rich; but there is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required an acquieſcence of Mind, contentment or ſatisfaction with ſuch a ſufficiency: <hi>Dives eſt non qui plus habet, ſed qui nihil cupit:</hi> He is not rich who hath much, but who covets no more. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, That the true nature of Riches doth conſiſt in the contented uſe and enjoyment of the things that we have, rather than in the poſſeſſion of them. Thoſe that out of penuriouſneſs can ſcarce afford themſelves the ordinary Conveniencies of Life, out of their large Poſſeſſions, have been always accounted poor: Such men may be truly ſaid to want thoſe things they have, becauſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by uſeleſs, it is all one as if they had them not.</p>
               <p>Moreover, That Man who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what is in it ſelf ſufficient for his condition, is not rich, nor ever will be ſo; becauſe there can be no other real limits to his deſires, but that of ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whatever is beyond this being boundleſs.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96633:33"/>
leſs and infinite. And though men may pleaſe themſelves with an Imagination, that if they had but ſuch an addition to their Eſtates, they ſhould then think they had enough, yet that is but a meer imagination, there being no real cauſe why they ſhould be more ſatisfied then than they are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly. Riches</hi> may be taken in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſenſe, and ſo they may be deſcribed to conſiſt in having large <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> when a man's Eſtate and Revenue is of ſuch a proportion as is commonly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great; whether with relation to the generality of other men; and ſo only thoſe at the upper end of the world are capable of being counted rich; or elſe with reſpect to others of the ſame rank and order; and ſo all ſuch are accounted <hi>rich,</hi> who do in their Poſſeſſions exceed the common ſort of thoſe that are of the ſame rank with them; this kind of Wealth conſiſting properly in compariſon; there being not any one determinate ſum or proportion of revenue to which the name of Riches may be appropriated, but that it may be as much below the occaſions of ſome perſons, as it is above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of others, who yet live plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:96633:34"/>Thoſe that are rich in this <hi>comparative</hi> ſenſe, may rather be ſtiled Proprietors of great Poſſeſſions, than truly Rich; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though ſuch Poſſeſſions be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great, yet they may not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to free the owner of them from want and poverty, whether in reſpect to his real or imaginary occaſions for more: And that is not Riches which cannot free a Man from being poor; and want of Neceſſaries is as truly Poverty in him that hath much, as in him that hath but little. He that in any one Condition of Life, hath enough to anſwer his Conveniencies, ſuch a Man is more truly rich than he whoſe Revenue is a thouſand times greater, if it be not equal either to his Occaſions or his Mind. <hi>Riches</hi> in this <hi>ſecond comparative</hi> ſenſe are no where promiſed to our obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, or to any particular Grace and Vertue; nor are they the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effects and conſequents of ſuch Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as if he that were godly, ſhould be thereby advanced to the greateſt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions that any man elſe doth enjoy; but only that Religion will be a means to ſupply him with ſuch a ſufficiency as may denominate him rich, and free him from ſuch neceſſities, whether real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as others of his rank are liable to.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96633:35"/>1. <hi>Riches</hi> are propoſed in Scripture as a Reward or Bleſſing to them that fear God, and keep his Commandments. It is ſaid of Wiſdom, that is the fear of God, which in ſeveral places of Scripture is ſaid to be the beginning of Wiſdom, or the chief Wiſdom; nay, Wiſdom it ſelf, Job 28.28. <hi>And unto man he ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to depart from euil is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Prov. 3.16. <hi>That length of days are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour,</hi> &amp;c. c. 8.18. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and honour are with me; yea, durable riches, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>That I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſures.</hi> Pſal. 34 9. <hi>They that fear the Lord, there is no want to them.</hi> Levit 26.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God promiſes to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if they will walk in his Statutes, and keep his Commandments, a confluence of all worldly Bleſſings; and the like in <hi>Deut</hi> 28. The Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>That Godlineſs hath the promiſes as well of this life, as of that which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The fear of God, and the practice of ſeveral Vertues commanded by him, are the moſt effectual means to gain and increaſe Riches: As 1 <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96633:35"/>
in our Callings, <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> Prov. 10.4. <hi>No gains without pains. Man is born to labor, as the ſparks fly upward.</hi> God hath not ſent us into the world like <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> to take our paſtime here, but to bear our part of the Burthens of Mankind. Tho' a Man be born to an Eſtate ſufficient to maintain him without Labor, yet I look upon him as unjuſt, if he lives upon the Sweat of other Mens Brows, and is not ſome way or other ſo helpful and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to them, as to compenſate for his Food and Raiment: Every man that hath Riches is accountable to God for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of them; being, as I ſaid before, but a Steward to him who is the ſupreme Proprietour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> in our Dealings: It is commonly ſaid, That <hi>honeſty is the beſt Policy</hi>; and ſo in this particular we find it in experience to be; thoſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having the greateſt cuſtom, and quickeſt returns, who are noted for their juſt and honeſt Dealings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety:</hi> Theſe conduce as well to the encreaſing of our Eſtates, as the health of our Bodies, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all ſuperfluous Expences in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our Senſual Appetites and Deſires: Whereas the contrary Vices of Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96633:36"/>
and Luxury, to which we may add Idleneſs, Prodigality, Pride, are known waſters of Eſtates, often <hi>bringing men to a morſel of bread, and clothing them with rags,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>But beſides the having a ſufficiency of all things neceſſary and convenient in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our rank and order in this world; to denominate us truly rich, as I ſaid before, there is required contentment and ſatisfaction of mind with ſuch a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and a free uſe of the things we have, which is attainable only by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that teaches and enables us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our Eſtates, and to live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably without ſuch things as others know not how to want, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> The ability of being content with a little, may much more truly be called riches, than the having of much without being ſatisfied therewith: As it is better to be in health with a moderate Appetite, than to be continually eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſeaſe of a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [voracious Appetite] or a Dropſy: And in this ſenſe <hi>a little that the righteous hath is better than great riches of the ungodly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the fear of God, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe Vertues he commands us,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96633:36"/>
is a real means of procuring and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſufficiency of worldly Goods, and contentment therewith, we find confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by experience: Let any man imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſider, what kind of perſons thoſe are, among the generality of Men, who in their ſeveral degrees and orders are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted moſt able, and moſt wealthy; and it will appear that they are ſuch as are moſt diligent in their Callings, moſt juſt and honeſt in their dealings, moſt regular and ſober in their Converſations, moſt liberal towards any good Work: Upon which account it is that ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where men have the opportunity of being inſtructed in, and excited to the Duties of Religion, do thereupon thrive and flouriſh moſt; it being one property of Religion to civilize men, and make them more inquiſitive in Learning, and more diligent in practiſing their ſeveral Profeſſions. And as for contentment of Mind, it is not to be obtained but upon the account of Religion, Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Such men need not fear future want, becauſe they have God's Promiſe for their ſecurity: Let them but do good, and put their truſt in him, and verily they ſhall be fed. They are alſo to conſider, that great riches cannot make them more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96633:37"/>
than they are, but rather expoſe them to Temptations.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, 1. That there are ſome kinds of Vertues which ſeem to have a contrary tendency, as Charity to thoſe that want, Bounty and Liberality to any good Work. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
               <p>That theſe Acts may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Riches in the moſt proper Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as it denotes a ſufficiency for our Occaſions; the ability of contributing in ſome proportion towards any worthy and charitable Work; being in the eſteem of every good man one of thoſe occaſions and conveniencies required to ſuch a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and cannot any more be a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, than it would be for a man to lay up ſome part of his Eſtate in the ſafeſt place, to lend it out upon the beſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to part with it for the purchaſe of the ſame favour and aſſiſtance from others in the like exigencies; to lay it out upon his pleaſure, with reſpect to that inward comfort and ſatisfaction which doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Conſcience of doing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy things. And beſides all this, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will aſſure us, that there is a ſecret Bleſſing, which doth for the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſuch Actions; ſo that men grow

Of Pleaſure.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Proceed to <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which is either Bodily or Spiritual, Senſual, or Intellectual. But firſt I ſhall endeavour to explain what is meant by this Word Pleaſure, what is the true ſenſe and notion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is that agreeable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Senſe that is excited in the Soul, either by an impreſſion or motion made upon the outward Organs or Senſation, by any ſuitable Object, and cenveyed by the Nerves to the Brain; or elſe by internal conſideration and reflection upon any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Action by the Underſtanding. Thoſe are called pleaſant Taſtes or Smells which are apt to cauſe ſuch a gentle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nerves belonging to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of thoſe Senſes, the Tongue and Noſe; as is naturally deſtined to excite a grateful and delicious ſenſe in the Soul:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96633:41"/>
Thoſe delectable Sights, which in like manner affect our Eyes, as curious Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures and Statues, artificial Engines, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and regular motions: Thoſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sounds which have a charming influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our Ears, as Muſick and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The Touch or Feeling is gratified and delighted by various motions of thoſe Nerves which do not miniſter to the other Senſes.</p>
               <p>To the Senſes of Touch and Taſte, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain thoſe Pleaſures, which by the wiſe Providence of God are annexed to the ſatisfaction of our Natural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
               <p>Theſe Appetites implanted in us, and all Animals, are to thoſe Things or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſerve either to the ſupport and preſervation of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> or each particular <hi>Animal</hi>; or to the propagation of the <hi>Kind.</hi> Thoſe which ſerve to the ſupport and preſervation of the <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> are the Appetites of Meat and Drink, or the Actions of Eating and Drinking: To which the Divine Providence hath not only premiſed a painful Senſe of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be a Monitor to us when we have need of Meat and Drink, and compel us to the uſe of them; but hath alſo annexed Pleaſure to the very Actions of Eating and Drinking, which otherwiſe would
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96633:41"/>
have been no very grateful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>This Pleaſure of eating and drinking abides no longer than till the Neceſſities of Nature are ſatisfied, and ſo far Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth allow of it. When our Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt are well appeaſed, all that follows is but a faint kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if it be not rather to be ſtiled Sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or Glutting: Yet doth not the uſe of Meats and Drinks conſiſt in an indiviſible point; there is a more moderate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained uſe of them: When we keep within the bounds of our Appetites, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it, not feeding to ſatiety, nor of the moſt delicate Viands. This ought to be our daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and there is a more free and liberal uſe of them in <hi>feaſting,</hi> which is alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us upon occaſions of Joy; and on Days of Thankſgiving; as Marriages, Chriſtenings, Victory over Publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Commemorations of great Mercies to Mankind in general, our own Nation, or our ſelves in particular: Such are the Feſtivals of our Saviour's Nativity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Aſcenſion, Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour himſelf was pleaſed to honour a Marriage-feaſt with his preſence: And he accepted of a great Feaſt from <hi>Matthew</hi> at his calling,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96633:42"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 5.25. But to ſpeak in general, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God giveth us all things richly to enjoy.</hi> And the Wiſeman, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh under the Sun, all the days of his life, which God giveth him; for it is his portion</hi>: And in the next Verſe he ſaith, <hi>It is the gift of God.</hi> The ſame we have, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.13. So we ſee God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us a free uſe, and cheerful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe outward Bleſſings. We are to ſerve God with joyfulneſs and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, for the abundance of all things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. God doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit us the uſe and participation of theſe or any other ſenſible Pleaſures, that are agreeable to Reaſon, or our true Intereſts; but only our Miſtakes and Exceſſes, in and about them (as the Biſhop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſpeaks) teaching us ſo to regulate our ſelves in the uſe of them, that they may truly deſerve the name of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Appetites and Actions which tend to the propagation and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the <hi>Species</hi> and the Pleaſures that attend them, God hath not denied us a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96633:42"/>Now the moſt ſincere Pleaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſuch a moderate, regular, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, well circumſtantiate uſe; ſuch an enjoyment as may be reflected upon without horror, fear of puniſhment, or conſciouſneſs of guilt, which attends the exceſſive, irregular, unſeaſonable uſe, or rather, the abuſe of them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the thought and memory of them very bitter and grievous: But of this particular I have written in a former <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World.</hi> pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>90.</note> Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, That our Saviour in the Goſpel hath abridged us of ſome Pleaſures of this kind, which are not in themſelves ſinful or unlawful, as having been permitted by God to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and practiſed by the Ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and other men eminent for Piety, without reproof, I mean, the uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wives.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That granting <hi>Poligamy</hi> not to be in its ſelf unlawful, or to have any natural turpitude in it; yet is our Saviour's Prohibition grounded up on good Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God at the firſt created Mankind Male and Female; that is, one Female only, as well as one Male; and in effect he doth ſo ſtill; there being as many, nay more Males than Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males born into the World: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96633:43"/>
it is unreaſonable that ſome men ſhould have many Wives, becauſe they cannot have them unleſs others lack.</p>
               <p>That there are more Males than Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males born, appears, by the Catalogues in all places, where accounts have been taken of the number of each Sex: And I doubt not but the caſe is the ſame in all places where ſuch accounts have not been taken.</p>
               <p>It may here be asked why theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites are ſo vehement and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, To ſecure the great end of continuing the Species, and carrying on the World: For had they been weak and languid, it might have come to paſs that through inadvertency, or to avoid the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trouble of bringing up Children, and maintaining of Families, the greateſt part of men might have abſtained from ſuch Actions, and ſo the Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by degrees have been extinct, and the World diſpeopled.</p>
               <p>That theſe Appetites are ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and irregular, and not without great difficulty to be moderated and ruled, or kept within bounds, as an effect of the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtacy of Man: That God permits them ſo to continue, one cauſe may be, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y may be matter wherein to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96633:43"/>
Vertue: For were theſe vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and inordinate Appetites tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away, were men left in abſolute indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency to Good and Evil, there could be no ſuch thing as Vertue and Vice, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing praiſe, or blame-worthy, no place for Rewards or Puniſhments. For the exerciſe of Vertue conſiſts in reſiſting, and ſtriving againſt viciuos Appetites, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing Paſſions, and mortifying of Luſts; and thoſe that labour herein, are Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons. Thoſe that are ſlothful, that lay the Reins upon the Necks of their Luſts, and follow whither they lead and hurry them away, are vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Are not theſe Exerciſes painful and repugnant to our Natural Appetites and Inclinations, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contrary to Pleaſure? Is not the ſubduing of Luſts compared to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of Members, which cannot be done without pain?</p>

inite modo bonis auſpiciis, ipſiſque Diis bene juvantibus,</hi> &amp;c. The way to Vertue is not (as ſome have written) ſteep and rough, but plain and level. Let me become to you the Author of a new, and not frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing. The way to a Happy Life is eaſy, do but enter upon it with God's help: It is much more difficult to do what the [wicked men] do. What is more facile than calmneſs and quiet of mind? What more laborious than anger? What more remiſs and void of trouble than Clemency? What more buſy and toilſome than Cruelty? Chaſtity is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and at eaſe: Luſt is always occupied and unquiet. He that tells Lies is hard put to it to maintain and make them good: and yet for all his ſhifts, is often detected, and put to ſhame: Whereas he that ſpeaks truth is void of all fear and trouble. The like may be ſaid of other Vertues and Vices compared together: So that Vertue is in it ſelf more agreeable to Reaſon, and more eaſy and eligible than Vice; and it proceeds from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and corruption of our Natures, that we do not chuſe it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Beſides, In all Pleaſures we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the ſubſequent pain and ſorrow do not outweigh the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; which if it do, the voluptua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96633:45"/>
Philoſophers themſelves adviſe to abſtain from them. Now the Pleaſures of ſin, (as the Scripture calls them) as Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Impurity do often bring upon the committers of them Pain and Sickneſs, and ſometimes noiſome Diſeaſes in this Life, but, to be ſure, Eternal Miſery and diſtreſs in the world to come: Between which, and a ſhort and tranſient Pleaſure, there is no proportion. I might add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Judgment of <hi>Seneca,</hi> concerning the filthineſs and unmanlineſs of theſe Vices of Intemperance and Luſt: <hi>Nulli</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>turpiùs occupati ſunt</hi>: No men are more ſordidly employed. <hi>Etiam ſi vana gloriae imagine teneantur, ſpeciosè ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Good men hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to give it, by the Command of God, and the excellency of the thing, it being a gift of God; and wicked men though they may deny that outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that is due to good and righteous perſons; yet even theſe cannot but have an inward veneration for Goodneſs and Religion. It is very remarkable, that even the rude and licentious Vulgar at <hi>Rome</hi> had ſuch a reverence of the Perſon of <hi>Cato,</hi> that though ſuch lewdneſs was permitted by the Law in the Feſtival of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96633:48"/>
                  <hi>Flora,</hi> yet ſo long as he was preſent in the Theatre, they could not go on with their obſcene ſports, nor have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to demand thoſe: <hi>Florales joci nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandarum meretricum,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls them. The wicked indeed hate the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, becauſe his life is a reproof to them, and gives them ſome check in their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſes, taking from them their great excuſe of the impoſſibility of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and demonſtrating, that through the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, which is always granted to them who do what in them lies, and pray for it; it is poſſible to obey them to ſuch a degree as will be accepted by God: Wicked men though they hate vertue in the Subject, yet ſimply and abſtractly they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be good; though in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they prefer Vice before Vertue; yet never any arrived to that degree of ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs, as to ſay, it was better than Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: For example; better to be a glutton, and a drunkard than a temperate perſon: to cheat and defraud, than to be juſt and righteous in our dealings: And therefore, though they hate and perſecute men for being religious, yet they diſguiſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their hatred, pretending it to be Hypocriſie, Hereſie, Superſtition, or the like, that they hate them for. Whence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96633:49"/>
it appears, that they are ſelf-condemned perſons. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Fourth Book, <hi>De Beneficiis,</hi> cap. 17. hath much to this purpoſe, <hi>Adeò gratioſa eſt virtus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut inſitum etiam malis ſit probare meliora:</hi> Virtue is ſo gracious, that it is naturally ingrafted even in bad men to approve that which is good. And again, <hi>Nec quiſquam tantum à naturali lege deſcivit &amp; hominem exuit, ut animi cauſâ malus ſit.</hi> Neither hath any man ſo far degenerated from the natural Law, and put off man, as to be wicked for his minds ſake, or only becauſe it is his pleaſure to be ſo. And again, <hi>Maximum hoc habemus à natura meritum, quod virtus in omnium animos lumen ſuum permittit, etiam qui non ſequuntur, illum vident:</hi> Nature hath herein deſerved exceeding well of us, That Vertue ſends its light into all mens minds, even they that do not follow it, yet ſee it.</p>
               <p>Againſt what is generally ſaid, That there is nothing truly honourable but Vertue, it may be objected, that Learning and Knowledge is honourable, and yet it is not always accompanied with Vertue, there being ſome learned men vicious, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> alſo ſuppoſes in that Saying, <hi>Quid prodeſt eſſe peritum &amp; periturum?</hi> I anſwer, That the acquiſition of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96633:49"/>
and Knowledge is by ſomething ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and commendable, <hi>viz.</hi> Labour and Induſtry in a Calling; nay, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it ſelf being that which all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſire, and being ſome participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Divine Perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and being that which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes us from, and advances us above brute Beaſts, and makes us capable of vertue and happineſs, a higher degree of it, exalting our Faculities, enabling us to act in a larger Sphere, and to do more good, muſt be acknowledged to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent quality, and to merit ſome honour and reſpect; and all men generally think ſo, and give it accordingly.</p>
               <p>That it doth ſo, appears further from the contrary, that is, Ignorance and Folly, which is among all men very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, and reproachful; inſomuch, that men abhor nothing more than the imputation of Folly; eſteeming it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſgrace to be accounted Fools, than to be accounted vicious; though indeed wicked men be the greateſt Fools and on the contrary, godly men the only wiſe men.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but wonder, that there ſhould be ſuch an unſatiable thirſt after Honour, implanted in the nature of man: Why men ſhould be ſo jealous of loſing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96633:50"/>
the reputation of any new Invention; ſo troubled and diſturbed at having any of their Obſervations or Diſcoveries, though by themſelves communicated to others, publiſhed without an honourable menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; ſo netled at the diſcovery of any miſtake in their Writings, though but Gramatical; and being upbraided with it, why they ſhould be willing to accept of falſe honour and undue praiſes: Why they ſhould think it a great matter to be praiſed by ignorant perſons, and incompetent Judges for ſuch Abilities and Gifts, as they are not conſcious to themſelves of; Doth praiſe add any thing to them of real good beſides conceit?</p>
               <p>I cannot conceive any other reaſon than what I intimated before, that it might be a powerful ſpur to incite them to the practice and exerciſe of religious and vertuous Actions; If it be objected that men are as jealous of their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in point of Knowledge, as they are in point of Vertue; I anſwer, It is an error, and a fault, and they ought not to be ſo; though for the reaſons before alledged, I deny not Knowledge to be an excellent quality, which enlarges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the Underſtanding, and renders a man capable of greater Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and doing more good than
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96633:50"/>
others of inferior Abilities and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And further, that it is not Vertue alone to which Honour is due; as appears in that we are commanded to honour Parents, Magiſtrates, Miniſters in general, as ſuch, without any reſtriction or exception of thoſe that are vicious. It is enough that they have an Authority derived from God, and a kind of Divine Impreſs and Character upon them, to make them venerable.</p>

of love to deſire and endeavour to pleaſe and gratifie the Party beloved: And therefore he that loves God will labour to pleaſe him, by doing thoſe things that are acceptable to him, and right in his ſight. The Love of God will add Wings to his Soul, and conſtrain him to run the ways of his Commandments, which will no longer ſeem grievous or burthenſome to him, but pleaſant and delightful; yea, eligible, were they propoſed to his chioce in competition with the ſhort and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Pleaſures of Sin.</p>

That great Rule of doing to others as we would they ſhould do to us in like caſe; and the contrary of not doing to others that we would not ſhould be

done to us, are neceſſary conſequences of loving our Neighbour as our ſelves. If we loved him as our ſelves, we would wiſh him as much good, and do him as much good as we do to our ſelves. We would willingly that other Men ſhould do their Duties to us, ſhew us all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be helpful and beneficial to us in all our Wants and Neceſſities; and why? becauſe we love our ſelves. Had we the ſame love to them, it would have the ſame effects. We would do the ſame good to them, that we deſire from them. To inſtance in the particular Commands:</p>
               <p>Children, Subjects and Inferiors would yield to their Parents, Magiſtrates and Superiors, all that Honour, Reverence and Obedience, which themſelves would expect and deſire from their Inferiors, were they in the ſame Relations and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>No Man would willingly have his own Body killed, or wounded, or any way tormented and put to pain; becauſe no Man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, as the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:96633:54"/>Every Man is jealous of the Loyalty of his Wife, and impatient of having his Encloſure invaded, and made common, becauſe he ſets a high value on her Love and Fidelity, and looks upon it as a great diſhonour, as well as an injury done him, to be robbed of it. Think we then he would offer ſuch an abuſe and wrong to his Neighbour, did he love him as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and were as tender of his Reputation as his own.</p>
               <p>Did Men love their Neighbours as themſelves, there would be no need of Locks and Bars to ſecure their Goods from rapine and ſurreptions by Thieves and Robbers, becauſe there would be no ſuch; ſo that every Man might lie down ſecurely, and there would be none to make him afraid: Love is ſo far from invading another's right, that it is liberal and communicative, and willing rather to part with its own.</p>
               <p>The like, if it were needful, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſhewn in the reſt of the Commandments relating to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

Knowledge alone is not ſufficient to make us happy; the lapſed Angels know the Excellencies and Perfections of the Divine Nature, but yet they are never the more happy for that Knowledge, becauſe they have no intereſt in God, nor are like to reap any benefit or advantage by what they know
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96633:61"/>
of him. So in Men here in this World, Vertue and Knowledge may be ſeparated: A knowing Man may be a vicious Man, and conſequently unhappy. Again, Knowledge of the Myſteries of Nature, and the Works of God, though there be in Man an eager thirſt after it, and ſome pleaſure in obtaining it, yet if it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates only in Knowledge, and be directed to no further end, it doth not contribute much to our Happineſs. It is a known ſaying, <hi>Scire tuum vihil eſt niſi te ſcire hee ſciat alter</hi>; and truly I am apt to think there may be ſomething of truth in it. Thoſe Men that exerciſe their Wits in curious Mathematical Speculations, could they be aſſured that their Inventions and Diſcoveries ſhould never come to the knowledge of any Creature but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I doubt whether the pleaſure of the Invention, would in their own eſteem compenſate the labor an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in the World to come the Viſion of God cannot be ſeparated from his Love. Such a knowledge of God will tranſform

Or if I muſt ſuppoſe any Man to be ſo unkind, and ſo unhappy, as to have no love for any body but his own ſelf, let him think what contentment he hath, and how he is pleaſed, if he can arrive any thing near to a quiet enjoyment of his dear ſelf. And ſuch a delightful ſtate may be a ſmall Image of Heaven, where holy Souls will love God with a far greater flame than ever they did (or ſhall then) love themſelves; becauſe he will appear infinitely more lovely, and to bear alſo a far greater love to them, than it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to do to themſelves.</p>

               <p>If any Neighbour ſhews us an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and undeſerved Kindneſs, we are apt to think he is the beſt perſon in the World: And the pooreſt Wretch in the World, if we ſee in him the undoubted ſigns of an hearty love to us, we cannot chuſe but requite it with ſome expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs back again; nay if a Dog, or ſuch a dumb Creature do but fawn upon us, or delight in our Company, and with a great deal of obſervance follow us whereſoever we go, we cannot but be ſo far pleaſed with this inclination towards us, as to make much of it, and to be troubled to ſee any harm befall it, and to love to ſee it play, and be well pleaſed. Judge then what a pleaſure it will be to pious Souls to find themſelves beloved of him, who hath put theſe kind Reſentments into our Natures. To what an height will the ſweet breathings of his Love blow up the Flames of theirs? Into what Extaſies will they fall, when they feel by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruits what an exceeding great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heavenly Father bears to them? It is above our preſent thoughts to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Joy that will then overflow them: But we may conceive a little of it, if we remember, that <hi>God is love,</hi> and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96633:65"/>
that by our Love <hi>he will be in us,</hi> and by his Love we ſhall be in him.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to ſpeak of the love of Saints and Angels: The pleaſure, joy, and delectation that naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily flows from this knowledge and love of God, the Happineſs which the Body ſhall be exalted to, and the eternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe.</p>
               <p>This Eternal Life our Bleſſed Saviour hath brought to light through the Goſpel, and hath promiſed it to all thoſe <hi>who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality,</hi> Rom. 2.7. 1 John 2.25. <hi>And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed, even eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some perchance may ſay, The great diſproportion that is between the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rewards makes this Promiſe of Eternal Life difficult to be believed: For who can think that God ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our poor and imperfect Duties and Services, performed for a very ſhort time, with ſuch an immenſe and eternal weight of Glory and Happineſs?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot conſiſt with God's Juſtice to puniſh any Creature without, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its demerit, yet nothing hinders but that he may be as bountiful as he pleaſes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96633:65"/>
and in his Rewards exceed all the deſerts, and even expectations of his Creatures, an hundred or a thouſand fold.</p>
               <p>Let us then admire the tranſcendent and unmerited goodneſs and love of God, in doing ſuch great things for us, as ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son into the World to take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, to ſuffer Death for our Sins, and to give us the great Promiſe of Eternal Life; and let us endeavour in ſome meaſure to anſwer this Love by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Affections of the moſt ardent Love and Gratitude.</p>
               <p>Let us alſo love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, which we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World to do, conſidering the greatneſs of his Love to us, manifeſted by the great things he hath done and ſuffered for us, <hi>John</hi> 15.9. <hi>As the Father hath loved me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>ſo have I loved you.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 13. he proceeds to ſay, <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
