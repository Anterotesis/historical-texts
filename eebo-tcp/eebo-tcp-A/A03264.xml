            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS VVELBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVED
IN CHRIST,
THE PARISHIONERS
OF SAINT OLAVES IN
Southwarke, IAMES BAMFORD wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
increaſe of Grace and knowledge
of our Lord and Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written in the 33.
of <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> That, if
the people of the land
take a man of their
coaſts, and make him
their watchman, if when he ſeeth
the ſword come vpon the land, he
blow the trumpet, and warne the
people: then he that heareth the
ſound of the trumpet and will not
be warned, if the ſword come and
<pb facs="tcp:881:3"/>
take him away, his bloud ſhall be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his owne head. But if the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſee the ſword come; and blow
not the trumpet, and the people be
not warned, if the ſword come, and
take any perſon from among them,
he is taken away for his iniquity, but
his bloud will I require (ſaith the
Lord) at the watchmans hand. So
you (my beloued) haue choſen
me to be your watchman. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it concerneth me to giue, and
you to take warning of mortall
danger, as we wil be free from bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſſe.
But I haue publickly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
you warning of that bloudy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
which denieth the Peſtilence
to be contagious: maintained, not
onely by the rude multitude, but by
too many of the better ſort; you are
therefore to take warning. That ye
may the rather take heed to the ſiluer
trumpet, which hath ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in your
eares, I haue thought it neceſſary to
<pb facs="tcp:881:3"/>
ſet downe in writing all that I haue
publickly taught, together with
whatſoeuer elſe, I perceiue, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
conference to be appertaining
to that queſtion, that yee may take
time, better to conſider that which
is either miſunderſtood, or not well
remembred, becauſe it was but once
deliuered, and the common ſort are
not acquainted with, and therefore
hardly capeable of Scholaſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.
And yet I endeuoured
to ſpeake as plaine as I could. But
now I haue contriued al in the forme
of a Dialogue, which is a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
maner of teaching; hoping that
now yee will more readily both
perceiue, and receiue the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. I humbly and earneſtly
deſire you (at your leiſure) diligently
to examine the quotations: but
firſt to reade ouer the Dialogue it
ſelfe. If any deſire a more learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I referre them to that worthy
<pb facs="tcp:881:4"/>
Treatiſe written by that reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(the light of our age) Maiſter
<hi>Beza,</hi> and tranſlated by that faithfull
and profitable ſeruant of Chriſt,
Maiſter <hi>Stockwood.</hi> Furthermore, as
I deſire you to reade this Dialogue
with good reſpect: ſo I pray you
do not thinke, that I haue any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to traduce you as maintainers
of errour, and gainſayers of your
teacher. For howſoeuer (indeed) I
was occaſioned by that I ſaw and
heard amongſt our ſelues, to preach
this doctrine, and haue committed
it to writing for your ſpeciall good,
yet knowing that bloudy errour
(which I impugne) to be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained in London, I thought
it conuenient to publiſh this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
in print, for a more generall
good. As for your ſelues, I am ſo far
from traducing you, that I do (with
ioyfull thankes to God the father, in
the name of Ieſus Chriſt) giue you
<pb facs="tcp:881:4"/>
this teſtimony; that notwithſtanding
the iudgement of ſome be not well
informed in this point, yet I haue
much comfort in my Miniſtery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you: for in ſundry things ye
ſhew the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith. Amongſt
the reſt, ye attend the Sacrament of
Baptiſme, from which in moſt places
people runne away moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly;
Ye frequent Friday Lecture
as diligently (euer ſince the Plague
was kindled) as in winter nights:
wheras many in &amp; about Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are
winter hearers, attending the word
when they haue nothing elſe to do:
and ye fill Gods houſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daies
of humiliation, &amp; holy reſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there haue died in our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
from the 7. of May to this day
2640. Wheras before the Plague our
Church was partly filled by ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers,
both on Sondayes &amp; Fridayes. Theſe
things I take knowledge of, as to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
that in this Dialogue I do not
<pb facs="tcp:881:5"/>
taxe you, or any of you, more than
other, ſo, to incourage you to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(&amp; not backward) in your holy
profeſſion, ſeruing God, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Sabboths as religiouſly
hereafter, as ye do now while God is
preſent with you in this his grieuous
viſitation. For it is a good thing (ſaith
one Apoſtle) to loue earneſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in a good thing:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 18.</note> And it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(ſaith another Apoſtle) for you
not to haue taken the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 21</note>
than after ye haue taken it to
forſake it. Therfore (good brethren)
take heed that ye coole not in your
deuotion, becauſe the number of the
buried in our pariſh is fallen (bleſſed
be God) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 305. to 51. in one weeke,
and from 57. to 4. buried in one day.
Shall our loue coole, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods loue
is kindled? God forbid. O remember
that when <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted vp his hands,<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 11. 12.</note>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> preuailed: but when his hands
were heauy <hi>Amalech</hi> preuailed. And
<pb facs="tcp:881:5"/>
when it ſhall pleaſe God to remoue
this heauy iudgement, let vs neuer
forget this viſitation, according to the
doctrine we haue learned out of the
title of the 38.<note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 34. 35. 36. 37. 57.</note> Pſal. Let vs not turne
backe like a deceitfull bow, and let vs
ſin no more, leſt a worſe euill come
vntovs, according to the ſaying of
Chriſt himſelfe to a man deliuered
from a grieuous diſeaſe. Conceiuing
good hope that yee will hide the
words of exhortation in honeſt and
good harts to bring forth fruite with
patience, I commend me to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
my Dialogue to your reading,
and your ſelues to God, and to the
word of his grace, which is able to

moſt trouble moſt men, eſpecially of the

               <p>I am of the ſame mind: for
Lepers might go abroad to ſéeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 12. 13.</note>
but yet in ſuch ſort, as hath bene
ſhewed. And ſo I could wiſh that our

wold reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 10. Lepers, how
they ſtood afar off, &amp; lift vp their voyce,
when they craued helpe of our Sauior:
ſo they would go abroad in ſuch ſort as
authoritie directeth: to wit, out of the
moſt frequented way, and with a rod
in their hand. I ſay with griefe (<hi>muſt
needes</hi>) for if authoritie had regarded
theſe things betimes, when there were
but few infected houſes, they might
haue bene well ſhut vp and prouided
for, till they were cleanſed, either of
their owne, or the common charges.
But what ſay you to thoſe, who are

and that in a throng and heat: whereas
if they humble themſelues vnder Gods

ſo long from the Church; I doubt not

them guiltie of their owne bane, who
take it with ſuch a conceipt. And yet I
thinke euery charitable Chriſtian will
grieue at the heart, that he ſhould be the

that he had rather béen from the church
a moneth, eſpecially being in ſome ſort
Gods priſoner, and the affrighted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
likelyhoods that either he or his
garment might be infected. That a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:881:14"/>
may be infected, and the Plague
taken onely by feare, experience and
reaſon do make manifeſt. Concerning
the former, it hath béene proued that
clothes of infected perſons layed vp and
not well ayred, being opened though a

by the ſmell that garments wil retaine
the ſent of Wormewood or muſke for a
long time: the cauſe is not in the ſent
by it ſelfe conſidered, but in the ayre
which is the ſubiect of the ſent. The
plague in a garment is a poyſoned aire
(being according to the nature thereof
called by the learned the <hi>Death of the
ayre</hi>) procéeding from the partie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and infecting the garment, though

I ſée not (but herein I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
mine opinion to the Church) that
viſiting the ſicke is a proper dutie of a

none can ordaine officers in the Church
but Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 8. 11 Mat. 28. 18. 19.</note> ſo none (as I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)

are not (no not the beſt) ſufficient for

point: this place of <hi>Iames</hi> doth not
proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the proper dutie of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to viſite the ſicke. For the Elders
were ſent for to heale the ſicke by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and oyle, according to that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
grace which was then beſtowed
vpon them,<note place="margin">Mar. 6. 13.</note> for confirmation of the
Word: ſo that I am of your mind, that
teaching Elders be here vnderſtood.
Which gift diſcontinuing, this Canon
is annulled: ſo that in time of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
it is abſurdly concluded: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Iames</hi> inioyned Miniſters to go
to heale the ſicke, therefore Miniſters
muſt vpon euery call aduenture their
liues, by viſiting the ſick of the plague.
Againe, if it be the proper dutie of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to viſite the ſicke, as it was the
proper gift of Elders, for confirmation
of the word, to heale with oyle, then
none muſt viſite the ſicke but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4. 2. Chor. 26. 16. 17. 18. 19.</note>
as none muſt miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(which properly belong to their
function) but they. Laſtly, this word,
<hi>Elders</hi> in the plurall number, putteth
me in mind, that Miniſters were in
the primitiue Church, aſſiſted with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:881:19"/>
other Elders,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17. Act. 6. 2. 3. Rom. 12. 7. 8.</note> (for there were two ſorts
of Elders) who looked to the manners
of people, and with Deacons who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the poore, that they themſelues
might attend their ſtudie, prayer, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and the Sacraments. Why
then ſhould we thinke, that viſiting
the ſicke, was laid vpon them as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
properly pertaining to their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie?
But rather that Elders by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
comfort, and Deacons by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reliefe viſited the ſicke as there
was néed: ſo that the Miniſter was
not troubled but in extraordinarie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.
As when none but he could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the deſpairefull conſcience, or
mind doubtfull in a fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
of one likely (otherwiſe) to die
out of the faith. In which caſe, I thinke
a Miniſter ought to hazard his life. My
reaſon is: It is the reueiled will of God
that he muſt ſaue a loſt ſhéepe:<note place="margin">Ezec. 34. 2. 4.</note> but it is
Gods ſecret, whether he ſhall be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

though he were the Lords prophet.
Againe, you vtterly miſtake the point:
for the queſtion is not whether the ſick
of the Plague are to be viſited; which
God forbid that any Preacher ſhould
gaineſay: but whether they are to be ſo
viſited and with ſuch reſort, as other
ſicke of diſeaſes not contagious. Laſtly,
in the place ſo much vrged, Chriſt doth
not neceſſarily require perſonall viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(though that alſo be comfortable in
caſes conuenient, and ſo required accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly)
but real, that is, by reléefe, either
brought,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 44.</note> ſent or procured: for in the 44.
verſe of that chapter you may find, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring</hi>
to Chriſt vſed, for all other
workes of Charitie before ſpecified.
Whereby it is manifeſt, that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
not ſo much perſonall viſiting,
as charitable miniſtring to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the ſick. Of all other, Princes and
Magiſtrates (who are foſter-fathers
and ſhepheards) are to viſite the ſicke.
But who will ſay they are to do it in

the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 41. 46.</note> for charging <hi>Moſes</hi>

ſpeake of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort (that we may go on with

be without offence) whether you would
haue thoſe pittifull creatures that are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
with the plague, to want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which they may take by the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

               <p>O neighbour! I wiſh them
all true comfort of body and mind, the
Lord knoweth, and I graunt that the
very preſence of thoſe we loue, is very
comfortable in time of ſickneſſe: but yet
I aduiſe all viſited with that deadly
and contagious diſeaſe, to manifeſt
their mortification from vnneceſſarie
deſires, &amp; their charitable loue to their
friends, by not deſiring them to come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:881:22"/>
into far greater daunger than their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
can do good, without neceſſarie
cauſe.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 23. 15, 16, 17.</note> And let them remember how
<hi>Dauid</hi> refuſed that water which was
gotten with ieopardie of life, and called
it bloud, though he had longed for it,
&amp; the daunger was paſt. As for comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
words, I likewiſe acknowledge
their ſpeciall vſe: but before I anſwer
that point, let vs conſider how needfull
it is (eſpecially in time of mortality) to
hide in their hearts the word of life, leſt
wée be iuſtly puniſhed with want of
comfortable words, when we moſt
need them: according to that of <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 8. 5. 11, 12.</note>
where a famin of the word is threatned
to deſpiſers of the Sabboth, and that at
ſuch a time, when to find the word, they
would run from the Eaſt to the Weſt.
Now to the point. Sith all ſickneſſe (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the plague, vntill the worſt be
paſt, when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable words are not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:881:23"/>
may ſufficiently comfort the afflicted,
according to that which is required by

Again, the Spirit of God is called
a Comforter, becauſe he bringeth the

and that eſpecially in time of néed, as

ſo when we are ſick. For when

               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>Indeede I confeſſe that your
probable diſcourſes haue won (I know
not how) a certaine inclination to your
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:881:23"/>
opinion, but yet I muſt ſuſpend my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
till you haue anſwered certain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
againſt the maine grounds of
your opinion: but before I come to them,
let me haue but one word with you about
buriall. I ſay but one word: for if thoſe
that are infected in perſon or garment,
are to keep from Church for a time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient:
and if friends are to forbeare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting
to friends ſicke of the Plague, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they haue neceſſary cauſe, then I may
(of my felfe) conclude, that we are not to
throng after infected corpſes (which haue
no good thereby) without ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cauſe. That one word (I ſpake of) is
this, I would gladly know (if I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that fauour) your iudgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the direction of authoritie, that
but ſixe perſons, beſides the Miniſter,
Clerke and bearers, ſhould accompany
infected corpſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not preſume to iudge
of the determinations of authoritie
without ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reaſon, which I want
in this caſe: but rather I am perſwaded
(according to that I am commaunded
by theſe words, <hi>Honor thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 20. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:881:24"/>
to indge the beſt, and take it as an
argument, that authoritie careth more
for the liuing then for the dead, their
pompe ſo dangerous in theſe times and
not neceſſary, as wiſe men thinke. But
mine own opinion is this I could wiſh
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> friends of the diſeaſed would reſpect
the preſeruation of life more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of buriall. But I vtterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
that infected perſons ſhould thruſt
into the throng, and it grieueth me to
heare how the poorer ſort, yea women
with yong children, will flocke to buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and (which is worſe) ſtand (of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
ouer open graues, where ſundry
are buried together, that (forſooth) all
the world may ſee that they feare not
the Plague. This peruerſe courſe of too
too many, in doing that which authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
forbiddeth, and deſpiſing that which
authoritie commandeth, to wit, faſting
and praier, occaſioneth me to obſerue a
notable proportion betwéene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague
&amp; the wickednes of this time: by which
proportion, God ſéemeth to teach men
to ſay in their hearts, we would not be
ruled, neither by reaſon nor authority,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:881:24"/>
therefore are ſo many, as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
in their ſickneſſe, and by no
meanes to be ruled: ſo that ſome leape
out of the windowes, and ſome runne
into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Thames. As the rough ſpéeches
of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> cauſed his brethren to ſay:<note place="margin">Gen. 42. 7. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>As
we would not heare Ioſeph, ſo this man
will not heare vs.</hi> I rather obſerue this
proportion betwéene the vnrulineſſe of
our ſinne, and the vnrulineſſe of this
ſickneſſe, becauſe I find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that the Plague was eſpecially
threatened againſt, and inflicted vpon
wilfull offendors. At your leyſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe places. <hi>Leuit. 26. 23, 24, 25.
Num. 14. 37. and 16. 41, 45, 46. 2. Sam.</hi>
24. 1, 2, 3, 4, 15. and you will perceiue
as much. But now let me heare one of
your obiections againſt the grounds of
mine opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prof.</speaker>
               <p>The ground whereon you build
your opinion, of ſeparating the ſound
from the infected, is the law of Lepers.
Which (vnder your correction) ſeemeth
to be no rocke, but a ſand, becauſe that
law was meerely ceremoniall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prea.</speaker>
               <p>Nay Sir, my ground is the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:881:25"/>
mortall contagion of the Peſtilence,
which we call the Plague. Indeed I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
confirmation from the law of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
For thus I reaſon: If ſuch care
is to be had of infection which is not
mortall, much more of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plagues infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which is mortall. And this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
holdeth good, your obiection not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.
For the lawes of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
women in time of their flowers,<note place="margin">Leuit. 15. 24. &amp; 17. 18 15.</note>
and not eating ſtrangled beaſts, were
ceremoniall: but yet huſbands are
now to forbeare the act of matrimonie
in that time, and all are to take héede
how they eate of ſtrangled fleſh, and
both are to be héeded in naturall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of bodily hurt, which is ſtill
to be feared, in ſuch copulation and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
So Leproſie is ſtill infectiue, as
experience ſheweth: if now, why not
then, notwithſtanding the lawe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
was ceremoniall? And the rather
becauſe in Sacraments and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
there muſt be a reſemblauce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
the ſigne and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſo that, as we obiect againſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
and ſay: If the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:881:25"/>
of bread and wine be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by conſecration, how can there be
bodily nouriſhment? if no nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how can our ſpirituall féeding be
reſembled? So I ſay to you, If in the
Leproſie there were no infection, how
could the contagion of ſinne be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prof.</speaker>
               <p>I graunt that in Leproſie there
was ſomewhat to ſignifie a ſinne to be
ſhunned. But that was Pollution, not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
For vpon occaſion of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,<note place="margin">Leuit. 14. &amp; 15.</note>
I haue read both the Chapters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Leproſie, and find them ſtill
mention Vncleaneneſſe, and neuer Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Againe, if the Leproſie were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,
how chaunced it that the Prieſtes,
who ſo often viewed the Lepers, were
neuer infected?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>Do not you conſider, that
though all vncleaneneſſe be not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,
yet all infection is vncleane, and
therefore you might haue vnderſtood
Infection as well as any other Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the word Vncleaneneſſe. And
though you find not the very word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet you may find enough to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:881:26"/>
make it euident, that the Leproſie is
infectiue.<note place="margin">Leuit. 13. 8 51.</note> For it was not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Leproſie, except it were found
ſpreading and fretting as a Canker,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 16. 17.</note> or
Gangrene in a mans bodie. And why
was the Leper to couer his lips, and to
to cry,<note place="margin">Leu. 13. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>I am vncleane, I am vncleane,</hi> but
to giue warning, that none ſhold come
within the infection of his breath? As
for the Prieſtes eſcape, that is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the prouidence of God, who
ſet him on worke.<note place="margin">Ier. 1. 18, 19 Act. 18 9, 10.</note> As he promiſed to
preſerue <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> for that
cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prof.</speaker>
               <p>If my memorie faile me not, I
haue heard you ſay, that the ceaſſing of
Man,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 5. 11. 12</note> preſently after the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
had eaten of the corne of the land of
promiſe, teacheth vs not to depend vpon
extraordinarie meanes (viz. Miracles and
ſuch like) when we may enioy ordinarie.
So I thinke it may be ſaid, we are not to
ſuppoſe the extraordinarie prouidence
of God, in preſeruing Prieſts viewing
the Lepers, where we may find an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
to wit, their not touching of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
whereby they might be defiled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:881:26"/>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>How find you that to be the
cauſe? Sith you find not in both your
Chapters <hi>Touching</hi> ſpoken of.<note place="margin">Leu. 15. 5: 7, 19, 21.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the next Chapter you find <hi>Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
communicated by touching and
not otherwiſe in the vncleanneſſe of a
man by fluxe of ſéed, and of a woman
by iſſue of flowers. Nay in this caſe of
of Leproſie,<note place="margin">Verſ. 14. 37 46.</note> a man is become vncleane,
by going into an houſe ſhut vp for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie
in the wals, which he néed not
to touch, as hath bene ſaid.<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> So that if
you conſider your two Chapters well,
it may rather appeare to you, that as
the infection of the Plague, ſo of the
Leproſie was communicated by the
ayre, and not onely by touching. But
ſuppoſe that Pollution not Infection,
were the cauſe that cleane men ſhould
ſhunne vncleane Lepers, leſt they
ſhould be defiled, not infected; yet this
makes for my purpoſe. For if. Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be to be ſhunned, much more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and that deadly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee I muſt either depart not
fully ſatisfied, or come to a point which
I haue hitherto auoyded, becauſe I wold
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:881:27"/>
not offend you, whom I haue heard ſo
carneſt againſt it, ſo as you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
it to be a bloudie errour, to wit,
It is ſtiffely maintained by no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people, that the Plague is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>I graunt that mo than a
good many do more ſtiffely than wiſely
maintaine that bloudie error, ſo I will
call it againe and againe. For moſt of
that many do wilfully maintaine that
opinion, becauſe they cannot abide to
be Gods priſoners. It is a death to be
out of companie, and they had rather
indanger a thouſand liues, than want
any part of their pleaſure or profite. As
may appeare by the diſcoured courſe
of many, who hold the Plague to be
infectiue, while they and theirs be wel:
but when they or theirs be infected; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(forſooth) the Plague is not infectiue.
So their reaſon followeth and is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to their will, and not their will
followeth reaſon to be ruled thereby.
But me thinkes euery reaſonable man
ſhould ſay to his owne ſoule: O let me
be ſure mine opinion touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infection
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:881:27"/>
of the Plague (whether nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
or affirmatiue) be vndoubtedly
true, leſt by maintaining an error, in a
caſe and time of ſo great mortalitie and
vnſpeakeable miſeries, I do infinite
hurt. For if it be true that the Plague
is contagious, then of neceſſitie, he
that maintaineth the contrarie, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the bloud of ſo many, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by his opinion to runne into
daunger. On the other ſide, if the
Plague be not contagious, then he
that maintaineth the contrarie, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of all the wants and miſeries of ſo
many as want conuenient reliefe, not
miniſtred for feare of contagion, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the maintenance of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But neighbour, I wonder that
any ſhould deny the Plague to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
againſt ſo generall and wofull
experience. Do not the botches, blains
and ſpots (called Gods tokens) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with rauing and death, argue
a ſtraunger infection, then that of the
Leproſie, to be iudged by botches and
ſpots? Doth not the ordinarie experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of laying liue Pigeons to plague
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:881:28"/>
ſores, and taking them preſently dead
away, and that one after another, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
mortall infection? In that
the Plague rageth and raigneth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
amongſt the younger ſort, and
ſuch as do not greatly regard cleane
and ſwéete kéeping, and where many
are peſtred together in alleyes or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
is not this an argument of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Thouſandes can directly tell,
where, when, and of whom they tooke
the Plague. Doth not all this make it
more then manifeſt, that the Plague
is contagious? All Magiſtrates, all
Diuines, all Phiſitians, all learned
men, and all wiſe men, in all ages,
haue held the Plague to be contagious.
Dare any but blind bayard, be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
to deny it, without ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as may ſway againſt ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and ſo great authoritie? If
you haue any ſuch, I pray you let me
heare them.</p>

               <p>That I haue any ſuch I cannot
ſay, in regard of the weaknes of myiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as alſo of the probabilitie (at leaſt)
of that I haue heard already ſpoken to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:881:28"/>
contrary: but ſuch as they be (if it pleaſe
you) I will bring them out, humbly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your anſwers. The firſt, is thus vrged
with open mouth: This opinion of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doeth vtterly ouerthrow charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the viſited by the plague, being the
cauſe, why they by whoſe meanes the ſick
and ſound are eſpecially to be prouided
for, do runne away, viz. Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
(ſuch I meane as indeed were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
faithfull, for (bleſſed be God) many
faithful remaine) Phiſitians and rich men:
and why ſo many be thruſt out of doores,
periſh in town and field for want of help,
and are ſo cruelly vſed by country people:
ſo that it is a very countermaund to Chriſt
his iudgement concerning viſitation of
the ſicke.<note place="margin">Pag. 24, 25, 26. 27. Pag. 7, 8, &amp; 34.</note> But by that which hath bin ſaid,
and by gathering from the laſt point we
talked of, that the preciſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
touching Lepers to be ſeparated
from Church and companie, was no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to their viſitation, but that they
were to be miniſtred vnto, according to
their need: I am for my part induced to
lay the blame of all this vncharitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vpon the exceſſiue feare of people,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:881:29"/>
occaſioned perhaps, but not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the opinion of the Plagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
for though the Plague be to be
feared, becauſe of the infection, yet (as I
take it) not ſo exceſſiuely and inordinatly.
For of ſuch feare, the cauſe is want of
faith, rather then the opinion of infection;
as I may partly gather from that which
you deliuered before:<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> I will therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
an argument (ſo deemed) which
we haue not yet handled.</p>

               <p>Stay here a while, for I can
not but thanke God that you iudge ſo
rightly betwéene mine opinion, and
others feare of infection. If Profeſſors
would wiſely obſerue what is taught,
there would not be ſo many ſpiders to
ſuck ranke poiſon out of ſound doctrine.
Then might we hold the plague in the
nature thereof to be contagious, and
men would not take occaſion before it
be giuen, of exceſſiue and inordinate
feare: then might we inuey againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
and inordinate feare, and men
would not take occaſion before it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
of inordinate and dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption:
but fooliſh men (as wiſe men
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:881:29"/>
obſerue) are euer running into extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 28.</note>
If <hi>Paul</hi> teach, that we are iuſtified
by faith, without the works of the law;
the carnal goſpeller taketh occaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be giuen, to neglect good workes.
And if <hi>Iames</hi> teach,<note place="margin">Iam 2. 26.</note> that faith without
workes is dead, the arrogant Papiſt
taketh occaſion before it be giuen, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
good workes to merite and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation.
Mine heart bléedeth to heare
of the crueltie and inhumanitie you
mentioned: ſo that if I were in the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
I would (by Gods grace) ſet my
ſelfe againſt thoſe damnable effects of
inordinate feare, and make it euident
that the Plague is not ſo contagious
as exceſſiue feare makes it to be. But
now I follow this courſe (which God
bleſſe) becauſe I liue where the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſinne of Preſumption is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and more dangerous; both becauſe
of that bloudy errour, as alſo of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Magiſtrates, who ſhould ſée
good orders put in execution: through
which default it is come to paſſe, that
men, women and children with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſores, go commonly abroade, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:881:30"/>
thruſt themſelues into company, ſo that
ſome haue perceiued when they tooke
the infection of ſuch. How many may
be ſuppoſed to haue taken the infection
from ſuch, though they perceiued it not?
I would be loth to make Magiſtrates
neglecting their charge, guiltie of all
this bloud: but (if I were in place) I
would humbly and earneſtly intreate
them, ſeriouſly to conſider the nine firſt
verſes of the 21. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where
they may learne, how fearefull they (of
all other) ſhould be of bloud-guiltines.
But leauing them to Gods direction, I
pray you propound your argument ſo

               <p>That I will, and (as neare as I
can) in ſuch ſort as it is inforced. If the
Plague be contagious, why is not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
as well as another? I haue lyen in
bed with many that haue had the plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores
running on them, I haue bene ſtill
about them, when they ſwet, their ſores

and yet I (and a great number beſides
me, who haue done as much) had neuer
the plague yet, and truſt neuerſhal, ſo long
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:881:30"/>
as I haue a ſtrong faith in God: for is it
not written,<note place="margin">Pal. 91. 5, 6, 7, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the

               <p>This aduenturous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtandeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two points, viz. firſt
the eſcaping of ſome, and ſecondly their
ſtrong faith. Concerning the former, I
anſwer, (in the name of the opponent)
<hi>Is thine eye euill becauſe God is good?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 15.</note> Wilt
thou by thy bloody errour poiſon other,
becauſe God hath glorified his ſpeciall
prouidence ouer thée? Is this thy thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
for ſo great deliuerance, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Gods prouidence by attributing
thine eſcape to this, that the plague is
not infectiue? Conſider better the very
text alleaged for thy ſtrong faith, and
you may (if you will) ſée clearely, that
God doth hereby ſet forth his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in that he preſerueth thoſe that
truſt in him, and walke in his wayes,
by Angels, and then, when by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
thouſands fall about them: for
the greater the daunger is, the greater
is Gods prouidence in deliuering his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:881:31"/>
people: as may further appeare by their
walking vpon Lions,<note place="margin">Pſa 91. 13. 14</note> Aſpes and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
mentioned in the ſame Pſalme.
Therefore take héede how you obſcure
the prouidence of God, and draw many
into daunger by denying the plague to
be contagious; leſt as he that feared
not the day of the Lord,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 18. 19.</note> met with a
Beare when he had eſcaped a Lion: ſo
you méete with a iudgement heauier to
you, though you ſtill eſcape the plague.
But neighbour, I will turne my ſpéech
to you, praying you to conſider this
Pſalme wel, and you ſhall ſée me proue
from the ſame the Plague to be conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
For if an extraordinary proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God be manifeſted in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thoſe that beléeue from peſtilence,
then is the peſtilence very dangerous:
as be the Lion, Aſpe and Dragon, but
the former is true, therefore the latter.
If then the peſtilence be dangerous to
one that is in the middeſt of thouſands
dying thereof, it muſt néedes be ſo by
contagion: as may further appeare, in
that it is called noiſome; and in that it
is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 3, 7</note> 
                  <hi>it ſhall not come neare thee.</hi> But let
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:881:31"/>
vs trie the ſtrength of the former part
of that huge argument, layed downe in
this forme. Many haue bene with the
ſicke of the plague, when they ſwet, &amp;c.
&amp; yet are not infected, therefore it is not
contagious. Certaine Prieſts ſaid to
a Philoſopher, All theſe monuments
which you ſée in this Temple, be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of ſo many deliuered from
ſhipwracke, by prayer to the God of
this Temple. But (quoth the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher)
can you ſhew me how many
prayed, and yet periſhed? As the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
anſwer was ſtronger againſt
their God. then the Prieſts obſeruation
was for their God: ſo it maketh much
more to proue the plague to be conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
to ſay: an hundred (if not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand)
infected by being where the
plague is, may be brought for one that
eſcaped. Againe, if that argument be
good, then theſe be as good: Many haue
had the plague ſores and were ſick, and
yet died not; therefore the plague is not
in it owne nature mortall. Many run
vpon the mouth of a canon, and eſcape,
therfore canon ſhot is not murthering.</p>

               <p>By common experience it is

and being where ſmall pocks are, cauſe
ſuch effects. Why then ſhould we not

betime preuent the worſt. Through
which default I am perſwaded hundreds
do periſh daily: but commending ſuch to
Gods gracious prouidence. I pray you
tell me what cauſes are giuen by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
why ſo many eſcape, though they
be continually in ſo great daunger of the
Plague,<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> as hath bene ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>There be cauſes both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and diuine. For naturall cauſes
I referre you to learned Phiſitians.
Onely I will ſhew you ſomewhat,
which euery reaſonable man (as I
thinke) may conceiue. Before any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
good or bad, can qualifie any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
the ſubiect muſt be firſt diſpoſed
thereunto, or capable thereof. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander
liueth in the fire, though the
flie, playing with the flame of a candle
is conſumed therewith. Gun powder
takes fire preſently, but ſo doth not
chalke. So perſons of a tender conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:881:33"/>
or corrupt humours ſooner take
the Plague, then thoſe that be of a
ſtrong conſtitution, &amp; ſound bodies, as
hath bene ſaid:<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> &amp; ſome infected are much
fuller of poiſonfull corruption then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The infirmities of many women
in trauell, and other diſeaſes turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Plague. We ſée few auncient
people die in compariſon of children,
and the younger ſort. Laſtly of thoſe
that kéepe a good diet, haue cleane and
ſwéet kéeping, liue in a good aire, vſe
reaſonable and ſeaſonable preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
and be not peſtred many in one
houſe, or haue conuenient houſe-roome
for their houſhold, we ſee few infected
in compariſon of thoſe, that faile in all
theſe good meanes of preſeruation, and
yet will thruſt themſelues into danger.
This well conſidered, may not an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
be drawn from hence, to proue
(euen by reaſon) that the Plague is not
ſo infectiue as faithleſſe people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
and therefore they need not feare
the Plague ſo extreamely as they do?
But I will procéed to the diuine cauſes
or reaſons. The chiefe whereof is this:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:881:33"/>
God worketh al things after the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of his owne will,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11. Rom. 9. 13 15.</note> and therefore he
hath mercie on whome he will haue
mercie,<note place="margin">Icr. 15. 2. Ioh. 7. 30.</note> and none ſhall die but they who
are appointed. For though the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
ſought to lay hands on Chriſt, yet
they could not, before the appointed
time came: and therefore be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plague
neuer ſo contagious in it owne nature,
none can be ſmitten with it, but thoſe,
whom God hath ſpecially appointed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>Here I remember an opinion
of ſome people (with whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe)
whereby they ſeeme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,
to reconcile the difference, touching the
Plagues infection; and that is this. Let
one (ſay they) go neuer ſo daungerouſly
where the Plague is, he cannot die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time, and yet indeed he may take
the ſickneſſe. What thinke you of this
opinion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>What thinke I of it? as I
do of other opinions which brain-ſicke
men (deſpiſing the word of God, and

owne phantaſticall braine-pans. How
wittie ſoeuer it ſéeme to them, I tel you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:881:34"/>
it ſauoureth ſtrongly of Epicuriſme.
For doth God diſpoſe of capitall and
principall, and not of leſſe matters, as
Epicures dreame? Shall we ſay:<note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 20.</note> The
iſſues of death belong to the Lord, and
ſhall we doubt with the Philiſtims,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 6. 9.</note>
whether ſickneſſe be by chaunce? If
they knew the Scriptures they might
learne,<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 6. Mat. 10. 29</note> that God forgetteth not ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
but ſo regardeth them, that
without him, not one of them falleth
to the ground. Doubtleſſe Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is the ſame, though not alike

to ſatiſfie the ſame. But I muſt firſt tel
you, that he is happy who can know
the cauſes of things, to the end you

I can preſently gather out of the word.
God preſerueth ſome to manifeſt his
power and prouidence. As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the 91.<note place="margin">Pag. 45 46</note> Pſalme before diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and by <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 9 (2) God will take

places, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 31, 32, 33, and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.
36. (3) God reſerueth ſome for an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier
iudgement, as may appeare by
theſe places: 1. <hi>King. 19. 17. 2. King. 8.
10, 15. Amos</hi> 5. 16, 17. And 4, towards
ſome he perfourmeth his promiſe in

according to the 91. <hi>Pſalme, verſ.</hi> 11.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:881:35"/>
For which cauſe Prieſts, though ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

as I ſhewed before, and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,

               <p>I thank you heartily for yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me this ſatisfaction. For amongſt
all your good notes I take hold of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
with ſome comfort, and thereon
ground this concluſion: If I ſhall not die,
before I haue done God all the ſeruice I
am appointed: why ſhold I be vnwilling
to die, when my time is come, and not
rather be prepared to ſay, yea ſing with
good old <hi>Simeon:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 2, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy
ſeruant depart in peace.</hi> But I miſſe one
principall cauſe of preſeruation from the
Plague: to wit, A ſtrong faith according
to the 91. Pſalme.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>I thought verily you wold
not let go your hold on that part of the
mightie argument. But I aſſure you
there is no ſuch force in it, as it ſéemeth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:881:35"/>
to haue. Nay rather it ouerthroweth
the former part of that argument. For
in that Pſalme, the promiſe of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is not made only, to our taking
hold of Gods promiſe, but alſo to our
walking in our wayes. Wherefore as
that faith which ſtandeth vpon the
precept (which is implyed) to walke in
our wayes, and forgetteth (as it were)
the promiſe of helpe, ſauoureth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
in God. So that faith which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
hold of the promiſe, neglecting the
precept, ſauoureth of preſumption, and
therefore hauing no promiſe (with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
aſſurance) cannot hope for
preſeruation. Againe, though faith do
equally reſpect both the promiſe &amp; the
precept, yet ſith all temporall bleſſings
are promiſed, not abſolutely but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
ſo farre as the performance
of them ſhall be to the glorie of God,
and good of the beléeuer, as I wil proue
if néed require, it cannot be otherwiſe
aſſured of preſeruation, then with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to thoſe conditions. If without
ſuch reſpect it be abſolutely aſſured, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is not faith, but preſumption. Except
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:881:36"/>
you will haue it to be a miraculous
faith, which taketh hold of the will of
God inſtantly and by inſpiration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled.
But that faith liueth and
dieth with miracles, becauſe (I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine)
it hath no promiſe. For howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaluation be abſolutely promiſed to
beléeuers, becauſe it is reuealed that
the performance of that promiſe is for
Gods moſt glory and the beléeuers beſt
good, and is therefore abſolutely to be
beléeued: yet becauſe it is not reuealed
at any time, that then the performance
of a temporall promiſe, is for Gods
moſt glory and the beléeuers beſt good:
therefore a temporall promiſe, is in the
nature thereof, conditional, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to be beléued. Laſtly, do you not
perceiue that the ſtronger faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 31, 32.</note>
the greater danger is ſuppoſed.
But if the plague be not contagious,
what daunger is there? if no daunger,
what néed of faith?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>There is no need you ſhould
proue your conditions: for they ſtand
with all reaſon,<note place="margin">Pro. 16 4.</note> ſith God hath made all
things for his owne ſake, and promiſeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:881:36"/>
deliuerance for his glory ſake,<note place="margin">Pal. 50. 15, &amp; 34. 10.</note> and his
promiſes pretend the good of his people.
But yet it will not out of my mind, but
that godly men who die in this plague, do
therefore die becauſe they faile in faith: I
meane not touching their ſaluation, but
touching the particular promiſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
from the plague. Therefore I
pray you for my better inſtruction, ſhew
me how by the death of godly men dying
of the plague, and beleeuing the promiſes
both of eternall ſaluation and temporall
preſeruation, God may haue glory and
the deceaſed benefit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>I graunt that a right godly
man may faile, as in obedience to the
precept of kéeping his wayes, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption:
ſo in faith to the promiſe of
preſeruation, by feare, eſpecially when
he heareth nothing but crying of wiues
and children, mourning of huſbands
and parents, ſorrowing of friends and
kinſfolke, and withall ſéeth the plague
wéekely to increaſe from tens to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
from hundreds to thouſands,
and to draw nearer and nearer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and that God in viſiting him may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:881:37"/>
iuſtly take hold of this feare: for <hi>Peter</hi>
walked on the water for a while,<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 29. 30.</note> but
when he ſaw a mightie wind, he was
afraid and began to ſinke. But this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
A godly man dying of the plague
failed in faith, touching promiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation,
I hold to be as vnſound as
this: All godly men dying before their
dayes be long, failed in honouring their
father and mother. But I will ſhew
you in a word how the death of godly
men dying of the plague, and in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
faith of eternall ſaluation, and
conditionall faith of temporall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
may be to Gods glorie and the
beléeuers good: for by the death of the
faithfull, God glorifieth his iuſtice and
wiſedome. His iuſtice amongſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 31.</note>
in giuing them cauſe to ſay, If God

the godly, leaſt they ſhould ſay, For our

the good of the beléeuer, I maruell that
you ſhould forget that which is ſo often

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:881:37"/>
ſo the righteous is taken away

may reforme our iudgement. Well, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that you haue fully anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my firſt argument, I proceed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
grounded on the prouidence of
God, in this ſort. If God ſhoote his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
at a certaine marke, and not at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if none die before his hower: and
if thoſe that are appointed to die, ſhal dy,
and thoſe that are appointed to periſh by
ſword or famine, ſhall ſo periſh, and none
other,<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> as you proued eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now; otherwiſe I
had thoſe proofes ready for this purpoſe:
then if I go where the plague is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, I ſhall not die of the plague, if
God haue not appointed me to dy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and if he haue, I ſhall die thereof
though I come not neare it by a thouſand
miles.</p>

All this is granted: but what infer you

of reaſoners heady people be: euen ſuch
as are blamed by God for darkning the
counſell of God with words without
knowledge.<note place="margin">Iob. 37. 2.</note> But to vſe the words of
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 19.</note> if God will, I will know, not the
words of them that are puffed vp, but
the power. To bring this about, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that vpon that ground of Gods
prouidence, you muſt of neceſſity frame
one of theſe two arguments, if you will
reaſon to the purpoſe: None can die of
the plague but ſuch as are ſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereunto, therefore the plague
is not contagious: or this: None can
die, &amp;c. but ſuch &amp;c. therfore we may as
boldly reſort to them that are ſicke of
the plague, as to thoſe that are ſicke of
any other diſeaſe. Which of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
do you like better? or do you like
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:881:38"/>
both? or will you make ſome other that
may ſerue your turne better?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>If neither of theſe will ſerue
the turne, I cannot imagine any other:
for my dull wit could not ſo diſtinctly
haue gathered theſe. I ſee that learning is
a good help to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for the very fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of theſe in this ſeuerall ſort (which
I neuer heard before) maketh me ſtagger.
For the former concluſion ſeemeth now
to be abſurd: for (as I now conceiue) by
the ſame reaſon, the bloudy ſword in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
battell, and extreme famin amongſt
a multitude of miſerable poore people,
may be concluded to be in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without daunger of death: for in the
ſame chapter of <hi>Ieremy</hi> (now ſo much vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
it is as well ſaid,<note place="margin">Ier. 15. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Such as are for the
ſword to the ſword, and ſuch as are for the
famine to the famine,</hi> as <hi>Such as are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to death vnto death.</hi> As for the ſecond
concluſion, if the plague be contagious, I
ſee not how it holdeth good. But yet I
pray you to ſay ſomewhat to it, that I may
the better ſatisfie my ſelfe and other, as
occaſion ſhall ſerue.</p>

               <p>Certaine Anabaptiſtes of

If God haue determined that
we ſhall fall into their hands, we ſhall
not eſcape though we had all the guns
and weapons in the world: if God haue
determined otherwiſe, we ſhall eſcape
though we haue no weapons, nor any
ſhew of defenſiue prouiſion. Another
being ſicke of the plague, and aduiſed to
take ſome phiſick, denieth ſo to do, vſing
the ſame argument. What thinke you
of theſe concluſions?</p>

               <p>If the onely ſetting downe of
your former concluſions, did make me
ſtagger, the laying of theſe by them (and
that in ſo goodly proportion) muſt needs
make me ſtumble: for now I ſee not, but
that we may as wel hold it vnneceſſary to
eate and drinke, though it be for a yeare
together, if God haue determined that we
ſhall liue ſo long.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>There is great difference
in the caſes propounded by me, and
that propounded by you. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:881:39"/>
to liue a yeare without meate
and drinke, except God worke a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle:
but the Anabaptiſts might
happely eſcape the Dunkirkers by not
méeting with them: &amp; there may be in
a man, though in outward appearance
dangerouſly ſicke of the plague, yet
ſome ſecret power of nature to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
againſt the diſeaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>All this may be; And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Anabaptiſt, and ſicke man do
not know that God hath determined
ſuch a miſſe, and graunted ſuch a power,
they both preſume (in mine opinion) as
well as he, that refuſeth meat and drinke:
becauſe they neglect lawfull meanes, the
one of defence, the other of recouery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>Now haue you hit vpon the
very point. For God, who is onely
wiſe, hath in his counſell determined
the meanes as well as the euent.
Which appeareth, as in the caſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ſaluation, wherein we ſée, that
God calleth all them to faith, whom he
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom 8. 29. 30. Act. 13. 48. Ioh. 6. 37. 44. Math. 13. 11. 15. Iude 4.</note> predeſtinated to life: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe,
he leaueth them in their reprobate
minds, whom he hath ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:881:40"/>
ſo in caſes of temporall
deliuerances. For though God graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> recouery,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 20. 5. 7.</note> yet he preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
a plaiſter for his ſore. And though
<hi>Paule</hi> was aſſured by an Angell,<note place="margin">Act. 27. 22. 23. 24. 31.</note> that
not one in ſhip with him ſhould be
loſt: yet, if they had vſed any other
meanes of preſeruation, then God had
determined, they could not be ſafe. And
howſoeuer Chriſt could not die before
his houre (as hath bene ſayd) yet his
life was preſerued till that houre by
ſhunning danger.<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 26. 30.</note> On the other ſide:
as God had determined to giue <hi>Sihon</hi> &amp;
his land vnto the Iſraelites, ſo he made
his heart obſtinate to refuſe peace, the
onely meane of his preſeruation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Profeſſ.</speaker>
               <p>I perceiue your meaning;
namely, from all theſe inſtances to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that as God hath determined to
infect any with the plague vnto death, or
otherwiſe, ſo hath he determined, by
what meanes they ſhould be infected: I
graunt all this. But do you thinke that
taking infection one from another is the
onely meane?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>No: For there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:881:40"/>
be (a Firſt) that is infected, &amp; we
ſée the godly aſwell as the wicked, and
not onely yong and poore folke, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and wealthy perſons: yea, ſuch
as dwell in a good aire, and auoid infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with all care, to haue the plague
as well as other: for otherwiſe how
were it a calamity, or a iudgement?
And yet many of them (I doubt not)
are infected by being in company of
ſome other infected, in perſon, or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though they do not perceiue it
many dayes after, for cauſes giuen
before.<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> But to anſwer your queſtion
more fully: I will tell you, what I
thinke further: To wit. As God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
bringeth ſome to their deſtruction,
by working vpon, and by the ſpirituall
corruption he findeth in their ſoules,
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Sihon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 4. 21. Deu. 1. 30. Gen. 3. 1. &amp;c. 2. Chro. 10. 14. 15.</note> but many moe
by outward meanes, as our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> ſo he himſelfe
infecteth ſome, by turning the naturall
or accidentall corruption he findeth in
their bodies into the plague, but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his prouidence) he viſiteth
many moe, by the meane of taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:881:41"/>
one from another. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
God ſtriketh whom he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiatly,
yet the Plague being conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in it owne nature, it cannot be
denied, but that one man may be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by another, except Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
be to the contrary? Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that cannot be knowne, but by
the euent, therefore as the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
ſicke and hungry men preſume (in
your opinion) when they neglect the
meanes of their defence, recouery and
feeding: ſo he that doth not keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from the daunger of infection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he haue a neceſſary calling, doth
by ſuch neglecting his owne ſafety, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
on Gods prouidence. For (to
confirme you in your opinion) it is
written:<note place="margin">Deu. 29. 29</note> That ſecret things belong to
God, and reueiled things belong to vs.
So that I may conclude, that ſith the
prouidence of God touching life or
death is ſecret before the euent, and it
is reuealed, that the Plague is conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
therefore it followeth, that
howſoeuer it be true that none can die
of the Plague, but ſuch as are ſpecially
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:881:41"/>
appointed thereunto, yet there ought
not to be that bold and free reſort to
them, that are ſicke of the plague, as
to thoſe that are ſicke of any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
To confirme this point further,
thus I argue: A wanton or vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
putting of God to the manifeſtation
of his power or ſpeciall prouidence, is
a tempting of the Almighty: as may
appeare by theſe places, <hi>Pſal. 78. 18. 19.
Eſa. 7. 12. Math.</hi> 4. 6. 7. But to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
danger of the plague without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
cauſe, as they do, who reſort as
boldly and fréely to them that are ſicke
of the plague, as to thoſe that are ſicke
of any other diſeaſe, is wantonly and
vnneceſſarily to put God to manifeſt
his power and ſpeciall prouidence in
preſeruing them from the Plague:
therefore to runne into danger of the
plague without neceſſary cauſe, as
they do, who reſort as boldly, &amp;c. is a
tempting of the Almighty. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
or ſecond propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I proue
by the fourth of <hi>Mathew, verſe,</hi> 6. 7.
where Satan would haue perſwaded
Chriſt to caſt himſelfe downe from a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:881:42"/>
pinacle of the Temple, vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
that the Angels had charge
to preſerue him, being the Sonne of
God. Where it is to be noted, that
Chriſt doth not take knowledge of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
his abuſing the Pſalme 91. by him
alleaged, in putting in theſe words,
<hi>At anie time,</hi> for theſe, <hi>In all thy
wayes:</hi> but alledgeth another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
forbidding vs to tempt the Lord
our God. Whereby it is euident, that
to preſume vpon Gods protection,
when we are not in our wayes, or to
neglect meanes (as the ſtaires of the
pinacle were) is to tempt the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that without neceſſary cauſe:
to runne into danger, as Satan would
haue had Chriſt to haue done, is to be
out of our wayes, therefore to runne
into danger of the plague, without a
neceſſary cauſe, is to tempt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
Thus you ſée, that from the
prouidence of God, you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that either the plague is not
contagious, or we néed not ſhunne it
more than other diſeaſes. Indéed vpon
that ground, he that hath a neceſſary
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:881:42"/>
cauſe of reſort where the plague is,
may thus argue: It is the reuealed
will of God, that I am in my way, and
therefore haue a promiſe of preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if it ſhall be to Gods glory, and
my good, and it is not reuealed, that I
ſhall be infected, therefore I may procéed
with hope and comfort. I ſay more
from the prouidence of God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
the beléeuer ought in euery affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to conclude thus: Howſoeuer I
vſed meanes as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to preuent
this affliction,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 22, 23.</note> yet perceiuing by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
that God hath decréed it, I will
(by his grace) take it patiently as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
alſo did. Thus for your ſatiſfaction
I haue ſayd that which I thinke ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to the ſecond concluſion. But yet
if you haue any thing to reply, or any
other argument to obiect againſt the
infection of the Plague, I would not
haue you (in any caſe) to hold it in.</p>

               <speaker>Prof.</speaker>
               <p>If I ſtaggered and ſtumbled
before, how is it likely that I ſhould be

I am therefore to ſeeke ſupply
from another obiection, which if you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:881:43"/>
ouerthrow I muſt yeeld: for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
no moe. But before I aſſault you
with that, perceiuing by your diſcourſe,
that ſhunning the plague is the cauſe of
preſeruation, as being within the danger
thereof is the cauſe of infection, I pray
your iudgement touching flying into the
country for feare of infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which ſome
iuſtifie,<note place="margin">Pro. 22 3.</note> by theſe words of <hi>Salomon: The

            <sp>
               <speaker>Preach.</speaker>
               <p>If you had ſayd, <hi>a cauſe,</hi>
in ſtead of, <hi>the cauſe,</hi> you had more
rightly reported my mind: for I haue
deliuered ſundry cauſes or meanes of
Infection and Preſeruation. Amongſt
the reſt, I thinke, going, and abiding in
the countrey, to be an excellent meane
(in it ſelfe) of preſeruation. But that
this meane may be ſanctified to them
that vſe it, let it be conſidered, Who
may take the benefit thereof, and How
it is to be vſed. I thinke that they
whoſe reſidence is not neceſſary, may
take the benefit of going into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:881:43"/>
as well as a man, who hath a
large houſe, may remoue from one ſide
infected, to another not infected. But
let vs further examine this point by
conſidering thoſe 4. ſorts of people who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you taxed for running away,<note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> viz.
Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Phiſitians,
and rich men. As for Magiſtrates and
Miniſters, I thinke they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident:<note place="margin">Pag. 43. 44.</note>
the one for reaſons I gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
the other for reaſons no leſſe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
For when will they offer to God
the ſupplications of his people for
helpe and health, if not now, when
their miſerie is ſo great? When will
they comfort the afflicted, if not now,
when there be ſo many wofull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and wiues, parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
friends and kinſfolkes? When
will they preuaile againſt ſinne with
the word of exhortation, if not now,
when men are humbled with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſinne? And when will
they do good by preparing men to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and teaching them to make
good vſe of affliction, if not now, when
(euery houre) they looke to come to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:881:44"/>
triall of their faith and wiſedome in
Chriſt Ieſus? I will ſay no more, ſith
Chriſt hath ſayd inough, when he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it downe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 12.</note> as a property of an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leaue the ſhéepe when he ſéeth
the Wolfe comming. As for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
I onely propound this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
Whether they be bound in
conſcience to be reſident, in regard of
their profeſſion, and ability to do good,
or they may vſe their liberty to ſhift for
themſelues, &amp; (as they thinke) for their
liues, in regard they are no publicke
perſons, and liue (not by a common ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
but) by what they can get. But
howſoeuer this queſtion be anſwered,
I dare ſay thus much, That a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who may do much more good than
a keeper, hath as great intereſt in Gods
promiſe and prouidence. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Rich men to be conſidered, vnder
which name I vnderſtand alſo ſuch as
are able to prouide for themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
I thinke they may go and abide
in the countrey, ſith the good they can
do (as they be rich men) is to reléeue
the ſicke and néedy: which they may
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:881:44"/>
do well inough, without their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
if they were ſo well minded. To
which purpoſe I ſpake ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note>
But though they may be non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
yet they muſt not vſe their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 16.</note>
as a cloake of their naughtines,
and therefore let them conſider: how,
or with what cautions, they are to vſe
that benefite. The cautions be two:
One concerning Feare. The other
concerning Loue.<note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 2. 10. &amp; 137. 5. 6. Amos. 6. 6. Ro. 12. 15. Pſal. 137. 1. 2. 3.</note> Their feare muſt
be neither exceſſiue, one argument
whereof is, their careleſneſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for their ſoules, ſo they ſhift for
their bodies, nor too litle, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
when they forget miſerable
Ieruſalem, and giue themſelues to
pleaſure. Out of their Loue, they are
to mourne with, and pray for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
brethren,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> as if they themſelues
were in their caſe: they are to be no
leſſe liberall in reléeuing their afflicted
neighbours,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 7. 8.</note> then they ſhould be, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from authority or otherwiſe, if
they were reſident, and they are to
haue a ſpeciall care, that their ſeruants
whom they leaue behind,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> may be well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:881:45"/>
gouerned while they be in health, and
well prouided for, if they fall ſicke. If
they flie, not reſpecting theſe, or like
cautions, or good conſiderations, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
(as you ſay) reproue them iuſtly.
Otherwiſe I dare ſay they do not.</p>

I am, and will be willing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfy
you as I may. The truth is, many
abuſe that place to iuſtifie their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
feare, taking hold of the words
<hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Hide.</hi> Amongſt other, they
who will not come to Church becauſe
of the Plague: of whom I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
theſe queſtions: Whether they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:881:45"/>
thinke that becauſe of the Plague,
the Lords day ſhould, by warrant of
Gods word, ceaſe to be ſanctified by
an holy aſſembly? If not, but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeciall dayes of publike humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and prayer, are to be ordained and
kept, during the viſitation: then
what diſpenſation haue they to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from holy aſſemblies, more then
other? Againe, if the promiſe of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
belong to ſuch, as frequent holy
aſſemblies in time of this viſitation, as
to thoſe that truſt in God and walke in
their wayes: and if God can ſtrike
them with the Plague, as well tarying
at home, as comming to Church, what
griefe will it be to their conſcience (if
God do ſtrike them) to conſider that
they haue failed in faith, forſaken their
wayes, and are found in their ſinne?
Touching the place, whereunto you
would haue me ſay ſomewhat, thus I
vnderſtand it. The word <hi>Plague</hi> doth
ſignifie a ſtripe, or ſtroke, and therefore
not onely the Peſtilence, but euery pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for ſinne is meant thereby.
<hi>Hiding</hi> is put for <hi>Preſeruing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chro. 22. 11.</note> as <hi>Ioaſh</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:881:46"/>
was, by hiding preſerued from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But it is to be conſidered, from
what a prudent man hideth or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
himſelfe. In a Plague two
things are to be auoided. The wrath
of God, and the puniſhment it ſelfe.
That men may take héed of inordinate
feare, let them know that a prudent
man hideth not himſelfe, or obtaineth
preſeruation from the former, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then by Prayer and Faſting,
Faith and Repentance. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hide our ſelues from God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 7. &amp;c.</note> who is
infinite, but by God himſelfe. That is:
as the woman appealed from King
<hi>Philip</hi> ſléeping, to King <hi>Philip</hi> awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſo a prudent man hideth himſelfe
from Gods wrath, vnder Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 21.</note>
which is as great as himſelfe. As
we may learne by theſe ſayings of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid:
In the time of trouble the Lord
ſhall hide me in his Tabernacle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 5. &amp; 36. 7.</note> And:
<hi>How excellent is thy mercy, ô God,
therefore the children of men truſt vnder
the ſhadow of thy wings.</hi> As the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man hideth himſelfe from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
it ſelfe, he vſeth, and may vſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:881:46"/>
lawfull meanes, temporall, as well as
ſpirituall. And therfore a prudent man
may vſe lawfull meanes of preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as well from the Peſtilence, as
from other leſſe Plagues, or ſtrokes of
Gods anger: &amp; by conſequence, if ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
infection be a mean to preſerue, as
being within danger is a meane to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
then a prudent man may flie out of
the City infected, into the country not
infected: prouided his reſidence be not
neceſſary, and he obſerue cautions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
as I ſayd before.<note place="margin">Pag. 73.</note> This is
mine opinion touching flying into the
countrey for feare of Infection, and
that place concerning hiding our
ſelues from the Plague. Now let me

               <p>I haue troubled you ſo long,
that I trow it is high time to come out
with my laſt obiection, and yet (I tell you)
it is deemed none of the leaſt: for it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be againſt all reaſon, that the
Plague ſhould be infectiue, ſeeing it is
ſpoken of in the Scriptures ſo often, and
yet in no place is ſaid to be infectiue.</p>

               <p>Howſoeuer that ſéemeth, I
am ſure this is againſt all reaſon, to
make the Bible a booke of phiſicke: or to
conclude thus, the Scriptures do not in
any place ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague is infectiue,
therfore it is not infectiue. It may be as
well concluded thus: the Scriptures do
not in any place ſay that the French diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
commeth by whoredom, therefore
it commeth not by whoredome, and by
conſequence whoredom is not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for that cauſe. I obſerue with griefe
the humour of moſt to be this, if they
haue a mind to any ſinfull pleaſure, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
profit, or erronious opinion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they ſtoutly demaund: What expreſſe
Scripture haue you againſt it? Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
if they haue no mind to any holy
duty, then they muſt know where ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth expreſly commaund it. But
neighbor, tel me, do you not thinke that
baptizing of infants is lawfull, ſith it
may be iuſtified by ſound concluſions
from the word, though in all the new
Teſtament, there is neither precept for,
nor example of baptizing infants?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No doubt of it. But can you proue
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:881:47"/>
the plague to be infectiue by concluſions?
If you can, for Gods ſake let me heare
ſome, &amp; then I wil beleeue, through Gods

                  </note>
                  <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which may be ſufficient to proue
a point, wherein the ſcriptures ſéeme to
be ſo ſilent. But that I may giue you
contentment (if I can) at our parting, I
will ſhew you ſome other Scriptures
which ſpeake to this purpoſe. In the 14.
of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> verſe 21. God nameth foure
principall iudgements appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
viz. the ſword, famine, noiſome
beaſts, and peſtilence: where note, that
(without queſtion) thrée of them be fit
means in their nature to deſtroy many:
why not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peſtilence? Conſider further,
that God doth not threaten to deſtroy
by dogs, buls or ſuch like creatures; but
by noiſom beaſts, ſuch as ſhould deſtroy
not to ſatiſfie hunger, but to make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke:
as may appeare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction
of thrée and forty children,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 2. 24.</note> only by two
Beares: ſo in that God doth not kill by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:881:48"/>
the burning ague, conſumption, or any
other diſeaſe, when he meaneth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
many, but by the peſtilence (which
alſo is called Neiſome in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 91. Pſalme,
verſe. 3.) it is to be gathered, that the
Peſtilence is a deſtroyer by infection:
and the rather, becauſe God ſaith in the
26. of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> verſe 25. <hi>When ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in your cities to eſcape the ſword, I wil
ſend the Peſtilence amongest you.</hi> Why
ſhould the Peſtilence be more noiſome
when people are thruſt together, then
when they be ſeuered, but that it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious?
Laſtly, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 24. of the Acts, ver.
5. <hi>Paul</hi> is called a Peſtilent fellow, or
(according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> originall) Peſtilence it
ſelfe. And why? Becauſe as the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is contagious, ſo was he accuſed
to be by ſedition and hereſie. Doth it
not now appeare vnto you by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that the plague is contagious?</p>

               <p>It doth, I confeſſe it freely, and

Maieſtie for Chriſt his ſake, not to
charge me with that bloud wherof I may
be guiltie, by incouraging my ſelfe and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:881:48"/>
other, vnneceſſarily to runne into danger,
in maintaining that bloudy errour, as you
rightly call the denying of the plagues
infection: which error I wil neuer defend
againe whiles I liue, but will hereafter (by
Gods grace) take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well of headie
preſumption, as inordinate feare.</p>

               <p>I alſo thanke God with you,
in the name of Chriſt, for this bleſſing
of our conference: but neighbor, I muſt
put you in mind, and charge you with
your promiſe, to informe others. For it
may be that people, howſoeuer (for the
moſt part) they learne corrupt opinions
one from another, ſooner then ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from the godly and learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
yet they may conceiue this truth
better by your familiar talking with
them, then by my maner of teaching.
As children learne ſooner to ſpeake by
pratling one with another, then by
hearing the diſcourſes of their parents.
Therefore as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, When
thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen thy brethren:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note>
ſo I eftſoones require you, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in iudgement your ſelf, you wil
wiſely and zealouſly indeuor to reform
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:881:49"/>
the iudgement of other in an error of ſo
great danger. And withal I deſire you,
that if you méet with any argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the plagues infection, or for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained
repaire to the infected, that is
worth the anſwering, let me know it,
and I promiſe you either humbly to
yéeld to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, or clearely to anſwer it
when God ſhal be pleaſed that we méet
againe. In the meane while let vs pray
that God would ſanctifie this grieuous
viſitation both to Prince and people,
that thereby the King (whom God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
from all contagion both bodily
and ghoſtly) ſéeing ſo many thouſands
of his people dying wéekely, and that in
his royall Citie, and beginning of his
raigne, may be occaſioned to take héede
that he leaue not his firſt loue, decline
not from his profeſſed ſinceritie, and be
not drawne away from his owne ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes,
but rather to vow reformation
of whatſoeuer maybe found by diligent
inquirie, to be offenſiue in the Church
and common-wealth, and that thereby
the people may be ſtirred vp out of a
true faith to ſéeke the Lord, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:881:49"/>
of hart, confeſſion of mouth, and
amendment of life, that ſo he may be
found in due time to heale the ſores of
his people, and to reſtore health and
wealth to Iſrael. All which God grant
for Chriſt his ſonnes ſake, in whom he
hath profeſſed himſelfe to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 5. Heb. 12. 24</note>
as being the Mediatour of the new
couenant; whereby he bindeth himſelfe
not to take his mercies from vs,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 14, 15.</note> though
he chaſten vs with the rods of men.
To whom (for this time and euer)
