            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

also laboured night and day with prayers and tears

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER I had spent my poor labours among
the <hi>Indians</hi> for the space of neer four years,
it pleased God to stir up in them a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of partaking in the Ordinance of Baptism,
and other Ecclesiasticall Ordinances in way
of Church Communion. But I declared unto
them how necessary it was, that they should
first be Civilized, by being brought from their scattered and
wild course of life, unto civill Co-habitation and Government,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98746:6"/>
before they could, according to the will of God revealed in the
Scriptures, be fit to be betrusted with the sacred Ordinances of
Jesus Christ, in Church-Communion. And therefore I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto them, that they should look out some fit place to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a Towne, unto which they might resort, and there dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
enjoy Government, and be made ready and prepared to
be a People among whom the Lord might delight to dwell and
Rule.</p>
            <p>When they understood the mind of God in this matter, they
were desirous to set upon the work: The reallity of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
the living have actually expressed, by their performance
thereof (in some poor measure) and some of them dying, left
their earnest affections and desires with the rest, to set upon that
work; especially <hi>
                  <unclear>Wampocas</unclear>,</hi> a godly man, of whose death and
exhortations that way, I have made some mention in some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letters.</p>
            <p>We accordingly attended thereunto, to search for a fit place,
and finally, after sundry journeyes and travells to severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Lord did by his speciall providence, and answer of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
pitch us upon the place where we are at <hi>Natick.</hi> Unto
which place my purpose at first was to have brought all the
Praying <hi>Indians</hi> to Co-habit together: But it so fell out (by the
guidance of God, as it now appeareth) that because the <hi>Cohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
Indians</hi> desired a place which they had reserved for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and I finding that I could not at that time pitch there
without opposition from some <hi>English,</hi> I refused that place, and
pitched at <hi>Natick,</hi> where I found no opposition at present.
This choyce of mine did move in the <hi>Cohannet Indians</hi> a jealousie
that I had more affection unto those other <hi>Indians,</hi> then unto
them. By which occasion (together with some other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God, as the death of <hi>
                  <unclear>Cutshamoquin</unclear>,</hi> and the coming
of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sias,</hi> to succeed in the Sachemship in that place) their minds
were quite alienated from the place of <hi>Natick,</hi> though not from
the work, for they desire to make a Towne in that fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
place of their owne, named <hi>Ponkipog,</hi> and are now upon the
work. And indeed, it now appeareth to be of the Lord, because
we cannot have competent accommodations at <hi>Natick,</hi> for
those that be there, which are about fifty Lots, more or lesse.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98746:6"/>
And furthermore, by the blessing of God upon the work, there
are People, partly prepared, and partly preparing for three
Townes more. Insomuch, as that it is most evident, that had I
procceded according to my first intentions, to have called them
all unto that one place, we must have been forced very quickly
to have scattered againe, for want of accommodations for so
great a company of Inhabitants, and so have discouraged them
at our first onset of drawing them from their scattered way of
living, unto Co-habitation: seeing it would have brought them
unto such wants and streights as they could not have grapled
withall, but rather would have been occasioned to think there
were insuperable difficulties in this enterprise: Whereas in lesser
companies they may find a more plentifull and better course of
life then they found in that former way out of which they are
called; as through Gods mercy, and the bounty of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>England,</hi> whose love layeth the foundation-stone of the
work, they doe already feele and find at <hi>Natick,</hi> and begin to
find at <hi>Ponkipog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In prosecution of this work in the year 1650 we began by the
Lords assistance our first Towne at <hi>Natick,</hi> where we built a
Fort, and one dwelling-house. In the year 51 after Fasting and
Prayer about that matter, they gave up themselves and their
Children to be governed by the Lord, according to his word, in
all wayes of civility, and chose among themselves Rulers of ten,
fifty, and an hundred, <unclear>according</unclear> to the holy Patterne, so far as
they could: In which way of Government the Lord hath not a
little owned them, and blessed them.</p>
            <p>In the year 52 I perceiving the grace of God in sundry of
them, and some poor measure of fitnesse (as I was perswaded)
for the enjoyment of Church-fellowship, and Ordinances of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, I moved in that matter, according as I have in the
Narration thereof, briefly declared. In the year 53 I moved
not that way, for these Reasons.</p>
            <p>I having sent their Confessions to be published in <hi>England,</hi> I
did much desire to hear what acceptance the Lord gave unto
them, in the hearts of his people there, who daily labour at the
Throne of grace, and by other expressions of their loves, for an
holy birth of this work of the Lord, to the praise of Christ, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98746:7"/>
the inlargement of his Kingdome. As also my desire was, that
by such Books as might be sent hither, the knowledge of their
Confessions might be spread here, unto the better and fuller sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of many, then the transacting thereof in the presence
of some could doe. These Books came by the latter Ships (as
I remember) that were bound for <hi>New-England,</hi> and were but
newly out when they set saile, and therefore I had not that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that year, which my soule desired, though something I had
which gave encouragement, and was a tast of what I have more
<unclear>fully</unclear> heard from severall this year, praised be the Lord.</p>
            <p>Besides, there fell a great damping and discouragement upon
us, by a jealousie too deeply apprehended, though utterly
groundlesse, <hi>viz.</hi> That even these praying <hi>Indians</hi> were in a
conspiracy with others, and with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to doe mischief to
the <hi>English,</hi> In which matter, though the ruling part of the
People looked otherwise upon them, yet it was no season for me
to stir or move in this matter, when the waters were so troubled.
This businesse needeth a calmer season, and I shall account it a
savour of God when ever he shall please to cause his face to
shine upon us in it. Yet this I did the last year, after the Books
had been come a season, there being a great meeting at <hi>Beston,</hi>
from other Colonies as well as our owne, and the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
being there, I thought it necessary to take that opportunity
to prepare and open the way in a readinesse against this present
year, by making this Proposition unto them; namely, <hi>That
they having now seen their confessions, if upon further triall of them
in point of knowledge, they be found to have a competent measure
of understanding in the fundamentall points of Religion; and
also, if there be due testimony of their conversation, that they walke
in a Christian manner according to their light, so that Religion is
to be seen in their lives; whether then it be according to God, and
acceptable to his people, that they be called up unto Church-estate?</hi>
Unto which I had I blesse the Lord, a generall approbation.</p>
            <p>Accordingly this year 54 I moved the Elders, that they would
give me advice and assistance in this great businesse, &amp; that they
would at a fit season examine the <hi>Indians</hi> in point of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
because we found by the former triall, that a day will be
too little (if the Lord please to call them on to Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98746:7"/>
to examine them in points of Knowledge, and hear their
Confessions, and guide them into the holy Covenant of the Lord.
Seeing all these things are to be transacted in a strange language,
and by Interpreters, and with such a people as they be in these
their first beginnings. But if they would spend a day on purpose
to examine them in their knowledge, there would be so much
the more liberty to doe it fully and throughly (as such a work
ought to be) as also when they may be called to gather into
Church-Communion, it may suffice that some one of them should
make a Doctrinall Confession before the Lord and his people,
as the rule of faith which they build upon, the rest attesting their
consent unto the same: And themselves (the Elders I mean,
if the Lord so far assist the <hi>Indians,</hi> as to give them satisfaction)
might testifie that upon Examination they have found a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of knowledge in them to inable them unto such a work
and state. And thus the work might be much shortned, and
more comfortably expedited in one day. I found no unreadinesse
in the Elders to further this work.</p>
            <p>Some dispute there was about Officers in the Church, if they
should be found fit matter to proceed, of which I shall anon
speak God-willing.</p>
            <p>They concluded to attend the work, and for severall Reasons
advised that the place should be at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> and not at <hi>Natick,</hi>
and that the <hi>Indians</hi> should be called thither, the time they left
to me to appoint, in such a season as wherein the Elders may be
at best liberty from other publick occasions The time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was the 13 of the 4 moneth; mean while I dispatched Letters
unto such as had knowledge in the Tongue, requesting that they
would come and help in Interpretation, or attest unto the truth
of my Interpretations. I sent also for my Brother <hi>Mayhu,</hi> who
accordingly came, and brought an Interpreter with him. Others
whom I had desired, came not. I informed the <hi>Indians</hi> of this
appointment, and of the end it was appointed for, which they
therefore called, and still doe, when they have occasion to speak
of it, <hi>Natootomuhteáe kesuk, A day of asking Questions,</hi> or,
<hi>A day of Examination.</hi> I advised them to prepare for it, and to
pray earnestly about it, that they might be accepted among Gods
people, if it were the will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98746:8"/>
It pleased God so to guide, that there was a publick Fast of all
the Churches, betwixt this our appointment, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
thereof: which day they kept, as the Churches did,
and this businesse of theirs was a Principall matter in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</p>
            <p>It hath pleased God to lay his hand in sicknesse upon <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quassun</hi>
our <hi>Natick</hi> Schoolmaster, so that we greatly wanted his
help and concurrence in this businesse. Yea, and such is his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
(<hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Vlcer</hi> in his Lungs) that I fear the Lord will
take him away from us, to the great hindrance of our work, in
respect of humane means: <hi>Lord increase our faith!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There fell out a very great discouragement a little before
the time, which might have been a scandall unto them, and I
doubt not but Satan intended it so; but the Lord improved it to
stir up faith and Prayer, and so turned it another way: Thus it
was. Three of the unsound sort of such as are among them that
pray unto God, who are hemmed in by Relations, and other
means, to doe that which their hearts love not; and whose Vices
Satan improveth to scandalize and reproach the better sort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
while many, and some good People are too ready to say
they are all alike. I say three of them had gotten severall quarts
of Strong-water, (which sundry out of a greedy desire of a
little gaine, are too ready to sell unto them, to the offence and
grief of the better sort of <hi>Indians,</hi> and of the godly <hi>English</hi> too)
and with these liquors, did not onely make themselves drunk,
but got a Child of eleven years of age, the Son of <hi>Toteswamp,</hi>
whom his Father had sent for a little Corne and Fish to that
place near <hi>Watertowne,</hi> where they were. Unto this Child they
first gave too spoonfulls of Strong-water, which was more then
his head could bear; and another of them put a Bottle, or such
like Vessell to his mouth, and caused him to drink till he was
very drunk; and then one of them domineered, and said, <hi>Now
we will see whether your father will punish us for Drunkennesse</hi>
(for he is a Ruler among them) <hi>seeing you are drunk with us
for company;</hi> and in this case lay the Child abroad all night.
They also fought, and had been severall times Punished formerly
for Drunkennesse.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Toteswamp</hi> heard of this, it was a great shame and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98746:8"/>
breaking of heart unto him, and he knew not what to doe. The
rest of the Rulers with him considered of the matter, they found
a complication of many sins together.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The sin of Drunkennesse, and that after many former Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for the same.</item>
               <item>2 A willfull making of the Child drunk, and exposing him to
danger also.</item>
               <item>3 A degree of reproaching the Rulers.</item>
               <item>4 Fighting.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Word was brought to me of it, a little before I took Horse to
goe to <hi>Natick</hi> to keep the Sabbath with them, being about ten
dayes before the appointed Meeting. The Tidings sunk my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
extreamly, I did judge it to be the greatest <unclear>frowne</unclear> of God
that ever I met withall in the work, I could read nothing in it
but displeasure, I began to doubt about our intended work: I
knew not what to doe, the blacknesse of the sins, and the Persons
reflected on, made my very heart faile me: For one of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors
(though least in the offence) was he that hath been
my Interpreter, whom I have used in Translating a good part of
the Holy Scriptures; and in that respect I saw much of Satans
venome, and in God I saw displeasure. For this and some other
acts of Apostacy at this time, I had thoughts of casting him off
from that work, yet now the Lord hath found a way to humble
him. But his Apostacy at this time was a great Tryall, and I did
lay him by for that day of our Examination, I used another in
his room. Thus Satan aimed at me in this their miscarrying;
and <hi>Toteswamp</hi> is a Principall man in the work, as you shall have
occasion to see anon God-willing.</p>
            <p>By some occasion our Ruling Elder and I being together, I
opened the case unto him, and the Lord guided him to speak some
gracious words of encouragement unto me, by which the Lord
did relieve my spirit; and so I committed the matter and issue
unto the Lord, to doe what pleased him, and in so doing my soul
was quiet in the Lord. I went on my journey, being the 6 day of
the week; when I came at <hi>Natick,</hi> the Rulers had then a Court
about it. Soon after I came there, the Rulers came to me with
a Question about this matter, they related the whole businesse
unto me, with much trouble and grief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98746:9"/>
Then <hi>Toteswamp</hi> spake to this purpose, <hi>I am greatly grieved
about these things, and now God tryeth me whether I love Christ
or my Child best. They say, They will try me; but I say, God
will try me. Christ saith, He that loveth father, or mother, or
wife, or Child, better then me, is not worthy of me. Christ saith,
I must correct my Child, if I should refuse to doe that, I should
not love Christ. God bid Abraham kill his Son, Abraham loved
God, and therefore he would have done it, had not God with-held
him. God saith to me, onely punish your Child, and how can I
love God, if I should refuse to doe that?</hi> These things he spake in
more words, and much affection, and not with dry eyes: Nor
could I refraine from teares to hear him. When it was said,
The Child was not so guilty of the sin, as those that made him
drunk; he said, <hi>That he was guilty of sin, in that he feared not
sin, and in that he did not believe his counsells that he had often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, to take heed of evill company; but he had believed Satan
and sinners more then him, therefore he needed to be punished.</hi>
After other such like discourse, the Rulers left me, and went
unto their businesse, which they were about before I came, which
they did bring unto this conclusion, and judgement, They judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the three men to sit in the stocks a good space of time, and
thence to be brought to the whipping-Post, &amp; have each of them
twenty lashes. The boy to be put in the stocks a little while, and
the next day his father was to whip him in the School, before the
Children there; all which Judgement was executed. When they
came to be whipt, the Constable fetcht them one after another
to the Tree (which they make use of instead of a Post) where
they all received their Punishments: which done, the Rulers
spake thus, one of them said, <hi>The Punishments for sin are the
Commandements of God, and the worke of God, and his end was,
to doe them good, and bring them to repentance.</hi> And upon that
ground he did in more words exhort them to repentance, and
amendment of life. When he had done, another spake unto
them to this purpose, <hi>You are taught in Catechisme, that the
wages of sin are all miseries and calamities in this life, and also
death, and eternall damnation in hell. Now you feele some smart
as the fruit of your sin, and this is to bring you to repentance, that
so you may escape the rest.</hi> And in more words he exhorted them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98746:9"/>
to repentance. When he had done, another spake to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Heare all yee people</hi> (turning himselfe to the People who
stood round about, I think not lesse then two hundred, small
and great) <hi>this is the Commandement of the Lord, that thus it
should be done unto sinners; and therefore let all take warning by
this, that you commit not such sins, least you incur these Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
And with more words he exhorted the People. Others
of the Rulers spake also, but some things spoken I understood
not, and some things slipt from me: But these which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
remained with me.</p>
            <p>When I returned to <hi>Roxbury,</hi> I related these things to our
Elder, to whom I had before related the sin, and my grief: who
was much affected to hear it, and magnified God. He said also,
That their sin was but a Transient act, which had no Rule, and
would vanish: But these Judgements were an Ordinance of
God, and would remaine, and doe more good every way, then
their sin could doe hurt, telling me what cause I had to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for such an issue: Which I therefore relate, because the
Lord did speak to my heart, in this exigent, by his words.</p>
            <p>When the Assembly was met for Examination of the <hi>Indians,</hi>
and ordered, I declared the end and Reason of this Meeting, and
therefore declared, That any one, in due order, might have liberty
to propound any Questions for their satisfaction. Likewise, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
the Assembly, That if any one doubted of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that should be given of their Answers, that they would
Propound their doubt, and they should have the words scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and tryed by the Interpreters, that so all things may be done
most clearly. For my desire was to be true to Christ, to their
soules, and to the Churches: And the trying out of any of their
Answers by the Interpreters, would tend to the satisfaction of
such as doubt, as it fell out in one Answer which they gave; the
Question was, <hi>How they knew the Scriptures to be the word of
God?</hi> The finall Answer was, Because they did find that it did
change their hearts, and wrought in them wisedome and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This Answer being Interpreted to Assembly, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mahu</hi> doubted, especially of the word <hi>[Hohpoóonk]</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<hi>Humility,</hi> it was scanned by the Interpreters, and proved
to be right, and he rested satisfied therein. I was purposed my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98746:10"/>
selfe to have written the Elders Questions, and the <hi>Indians</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
but I was so imployed in propounding to the <hi>Indians</hi> the
Elders Questions, and in returning the <hi>Indians</hi> Answers, as that
it was not possible for me to write, unlesse I had caused the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
to stay upon it, which had not been fitting; therefore
seeing Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> writing, I did request him to write the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and Answers, and help me with a Copy of them, which I
thank him, he did, a Copy whereof I herewith send to be inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this place, on which, this only I will animadvert, That the
Elders in wisdome thought it not fit to ask them in Catechisticall
method strictly, in which way Children might Answer: But that
they might try whether they understood what they said, they
traversed up and downe in Questions of Religion, as here you
see.</p>

not to believe the gracious Promises in Iesus Christ? Or whether
when you find wickednesse in your heart, you are not tempted, that
you cannot believe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> My heart doth strongly desire to goe on in sin, but this

               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doe some believe in Christ, and not others, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the difference?</p>
            <p>

and they hearken to him, and God speaks to others, and they
believe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doe they believe God?</p>

giveth us the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the New Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Covenant of Grace, Repent and believe in Christ,
and be saved.</p>

saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth thy heart desire Iesus Christ more then sin, and
thy former Idolls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Before we prayed to God, I did not desire Jesus Christ,
I did desire my sins, but now I see my need of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why doe you need Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When I dye, Christ carrieth my soule to heaven.</p>

We need Jesus Christ, because we are full of sinne.</p>

breaks my heart.</p>

Some or other of the Elders did severall times publickly call
upon the Interpreters, to be attentive to all things that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because they must relye upon their testimony, or to
that purpose, praying them to speak if they doubted of
any thing.</p>
            <p>In the conclusion, the Elders saw good to call upon the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

            <p>WHen the day was well spent, in this above-written man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
some that were aged desired that an end might
be put unto this work for this time, because by this tast which
they had, they saw that which gave them comfortable satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Then I desired that (if it might be without prejudice to
any) they might be further tryed with Questions about Christ,
and grace wrought in us by the Spirit; and about the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christ (concerning which, no Questions had been yet
propounded) and also about the <unclear>estate</unclear> of man after death, of
the resurrection of the dead, and of the last Judgement, wherein
they were, through the grace of Christ, in some measure instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
But it was said, that they did perceive that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in points of Catechisme, by what they had heard from
them. When they came to a conclusion, one of the Elders <hi>(viz.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Ezek: Rogers)</hi> having first privately conferred with such of
the Elders as sate near him, spake words of acceptance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
both to me, and to the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the name of the
rest. But Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> did not write them, and therefore I omit
the rehearsing of them.</p>
            <p>This great and solemne work of calling up these poor <hi>Indians</hi>
unto that Gospel light and beauty of visible Church-estate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98746:15"/>
now passed through a second Tryall: In the former where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
of, they expressed what experience they had found of Gods
grace in their hearts, turning them from dead works, to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the living God, and salvation in our Saviour Jesus Christ.
In this second they have in some measure declared how far the
Lord hath let in the light of the good knowledge of God into
their soules, and what tast they have of the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and doctrine of salvation. Now the Question remaineth,
<hi>What shall we further doe? And when shall they enjoy the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Iesus Christ in Church-estate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work is very solemne, and the Question needeth a solemn
Answer. It is a great matter to betrust those with the holy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Gods honse, upon which the name of Christ is so
much called, who have so little knowledge and experience in the
waye; of Christ, so newly come out of that great depth of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and wild course of life; in such danger of polluting and
defiling the name of Christ among their barbarous friends and
Countrey-men; and under so many doubts and jealousies of
many people; and having not yet stood in the wayes of Christ
so long, as to give sufficient proof and experience of their sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse
in their new begun profession. Being also the first
Church gathered among them, it is like to be a pattern and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of after proceedings, even unto following Generations.
Hence it is very needfull that this proceeding of ours at first, be
with all care and warinesse guided, for the most effectuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the holinesse and honour of Jesus Christ among
them.</p>
            <p>Upon such like grounds as these, though I and some others
know more of the sincerity of some of them, then others doe,
and are better satisfied with them: Yet because I may be in a
temptation on that hand, I am well content to make slow hast
in this matter, remembring that word of God, <hi>Lay hands sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
upon no man</hi> Gods works among men, doe usually goe
on slowly, and he that goeth slowly, doth usually goe most
surely, especially when he goeth by counsell. <hi>Sat cito si sat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
the greater proof we have of them, the better approbation
they may obtain at last. Besides, we having had one publick
meeting about them already this summer, it will be difficult to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98746:16"/>
compasse another, for we have many other great occasions,
which may hinder the same, and it is an hard matter to get In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
together to attend such a work, they living so remote.
The dayes also will soon grow short, and the nights cold, which
will be an hindrance in the attendance unto the accomplishment
of that work, which will most fitly be done at <hi>Natick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all other Reasons this is greatest, that they l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving
in sundry Towns and places remote from each other, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
few to take care of them, it is necessary that some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
should be trained up, and peculiarly instructed, unto whom
the care of ruling and ordering of them in the affaires of Gods
house may be committed, in the absence of such as look after
their instruction. So that this is <unclear>now</unclear> the thing we desire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
for the comfort of our little <hi>Sister that hath no breasts,</hi> that
such may be trained up, and prepared, unto whom the charge of
the rest may be committed in the Lord. And upon this ground
we make the slower hast to accomplish this work among them.
Mean while I hope the Commissioners will afford some encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
for the furtherance of the instruction of some of the
most godly and able among them, who may be in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
helpfull unto the rest, in due order and season.</p>
            <p>And thus have I briefly set down our present state in respect
of our Ecclesiasticall proceedings. I beg the prayers of the good
people of the Lord, to be particularly present at the Throne of
Grace, in these matters, according as you have hereby a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Information how our condition is. And for me also, who
am the most unfit in humane reason for such a work as this, but
my soule desireth to depend and live upon the Lord Jesus, and
fetch all help, grace, mercy, assistance, and supply from him.
And herein I doe improve his faithfull Covenant and Promises,
and in perticular, the Lord doth cause my soule to live upon
that word of his, <hi>Psal. 37. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</hi> wherein I have food,
<unclear>rayment</unclear>, and all necessaries for my selfe and Children (whom I
have dedicated unto the Lord, to serve him in this work of his, if
he will please to accept of them) and this supply I live upon in
these rich words of gracious Promise, <hi>vers. 3. Trust in the Lord,
and doe good, dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein also I find supply of grace to believe the conversion of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98746:16"/>
these poor <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp; that not only in this present season, in <unclear>what</unclear>
I doe already see, but in the future also, further then by mine eye
or reason I can see. Which supply of grace, I live upon in
those words of his gracious Promise, which I apply and improve
in this particular respect, <hi>vers. 4. Delight thy selfe also in the
Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein also I find supply of grace to believe, that they shall
be in Gods season, which is the fittest, brought into Church-Estate;
faith fetching this particular blessing out of the rich
Fountaine of those gracious words of Promise, <hi>Commit thy way
unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to passe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein also my soule is strengthned and quieted, to stay upon
the Lord, and to be supported against all suspitious jealousies,
hard speeches, and unkindnesses of men touching the sincerity
and reallity of this work, and about my carriage of matters, and
supply herein. Which grace my soule receiveth by a particular
improvement of that rich treasury of the Promise in these words,
<hi>vers. 6. And he shall bring forth thy righteousnesse as the light,
and thy judgement as the noon day.</hi> And herein likewise I find
supply of grace, to wait patiently for the Lords time, when year
after year, and time after time, I meet with disappointments.
Which grace I receive from the commanding force of that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promise, <hi>vers. 7. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for
him, fret not thy selfe,</hi> either for one cause, or for another. Thus
I live, and thus I labour, here I have supply, and here is my hope,
I beg the help of prayers, that I may still so live and labour in
the Lords work, and that I may so live and dye.</p>
