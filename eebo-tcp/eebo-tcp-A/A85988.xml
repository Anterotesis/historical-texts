            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Variety of Diſpenſations hath he
carried us through both publiquely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally.
Viſits of Iudgement, and then
of Mercy, we have had from him again
and again. No wayes hath he left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
that might do us good, though
our Returns have not been anſwerable. The
Sword, Famine and Plague ranged in theſe
parts upon Gods Errand at my firſt coming,<note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note>
and continued a conſiderable time. I was
thereby occaſioned to contribute my utmoſt
by the Lords Aid, to the relief and cure
of mens ſouls and bodies. It was then my
<pb facs="tcp:114749:3"/>
cordial delight and deſire to ſpend and be
ſpent for the good of <hi>Limrick;</hi> as the ſame
is ſtill my deſign and labour through the
aſſiſtance of Heaven. The <hi>Voyce of Gods Rod</hi>

phyſick us, ſuiting his Preſcripts to our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.
Few in this place did miſs of
a Touch; the deeper ſmartings of many
among us warned all the reſt. Our ſins
deſerved much worſe from his hand, yet
he afflicted us very favourably. In the
<hi>midſt of wrath he remembred mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Habac. 2. 2.</note>

could more be done for us then he hath

others heart-ſick with feavouriſh Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Heads of ſome labour with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions;
the Vitals of others ſuffer defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Spiritual Lethargies benumb ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſleep and mortal dreams; raging Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies
do inflame ſome others. Some are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
mad with pleaſing Conceits; others
melancholy through a ſullen ſpirit: Lethal
Apoplexies take ſome few ſuddenly; and
ſpiritual Palſies ſeiz upon others more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually.
Some have loſt Appetite to the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Heaven; others ſeem to hunger, but
digeſt not well. Spiritual Rickets do poſſeſs
divers, and ſinful Gouts trouble not a few.
<pb facs="tcp:114749:5"/>
Various obſtructions diſorder mens ſouls,
whence the disfiguring of their Life and
Acts. Internal ſtoppages often diſcolour the
external man; the falling-ſickneſs and the
ſwounding fits do alſo take turns in ſouls
and Societies. Conſumptions and Dropſies
appear ſo viſibly, that they prognoſticate but
Ominous things. Sad Symptoms are ſeen
in mens faces and ſpeech, their tongues and
breathings concurring therewith. If you feel
their pulſe and Beatings of heart, you may
ſoon deſcrie Syncopal Tokens. Schirrhus'<hi>s</hi>
and hardneſs are eaſily felt; ſwellings and
ſores manifeſt themſelves. Thus this world
appears a ſinful Hoſpital for the God of
mercy to give viſits to. What comes away
from men, proves a Semeiotick that points
at the Cure by ſad Characters. The Cauſes
of ſuch dangerous Affects muſt needs be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and multiplicious. Diſeaſes compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and inveterate, beſpeak a difficult and
a dubious Cure. Secreſie and ſtrength add
much to that evil, beſides ſenſleſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs.
Diſorder in food and in exerciſe with
ſloth and ſlumber aggravate the ſame Strains
and Ruptures with Diſlocations, Tumors
<pb facs="tcp:114749:5"/>
and Wounds manifeſt more evil. Humours
and ſpirits being diſtempered do ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
the ſubſtantial parts. Exceſs in Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and vacuity, in number and extent, ſtill
do make it worſe. Retention of evil &amp; waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good, do both teſtifie the method of
help. Indications thus being ſo various, its no
wonder if the cure be ſlow both in Church
and State. Purgations total and particular,
muſt attend diet, reſt and all due help. Both
the Patients care and all Aſsiſtants, will be as
needful as the Phyſitians skil. Politick Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
and Eccleſiaſtical had need look to
Chriſt for skil, ſtrength, ſucceſs. Choice and
cordial Preſervatives, Alexipharmacks are
often needed, where malignity doth infeſt
mens ſouls. Induſtrious Care and painful
attendance will be found herein of exceeding
need. The Ladies hand and the Eagles eye,

things which others have elaborately
handled, to uſher in the Scope and Subſtance of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>1. The Nature and Idea thereof conſiſts much in a
ſinfull ſtraying of mans Judgement from the Truth of
God into falſhood. 1. Mans Judgement is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Subject and Seat thereof: (we meddle not now the
Angels Failures) from whence it caſts a malign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon all other Powers and Parts.</p>
            <p>2. Its <hi>Genus</hi> is ſtraying or wandring.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So the Greek
properly imports, a ſlipping and ſliding from Truth into
falſhood and by-ways.</p>
            <p>3. Its difference lies in both the terms. Firſt, From which
it ſwerves; <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> from the Truth
of God. Secondly, To which it leads, the <hi>Terminus ad
quem,</hi> into falſhood. So its diſtinguiſhed from bare Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,

both negative and privative; Error being a
ſoul-ſickneſs, an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a diſorderly Diſtemper, diſpoſing
to evil poſitively, both habitual and actual, as it deprives
of and indiſpoſes to that good, r<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſpecting the Souls health;
It differs alſo from Scruples and doubts, which are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
motives from Truth, and weaker Inclinations to
falſhood, as the grudgings and Rudiments of ſpiritual
diſeaſes. Its likewiſe differenced thereby from Heart-Hypocriſie
and verbal lies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Errors Deſcent fetches its Extract from the
Prince and Father of <hi>Lies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> who abode not in the Truth,
but drew thouſands of glorious Angels,<note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> who kept not their

               </gap>ous Queries was ſoon caſt into our firſt Parents,
where it quickly bred Error and all ſin. That unhappy
Breath ſo ſtrongly infected them, that this ſinfull diſeaſe
is become hereditary to all their natural Poſterity. This
wofull Leproſie hath been thus propagated from our Head
<hi>Adam</hi> to all his Iſſue, through the loins of ſinfull parents.
It cleavs to mans Nature, and hath been in all ages ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively
communicated by a wofull <hi>Series</hi> in all ſorts,
more or leſs.<note place="margin">Levit. 14. 44, 45.</note> As the Leproſie cleaving to the Wall, could
never be totally removed, till the Wall it ſelf was quite
pulled down: So doth this Plague cleave to mans ſoul,
till mans diſſolution. <hi>Adam</hi> received at once the ſeed of
corporal and ſpiritual Diſeaſes and death, in the ſame
moment that he began to ſin, he began to die, according to
Gods Word; from whence the progreſs of a dying life in
him, and all his, till Grace begin that ſpiritual Life
below that Glory compleats above. Iſrael had contracted
their wofull Leproſie from that <hi>Aegypt</hi> that enſlaved
them;<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 27.</note> ſo is our ſpiritual Leproſie contracted from that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
<hi>Aegyt</hi> which hath poiſoned us ſo deſperately, and
<pb facs="tcp:114749:7"/>
infeſts ſtill the <hi>Canaan-State</hi> of Chriſts militant
Church.<note place="margin">Dato uno ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdo, mille ſequuntur. Cadmei Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Adag.</note> As Truth is a moſt diffuſive Good, ſo is Error
a moſt diffuſive Evil. Error like a ſtone thrown into the
water, riſes in Circles, each Circle begetting another and
growing ſtill wider till they all quite loſe themſelves in
the end. Like <hi>Cadmus</hi> Brood they ſtart up ſuddenly, and as
ſoon fall foul each on other.</p>
            <p>3. The Species and Sorts of Error are multiplicious,
like the diſeaſes that trouble the body. As there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſorts and denominations of divine Truths, ſo are there
as many diſtinctions of Errors. The ſpecifical difference
of each Error is meaſurable ſtill by the dimenſion of that
Truth it oppoſes and ſtrayes from, and of that falſhood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which it ſlides.<note place="margin">Veritas Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Indicis &amp; Entis, apud Scholaſticos.</note> The Truth of God is the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Thoughts, Words and Works, to his own glorious
Eſſence. The Truth of man is the due conformity of man
to that Truth of God, whether mental, verbal or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Error is accordingly diverſified in its general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation;
but properly to our purpoſe it is reſtrained
to the Iudgement, and diſtinguſhed from other ſins which
are verbal or practical Errors, flowing from mans Will
and affections more directly. That Truth of God is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſiderable in matters of Religion, either funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
or juxta-fundamental,<note place="margin">Errores qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom citra, alii circa, alii con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra fundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi divertunt, Secundi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertunt, tertii ſubvertunt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxam.</note> or more ſuperficial and
circumſtantial. Error is accordingly diſcernable in its
ſeveral wandrings from that Truth. The Scripture of
Truth declares the ſame in all their ſpecifical variations.
Tue Fundamentals of Religion are ſummed up in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Faith, called the Apoſtles Creed, becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of their writtings; which Symbol hath been
ſucceſsively explained by the ſeveral Confeſsions of the
primitive Churches, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi>
Creed, as alſo of the Reformed in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,
<pb facs="tcp:114749:8"/>
Belgium,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. As there are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Weeds and poiſons about the earth which peculiarly
offend the ſeveral parts of the Body, ſome being more
hurtfull to the head, ſome to the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Errors offend the ſeveral parts of Truth, whence
various deſignations are given to them.</p>
            <p>4. The Gradations and Degrees of Error admit alſo
of a variable Latitude, according to the variation of its
aggravations. As diſeaſes do vary in their gradual receſs
from health, being either ſimple or compound, either more
or leſs malignant &amp; hurtfull; Thus Errors admit of many
adjuncts which render them more or leſs ſinful and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
In every Error there is a ſinfulneſs, an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a defect of Truth <hi>privative,</hi> &amp; a diſpoſition to falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<hi>poſitive.</hi> As in every diſeaſe there is an evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or ſound diſpoſition of the body;
ſo in Error from that of the mind. But this deflection
is not alike in all, but is cloathed with numerical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and perſonal aggravations. Some Errors are more,
and others leſs rooted: Some are more ſingle, and others
complicate. Some are more ſubmiſsively held, and others
more pertinaciouſly: ſome are kept cloſe, &amp; others publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſome have more of the Will and Affections attending
them, others leſs: ſome are more, and others leſs pernicious:
ſome are more quiet, others more turbulent. As the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of infectious diſeaſes admits of a great Latitude: as
the variety of venomous Creatures, whether Plants,
Minerals or Senſitives, is multipliciouſly diverſified by
the variations of their clime, intentions of degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſome being cold as <hi>Hemlock,</hi> others hot as <hi>Euphorbium:</hi>
ſome in the firſt or ſecond, others in the third or fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
ſome working more ſlowly, others more quickly: ſome
by their Tail, as the <hi>Scorpion:</hi> ſome by their Teeth, as
<pb facs="tcp:114749:8"/>
the Viper and Rattle-ſnake; ſome by their Tongue, others
by their Excrements: ſome more ſenſibly, as a mad Dog;
ſome more inſenſibly, as the <hi>Aſp:</hi> So do Errors appear
under variety of offenſive qualities and adjuncts.</p>
            <p>5. The Cauſe of <hi>Error</hi> alſo, as of every diſeaſe, is
multipliciouſly obſervable, eſpecially in a three-fold
<hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Evident, Antecedent,</hi> and <hi>Continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. An <hi>Evident Cauſe</hi> among Phyſicians, is much
from Externals, if not altogether, whereby a Diſtemper
is occaſioned in the body. So in mans ſoul this ſickneſs
of <hi>Error</hi> may be occaſioned by external Cauſes, as by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ill company, bad books, various Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. An <hi>Antecedent Cauſe</hi> of ſickneſs bodily, is from
ſome thing within, whether vapor, humor or Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempering
any part, &amp; diſabling it from its proper Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus the foregoing Cauſe of this ſpiritual diſeaſe, lies
in ſome flatuous, humorous or ſpiritual evil that diſorders
the mind from its right diſcerning of the Truth, cauſing it
to deviate into the way of falſhood.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> Habitual Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within, flowing from <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, (which is ours by
Imputation,) attended with the want of original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and often called original ſin, becauſe the womb
of all ſin in us) is the chief cauſe from which all other
evils flow, that breed and increaſe theſe ſad diſtempers.
This Corruption acts variouſly in the way of Pride and
Self-ſeeking, Security and Worldlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Continent Cauſe</hi> of a corporal diſtemper is
that immediate thing which cheriſhes it, being cheriſhed
from the remote cauſe, whether corrupt blood, wind,
water, gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the continent Cauſe of Error, is
that peculiar Corruption whether. Ignorance or Pride, ſelf-conceitedneſs
or worldlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſticks cloſe to
the mind, to breed and cheriſh its ſeveral dyſcraſies and
<pb facs="tcp:114749:9"/>
diſtempers. Thence ſuch clouding of mens Iudgements
and diſorders in their Reaſonings:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> hence perverſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputings</hi>
of men that are <hi>reprobate concerning</hi> the
Faith; as Ambition and Pride carried <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander,
Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi> away; Diſcontent
and Envy prevailed with <hi>Arrius;</hi> Covetouſneſs carried on
<hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Comrads. There is a Complication of
ſuch cauſes in moſt.</p>
            <p>6. The Effects of <hi>Error,</hi> as of every corporal diſeaſe, are
likewiſe variouſly numerous, according to the variations
of its numerical Idea, of its ſpecifical nature, of its deſcent,
gradations &amp; cauſes. This ſpiritual ſickneſs is a Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to further ſin &amp; eternal Death; as every bodily ſickneſs
is the beginning of corporal death.<note place="margin">Rom, 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The wages of ſin is
death;</hi> ſin deſerves it, it binds ever, it leads to it, it fits
for it, it begins it. As much as there is of ſinfulneſs, ſo
much is there of death attending it, Corporal &amp; civil, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Eternal. Grace indeed doth reſtrain and limit,
it pardons and ſubdues, it purges out gradually, and at laſt
exterminates all ſin in Gods Elect; yet it changes not the
Nature or deſert of ſin, though it chances the ſinners na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and relation. Providence limits and over-rules this
ſinfulneſs alſo in the Reprobate. As the wiſe Phyſitian
corrects his <hi>Opium</hi> in a Confection; ſo doth God correct
ſin remaining in his Children. As the ſame Phyſitian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
fit means againſt infection to all indefinitely, ſo doth
our Soveraign Phyſician by ſhewing the dangerous effects
of Error. As the effects of Poiſons are very various, yet
always ſad: ſo are ſin and ſorrrw inſeparable Twins. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was ſet forth to the Life by that Leproſiy of the head,
which had a peculiar mark of Ignominy,<note place="margin">Levit. 13. 29, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Infection and
danger. Its like to thoſe poiſonous Minerals and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which ſtrike firſt ai the head, and thence at all other
<pb facs="tcp:114749:9"/>
parts. Its a ſpiritual Plague which cannot but be miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſtill, though not in all alike. All ſorts of men in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are made to feel the ſad Conſequents thereof. Its
a fruitfull womb, a breeding dung hill, a poiſoned ſpring,
<hi>Lerna malorum.</hi> It engages and leads inſenſibly to more
evil, notional and practical. It diſgraces God, oppoſes his
Truth, diſtempers mens ſouls, endangers their families,
blaſts their Profeſsion, ſtains their Repute, ſcandalizes
many, enſnares divers, troubles Church and State, and
complies with Satan in his various deſignes, by nurſing of
his brood. This Age gives ſad demonſtations thereof. As
Cephalical diſeaſes are on many accounts the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
of all in the Body: ſo are theſe heady diſtempers in
the ſoul, which are eaſily communicated to all the vital &amp;
inferior parts. The poiſon of ſome works in a ſtupifying
way, as <hi>Opium, Henbane, Hemlock,</hi> &amp;c. others venom
acts by an enraging quality, as <hi>Elaterium, Euphorbium,
Scammony:</hi> The effect of ſome is more ſpeedily mortal,
as in the Touches of a <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> and <hi>Aſp,</hi> of the <hi>Viper</hi>
and <hi>rattle Snake,</hi> if not very timely look'd to; others are
more ſlow and leſs dangerous, as in the operations of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſimples appears. The Parallel of ſpiritual Poiſons
therewith is eaſily drawn by an obſerving Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>7. The Symptoms or Signs of Error, as of Corporal deſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
are of divers ſorts, ſome more <hi>Common,</hi> others more
<hi>Proper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>common ſigns</hi> are ſuch as attend divers diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in a general way, as enfeebling of the parts, change of
complexion, Indipoſition to action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Errors have
their <hi>Common ſigns,</hi> wherein many of them agree, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
much in their ſad effects againſt Gods Honor and
mans good, though often under far Colors, like that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Apple in the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands,</hi> which ſeems beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and yet is rank poiſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114749:10"/>
2. There are proper Tokens and characteriſtical <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and notes of each bodily diſeaſe, ſetting out its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical
Idea by its numerical and peculiar properties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one or more, and uſually by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and Concurrence
of divers, as a Frenſie, a Lethargy, an Apoplexy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have ſingular marks from the defect and diſorders of the
faculties animal, vital and natural.</p>
            <p>Thus Error, the Frenſie of the ſoul, when boiled up to
its height, ſets a man on a rage againſt Truth and her
friends, rejects the Means of its cure, raves and ranges
at Will, inflames the Spirits, diſorders all the powers and
parts, haſtning to deſtruction, as appeared in the ranting
Crue, formerly and lately in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England;</hi>
another error may more reſemble a Lethargy, benumming
the Soul, fixing the Spirits, caſting the perſon into a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voriſh
ſleep, ſtopping the ſenſes, filling them with dreams,
cloſing their eyes, and diſtempering all powers and parts,
rendering them incapable of ſenſe and help, if the Lord
work not extraordinarily, witneſs <hi>James Naylor</hi> and
his quaking Rout.</p>
            <p>Another Error may be found more like an Apoplexie;
ſuddenly taking away ſenſe and motion, reaſon and life,
as that of ſome Circumcellions, and the bloody rabble of
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> from <hi>Anno</hi> 1522.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Sleidan, Cloppenburg, Hornebeck, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger, Luther, Calvin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> till
1534. Another is more like a <hi>Palſey,</hi> ſtopping the
fountain of the ſinews, either totally or partially by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempering
the head and its Conduits, whereby ſenſe and
motion are conveyed to all inferior parts, and gradually
haſtning mans end. So it fares with divers Quakers
now, and many monkiſh Phariſaical Notioniſts, <hi>Roſe-Crucians,
Eremitical Recluſes</hi> and <hi>Behmeniſts.</hi> Thus
might we inſtance in every diſeaſe, and draw the parallel
of Error along in its various Symptoms and Characters;
<pb facs="tcp:114749:10"/>
the which are accompanied with malignity and infection,
with Confidence and peremptorineſs, with Cenſoriouſneſs
and ſelf-conceitedneſs, more or leſs, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Extent and Cauſes of ſuch diſtempers. But as ſome
poiſonous Weeds do very nearly reſemble the good plants
among which they grow, as young Hemlock among Parſley;
So divers Errors grow like Truth for a while, till they
come up to ſtrength (which they do much faſter then good
hearbs) to be better diſcerned by their ill qualities and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
effects.</p>
            <p>8. The Cure of Error, as of bodily ſickneſs, is diverſly
to be obſerved in the Indications directing thereto, in the
materials to be uſed, and in the due method of preparing
and miniſtring of them ſutably to the Rules of Art, and
the Patients Caſe.</p>

                  </gap>. Galen.</note> The Indications of Error, as of the bodily diſeaſes,
require the removing of the Cauſe, the rectifying of the

and Salute, an entrancee into the ſubſtantial diſcourſe
following; by a Divine Inſinuation into their mind and

deſcribes at large, in their Perſons and Doctrines, in their riſe
and Ruine, in their acts and Methods, in their Principles and

and unbowels thoſe Tragical deſigns of Hell diſguiſed under

he is from Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> the more unſteady, according to the Nature
and degree of Error: ſo is the ſoul more or leſs looſened
from Chriſt, that Divine Anchor. The looſer any member
is in the Body from the Head, the leſs ſteady ſtil. Error is
that malignant humour,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> that diſlocates and benums Chriſts
Members, breeding ſinful palſies and Relaxations; It works

A Limb weakened cannot be firm and ſteady. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
infeebles and enervates the ſoul, devouring its vigour and
Livelineſs proportionably to its Degree. There is a ſecret
malignity therein, which ſtrikes at the Vitals: Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
are that radical moiſture and native heat which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſoul in life and ſtrength. Error preys upon them
a main, breeding varieties of Feavers and Rickets, waſtings and
languiſhings of every part. As in the Building ſtones decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
endanger themſelves and the whole: ſo doth Error, by

Satan gets in by degrees into men,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1, 4, 5.</note> as he did with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
His inſinuations are carried on by plauſable Queries.
He breeds doubtings and ſcruples, which ſoon grow up into
pertinacious Errors. His ſpawn is dubious and inconſiderable
at firſt, but it thrives apace, like the weeds of the dung-hill;
ſtrength being gotten, it preys for it ſelf, being humorous
and ambitious, it makes brawls and contentions, then diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſeparations. Thence ſuch lamentable departings from
Gods goodneſs and good men. Hence ſuch impoſtumes
and inflamations, ſuch Tympanies and Ruptures in the ſouls

               <p>Error is your ſeeming freind, your real enemy. Its a Boſom
Traitor, that correſponds with Satan ſtill to betray and ruin
you. The poiſon is ſubtile, but deſperate, though of various
degrees. There is a latitude in ſuch diſtempers, but the leaſt
is bad enough. The giddineſs inclines to phrenſie and faling
ſickneſs, diſeaſes and errors admit of gradations. <hi>Nemo de
repentè peſſimus.</hi> A Bodkin may wound to the very heart; ſo
will an error with little ſhew and ſence. The more erroneous,
the more ſubject ſtill to apoſtatize.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18, 19.</note> Spirits of error, will tear

his chief buſineſs, as Mediator, being to
procure effectual Reconciliation, to the ſaving of his people,
by his perfect Oblation preſented to God,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21.</note> for them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to them by Gods Spirit;<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7</note> He aſſumed the Name and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Jeſus the Saviour;<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> He was anointed as the Chriſt of
God; with all ſuitable qualifications: and made Lord of all,
but eſpecially made our Lord and Saviour, by perſonal appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,
and effectual application.</p>
               <p>Thus was Chriſt voluntarily made of a woman under the
Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> ſubjecting himſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4, 5.</note> in that wonderful diſpenſation of his
Mediation, to receive from the Father, his Call to that redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Function.</p>
               <p>There was no defect in God, but in us only, who wanted
skil,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.</note> power and will utterly, to the curing and ſaving of our
ſelves.<note place="margin">Act. 3. 21, 22, 23.</note> Chriſt therefore was divinely anointed to be our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> Prieſt and Prince, to effect all for us and in
us needful to ſalvation.<note place="margin">Eſa. 32. 1.</note> As a Prophet he Reveals the whole
Council of God;<note place="margin">Eſa 33. 22.</note> As a Prieſt he makes full expiation to God,
and Interceſſion for us: As a Kingly Prince, he ſubdues all
ſpiritual Enemies, and makes all things ſerviceable to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and protection of his people, under his Soveraign Rule
and Government. All this he did and doth by his Eternal
Spirit, as the Scripture Records, freely, fully, ſurely and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
being therein a glorious Object of Chriſtian knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Thirdly, Chriſt in his Progreſs is conſiderable, under a double
ſtate of Humiliation and Exaltation.</head>
               <p>1. HIs Humiliation, appeared in all the ſteps of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and Birth, of his Life and Paſſion, of his death
and Burial moſt wonderfully: This God head was then
covered with the dark vail of his humane Nature, mourning
as it were in the ſad habit of his infirmities, for his peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114749:28"/>
He willingly then eclipſed his divine light within
the dark Lanthorn of this ſubmiſſive ſtate,<note place="margin">Phil. 2 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to exalt us, he emptied himſelf that he might fill us. He
parted with all, that he might give us all. He ſhewed himſelf
to be the Son of man, to the loweſt degree, that he might
bring all his into the ſtate of Children. Had there not been an
abſolute neceſſity thereof, he had never done it. Had not our
caſe been ſo deſperate; could any other way have expiated
and deſtroyed his peoples ſins, Chriſt had not come down
from the height of Glory to the bottom of ignominy. Here
is an object of admiration indeed, God humbled to a childs
ſtate, growing up by degrees in Stature and Grace, doing
and ſuffering every moment for his enemies in rebellious
arms. Behold the Son of man wraſtling with earth and hell, yea
with heaven it ſelf, conflicting with mans rage, the devils fury,
and the wrath of God! What think you of ſin, the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of this Chriſt, and of that Love which gave him to the
death?<note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Thus <hi>made he his ſoul a ſacrifice for ſin, that he might
ſee his ſeed, and the good will of the Lord proſpering in his hands.</hi>
He laid in the grave to confirm his death, and to air that Bed
for our Repoſe. His God head held his ſoul and body aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from each other, yet ſtill inſeparably united to himſelf.
Thus may you ſee a man drawing out his ſword, holding in
his hands ſtill both ſword and ſcabret, till it be put up again.
Thus it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and ſo make
entrance into his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſts Exaltation is further worthy the beſt
obſervation. Therein his glorious perſon unvailed himſelf of
all humane weakneſs, though he ſtill retained the nature of
man and its properties.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> He laid down his ſable weeds to put
on the roabes of Immortality. His God-head did then raiſe
up his Man-hood in his Reſurrection; and the Son of man
declared himſelf by his divine Power, to be the Son of God:
The Price paid for his people in his humiliation;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> he applies by
power through his exaltation, to them orderly and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He is God-Man ſtill, and therefore tearmed the Man
Chriſt Jeſus. Thus his office was to be compleated by the
compleating of his ſaving Progreſs. He converſed then among
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114749:29"/>
his Diſciples, the ſpace of forty days to confirm their faith;
and to inſtruct them in the affairs of his Kingdom.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Thence
his Aſcention was ſolemnly performed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> followed with
his Seſſion at the Fathers right hand;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3, 4.</note> and Interceſſion
for his people.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> Theſe are the four main ſteps of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
to be ſingularly improved.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 5, 6.</note> He roſe that we might
riſe from death to Life:<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 21.</note> he aſcended, that we might aſcend;
he ſits at Gods right hand,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that we may ſit with him on his
Throne; and he ſtill intercedes to make all our Interceſſions
effectual. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
Elect? Its Chriſt that died, yea rather, that roſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
ſiting now at the right hand of the Majeſty on high,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note>
and ever lives to make Interceſſion. Thus is Chriſts progreſs of
chief worth and conſideration.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>4. Chriſt is moſt conſiderable in his purchaſe alſo made for all
his People, which hath both value and vertue in it.</head>
               <p>1. THE value of his whole Obedience was of infinite
worth, being the merits of God-man, giving full
ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> for all the ſins of all his elect, and
making a full acquiſition of all the good they were &amp; ſhould
be capable of. This price of Chriſts perfect Righteouſneſs,
active and paſſive,<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.</note> was put into Gods Coffers, to be ſeaſonably
and effectually applied to all his people orderly and actually
from their converſion to their utmoſt ſalvation by his Spirit
according to his eternal Purpoſe. By the ſame value were
all Gods elect from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſts death, delivered from the
guilt &amp; wages of ſin upon Chriſts engagement of ſeaſonable
performance; For he is the Lamb ſlain from the foundation
of the world;<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> intentionally in the divine purpoſe and promiſe.</p>
               <p>2. The Vertue of Chriſts perfect Obedience, extends to the
effectual application thereof to all Gods people. So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
purpoſe in electing, and the Sons Intention in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
do run parallel.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8, 9.</note> That value which Chriſts merits preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God, cannot but be attended with anſwerable vertue
for the making good thereof to the utmoſt. The Son of man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114749:29"/>
came to ſeek &amp; ſave that which was loſt,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 10.</note> and that to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
ſeeing he ever lives to perform all.<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> Whilſt therefore he
was gone into Heaven to act his part there, he was carefull to
ſend his Proxie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16, 26.</note> even his own Spirit, that ſhould make a
through application of all his Purchaſe by the conveyance of
his ſaving Grace to all his Choſen.<note place="margin">Ioh, 16. 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> His Oblation is living
and lively ſtill, even as Chriſt himſelf who abides for ever. The
ceremonial Oblations had him ſhadow'd out, to repreſent
the efficaciouſneſs of Chriſts Oblation.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man paying a Ranſom or Debt, as ſurety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will be ſure to know for whom, and to ſee his purpoſe
fulfilled to his power. The agreement or Covenant made
between God and Chriſt (diſtinct from the gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant<note place="margin">Eſay 53. 10, 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>

imports as much.<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 18.</note> As the Father required, <hi>that he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his ſoul a Sacrifice for ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> which the Son willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took;
ſo was it engaged to him, <hi>that he ſhould ſee of his ſeed,
and the good pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his hand.</hi> So
that the vertue of his blood is ſtill included in the value of it;
both being directed by divine intention, which terminates in
the proper ſubjects thereof. Therein concurs his threefold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
he being ſtill a Prophet and prince, as far as he is a Prieſt
unto any. The vertue of Chriſts Merits is indeed intrinſecally
infinite like himſelf, and only limited with the value thereof
by the divine pleaſure. This purchaſe of his may be ſaid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
and ſecundarily to comprehend the whole Creation
in ſubſerviency to divine Intentions, but directly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the Scripture limits it to Gods Elect, for whom he came,
and lived, prayed and died, roſe and intercedes ſtill. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to the removal of all evil, both of ſin and ſorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choatively,
progreſſively and conſummatively. It reaches
alſo the Import of all ſutable good ſpiritual, temporal and
eternal. All things are ours, and for our ſake, that are truly his,
and ſo far as we are his. Is not this a choice Jewel to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viewed?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Doth not ſuch a purchaſe challenge our beſt
knowledge? The poſſeſſive Our gives relliſh to all. It doth us
little good to hear of Indian Treaſures that are not our own.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is moſt precious in his Relation, multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114749:30"/>
expreſſed to his people, by <hi>Alluſion</hi> to all choice rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in things natural, civil and artificial. The perfection
of all creatures is radically in him, originally from him, and
reductively leads to him again. None of them can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſet out his wonderfull Relation wherein he ſtands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his choſen Ones; he therefore borrows the cream
and quinteſſence of them all to ſhadow out to our ſhallow
capacity the marvels of his glorious Grace. Thus he ſpeaks
to his Babes in their known Dialect,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 2.</note> that he may gradually
and familiarly be underſtood of them.<note place="margin">Revel. 5. 5.</note> He calls himſelf

his Aſſertion, ſways the Judgement to reaſon the caſe, and
caſt its reſolve upon Chriſts ſide. Divine reaſon then perſwades
mans Reaſon, that ſuch a Chriſt is worth the accepting upon
his own Terms. The ſoul thereby judges <hi>all</hi> capitulations and
Reſervations to be <hi>ſinfull, dreadfull, irrational.</hi> Mans reaſon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114749:34"/>
is then brought over to ſuch a ſubjection as Chriſts reaſon
demands without delaies or exceptions. It ſees that in Chriſt,
which is better then <hi>All,</hi> and ſuits its wants in every part

and judges <hi>all</hi> to be but vanity and Lyes that hinders from

none but Chriſt,</hi> as the Martyr did, with due conviction of
ſin and righteouſneſs in order to Judgement through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

aſſents to that truth of God which preſents Chriſt for a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of ſingular worth?</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Application and hearty conſent is the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of all conjugal Knowledge, eſpecially of this. The
ſoul is hereby effectually yielded into Chriſts own hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and renders up it ſelf to his diſpoſal. Conjugal Acception is
thus reciprocated, that the whole man may yield unto him
all loyal obedience of Faith and Love. This great wheel
thus moved, all the Affections turn accordingly Chriſt ward,
heaven-ward, that before ſtill moved ſelf-ward and earth-ward.
The ſoul being thus ſurrendred to Chriſt, depends on
him, and derives from him ſtill Grace for Grace. All other

being duly known, makes them to know the worſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Chriſts eye-ſalve doth ſo clear their eyes, that they
ſee eaſily thoſe ſinfull motes of leſſer faults,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> which by their

Their beholding of Chriſt in their Goſpel-glaſs, with open

<hi>Job</hi> was more humbled by ſeeing of God in a clearer light.<note place="margin">Iob. 42. Gen. 18. 27.</note>

               <p>6. Its a grateful knowledge, that cannot endure ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
They know thereby the worth of Mercy, and
the high price, paid by Chriſts blood for every favour afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his. The bounty of Chriſt ſo magnificently multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
on them ſtill renders them thankful Debtors, mindful of
their Bonds. Their Inſolvency they more throughly know,
which makes them the more beholding to him. What others
enjoy by common Providence, they receive ſtill by a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Promiſe. Ingratitude, the ſum of all evil, they abominate
as the Devil himſelf. Their homage and rent do they bring
to him, whom they well know to be their chief Lord. Returns
of Duty they labour to make in ſome proportion to their
Receipts of Mercy.</p>
               <p>7. All other Graces do beautifie this, attending on Chriſt
in following his Train. Patience and Prudence are found in
their Rank. Zeal and diligence will not be backward. Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſweetneſs will not be ſtrangers. Courage and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
are ready at hand. Sincerity and ſelf-denial are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
companions thereof. The Knowledge of Chriſt then
is a choyce Jewel, that is ſo well ſet and accompanied. Nothing
is wanting for knowledge or comfort, ſo far as Chriſt is known
or enjoyed.</p>

prevent not miraculouſly, thou ſhalt know that Chriſt to thy
confuſion, whom thou wouldſt not know to thy converſion.</p>
               <p>6. This Truth looks wiſhly on carnal Notioniſts, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
much to the Knowledge of Chriſt, and yet remain deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of his Grace. They have learned to prate about Chriſt,
and to uſe his Name for a Sanctuary to ſin. From vain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they ſpeedily run into vile affections, and their devotion
lies moſt in their fancy. Their Tongue is tipped with the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of <hi>Canaan</hi> to deceive the ſimple in deceiving themſelves.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note>
This age abounds with ſuch,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 13.</note> the Lord awaken them, who are
lulled aſleep in the Devils Lap. Alas wretched ſoul, what will
be thy end, and what is thy caſe in ſuch deluſions? If thy

whilſt thou ſlighteſt Chriſt &amp; his Ordinances, how woful is
it? Thou playeſt like a Gnat and Moth about the Candle, till
thou be conſumed by the heat thereof. Golden Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do tickle thy thoughts whilſt Satan is leading thee captive

Lies? Is it not becauſe thou receiveſt not the Truth in the
Love of it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 11, 12.</note> that God gives <hi>thee up to thy own hearts Luſts?</hi>
How far art thou from a gracious knowledge, that turneſt
his Grace into wantonneſs? Didſt thou know Chriſt aright,
thou wouldſt know thy ſelf better, and wouldſt ſee thy new
pretended Light to be but old darkneſs. Thy pretence of
Chriſts name will do thee little good whilſt thou ſlighteſt his
Word and Ways, his Sabbath and Worſhip, his Service and
Saints.<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 11.</note> Satan may ceaſe troubling of thee, and fill thee

               <p>2. The moſt gracious may find juſt cauſe from this very
point to humble and judge themſelves for the remaining of ſo
much ſin in them. The moſt are totally guilty, and the beſt
in part of too much darkneſs and dulneſs, ſelfiſhneſs and
ſinfulneſs againſt this precious Jewel. That Chriſt is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known unto thee after ſo much of his glorious diſcoveries,
what a ſhame is it? that there is yet ſo little of Grace, and ſo
much of corruption in us, ſhould it not deeply humble us?
that we ſavour ſo much of ſelf, and ſo little of Chriſt: Is
it not matter of ſad lamentation, that Chriſt ſhould be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abuſed, forgotten and forſaken in ſuch a manner by
his very Friends? Is it not wofull? The more precious Chriſt
is unto us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 12, 13.</note> the more vile ſhall we be to our ſelves? Saith not
Chriſt to us,<note place="margin">As Caeſar to Brutus, Tu eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am mi fili?</note> as <hi>David</hi> his Type to his boſom friend that

our neareſt and deareſt relations? Hadſt thou ſtruck thy
beſt friend in the dark on miſtake, how would it break thy
heart?</p>
               <p>3. This Truth will afford a needfull Teſt for a due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Hence may we trie our ſtate perſonal and publique
to frame a Prognoſtick of our hopes and fears. In this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the Sanctuary our caſe ſhould be weighed. Deceit is
common and very dreadfull.<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 24.</note>

1. By the due review and application of all the former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
do we know Chriſt thus in his perſon and office,
in his Progreſs and Purchaſe, in his Relation and Influence?
Are we the ſubjects ſo wrought upon by him? Are we thus
acquainted with the cauſe and nature, with the properties and
effects of this gracious knowledge? Are we not ſtill in that
unregenerate ſtate of reigning Ignorance and neglect,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
and ſelf juſtifying,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> of profaneſs or notional deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

our ſelves and others?<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 3.</note> mind it exactly by the ſtandard of
Truth.</p>
               <p>2. How this Change was wrought, is as conſiderable. What
Method and Means did Gods Spirit uſe, and in what manner
did he prevail with us? Were we effectually convinced by him
of ſin and Righteouſneſs? Were we made to ſee the worſt of
our ſelves,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 8, 9, 10.</note> that we might embrace the beſt of Chriſt? Have
we felt at the heart ſuch a clear diſcovery of our emptineſs
and ſinfulneſs, of our Wretchedneſs and Unworthineſs, of
our Inſufficiency and nothingneſs, as to be wholly weaned
from ſelf, and carried out to him? Have we duly obſerved
the unability of all Creatures to afford us help? Hath the
ſight and ſenſe of our wofull ſtate ſo oppoſite to God, made
Chriſt truly precious to our ſouls? Are we more troubled
at the pollution then at the puniſhment of ſin? Doth it
grieve us to the very ſoul, that we have grieved ſuch a dear
Saviour? Have we beheld our ſtate in the Glaſs of his Law,
and of his Goſpel to make us ſenſible efficaciouſly both of our
Malady and of his Remedy?<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9, 14.</note> Hath he made his Word ſo to
work on us,<note place="margin">Ierem. 23. 29.</note> as to break our hearts and melt them kindly?
Have we found that hammer and fire of his killing our ſins
and quickning our ſouls? Hath he made us thereby cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>willing</hi> to give up all to him, and prefer him above <hi>all?</hi>
Hath he bleſſed the means ſo effectually, as to make us feel him
in and through them all? Hath he made every ſin more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to our Taſte, then ever we found any ſweetneſs therein?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114749:41"/>

upon him alone?</p>
               <p>3. Conſider alſo how this Change works now to clear this
Inquiry with impartiality. Doth his holy Spirit operate on
us by this gracious knowledge, as the Soul doth upon the
Body through its variety of intermediate Spirits? Obſerve
it we may in the reſemblance of that three-fold Life, which

is a ſpecial Goſpel-Duty. It becomes Chriſtians to be ſtill

truſt him, obey him, and your caſe is ſafe.</p>

all things to his peoples good. To abſtain from evil is ſtill
as needfull as to be doing and receiving good. Obſerve then
what things are moſt offenſive to your conſtitution,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 22.</note> that you

that his bare fleſh, and the fleſhly ſence thereof, profits nothing

In the
precept and cloſe he names the Sabbath, though in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification
he mentions the ſeventh day, or a ſeventh day.
He adds ſtrong Reaſons to enforce it from his Propriety,
Example and Bleſſing, as alſo from the Equity thereof. By
this one Command, he often expreſſes his whole Worſhip,
He couples it ſometimes with one Precept of the firſt Table,

day Sabbath extends as fully to the firſt day Sabbath.
That was the Lords reſt day from his Creation-work; This
is his reſt day from his Redemption-work. The change of
the day in its <hi>quando,</hi> made by God himſelf, alters not the
force of the Comand, but ratifies it. He only could do it
that is the Lord thereof.<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 8.</note> There is no change made in the
<hi>quamdiu</hi> and continuance, nor in the <hi>quoties</hi> and frequency
of the ſame. The whole Precept being moral, in part natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
in part poſitively, is perpetual therefore, and not to be
altered by any Creature. That ſome ſpecial time ſhould be
obſerved for Gods ſolemn worſhip, is moral natural. That
it ſhould be ſuch a proportion in ſuch a Revolution, is moral
poſitive. That the duty ſhould be moved from the ſeventh
to the firſt day of the week, makes no ſubſtantial change
therein, but only directs to the ſeaſon thereof upon pregnant
ground.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note>

The <hi>Phariſees</hi> thus preſſed and owned it, and were confuted

They ſtill own the royal Law of Liberty,<note place="margin">Iam, 2. 8. 12.</note> that moral Law
which is the Tranſcript of Gods holy Will for the Rule of
mans Duty in conformity to Gods Image. Its called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law of Chriſt, the perfect Law, and the Law of Truth,
which men do well when they obſerve, and ill ſo far as they
neglect it. God indeed writes his Law on his peoples heart,
but gradually and variouſly; that is, to them an internal
Principle of Obedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> which is ſtill attended by the Law of
their Members in oppoſition thereto. This Principle moves
them ſtill to obſerve that Law which God hath given to be
their ſtanding Rule, perfect and unchangeable. Men are as far
from his Grace as they are from obſerving his Law. God
never leaves his Children without Rule. He that breaks and
nuls any one part willingly, is guilty of all. The Papiſts guilt
is great in hiding the ſecond Command from the people in their

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> How great is their guilt then that take away
all the Commands at once, leaving man to his own deceitfull
heart under pretence of a Light and Law within? to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

AGainſt thoſe Maladies we find Soveraign Help from the

come to him except the Father draw them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 44.</note> He gives to his Elect
peculiarly, what he requires from all indefinitely. As far as
that Condition is performed either Externally or Internally,
ſo far reaches the Covenant priviledge before God and men.

hath with them no Power or Efficacy to ſave thoſe ſo redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that a perſon whom God in Chriſt did ſo redeem, may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114749:80"/>
periſh nevertheleſs utterly. Fifthly, By divers of late who

               <p>AGainſt this Poiſon, Chriſts Antidote improved will give
ſingular help; it will ſhew the Al-ſufficiency and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Chriſts oblation to all the Elect; <hi>for whom he did fore-know,

               <p>The neceſſity and operation thereof it clears alſo. None

                  <hi>For if whilſt we were enemies, we were reconciled to

There is an eternal Redemption of Grace to Glory, peculiar
to Gods elect. This differs from that as far as Heaven from
Earth. Chriſt the Redeemer is indeed Lord of all, and makes uſe
of all for the good of his redeemed ones. The devils themſelves
and brutes are thus generally under his dominion,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> as all Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.
Yet it follows not that he died for them. Gods
Elect are the proper Objects of redeeming Grace; All
things elſe below come in accidentally, ſecundarily, ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and comprehenſively under conſideration in Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which makes them all to advance Gods honor and
his peoples good. There is a dubious Homonymy in this word
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114749:81"/>
(<hi>Grace</hi>) which occaſions much miſtake. Many take it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for any favour ſhew'd by God to man. But Scripture
limits the ſenſe thereof in moſt, if not in all places to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
favour ſhew'd to his Elect in Chriſt, reaching their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Salvation efficaciouſly and infallibly. Other
Creatures enjoy many gifts, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſecundary offſpring,
but his Elect as <hi>Iſaac</hi> alone his Inheritance. This advances
the Glory of Chriſts Grace in every conſideration. To make
his blood impotent and uncertain, cannot but much eclipſe it.
His freeneſs and fulneſs, his ſureneſs and choiceneſs appear
orientally in this redeeming Grace. Neither may any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
complain of any wrong herein.<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 15.</note> Is not he free to do with
his own what he pleaſes?<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 35.</note> Was he ever bound to any Creature?
Doth any ſuffer but for their ſins? Doth not God make good
every Word of his? Chriſt was never a half-Saviour. He
came not barely to make men ſalvable,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> but to ſave effectually,
and to the utmoſt. His Redemption is as abſolute as the
Fathers Election, though the offers of Grace be conditional,
indefinitly tendred to all ſorts. Chriſt came not to purchaſe
any new Power to God,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 9, 10.</note> but to fulfill his purpoſe in his effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
procuring of Salvation for all his.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 16, 28, 29, 30.</note> He came for his loſt
ſheep whom the Father Gave him, to fetch them home effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.
The Sons Redemption muſt needs keep parallel with
the Fathers election. Had ſalvation been intended to each man,
what could have hindred the effecting thereof? If Chriſt died for
<hi>Judas</hi> as for <hi>Peter,</hi> then is <hi>Peter</hi> little more then <hi>Judas</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſts Redemption. Its not Chriſt it ſeems that makes
the difference, but ſome thing elſe. If he died for them both, but
not alike, then was his death therein peculiar to <hi>Peter,</hi> which
makes the difference. Then was it impoſſible that <hi>Judas</hi> could
be ſaved without that ſpecial thing, and it was as impoſſible
that he ſhould have it, ſeeing it was not intended to him. To
what purpoſe then did Chriſt die for him? He was not ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it ſeems by the grant ſuppoſed. What elſe he had was
common to him with other Creatures, good in it ſelf, but abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by man. That Chriſt came not to reſtore whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
appears in that every one is never effectually reſtored
to primitive ſtate. Where the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114749:81"/>
Dying for all, for the World, for ſinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the context
ſtill clears the reſtriction of thoſe phraſes to all the Elect,
both Jews and Gentiles, that are of all ſorts, and in all
places and ages. Its a common phraſe in every language
thus to ſpeak of all for many of all ſorts indefinitely,<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 5.</note> to be
explained by the matter in hand.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 23.</note> Thus all <hi>Judea</hi> came to be
baptiſed. The Apoſtles preached to every creature under
heaven, yet ſtill with limitation. The word [<hi>World</hi>] in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places cannot ſignifie whole man-kind,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 29.</note> but muſt be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to the veſſels of mercy alone.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 32.</note> Thus Chriſt takes away
the ſin of the world;<note place="margin">Iohn 6 33.</note> now bleſſed is he whoſe ſin is taken
away;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> every man is not ſo. Many are in Hell beyond poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
thereof; he gives Life to the world, not to them in Hell.
God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world, not imputing their
ſin unto them: Is this every mans priviledge to have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and pardon? In other places, the <hi>World</hi> can ſignifie
none but Reprobates,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 19.</note> that ſhall never be ſaved, that <hi>lie in

                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 9.</note> that Chriſt prayed not for, that die in their ſins that

Such ſhall duly know that Chriſt died for them when they find
him killing ſin in them, that they may live to him. A general
Notion that Chriſt died for all and every One, can give no
more comfort to <hi>Peter</hi> then to <hi>Judas,</hi> till his heart do feel the
power of Chriſts death. Is it not more comfort that Chriſt
died to ſave his Elect certainly, then that he died ſo indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
that its uncertain for all his death whether any ſhall
be ſaved? If you grant he died abſolutely but for ſome; then
its certain that only they ſhall be ſaved; and his dying for the
reſt conditionally, will not make them ſalvable nor afford
any comfort to them. If any Inconvenience attend our
Doctrine it muſt needs attend that alſo.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 18.</note> Yea, if Chriſt ſhould
have died for all alike,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> yet ſeeing all are not in the event ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he muſt needs fore-know it, or not be Omniſcient; and
fore-ordain it, or not be Omnipotent; and that certainly, or
not be Soveraign. The ſame difficulties will follow that way
with many more. Either God or the Creature muſt be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.
It diſparages not Chriſts death that its limited to

The former Oppoſitions. Secondly, By <hi>Pelagians</hi> old and
new, aſſerting mans nature to be ſo reſtored in every man, that
they are all born in Gods favour, continuing ſo till they groſly
abuſe the Light given them, either natural or Evangelical:
making Grace as common as Nature, becauſe its a gift, though
diverſifyed. Denying Original ſin and Habitual corruption
before years of diſcretion. Thirdly, The <hi>Socinians</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them, deny that ſpecial Renewing Grace, and pretend
the New Birth mentioned ſo often to be but a moral change
upon men, which their nature by a common help from God
doth attain unto in imitation of Chriſt, whom they ſuppoſe
to be a meer Patterne of Holineſs, not the Internal efficient
thereof. Fourthly, By the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> who have
learned of them to advance mans ſelf-ſufficiency, free Will
and Power by a common aſſiſtance of Gods Light indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
afforded to all ſorts according to their Improvements
of the common Gifts received to accept or reject Chriſt at

when they liſt. In effect, placing a mans ſtrength and
ſtanding, yea his chief All in his own mutable will: making
Faith but a common Aſſent given to Truth. Fifthly, By the
<hi>Quakers, Familiſts</hi> and <hi>Notioniſts,</hi> who carry too much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their Ghoſtly Fathers in theſe as in other things.</p>
               <p>AGainſt theſe Lethal Maladies, the knowledge of Chriſt
improved graciouſly will afford effectual Remedies.
Thereby we learn to ſee by Scripture Light the total
corruption of mans ſinful Nature;<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> the univerſality thereof
reaching all places and perſons:<note place="margin">Pſalm 14,</note> its cloſeneſs and adherence,

its indefatigable unſatisfiableneſs, and its multiplicious propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
not admitting of remiſſion or intermiſſion: This fully
manifeſts the inſufficiency and emptineſs of man, his unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and aptneſs to any ſpiritual good. Thence the neceſſity
of a ſpecial Renewing Grace from above to work an effectual
change in all Gods Elect by an Almighty irreſiſtible power,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3, 5. 6.</note>
ſuch as quickned <hi>Lazarus</hi> and raiſed up <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> from the

Heaven. That difference is ſtill morally-ſpecifical, though
it ſeems to be Phyſically, but Numerical and gradual. Its
the ſame Spirit that works conviction on the Reprobate and
on the Elect, but not in the ſame manner. He knocks at
both, and is reſiſted. He leaves the Reprobate juſtly; he
opens the Elects heart mercifully and prevailingly. The
Reprobate may be externally and profeſſedly ſanctified
in a partial ſuperficial way. Gods Elect are ſpecially ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
univerſally in every part; and gradually through every
part. Mans free will by ſin ſubjected to Satan, is through this
Renewing Grace ſet at liberty,<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 21.</note> ſo far as Grace prevails. The
unregenerate is free only to ſpiritual evil,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7, 8.</note> being an enemy to
ſpiritual good.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2, 9.</note> The Regenerate ſoul is ſo far free to ſpiritual

the ſoul like good Angels ſhall be free only to good.<note place="margin">Neceſſity and liberty meet together in Heaven, on Earth, yea in Hell itſelf.</note> The
Nature of mans will is thus bettered by Grace; which was
made a ſlave by ſin. The Devils and damned do freely will
ſin, ſo do unregenerate ſouls on earth, yet neceſſarily. Thus

There are no merits but in Gods Mercy. He rewards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

he requires Faith and Repentance, not to merit, but to receive
it, emptying the ſoul of ſelf, to fill it with himſelf, letting out
ſin to let in Chriſt: caſting out Satan to bring in his Spirit,
Purging out corruption by giving his Grace, preparing for
Glory. He therefore bids them <hi>take heed leſt they fall,</hi> to

the End and bleſſes the Means. He promiſes and aſſures their

is Gods Revealed Will in his written Word, not his own Will

of Conſcience is much talked of, but it covers often the

but with external evil, though pretending conſcience.

Conſcience plead for any ſin. Chriſt never intended it to

AGainſt theſe various Evils, the Knowledge of Chriſt
improved graciouſly will fence our Judgements, and
make us to ſee the excellency and perpetuity, the neceſſity
and utility of his Goſpel-miniſtry. It was his care of old
to ſet it up in his Church for their common good, <hi>that the
Prieſts lips might preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the

The firſt Inſurrections againſt it, (which aſſaulted alſo the
Magiſtracy by a ſtrong levelling party under holy pretences,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note>)
were dreadfully rebuked and plagued by an extraordinary
hand from Heaven.<note place="margin">Num. 17.</note> The Lord made alſo <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod to

evil.<note place="margin">This Propheſie from the 40<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapter of Ezek. is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, though ſet out by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as the whole ſcope demonſtrates, &amp; Expoſitors harmoniouſly agree.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in all their Succeſſors were ſtill duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by God and good men. The Jewiſh Church and State
declined together by their ſinfull neglects of Chriſts Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Chriſt therefore came at laſt himſelf perſonally, that he
might repair thoſe wofull Ruins. The vile abuſing of his
Miniſtry brought on them firſt a Babylonian yoak, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Roman ſlavery, after many Perſian and Grecian Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
The Revolts of <hi>Jaſon</hi> and of <hi>Onias,</hi> with their
Anti-temples in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> brought in many more
confuſions then both on Church and State. Their corrupt
oppoſings of Chriſts Miniſtry coſt them very dear. When
Chriſt came in the fleſh, the many diſorders of the miniſterial
Office and perſons had diſordered all.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 15, 16.</note> His great care was
then to rectifie things in the beſt method.<note place="margin">See <hi>Joſephus</hi> his <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> wars.</note> An end of all
ſhadows he made in himſelf by his own Miniſtry, and ſettled
himſelf a ſubſtantial Miniſtry that ſhould continue unto the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114749:89"/>
worlds end. His great buſineſs ſtill was to purge his Temple,
and to commiſsion his miniſterial Servants for the ſucceſsive
building of his houſe. His twelve Apoſtles and ſeventy
Diſciples were to that end ſuccesfully employed by him.<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 14, 15 16.</note>
When he aſcended and triumph'd over all,<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 12.</note> he beſtowed then
Coronation Gifts of a choice Nature.<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 45, 46.</note> Then gave he <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in extraordinary, <hi>Paſtors</hi> and
<hi>Teachers</hi> in ordinary for Ambaſſados,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> for the perfecting of

                  </note> 
                  <hi>untill we all come to the full ſtature of the Son of God.</hi>
Thus Chriſt ſettled this miniſterial function with ſpiritual
Authority,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 10, 11.</note> by ſetting apart in a regular Call, perſons by him
duly qualified to the full employment of the Miniſtry. The
Circumſtantials of the ceremonial Law he pared off thereby,
and ſettled the ſubſtance of his will therein in this ſolemn of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for his ſpecial honor and his peoples good. The Father
and Spirit joined with God the Son in the Commiſſion given
from above to ſettle this Office, and aſſure thereon a ſignal
Bleſſing till the end of all. As the Son gave theſe Reſidents
of his to his Church below,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 12.</note> ſo did the Father <hi>ſet them</hi> in the
Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28, 29.</note> and the holy Ghoſt ſtill makes them overſeers thereof.
In the renewing of their Commiſsion he enlarged it unto all
Nations,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> gave them the <hi>keys of his Kingdom</hi> to act under him
as Deputy-ſtewards;<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> Titles of Honor he gives them

with them their immediate infallible Call. Extraordinaries

At firſt they did chuſe a Moderator, who might be Speaker
in their regular meetings. That was firſt elective, and then
became fixed, and gradually did degenerate. Under fair
colors many did encroach, and ſubjected Elders to Biſhops
Power. Thence did Arch-Biſhops and Patriarchs riſe with
other Limbs of that Hierarchy. By Princes bounty too ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Antichriſtian Beaſt with his double horn, ſpeaking like the
Lamb, acted Dragon-like. He gradually ſubdued Chriſts
Magiſtracy and Miniſtry by uſurpations of the double
ſword. That Peſtilential Wen grew ſo faſt on the Church
that it did over-ſpread and conſume it in its nobleſt parts.
Many Excreſcences did riſe under it as their Cardinals, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,

worth for touching a leprous hand, nor Gods Temple by
the ſitting of the man of ſin, when their pollutions are but
once removed. If any defilment be proved to attend our
Miniſtry, we are ready to yield and remove the ſame. When
the Wen is cut off, and the body cured, health being reſtored,
is to be improved. If any will ſtil lord it over Brethren we ſhall
diſclame ſuch uſurpations. Chriſts Miniſtry is to feed and
teach, to rule and to cure Miniſterially. Our weapons and
work are ſpiritual, not Political, nor Monarchical. As Nurſes
appointed for the Childrens good, its our deſire to attend
Chriſts houſe. An orderly Call unto this office as he doth
appoint, ſo will he ſtill bleſs. <hi>How ſhall men believe, if not
preached to? How ſhall men preach right, if they be not ſent?</hi>
Internal gifts are very needfull, yet not ſufficient to make out
this Call. No man ſelf-called is owned by God, no more then
<hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts. A Souldier, though able,
without Commiſſion ſhall never be owned for an Officer. A
perſon of Parts without Authority cannot act the part of
Juſtice or Judge. Every Chriſtian is to improve Gifts, but
within his place and fit relation.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2, 3.</note> Gods word doth appoint
