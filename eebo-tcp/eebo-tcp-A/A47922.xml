         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

arguing from the <hi>Justice</hi> of the

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Four,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
an <hi>Answer,</hi> under the Title
of <hi>the Relaps'd Apostate:</hi> This
<hi>Supplement,</hi> was particularly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by One of the other Three,
entitled <hi>Two Papers of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
to his Majesty,</hi> wherein their
Designs upon the <hi>Publick Peace</hi>
are more <hi>avow'd,</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> then
in the <hi>Rest.</hi> Should These <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

'twould make either their <hi>Party;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65718:3"/>
or their <hi>Arguments</hi> seem more
<hi>considerable</hi> then they are.</p>
            <p>I will not foul my Paper, with
the extravagancies of their <hi>Rage</hi>
against me; but in their <hi>Intervals,</hi>
(that is, when they are as <hi>Sober,</hi>
as <hi>other people</hi> are when they are
<hi>Mad.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Thus they Object against my
Pamphlet; <hi>There's too much</hi>
Fooling <hi>in't: and too much</hi> Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(They do well to <hi>vilifie</hi> what
they cannot <hi>Answer.</hi>)</p>
            <p>They are to know, that my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was to expose their <hi>Practices,</hi>
and <hi>Arguments</hi> to the <hi>People;</hi>
toward whom, whoever Sauces not
his <hi>Earnest</hi> with a <hi>Tang</hi> of <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

               <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Then</hi> gone too; and
<hi>Then</hi> they are <hi>lost;</hi> whereas
they'd make a shift without the
Peoples <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Rayling;</hi> I confess I was
never taught in the <hi>Presbyterian-School;</hi>‚Äîwhere
they call <hi>foul
things</hi> by <hi>fine names.</hi> Sometimes
perhaps I call their <hi>Combination,</hi>
(as the Law <hi>Christen'd</hi> it) Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:‚Äî<hi>Spilling
of Innocent
Bloud;</hi>‚ÄîMurther. <hi>Taking away
an Honest mans Estate,</hi> Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Rifling of Churches,</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
&amp;c.‚Äî</p>
            <p>They have indeed a <hi>cleanlier
Idiome</hi> for these Matters. A
Treacherous <hi>Confederacy</hi> they
call a <hi>Holy Covenant. Murther</hi>
forsooth, is <hi>Justice</hi> upon <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.
Notorious Robbery,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65718:4"/>
passes for <hi>Sequestration. Rifling</hi>
of <hi>Churches,</hi> is but demolishing of

            <p>Was the <hi>Murther</hi> of the <hi>late

the 42. verse of the same chapter, the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
is explayn'd. <hi>[Ionathan said to David,
Go in peace: that which we have sworn both

               </p>
               <p>Thus far, there's no <hi>Proportion;</hi> the one is

               <p>Since <hi>This</hi> is nothing to our business, it must

makes the Case worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David flees</hi> (Chap. 22.) and a <hi>malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Party</hi> gathers to him. <hi>Saul Hunts
him; Ionathan</hi> finds him in the Wood, and
comforts him, saying <hi>Fear not, for the hand
of Saul my Father shall not find thee.</hi> (here's
no Resistance.) <hi>So they twain made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               </p>
               <p>During the League betwixt this Pair of

Lord</hi> in all his <hi>Publique Actions; [Shall I go
and smite the Philistins?]</hi> (Chapt. 23.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65718:9"/>
and smite the</hi> Philistines, <hi>and save</hi> Keilah.]
<hi>David discomfits</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and saves
<hi>Keilah: Saul</hi> marches towards him, <hi>David</hi>
again applies himself to God to know if the
men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would deliver him up or no?
it was returned, <hi>they would.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> fled,
and afterward had <hi>Saul</hi> twice at his <hi>mercy,</hi>
whom as the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> he still feared to
touch.</p>
               <p>I have here trac'd the story at Length, and
now let the Reformers chuse what use they'll
make of it. This part of Scripture has been
often tortur'd in favour of the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi>

quoted an <hi>Indenture;</hi> so that either the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
business is to <hi>justifie</hi> the <hi>Quarrel,</hi> or to
<hi>abuse</hi> the <hi>Bible.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">The Case of <hi>Zedekiah.</hi>

his <hi>Vncle, who was carried away in Captivity

13. Thus saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Jerem. 34. God made the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
I made a Covenant with your Fathers in the
day that I brought them forth out of the Land
of Aegypt, out of the house of Bondmen,
saying;</p>
               <p>14. At the end of seven years,<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it self.</note> let ye go
every man his Brother, an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which
hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath
served thee six years, thou shalt let him go
free from thee: but your Fathers harkened
not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</p>
               <p>15. And ye were now turned,<note place="margin">Zedekiahs <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </note> and had done
right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every
man to his Neighbour, and ye had made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
before me in the house which is called by
my Name.</p>
               <p>16. But ye turned and polluted my Name,<note place="margin">And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</note>
and caused every man his Servant, and every
man his Handmaid, whom ye had set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
at their pleasure, to return, and brought
them into subjection, to be unto you for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and for Handmaids.</p>
               <p>17. Therefore thus saith the Lord,<note place="margin">For the Breach</note> Ye have
not harkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty
every one to his Brother, &amp;c.‚Äî</p>
               <p>21. And <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65718:10"/>
Now here's the Case: God <hi>having made
a</hi> Covenant <hi>with the</hi> Israelites, <hi>King</hi> Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
<hi>makes a</hi> Covenant <hi>with the</hi> People, <hi>for
