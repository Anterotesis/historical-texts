            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Honourable House of Commons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Parliament did exhibite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Articles against <hi>William Laud</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> unto the Lords of the upper house the twelft whereof is set downe in these words: <hi>He hath traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously indevoured to cause division and discord betwixt the Church of England and other Reformed Churches; And to that end hath supprest and abrogated the Priviledges and Immunities which have been by his Majestie and his Royall Ancestors granted to the Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdome: and divers other wayes hath expressed his malice and dis-affection to these Churches; that so by such dis-union the Papists might have more advantage for the overthrow and extirpation of both.</hi> The truth of this appeares by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops proceeding against our forraign Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for although the Deputies of all the forraign Churches met at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1625. and held a Synod, whereof I was a Member, deputed by the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and went to the King, who was accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and Sectetary <hi>Morton,</hi> all deceased, and others, and a Speech was made in French to
<pb facs="tcp:59077:3"/>
the Kings Majesty by M. <hi>Primrose,</hi> containing among other things a Petition for the continuance of our Priviledges concerning our Discipline, according to our custom granted heretofore by his Ancestors and Royall Progenitors. The King gave us a gracious Answer and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Promise, and gave us his hand to kisse; and we enjoyed our Priviledges as long as Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> lived. Yet as soone as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was warme in his Archbishops seat, he indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with tooth and naile to suppresse and abrogate our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Immunities granted to our forraign Churches by his Majestie and his Royall Ancestors; to introduce the Book of Common Prayer in our Churches, and subject us to the English Liturgie translated into French, &amp;c. and to withdraw from our Churches those of the first and second descent, to have them goe to the English Parishes, as may fully appeare by this Relation. True it is that in King <hi>James</hi> his raigne the two forraign Churches French and Dutch in <hi>Norwich,</hi> were assaulted and troubled by Dr. <hi>Overald</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and especially by his Chancellour, but that was about two points; the one was a prohibition to observe Publicke Fasts without the Kings permission (which the Churches had implicite in the toleration of their Discipline.) The second was, A command to the Communicants of both Congregations to receive the Communion not sitting but standing. Indeed when the French forraign Churches held their Synod at <hi>Norwich, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Dom.</hi> 1619. to the which I was deputed, and was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Scribe by the Synod; at that time the Bishops Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour came to our Synod, and told us, That my Lord would have the Communicants kneele at the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which seemed very strange to us. I was chosen to goe to the Chancellour, accompanied by the whole Synod, and declared to him what Priviledges we had from time
<pb facs="tcp:59077:3"/>
to time from King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, and from King <hi>James</hi> then reigning. The Chancellour answered us, That the King might alter his word &amp; revoke his promise. But we replied, That we estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Kings word as much as a Patent. We went after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Bishop, who told us that his Chancellour had abused him, he never intended that those of the forraign Congregation should receive the Communion Kneeling but Standing as they did in <hi>France.</hi> He told us that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty commanded him to look to his Diocesse. We answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the two forraign Congregations in <hi>Norwich</hi> were in his Diocesse, but not of his Diocesse; and desired his Lordship to let the Churches be in quiet till we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the businesse to our Consistories, and returned our answer to the two Churches. Which he promised to doe. In the meane time the Bishop died. The Bishop who succeeded him was content to let the two Congregations enjoy their Discipline in their Fasts and Communion, so that Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> would set his hand to such a permission; which was a strange Condition: for he might have considered, that the Archbishop did not trouble the forraign Churches in his Diocesse, but let them enjoy their Priviledges quietly. But after the Bishop had heard the Kings answer to the forraign Churches, permitting the continuance of their Discipline, he did not molest them, but the two Congregations lived in peace till Archbishop <hi>Lauds</hi> time, who was not content to trouble the three forraign Churches in his Diocesse, but endeavoured to assault all the forraign Churches in this Kingdome; and did cite their Deputies to appeare, and meant not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of two or three points of their Discipline, but to dispossesse them of all, and to submit them to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Discipline. Yet when he saw he could not bring it to
<pb facs="tcp:59077:4"/>
passe, he would have perswaded the world he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended such an Injunction, as will appeare by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatise. We intend not to write of the troubles of all the forraign Churches in <hi>England,</hi> or those of <hi>London</hi> or of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but by the by, or a touch of them by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; our purpose is to write principally and summarily what hapned to the three forraign Churches in <hi>Kent.</hi> In which Narration it will appeare the malice and dis-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdome which stood in his way, intending the dissipation and extirpation of them, that so his fine designe of bringing in Popery might have taken effect and sure footing in <hi>England</hi> to the overthrow of the true Protestant Religion, had not God in his great mercy put an end and set a period to his ambition, his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, designes, and life.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the Troubles of the three forraigne Churches in KENT.</head>
            <p>AFter the death of <hi>George Abbot</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, William Laud</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was promoted to that See, and made Archbishop thereof; who at his entrance obtained of the Kings Majesty a Patent for a generall Visitation of all the Diocesses under his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as well of those that were exempts as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And although the foraigne Churches of this Realme were not comprehended in that Patent (for whereas Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Canons, prebendaries, ministers and others were nominated, the forraine Churches were not named) yet the Archbishop presupposed and pretended them to be; and therefore in the visitation of his Diocesse of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> by his Commissioners in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill Anno Domini,</hi> 1634. he caused the three forreine churches to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to appeare by their deputies in <hi>Canterburie;</hi> namely of <hi>Canterburie, Sandwich, and Maidston,</hi> the Deputies of which churches appeared on the 14. day of <hi>April,</hi> in Master Deanes house before his Commissioners, which were Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> the Deane of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and others, the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> being sicke and absent; where were</p>
            <p>Questions propounded to the <hi>Walloone</hi> Congregation at <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Maidston,</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are to make answere in writing, severally, or jointly, on Saterday next in the afternoone, betweene the houres of one and five of the clocke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What Liturgie they use, and whether they have not the English Liturgie in <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> in use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of how many desents for the most part they are borne Subiects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether such as are borne Subjects will corforme to the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deputies were, <hi>Gasparus Nieren</hi> minister of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church of <hi>Sandirich; Jeha Bulteel,</hi> and <hi>Philip Deline,</hi> ministers of the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>Canterburie. Iohn Miller</hi> minister of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church <hi>of</hi>

               <hi>Maidston,</hi> and some Elders. <hi>Iohn Bulteel</hi> was requested by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the speaker, he therefore answered the Commissioners, that though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> three forreine Churches were in my Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Diocesse, they were not of his Diocesse, and that they were of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts; and whereas Doctor <hi>Warner</hi> said, that the Deane and Chapter were of the exempts also, yet were comprehended in the patent and were visited; he answered, they were in a manner doubly exempted, and not contained as they conceived expresly and by name as they were (Deanes, Archdeacons, prebends, and others nominated in the patent) they added also that no Archbishop did ever propound any such question to their Churches; and that it might be easily knowne, and was knowne what Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie they had it being added ordinarily to the end of the psalmes, as it was practised and used in <hi>France, Germanie</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> in the <hi>French Walloone</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations. As for the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, it was translated into <hi>French,</hi> but not in <hi>Dutch</hi> that they knew; neither was it in use among them, they having their owne Liturgy. Now the Deputies being pressed to answer more particularly to the three questions desired of the Commissioners a longer time to answer to those propositions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were to communicate them to their congregations and they of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Matdston</hi> could not returne an answer so soone. So the Commissioners did prorogue the time and did appoint the day of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to those questions that day three weekes, namely the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> Deane <hi>Bargrave</hi> and Doctor <hi>Iackson,</hi> spake of their governmenr and discipline concerning refractary and deboshed perions; and praising them for the care they had of their poore, in setting them on worke, and not permitting them to beg, giving them sufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But Doctor <hi>Warner</hi> could not endure to heare those praises, start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and snuft at it, using some discurteous words, as if those praises were to the disparagement of the <hi>English</hi> Churches, &amp;c. notwithstanding some Justices of peace at Sessions, in giving the charge, would often make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being assembled together, according to its custome namely, the Ministers, Elders and Deacons, and considering it was a subject of great importance, and a matter of consequence, that concerned all the forraign Churches found it sitting to write to the <hi>Coetus,</hi> that is to say to the two stranger Churches, the French and Dutch Consistory of <hi>London,</hi> and to aske their councell, advice, and helpe: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneó

their answer, that the three Congregations of <hi>Canterbury, Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and <hi>Maidstone,</hi> should doe well to depute some of every Church, and send them up to <hi>London</hi> to conferre there, together with the Coetus, about the businesse, as being a subject of great concernment. The Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> deputed their two Ministers, <hi>John Bulteel</hi> and <hi>Philip Delme,</hi> and two of their Elders, with instructions to conferre with those of <hi>London,</hi> and gave them in writing the answer to the three proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were to be shewed to the company there but not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the Arch-bishops Vicar-generall but with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Coetus, and but upon necessity: the Answer was this,</p>
            <p>Upon the first Question.</p>
            <p>THat we have that Liturgy, which all the Churches of the French tongue, both in <hi>France</hi> and in the united provinces of the estates have had since the blessed reformation, and which our Churches refuged here have had this sixty or siventy years or more, and which is annexed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the book of psalms.</p>
            <p>That the English Liturgy is translated into French, but we use it not; we know not whether it be in Dutch or no.</p>
            <p>On the second Question.</p>
            <p>THat the greatest part of the heads of the families are not borne here, but about a third part; because that the greatest part of the old ones are strangers borne, and many others are newly come since a few yeers.</p>
            <p>To the third Question.</p>
            <p>THe mentioned in that proposition desire not to doe that which is inquired of; because they see that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Besides, many of the Natives understand not nor speak so well the English as they should, to understand well the Sermons and prayers. Moreover, the families would be divided in the publike exereises of piety; therfore they find it fit and necessary that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Whereupon the Deputies of the said Church with those of <hi>Sandwich</hi> went up to <hi>London,</hi> where they met with the Minister of <hi>Maidston,</hi> and having conferred together with the Coetus or two forraigne Churches of <hi>London;</hi> they made this answer in writing to my Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

            <p>This Answer was delivered up to Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> by the Deputies at his house in <hi>London;</hi> who said it was a modest answer and with respect, and that he would deliver it to my Lord; desired them to shew the parent of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, or a copy thereof, that my Lord might have a fight thereof; who were not willing to shew him the Originall, but gave him a copy thereof (written by a Notarie) to deliver it to my Lord. So taking their leaves of Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> and dilmissed with very cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous words, the Deputies returned to their severall Churches and charges.</p>
            <p>The Churches were in good hope that their answer would have given my Lord satisfaction and content, and nothing was heard from my Lord or his Vicar-generall for a long time; all seemed husht and asleep, but not dead: for Sir <hi>Nathaniel</hi> having ended his perambulation and visitation of divers provinces for that yeer, returned to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and intimated unto the Ministers of the French congregation, that my Lord was not satisfied nor content with their precedent answer, and had order to cite them to appeare with those of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Maidston</hi> before him and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners the 19. of <hi>December</hi> in Master <hi>Sumners</hi> house, to heare my Lords injunctions: The Deputies of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> appeared at the place &amp; time before them, who propounded the injunctions spake som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the English Liturgy, wished it were received in their churches for the glory of the English churches; and seeing that both the english and strangers had but one Religion in substance, why should there be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Liturgy and discipline between them? told them that if they would conser &amp; discourse with the Divines (the Deane and Master <hi>Casaubon</hi>) they might goe downe into the Garden and there talk and communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Deputies answered, they came not there to conserre or dispute together, but to heare what they had to say from my Lord; and because the time to answer to the said injunctions was short, as that the natives should resort to their parish churches the third day of <hi>January,</hi> and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy should be read in the forraine churches the 14. of <hi>February;</hi> they

The Deputies told him, that the execution of his injunctions would be the dissipation, yea, the destruction of their Churches, that the ministry and poore could not be maintained; he seemed not to beleeve it, and said, that they were not to regard two or three Ministers; they replyed they did not speak for themselves, but for their Churches; many among them not understanding the english tongue; he said, that was but a designe, and that from the beginning they should have sent their children to the parishes to learne the language and accustome them to it from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and youth. In fine, his full resolution was to have his injunctions put in full execution on the day prefixed, and that they should look to it to their perils, and commanded Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> his Vicar-generall to goe on with them: the Deputies said, they had the Kings royall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, who said he would shew unto the forraigne Churches the same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which the King his Father had shewed unto them, my Lord said, that they might goe unto the King if they would (as any Subject might doe) and his hand should not be the heavier on them for it; those that were English borne, and the Kings Subjects, should be subject to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and if they had any thing to say to him hereafter, they might come to him againe, and so dismissed the Deputies.</p>

                  </gap> as are borne in this Kingdome should resort to their parish churches.</p>
               <p>And the other of the strangers which shall remaine, shouldreceive the book of common-Prayer of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the other foraigne churches of the said Kingdome being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised thereof by letters, are all met together according to their order and ancient practice to cast themselves at your Majesties feet by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and to entreat your Majesty in all humility to consider, if the said sentence be executed, that there will follow much more hurt then good, as your Majesty cleerly may perceive by the reasons following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the hurt,</hi> it will fall very great, as well in regard within as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Realme, of this sentence be executed.</p>
               <p>For thereby will be abolished the priviledges granted and confirmed to the said churches by King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the late King <hi>James</hi> your Father, all excellent Princes and of glorious memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59077:14"/>
Thereby likewise the royall promise of your Mrjesty given at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crowne, will remaine fruitlesse and without effect; from thence will follow a great confusion in families, some going to one Church, some to another, and many of the natives not understanding the English tongue; so that the heads of the said families will not be able duly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves of the duty towards those that are under them.</p>
               <p>Yea, from thence infallibly will ensue the dissipation of the said church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, forasmuch as the Natives (who are the pillars thereof) being cut off, there wil be no meanes left to entertaine the ministry nor to help the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of a great number of poore.</p>
               <p>By reason of that, many good workmen will retire themselves elswhere, who daily furnish excellent manefactures to this Kingdome and of all kind; and by their retiring many thousands of your Subjects who are imployed by them will find themselves destitute of work, yea from thence your custome is like to receive a great prejudice.</p>
               <p>If this sentence be executed in this time of confusion and trouble, it will cause a most sensible and sharp displeasure to all the reformed churches of divers countries, and more particularly to those of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, which is more, this will make the said churches not onely more hatefull and contemptible to their adversaries, but even will be able to draw persecution upon them, their enemies judging by this change, that the good will of your Majesty will be changed towards them.</p>
               <p>And Sir, if the persecution should begin there, as alwayes it is much to be feared; with what courage could the poore afflicted ones retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hither, as formerly they have done, knowing that their Liturgy should have been there overthrowne.</p>
               <p>Your Majesty will be also pleased to consider, that this alteration will hinder the conversion of many that are out of the way, living in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries under the dominon of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who to the encrease of the Kingdome of Jesus Christ, come hither in great number.</p>
               <p>Thereby will be broken the outward union and good intelligence of the English church with all other reformed churches, whereof our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Romish church will triumph and make bonefires thereof at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence will follow, that there will remaine but one Sacrament in our churches, being not admitted to administer baptisme to little children which shall be borne in this Kingdome, yea, it will come to passe that the use of catechizing will faile amongst us, having no children to be catechized.</p>
               <p>To make short, most gracious Soveraigne, thereby will be abolisht the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59077:14"/>
entire use of our Liturgy and discipline, which we have enjoyed so many yeers together, and have common with many churches in <hi>Germany</hi> with those of the Low-countries, and of the Kindome of <hi>France;</hi> all renowned in regard of the purity of their doctrine, common with that of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: As also in regard of great and excellent persons, which from time time are come out of the midst of them.</p>
               <p>And for all the good that can be pretended for it, will be.</p>
               <p>That by this meanes your Majesties Subjects will be seen to goe to their parishes, and to serve God after the ordinary forme of the Land; but in the most part of the said churches this is done hitherto by them going thither many times, being imployed in all sorts of charges and offices at others, causing their children to be baptized there, &amp; often receiving there the holy communion, and contributing for the Ministers and other Officers even as the rest of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Briefly, making profession with them of one and the same Religion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which concerneth the Liturgy and divine service; but besides, they come themselves with liberty amongst those of their owne tongue, to maintaine unity among them, and to provide for the entertainment of the ministry, as also for the relieving of the poore and needy.</p>
               <p>Which things, the late King your glorious and wise Father having ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered would never consent to the change, howsoever he were many times solicited thereunto.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, most gracious Soveraigne, seeing by these reasons it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether evident, that this change going forward, there will issue out of it more hurt then good, your Majesty is entreated in all humility, by all the said forraign Churches to enjoyne that the said sentence of my Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop's grace be not executed; and that the said churches continue in their liberties and priviledges that they have peaceably injoyed hitherto. And so our selves being full of consolation and joy we will more and more beseech the Almighty for the conservation of your royall person of the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, of your royall Issue, as also for the good and continuall prosperity of your Crownes.</p>

the Duke of <hi>Soubise</hi> was with the King in behalfe of the said Churches, who told him, they desired his Majesty that they might have a hearing, and he seemed to condescend to it by some words he let fall.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever the matter was whether it was the businesse of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> between the Kings Majesty and the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which imployed the Lords of the honourable Privy.

            <p>The Churches seeing the time passed away &amp; hearing of no answer, and perceiving that the time of the execution of the injunctions approached. found it necessary, that not all the Deputies of the Churches but the Deputies of the three Churches only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And although there were some of the company that thought it fitting the petition should be given to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty by the Deputies themselves, &amp; that some short speech should be made by mouth; yet it was thought fitter by the most votes, that the Duke of <hi>Soubise</hi> who had tendered the first petition, should be requested to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this second petition to his Majesty, who without doubt would bring an answer; whereas if the Deputies gave it, they might he as long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an answer as they had been before; but if the Duke of <hi>Soubise</hi> found it not fitting to doe it, then to entreat one or two of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Kings Bed chamber to tender it and if they refused to do it, as it may be they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59077:16"/>
they would speak their mindes, and doe some good offices to the Churches, but durst not oppose the Arch-bishop under board in that businesse, least they should incurre the Kings indignation for his sake, who was so potent and gracious with the King: The Duke of <hi>Soubise</hi> Noble-man of a curteous disposition, who took to heart the cause of the Churches, and pittied their case, was very willing to accept of that charge and goe to the King, and present him the petion; the Deputies offered to goe with him to the Court, if he thought good, according to the charge given them by the Company, and wait on him, yea, and speak to the King if need were; but the Duke found it not convenient they should goe with him for some reasons, but went himselfe even that day to the King, as having accesse unto him at any time, waited in the chamber of presence the Kings returne from dinner, and delivered this petition unto him in writing.</p>
            <p>The second petition of the three forraigne Churches of <hi>Kent</hi> delivered to the Duke of <hi>Soubise,</hi> beseeching his Highnesse that he would be pleased to present it to the Kings Majesty.</p>

               <p>Humbly shewing to your sacred Majesty, that the time limited by the most reverend Father in God the Lord Arch bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his grace, concerning the injuctions on Sunday next expireth, and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty as yet hath not signified your pleasure upon their petition delivered about fifteen dayes past, your sacred Majesty is most humbly prayed to give order that the execution of the said Injunctions be respited and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red untill their cause may be heard, as in all humility they desired: And as in duty bound, they will daily pray for your Majesties long and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reigne.</p>

            <p>The Company seeing the King gave no answer at all, or at least not dearely to the Petition of prorogation of time, untill his Majesty had leasure to heare them; and that the time approached, and that there was no appearance to have any other answer from the King, thought it convenient to send some of the Company to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who seemed over-swayed the King) to know the Kings minde and pleasure and his owne (which was also the opinion of a Councellour of State:) the Deputies therefore of the three forraigne Churches in <hi>Kent,</hi> whom it concerned primarily, by the advice and votes of the Sinod, went to Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> Vicar generall, and told him that my Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> gave them permission to goe to the King, which they had done and now came to him to know the Kings pleasure and answer; they told him besides that they had studied the case better since they were with my Lord (for they had kept the principall arguments in the reare) and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to speake to him againe, and to shew him some reasons which he had not seene as yet; they told him also, that the time of the execution of the Injunction was neere, to wit, the first of <hi>March;</hi> that they could not returne to their Churches at the appointed time, because they had not as yet the Kings answer, and hoped that their Churches might continue their accustomed order. Sir <hi>Nathaniel</hi> told them that he would speake to my Lord about it, who was not so straight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for a weeke or two. He went to my Lord on some occasion and returned, told them they should doe well to goe to my Lord either at <hi>Whitehall</hi> or <hi>Lambeth</hi> to know his pleasure concerning the time he would appoint to heare them. The Deputies went to <hi>Lambeth</hi> and expected his comming from the Councell somewhat late, for there was a cry in the Hall, Hats off and lights, for my Lords grace is at hand: where in the Hall they met my Lord, I.B. told him that his Vicar generall had told them that his grace was content to heare them againe, and therefore they came to know his pleasure, desiring a time when they might be heard. He told them their motions did not please him, because they were not according to his judgement; that he was full of businesse, and knew not when he should be at leisure; but that Sir <hi>Nathaniel</hi> might pitch upon a probable time he might be at leasure, and so dismissed them.</p>
            <p>It might have beene returned to him, his judgement did not please them, because it was not according to their motion; but he held his peace. So when the Archbishop said here above mentioned, that their

The Deputies sent word to the Vicar generall my Lords minde; who esteemed Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the afternoone the fittest day. Doctor <hi>Primrose</hi> and <hi>I.

               </hi> that day and there dined, where they had much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course together about that businesse; and the said Lord thought it were better not to goe at all there, had not the promise bin made to goe there. So <hi>I. B.</hi> went from thence by water to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he found the other Deputyes, and went together to my Lord of <hi>

            <p>My Lord received the Deputies courteously, and spake to them kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but before he would enter into the businesse, he told them he had something to say to them; to wit, that he had heard say, that they had reported, that he had said they had no ministery among them; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he was very harsh and would give them no hearing as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Doctor <hi>Primrose</hi> and <hi>J.

at least 600. Papists that came from the Archdukes Countrey, that had beene converted by their Ministery in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and renounced popery in the space of ten yeers, they might have said a thousand in lesse then twenty yeers; that in the french Church in <hi>London</hi> there were at one time 47.

English at work in and about <hi>Colchester,</hi> and that they of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> did set a great number of English at work: My Lord kept the Fundamentals and reasons and took out of his pocket the two Injunctons, and read them, and said, he never commanded the second Injunction about the receiving the English Liturgy (translated into French) in their Churches; nay, he said it was impossible it could be done at that time appointed, namely, the first of <hi>March,</hi> especially in regard of the Dutch translation, he never minded to tye the strangers to it, nor had given such order, but that the strangers should hold their owne Liturgy; and said, God forbid he should take away their Liturgy or change their discipline, telling his Vicar-generall that he was mistaken, and therefore changed the words of the Injunction, as we shall see anon; notwithstanding Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> could have shewed my Lords hand to both the Injunctions, and the Order above mentioned commanding the two Injunctions to be observed. But my Lord said, as for the other Injunction he would have it observed, namely, that the Natives Subjects to the Kings Majesty should be members of the Parishes, and resort to them; he would not have them to be mungrels (which was a harsh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> terme, who knowes what the word Mungrell signifies, so that most Princes of Europe and their issue might be taxed by that phrase.) It was told him that many went to the Parishes, heard Sermons, which might suffice, and that if there were a command, they desired that it might be a command without prohibition: he said, he would not change his Injunction, and that would not hinder but that they might go some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the forraigne Churches; and Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> spake to my Lord in their behalfe, and asked him if it would not suffice that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives went now and then to the Communion, as once or twice a yeere: but my Lord would not permit that, for he should finde an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that kinde, as of those that put on the Surplice once or twice a yeere.</p>
            <p>A proposition was made unto him by Master <hi>Miller,</hi> about the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of those forraigne Churches that were <hi>English</hi> borne, Whether they might continue in their charge. He answered, he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59077:18"/>
those that were already in the Ministry, but hereafter none should be admitted to be Ministers in their Congregations but those that were strangers &amp;c.</p>
            <p>At last, the Deputies requested two things of my Lord: the one, that he would conceive a good opinion of them: the other, that he would be a mediator betweene them and the King (it was the advice of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, for he had said. It was the Kings will and command.) He said, that he had a very good opinion of them, that they were honest and good men. And as for the second, he could not be an intercessour for them, because he was the man that had set this businesse on foot; but if they would make a Petition to him, he would tender it to his Majesty. In fine, ready to dismisse them, he desired an uniformity in the Church, asked the names of the Ministers, wished the Deputies as much good as the greatest friends they had; prayed God to blesse their Ministery and endeavours; tooke his leave of them, and said, he would goe to Service and serve God.</p>
            <p>The Deputies had occasion to thanke God, being glad that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Injunction was taken off, so were thofe of the Synod and the Duke of <hi>Soubise,</hi> and my Lord Ambassadour, and some Noble men of the Court of the honourable Privie Councell. As for the Deputies, they had occasion to rejoyce for their Churches good, that the Kalends of <hi>March</hi> were past (which <hi>Julius Casar</hi> did not passe) and they and the Churches rejoyced, that the principall or moitie of the Injunctions was taken away; <hi>Dimidium facti qui bene caepit habet,</hi> and <hi>dimidium plus toto:</hi> for the observation of that Injunction would have given a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound to the Churches, and made a shipracke of them. <hi>Qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit hinc fluctus, fluctus supereminet omnes, Posterior Nono est un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimoque prior.</hi> So that a great number of the Strangers would have beene indangered to have suffered shipracke, and compelled to save themselves on boords like to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Malta</hi> among the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</p>
            <p>As the Assembly rejoyced that one of the Injunctions was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, so were they sorry that the other remained; which being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: would in time undermine the Churches and blow them up. And concerning a Petition mentioned by my Lord about one degree, it was not thought fit to doe it, as being very prejudiciall to the Churches, a thing that the Deputies could not doe, not knowing the resolution of their Churches, and whether they would submit and subject themselves and their posterity. So the Deputies went to Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> told him, they had beene long absent from their Churches, and intended by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59077:18"/>
Gods grace to returne to them, thanking him for all his favours shewed towards them, praying him to continue them.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Synod thought it fit to send some of their company to thank divers persons for their good affections towards them, and paines taken for them: the Deputie were Doctor <hi>Primrese</hi> President, <hi>John Bulteel,</hi> and Master <hi>Timotheus</hi> with two Elders, Master <hi>Lucie,</hi> and Master <hi>L'Amj,</hi> who went to the Duke of <hi>Soubise</hi> and thanked his Highnesse for the paines he had taken for them, as being the prime man under God who had laboured the most, and most obtained for the Churches, and desired him at his first occasion to thank the Kings Majesty for his royall bounty and favour towards their Churches; he took it very kindly, and promised them his help as much as lay in his power, and to goe to the King and thanke him, and to pray him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his royall favour towards the said Churches, especially touching the execution of that part of the injunction, about the natives borne of the strangers and their children, that they might not be liable to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof: They went also to my Lord <hi>Joachimi</hi> Ambassador of the Estates of the united Provinces (with whom they dined) and thanked him for his good counsell and advices; he told them his affection was good, offered unto the Churches all kind of good offices and services according to his power: They went to Secretary <hi>Cooke</hi> and thanked his Honour for all the good offices he had done in their behalfe; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Je n'ay rien fait que mon debuoir vous troumtez le Roy fort gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:</hi> They also thanked Master <hi>Weckerlin</hi> in the name of the three forraigne Churches of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>John Bulteel</hi> in especiall in his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es name, for his love and paines taken for them; they were to thanke others who were absent from Court, as my Lord Chamberlaine, and Sir <hi>William St. Ravi:</hi> the Deputies of the Churches of <hi>London</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and promise to thanke them at the returne of my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine and <hi>St. Ravi,</hi> in the name of the Churches of <hi>Kent,</hi> and their owne: They met Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> Knight, and the Kings prime Physician at Court, and thanked him in like manner, &amp;c. And J. B. thanked Master <hi>Burlamacht</hi> for his paines taken in the behalfe of their Churches.</p>
            <p>Meane while Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> sent to the Deputies of <hi>Kent</hi> to speak to them, who went to him; he told them my Lord was not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their answer, they were booted and ready to returne for <hi>Kent,</hi> but he told them, they should doe well to speake to my Lord at Court, where they met Sir <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> who went to my Lord with whom he was not long, because he went to the Chappell to heare the Sermon; so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59077:19"/>
he came to them as they were in the Court, and told them my Lord had no leisure to speak to them any more, but gave him a command to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them the observation of the Injunction touching natives on the first day of <hi>April,</hi> which he told them openly in the Court-yard, in the presence of his owne Secretary, and of my Lord's generall Aparitor, (whom he called as a witnesse thereof) so seeing there was no meanes to have further audience of my Lord, businesse creeping on him by the death of the Lord Treasurer that morning, they took their leave of him, and returned to <hi>London,</hi> where they related to the Synod what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; who counselled them that in no manner they should publish the Injunction in their Churches, namely, that the natives should resort unto the parishes where they dwell as absolute members of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the said parishes, because it tendeth to the destruction of the said Churches, which they are bound to edisie; telling them also that if the execution of the said Injunction were harshly prosecuted, that they should certifie the Coetus thereof, and they would speake to the Duke of <hi>Soubise,</hi> who would goe to the King and tell his Majesty of it, that he might remedy it according to his royall promise, connselled them to goe home with expedition and follow their charges, <hi>March</hi> 13. 14. <hi>dayes</hi> So after thanksgiving to Almighty God and mutuall imbracings of one another in taking their leaves, the Synod brake up, and the Deputies of <hi>Kent</hi> returned to their houses, Churches and charges, to the comfort of their Churches and Families, and preached on the Lord's day to their Congregation, with thanksgiving to God, to the edification and joy of their flocks.</p>
            <p>The Churches of <hi>Kent</hi> continued their ordinary course untill the moneth of <hi>April,</hi> and there was an intercourse of letters between some honourable friends at <hi>London</hi> and the Ministers of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who hoped matters would goe well at last, and the Injunction would dye of it selfe. But the Vicar-generall having been at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and given an Injunction from my Lord to the two forraigne Churches, Dutch and French, concerning the natives, that they were to resort to their parish Churches; the Ministers and Elders of the forraigne Churches of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> were cited to appeare before my Lords Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in his Consistory at <hi>Canterbury</hi> on <hi>April</hi> 13. where they appeared; where J. B. said that it was the first time that ever they were in that place, namely, in the Consistory in that manner, the Deane asked him whether he refused Episcopall jurisdiction, whereunto he answered he desired him not to presse that question, they had appeared before my Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; the Deane told them that the Injunction was to be published in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59077:19"/>
their Churches the next Sabbath day by the Ministers; they desired to be excused, as being not their office to disperse or dissipate their stocks, but rather to unite and preserve them; then the Commissioners said, it might be done by the Elders; it was answered, that they answered in their names, they could not doe it, neither for the reason afore alleadged, neither was there any such circumstance in the Injunction, that it should be published by Ministers or Elders; then the Deane said, it might be published by Master <hi>Somner</hi> or his sonne in the said Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Deputies answered, that they desired not that also, although they could not hinder it; the Commissioners gave a charge to Master <hi>Somner</hi> to certifie the Ministers of the parishes, that they might receive all those that would come to their parishes, being natives, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Sumner</hi> gave to the two Elders of the two Churches, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Injunction in this forme.</p>

whereupon the Church of Canterbury intended to send but one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and an Elder (whereas before they had sent both the Ministers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not leave their Church unfurnished of the Ministery and Preaching.

            <p>Whilest these things were a doing, above all expectation and hope Master <hi>Somner</hi> came unto <hi>J.</hi> B at his house, told him he had a Letter from my Lords Secretary, which he shewed him; wherein he certified him that my Lord had respited the observation of the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the first of <hi>July,</hi> whereof he was glad; for although <hi>quod dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the meane time, it was thought fit, and now the time and opportunity seemed to be, that the Citie should make a Petition to my Lord in the Churches behalf according to their proffer and promise.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59077:22"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> the Injunctions which I have made, concerning the strangers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to their severall parishes (I meane such as are natives, and with such interpretation as I made to them when they were last with me) must stand in force and be obeyed: As for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which you desire may be taken into consideration, you are to receive this Answer to them.</p>
                  <p>The first is, your feare that their poore will be cast upon you whereat you have too many of your owne: To this you must know, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the State expresly is, that though they doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> themselves to the english parishes, yet they shall contribute to their poore as they did before, and look as well to them in all respects at least so long a till some other sitting order can be taken; and they must not look being come in strangers hither, to receive so much peace, and benefit by the State as they doe, and not conforme themselves in those things which are required of them, as all strangers doe in all other parts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>For the second that divers of their trades will fule which are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the rules of their congregations: That is grounded upon no reason at all for I hope the congregation doth not set rules to their severall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> while they are at Church, nor make it any part of that service; and for any other meetings to set rules to their trades or to doe any thing else about them, there is no Injunction that restraynes them from; neither need their resorting to their severall parishes any way hinder that: And whereas you adde that no English, man in your City hath ever had knowledge or interest in those trades, the Lords like that worse then any thing else and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so to doe, for why should strangers come here and enjoy the peace of the Kingdome, and eat the fat of the land, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to teach such English as are apt and willing to learne the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and practice.</p>
                  <p>As for that which followes, namely that many poore English mome; boyes and girles shall not be imployed as now they are in spinning winding; drawing, and other worke whereon to their great benefit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> they are now daily exercised: Theres as little reason for that as for the former, for since nothing in my Injunctions need out any the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to their severall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all those women and children both may and must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> by them, as they formerly were, for their trade cannot goe on without such to worke under them.</p>
                  <p>And last of all, you say, If the congregation be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they will not be abe to contibute to the Cities charge, as heretofore they have usually done, and in good measure upon all such occasions as concerne his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> service: there is no more reason for that then for any of the rest, for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59077:22"/>
so long as they live in the City and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> their trades, both Native and Alien must ratably serve the King and the State; and I hope the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the Natives to the English <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>  duty, and to the City it is all one so the severall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> be payed, whether they be paid in a lump from the whole congregation, or part from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and partly from the congregation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines yet as Aliens.</p>
                  <p>In all these respects, though I have at your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
