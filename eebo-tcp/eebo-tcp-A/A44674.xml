            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>COLOS. I. 21.</bibl>
               <q>And you that were sometime aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and enemies in your mind by
wicked works, yet now hath he
reconciled.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a great and wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
whereof these words are a
part, which the time will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me to look into; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to fall on the consideration of
the words in themselves; which brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represent to us,</p>
            <p>The wretched and horrid state of men,
yet unconverted, and not brought home
to God.</p>
            <p>The happy state of those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and brought home to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The former in these words,</hi> And
you that were sometime alienated, and
enemies in your mind by wicked works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31702:4"/>
The latter in those words, <hi>Yet now
hath he reconciled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall apply my Discourse to the
former part of the words, and thence
observe;</p>
            <p>That men, in their unconverted state,
are alienated from God, and enemies to
him by their wicked works.</p>
            <p>This I shall endeavour,</p>
            <p>1. To explain, and shew you the
meaning of it.</p>
            <p>2. Evince, and let you see the truth
of it.</p>
            <p>3. Apply it.</p>
            <p>1. For the meaning of it. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it is the unconverted state
of man that is here reflected upon,
and referred unto. <hi>You that were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
alienated, and enemies in your
mind by wicked works.</hi> They were so
before they were turned to God. He
writes to those <hi>Colossians,</hi> as to <hi>Converts,</hi>
to them that were <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>faithful
Brethren in Christ,</hi> Vers. 2. to them
that were now Believers in Christ, and
Lovers of the Saints, <hi>V.</hi> 4. telling them,
they sometimes had been <hi>enemies by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31702:4"/>
wicked works.</hi> Before conversion, they
had as is elsewhere said, <hi>their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
darkened, being alienated from
the life of God;</hi> walking, as <hi>other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
walk, in the vanity of their mind,</hi>
Ephes. 4. 18. compared with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Verse. This is the deplorable
condition of the unconverted World.
They are alienated from, and enemies
to God, by wicked works.</p>
            <p>We are to consider, what this <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from God</hi> doth import. It sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
estrangement, unacquaintance
with God; and that without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
towards him, or dispostion
to seek his acquaintance. The word
is emphatical, it signifies <hi>people of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Country.</hi> You were like people
of another Country. Of such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Language, Manners, and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
they that are converted are to
you, and you to them. You are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
to their Speech, Customs,
and Ways. All that is of God was
strange to you. Men in their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
state are strangers to God.
Wicked men do not understand the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31702:5"/>
words of the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 43. What
relates to the Kingdom of God the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
man dislikes, <hi>Job 21. 14.
They say to God, depart from us, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not the knowledge of thy ways. Man,</hi>
who was originally made for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and communion with him,
is now so degenerated, that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a meer stranger to him.</p>
            <p>The next word to be taken notice of,
is, <hi>Enemies,</hi> which may seem to add
somewhat to the former word <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
There is not only <hi>no inclination</hi>
towards God; but there is a <hi>disincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
Not only <hi>no affection,</hi> but a
<hi>disaffection.</hi> The <hi>carnal mind is enmity
to God.</hi> And the effects of this enmity
are obvious. This alienation from
God is voluntary, affected, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
Men in their unconverted state,
are not only <hi>strangers</hi> to God, but <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi>
against God, and that <hi>in their
minds.</hi> A most fearful case, full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment,
that the very <hi>mind of
man,</hi> the off-spring of God, the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mind, as an Heathen call'd him;
that this most excellent part, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31702:5"/>
belonging to the nature of man,
should be poison'd with malignity,
and envenom'd with enmity against
the glorious ever-blessed God! The
mind of man; his thinking power;
the fountain of thoughts, should be
set against God, who gave him this
<hi>power to think!</hi> Yet into this Reason
must every mans unacquaintance with
God be resolv'd. They know not
God, and converse not with him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they have no mind to it.
That noble faculty in man, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
the nature of God, is turn'd
off from him, and set on vain things
that cannot profit; as also upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and impure things, that render
them more unlike to God, and disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By wicked works]</hi> which must have
a double reference.</p>
            <p>1. Former wicked works, as done
by them.</p>
            <p>2. Future wicked works, as resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on by them.</p>
            <p>1. The former wicked works, which
they have done, have more and more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31702:6"/>
habituated their Souls unto a state of
distance from God. The longer they
live, the longer they sin. And the
longer they sin, the more they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in their enmity against God.</p>
            <p>2. Future wicked works, as resolv'd
on to be done. They purpose to live
as they have done, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the same liberty in sin as before,
and will not know God, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him, lest they should
be drawn off from their resolv'd sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
course. For the knowledge of
God, and a course of sin are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
things, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 34. Awake to
righteousness and sin not, for some have
not the knowledge of God. This is the
condemnation,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. <hi>that light is
come into the world; but men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather than light, because their
deeds are evil.</hi> They hate the light,
because they will not have their course
altered. They resolve to do as they
have done. And that light, which
brings with it a tendency to the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, they cannot endure. But
then, as this alienation of mind, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31702:6"/>
enmity are against the light that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
God, they finally terminate on
the blessed God himself. As God is
the term of Reconciliation, so he is
the term of this enmity and alienation.
Wicked men look on God with enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind under several notion;</p>
            <p>1. As he claims to be their Owner.
When he claims a principal propriety
in them; when he insists on his right
in them, as their Creator, as having
made them out of nothing. When
God owns, or claims them as their
Lord, that first signifies, he is their
Proprietor, or one, to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
But they say, they are their
own. If we have to do with God, we
must quit claim to our selves, and look
on God as our Owner. But this is
fix'd in the hearts of men, we will be
our own; we will not consent to the
claim which God makes to us. <hi>Our
tongues are our own,</hi> Psal. 12. 4. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men might as well say the same
thing of their whole selves, our bodies,
strength, time, parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are our own,
and <hi>who is Lord over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31702:7"/>
If you consider God under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Ruler, as well as an Owner.
Why should not God rule over, and
govern his own? But this the spirit
of man can by no means comport
withall; tho' 'tis but reasonable, that
he who gave men their Beings, should
give them Laws; and that he who
gave life, should also give the rule of
life. But this man, in his degenerate
state, will by no means admit of.
There are two things considerable in
the Will of God, which the mind of
man cannot comply withall.</p>
            <p>The Sovereignty, and the Holiness
of it.</p>
            <p>1. The Sovereignty of God's Will.
We must look on God's Will as absolute<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
Sovereign. Man must look on God's
Will to be above his Will; so as that
man must cross his own will, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with an higher will than his. But
this apostatiz'd man will not do; and
therefore he is at enmity with God;
he will not submit to the Will of God,
as superiour to his Will. And then</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31702:7"/>
2. There is the Holiness of God's
Will. His Law is a holy Law, and
the renewed man therefore loves it.
But because 'tis holy, therefore the
unregenerate man dislikes it.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, <hi>God</hi> is consider'd under
the notion of <hi>our end, our last end,</hi> as
he is to be glorify'd, and enjoy'd by
us. There is a disaffection to God in
the hearts of unregenerate men in this
regard also. The spirit of man is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to living to the glory of
God. Every one sets up for himself.
I will be my own end. It shall be the
business of my whole life to please my
self. Therefore, when God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as our end, as in the 1 <hi>Cor. 10.
31. Whether you eat, or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
And as it is in the 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 15. No
man is to live to himself,</hi> &amp;c. The
great design of our being delivered
from the Law, <hi>(viz.</hi> as a cursing,
condemning Law is) that we may
<hi>live to God,</hi> Gal. 2. 19. <hi>I am dead to
the Law, that I might live to God.</hi>
This the unrenewed heart cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31702:8"/>
with. The last and great design
of all our actions must terminate on
God. Now <hi>self</hi> is set up, as the great
Idol, in opposition to <hi>God,</hi> all the
world over; and the spirits of men
grow by custom more and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to God in this respect.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>God</hi> would be owned by us
for <hi>our best good.</hi> This should be the
sense of our Souls towards him. So
it was with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 73. 25.
<hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> &amp;c.
But says the unregenerate Soul, the
World is better to me than God. And
it is upon this account, that when O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures
are made of changing this
state, the unregenerate mind opposes
it.</p>
            <p>Thus have you this Doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and opened. I come now in
the</p>
            <p>2d. Place, To evince the truth of
this Doctrine, and that by two Heads
of Arguments,</p>
            <p>Partly from our selves, and partly
from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31702:8"/>
1. From our selves. 'Tis an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and enmity of mind, that keeps
men off from God, and Reconciliation
with him, which will plainly appear,</p>
            <p>1. If we consider, that our minds
are capable of knowing God. Such a
thing is the mind of man, which was
originally made for such an exercise,
as to be taken up principally with
things relating to God. Our minds
can apprehend what is meant by the
nature of God, as a Being of uncreated
Perfection, in whom all Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Goodness do meet; who
fills Heaven and Earth, and from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
was God. Our minds tell
us, that we have a capacity thus to
conceive of God. 'Tis in the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of man's nature, to mind God, as
well as to mind vanity; but doth it
not. And whence doth this proceed,
but from enmity, an alienation of the
mind from God?</p>
            <p>2. This appears in that men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ignorant of God, and are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the knowledge of him out of
choice; ignorant, and are willing to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31702:9"/>
be so. This speaks enmity, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of mind more expresly, and
fully. That they are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, and yet are ignorant of him,
leaves no other cause assignable. But
their desiring so to be, plainly assigns
this cause, <hi>Rom. 1. 28. They liked not
to retain God in their knowledge.</hi> 'Tis
not grateful to them, <hi>Job 21. 14. We
desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi>
Men are ignorant willingly of that
God, who made the world, and all
things therein, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 5. For this
they are willingly ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. They
will not know God, though his <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Works</hi> shew his <hi>invisible Power,
and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1. 19, 20. Now
this can signify nothing but auenation
and enmity of mind. Men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and industrious to know other
things, and labour after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them; but they decline the
knowledge of God, and his ways, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alienated from God, <hi>through the
blindness of their hearts,</hi> Ephes. 4. 18.
This heart-blindness is chosen, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
blindness, signifies their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31702:9"/>
no mind or will to things of
that nature.</p>
            <p>But now the voluntariness of this
ignorance of God, and the enmity that
is, consequently, in it, appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in two sorts of persons.</p>
            <p>1. In many that are of the more
knowing and inquisitive sort, who do
all they can to make themselves <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Atheists;</hi> to blot, or rase the
notion of God out of their minds.
Of them I shall say little <hi>here.</hi> They
do their utmost, but in vain. It will
stick as close to them as their <hi>thinking
Power.</hi> But their <hi>attempt</hi> shews their
<hi>enmity.</hi> For they are content to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the grossest Absurdities into their
minds, rather than permit that notion
to remain unmolested there. Rather
imagine such a curious frame of things,
as this World is, to have come by
chance, than that it had a wise, just,
holy, as well as powerful, Maker.
They would count it an absurdity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto madness, to think the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
picture of a Man, or a Tree, to
have happened by chance; and can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31702:10"/>
allow themselves to be so absurd, as to
think a Man himself, or a Tree, to be
causal Productions. Is not this the
height of enmity!</p>
            <p>2. In the unthinking generality;
of whom, yet unconverted out of the
state of Apostacy, 'tis said, <hi>they are
fools,</hi> as is the usual Language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
concerning wicked, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
men; and that such fools, tho'
they never offer at saying in their
minds, much less with their mouths;
<hi>yet they say in their hearts, no God;</hi> i. e.
not <hi>there is none;</hi> for there is no [is]
in the Hebrew Text. The words may
rather go in the <hi>Optative</hi> form, than
the <hi>Indicative, O that there were none!</hi>
The notion is let alone, while it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
not their hearts. If it do, they
only wish it were otherwise. This
speaks their enmity the more; for
the notion lies a continual testimony
against the bent of their hearts, and
constant practice; that, while they
own a God, they never fear, nor love
him accordingly. And they grosly
misrepresent him, sometimes as all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31702:10"/>
made up of Mercy, without Justice,
or Holiness; and so think they need
no Reconciliation to him; he and they
are well agreed already. Sometimes
think of him, as merciless, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable;
and therefore, never look
after being reconciled to him.</p>
            <p>3. It appears hence, that men do
so seldom think of God, when as a
thought of God may be as soon
thought as any other, and would cost
us as little. Why not as well on God,
as upon any of those vanities, about
which they are commonly employ'd?
'Tis a wonderful thing to consider,
how man is capable of forming a
thought! how a thought arises in our
minds! And how sad is it to a consider,
that tho' God hath given to man a
thinking power, yet they will not
think of him! God hath given to man
a mind that can think, and think on
him, as well as on any thing else.
My body cannot think, if my mind
and spirit is gone: Though God gave
man the power of thought; yet men
will not use or employ their thoughts,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31702:11"/>
otherwise than about vain or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
things. God forms the Spirit of
man within him; hath put an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirit into him, whence a spring of
thoughts might ascend Heaven-wards.
When we have thousands of Objects to
choose of, we think of any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than God! And not only turn
this way, or that, besides him; but
tend continually downwards in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to him. Yea, men cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be put in mind of God. The
serious mention of his Name is distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Whence can this proceed, that a
thought of God cast in, is thrown out,
as Fire from one's Bosom; whence is
it, but from the enmity of mind, that
is in man against God?</p>
            <p>4. It further appears hence, That
men are so little concern'd about the
Favour of God. Whomsoever we love,
we naturally value their love. But
whether God be a Friend, or an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
it is all one to the unrenewed
Soul, if there be no sensible effects of
his displeasure. The men of this World
only value its Favours. The Favour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31702:11"/>
of God they value not. Whereas <hi>in
his Favour is Life,</hi> in the account of
holy and good men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 5. yea,
they judge <hi>his loving-kindness is better
than life</hi> without it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 3. When
men shall go from day to day without
considering, whether God hath a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for them, or not; whether they
are accepted, or not; whether they have
found grace in his eyes, or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
What doth this declare, but an enmity of
mind, and alienation from God? If men
had true love for God, it could not be,
but they would greatly value his love.</p>
            <p>5 That men do so little converse,
and walk with God, doth speak a fixed
alienation of mind, and enmity against
God. Walking with God includes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and minding him; but it adds all
other motions of Soul towards him,
together with continuance, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our selves to him therein. Now
agreement is required to walking with
God, <hi>Amos 3. 3. Can two walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unless they be agreed?</hi> Hos. 3. 3.
Men walk not with God, because they
are not come to an agreement with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31702:12"/>
him. God's agreement with us, and
ours with him, is, that we may walk
together. If we walk not with God,
it is because there is no agreement,
and what doth that import, but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation
of mind from God. Says
God, I would not have you live in the
World at so great a distance from me,
I would walk with you, and have you
walk with me; and for this end, I
would come to an agreement with
you. But Sinners will not come to
any agreement with God; and thence
it comes to pass, that they walk not
with God; they begin the day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, walk all the day long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, lye down at night without
God; and the reason is, because there
is no agreement; and that denotes
enmity. Especially considering,</p>
            <p>6. That daily converse with God
would cost us nothing. To have any
man's thoughts full of Heaven, and
full of holy fear and reverence of
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is included in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God) what inconvenience is
in this? what business will this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31702:12"/>
when a man goes about his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
affairs, will it do any hurt to
take God with him? No business will
go on the worse for it, it will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the success of our affairs,
1 <hi>Cor. 7. 24. Let every man wherein
he is called, therein abide with God.</hi>
Let your state be what it will, there
can be no business in this World, but
what you may do with God, as well
as without God, and much better.</p>
            <p>7. Which makes the matter yet
plainer. How uncomfortably do men
live in this World, by reason of their
distance from God, and unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
with him, <hi>Job 35. 10. But no
one saith, where is God my maker, who
giveth Songs in the night.</hi> They choose
rather to groan under their Burdens
alone, than cry to God their maker,
as at the 9th Verse of that Chapter.
When men will endure the greatest
extremity, rather than apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God; what doth this resolve
into, but enmity against God?</p>
            <p>8. That men do so universally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
God bespeaks alienation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31702:13"/>
of mind. As Obedienc proceeds
from Love; so Disobedience proceeds
from Enmity. And for this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall
only instance in two great Precepts,
wherein the Mind and Will of God is
exprest, which I mention, and insist
upon (tho' briefly) as things that
concern the constant and daily practice
of every Christian.</p>
            <p>1. A course of Prayer to God in secret.</p>
            <p>2. And having our Conversation in
Heaven. How express are both these
Precepts in the same Chapter; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. the latter, <hi>vers. 19,
20,</hi> 21. Now consider, whether our
disobedience to these two Precepts do
not discover great enmity in our
Hearts against God? What, to refuse
to pray, and pour out our Souls to
him in secret? To refuse placing our
Treasure, and our Hearts in Heaven,
what doth this signify, but aversion,
and a disaffected Heart?</p>
            <p>Let us consider each of them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and apart by it self.</p>
            <p>We are a Christian Assembly: How
should it startle us to be (any of us)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31702:13"/>
convicted of enmity against God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Christian Name, in two, so
plain cases?</p>
            <p>1. For Prayer, 'tis a charge laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all persons, consider'd in their single
and personal capacity, <hi>Matth. 6. 6.
But thou when thou prayest, enter into
thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy
door, pray to thy Father which is in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</hi>
I fear, that most of them, who
bear the Christian Name, carry the
matter so, as if there were no such
place in the <hi>Bible.</hi> When the mind
and will of God is made known to us
by his Son, who came out of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
that he will be sought unto; and
that not only publickly, but secretly,
and daily: that as we are taught by
our Lord himself, to pray for our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bread, and the forgiveness of our
daily trespasses; we are also to <hi>pray
in secret to him that sees in secret.</hi>
Can such commands be constantly
neglected and disobey'd, and not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the contrary bent of our will,
especially when we consider, that it
is enjoyned us for our own good? It
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31702:14"/>
would be profane to say, what profit is
it to us to call upon the Almighty? But
it is most justly to be said, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is it to the Almighty that we call
upon him? It is honourable to him,
but very profitable to our selves. If
we know not how to pray in a corner;
confessing our sins, and supplicating
for mercy; we cannot but live mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
lives. When therefore this is
not done, whence is it, but from an
enmity of mind? To a Friend we can
unbosom our selves; not to an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>I might also enlarge upon Family
Prayer. But if Closet Prayer were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
minded, you that have Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
would not dare to neglect Prayer
with them too. But if either be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with coldness, and indifferency,
it makes the matter worse, or more
plainly bad; and shews, it is not love,
or any lively affection that puts you
upon praying, but a frightened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
only. And a miserably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
deluded one, that makes you
think, the God you pray to, will be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31702:14"/>
mock'd or trifl'd with, or that cannot
perceive, whether your Heart be with
him, or against him. And so instead
of worshipping him, or giving him
honour in that performance, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and affront him. And all
this while, how vastly doth the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of your mind disagree with the
mind of God. I would, saith the
blessed God, have a course of Prayer
run through the whole course of your
lives; and all this that your Hearts
may be lifted up from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that your Hearts may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
every day, according to <hi>Mat. 6. 19.
Lay not up for your selves treasures on
Earth; but treasures in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Where your treasure is, there will your
hearts be also.</hi> And so we are led to
the other Precept mentioned before.</p>
            <p>2. As to a Heavenly Conversation,
God would not have reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who have intelligent spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, to grovel and crawl like
Worms in the Dust of this lower World,
as if they had no nobler sort of Objects
to converse with, than the things of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31702:15"/>
this Earth; nothing fitter for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
exercise, and enjoyment
of an immortal mind. The Saints are
finally design'd for <hi>an inheritance in
light,</hi> Colos. 1. 12. and their thoughts
and affections ought to be there before
hand; that they may become <hi>meet
for that inheritance.</hi> Will it do a man
any harm to have frequent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
of the everlasting joy, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and bliss of the heavenly state!
How joyous and pleasant must it be!
And why are we called Christians, if
he, who is our Lord, and Teacher,
revealing his mind to us, and expresly
charging us, to <hi>seek first the Kingdom
of God,</hi> to <hi>set our affections on the
things above,</hi> &amp;c. shall not be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Why is not Heaven every day in
our thoughts? Why will we lose the
pleasure of an heavenly life, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
it for earthly care, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or vanity, at the best? Why is it?
no other reason can be given, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an alienation of our minds from
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:31702:15"/>
9. Another Argument to prove this
alienation, and enmity against God,
is, the unsuccessfulness of the Gospel,
which can be resolvable into nothing
else, but such an enmity. The design
of the Gospel is to bring us into an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Son of God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him whom the Father hath
sent. Christ seeks to gather in Souls
to God; but they will not be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This is matter of fearful consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that when God is calling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
men by his own Son, that there
be so few that will come to him. How
few are there that say, give me Christ,
or I am lost? None can reconcile me
to God but Christ? You are daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
in Christ's stead to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. but in vain! What
doth this signify, but obstinate, invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
enmity?</p>
            <p>2. Another head of Arguments may
be taken from several considerations
that we may have of God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whence it will appear, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but enmity on our parts keeps
us at that distance from God, as we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31702:16"/>
generally are at. And consider to
that purpose;</p>
            <p>1. That God is the God of all
Grace, the fountain of Goodness, the
element of Love. Why are men at
that distance from him, who is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Grace, and Love it self?
The reason is not on God's part, 1 <hi>Joh.
4. 16. God is love, and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in love, dwelleth in God, and God
in him.</hi> What can our so great distance
from this God signify! from the most
perfect, the most excellent goodness!
but the most horrid kind, and the
highest pitch of enmity! Did men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this, what frightful mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
would they appear to themselves!
This is not only a plain, but a terrible
declaration of a most unaccountable
enmity on our part.</p>
            <p>2. God is still pleased to continue
our Race on Earth; a succession of
men in this World, from age to age,
made after his own Image, with minds,
and spirits that are intelligent, and
immortal, which declares a strong
propension in God towards such a sort
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31702:16"/>
of creatures; the inhabitants of this
lower World, tho' degenerated, and
fall'n from him. Notwithstanding all
their neglect of him in former ages;
yet new generations of men still spring
up, capable of knowing, and serving
him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. In the foreseen
heighth of man's enmity, this was the
steady bent of his mind towards them,
to <hi>rejoyce in the habitable parts of this
earth,</hi> and to <hi>have his delights with the
sons of men.</hi> Thus also in the 2 <hi>Chron.
6.</hi> 18. do we find <hi>Solomon</hi> in a rapture
of admiration on this account: <hi>But
will God in every deed dwell with men on
earth,</hi> &amp;c! And the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18.
That <hi>gifts are given to the rebellious</hi>
(the most insolent of enemies) <hi>that
the Lord God might dwell among them.</hi>
How admirable and unconceivable a
wonder is this! <hi>The heaven of heavens
cannot contain him, and will he yet
dwell with men on earth!</hi> And we yet
find, notwithstanding God's great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension,
that there is still a distance.
Whence can this be, but from man's
aversion, and enmity of mind against
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31702:17"/>
God? Thus are men still requiting
God evil for his goodness. God will
dwell with men on Earth, but men
will not dwell with him, nor admit of
his dwelling with them. They say
to him, <hi>depart from us,</hi> Job 21. 14.
'Tis thus from age to age, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to generation, which shews
God's goodness on his part, and the
enmity on man's part. See to this
purpose, <hi>Psalm</hi> 14. and 53. the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of each.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the forbearance of God
towards you, while you are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at mercy. With what patience
doth he spare you, though your own
hearts must tell you, that you are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
creatures, and whom he can
destroy in a moment! He spares you
that neglect him. <hi>He is not willing
that you should perish; but come to the
knowledge of the truth, that you may be
saved;</hi> by which he calls, and leads
you to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. On
God's part here is a <hi>kind intention;</hi>
but on man's part nothing but <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
enmity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:31702:17"/>
4. Consider God's large and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
bounty towards the Children of
men in this World, and the design of
it, <hi>Acts 17. 25, 26. He giveth to all
life, and breath, and all things, that
they might seek after him,</hi> Psal. 68. 19.
<hi>He daily loadeth us with his benefits.
He gives us all things richly to enjoy.</hi>
Act. 14. 17. <hi>God leaves not himself
without witness, that he doth men good.</hi>
He gives men Rain from Heaven,
when they want it, and, when unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
he with-holds it. 'Tis a great
thing to understand <hi>the loving-kindness
of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 107. 42. <hi>his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
works towards the children of men;</hi>
to understand our Mercies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and what their meaning, and
design is. By Mercies to our outward
man, God designs to draw our hearts
and minds to himself. Mercies are
bestowed on them that have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of thought, to consider the end of
all God's Mercies. 'Tis bespeaking,
and seeking to win our hearts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 4. 'Tis <hi>drawing us with
those cords of a man, with bands of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31702:18"/>
love;</hi> which plainly shews, what the
case requires; that the minds and
hearts of men are very averse, and
alienated from him, and therefore
need such drawing.</p>
            <p>5. And that which is more than all
the rest, is God's sending his Son into
the World, to procure terms of peace
for us, and then to treat with us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
and that <hi>in him he is reconciling
the world to himself,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19.
Doth not Reconciliation suppose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
as here, and in the Text. <hi>You
that were enemies in your minds—
yet hath he reconciled.</hi> As we have
noted, that on our parts, our with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and too commonly frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Overtures, speaks enmity,
and obstinacy therein; so on his part,
those Overtures themselves speak it
too. Here is the greatest kindness
and good-will, on God's part, that
can be conceiv'd. But it supposes,
what we are evincing, ill-will in us.
<hi>Christ came to seek and save that which
was lost.</hi> What a lost state was our
state! What to be engaged in a War
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31702:18"/>
against him that made us! <hi>Wo to him
that strives with his Maker,</hi> Isa. 45. 9.
Fall'n man is little apprehensive of it
now. If we continue unreconciled to
the last, at death it will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what a lost state we are in.
Upon this account it will then appear;
but this was our state before, when
it appeared not. In this state Christ
pitied us, when we had no pity for
our selves. Christ came not into the
World to save men only at the hour
of their death from Hell; but to raise
up to himself a willing people, that
may serve and glorify God in their
life on Earth. He is for this purpose
intent on this reconciling design.
And how earnest, how alluring were
his Solicitations in the days of his
Flesh! <hi>Come to me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
—He that cometh to me, I will
in no wise cast out.</hi> How pathetical his
lamentations for the unreconcilable!
<hi>O that thou hadst known the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to thy peace</hi>—And his bloud
was shed at last, as the bloud of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
of a reconciling Sacrifice,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31702:19"/>
first, to reconcile God's Justice to us;
but thereupon also, as in this Context,
<hi>Having made peace by the bloud of
his cross,</hi> vers. 20. to vanquish our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<hi>to reconcile us who were enemies
in our minds</hi>—vers. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>6. Consider Christ sending, and
continuing from Age to Age the Gospel
in the World; the design whereof
may be understood by the manifest
import and substance of it, and by
the titles given to it. As it reveals
Christ, the Mediator, the Peace-maker,
in his Person, Natures, Offices, Acts,
Sufferings, and Performances. As it
contains the great commands of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
towards God, and Faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> with the promises
of Pardon and Eternal Life, with
whatsoever is requisit to our present
good state Godward, and our final
blessedness in him. As also the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enforcements of such Precepts,
and confirmations of such Promises,
with copious Explications of the one
and the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:31702:19"/>
               <hi>And as it is called, the</hi> Ministry of
Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. The word
wherein Peace is preached by Jesus
Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 36. The Gospel of
peace, and of glad tidings, <hi>Rom. 10. 15.
as that very word</hi> Gospel <hi>signifies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gospel was, in its clearer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,
at the fulness of time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
with great magnificence, and
solemnity into the world, as the Law
had been, by the Ministry of Angels.
When the <hi>Sun of Righteousness, the
light of the world</hi> was arising, and
dawning upon it; then did a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Heavenly Host appear,
praising God, and saying, <hi>Glory to
God in the highest, peace on earth, and
good-will towards men,</hi> Luk. 2. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>But this Gospel is not a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
declaration of God's good-will
towards men; than their deportment
under it, their continuing to live, as
without God in the world, is of their
ill-will, disaffection, and enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God.</p>
            <p>7. And lastly, The strivings of the
Spirit in the Hearts of Ministers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31702:20"/>
the Gospel, and with the Souls of
men to whom it is preached, shew,
that there is a mighty enmity to be
overcome.</p>
            <p>1. God's giving forth his Spirit to
Ministers, enabling them to strive
with Sinners, to bring them to Christ;
<hi>according to the working of that power,
which works in them mightily,</hi> Colos. 1.
<hi>ult.</hi> What need of such striving, but
that there is a great enmity in the
minds of People to be conquered and
overcome? Sometimes we read of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel weeping over
Souls, who, for their too intent <hi>mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of earthly things, are called ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Cross of Christ,</hi> Phil. 3. 18.
Sometimes they are ready to breath
out their own Souls towards them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom they labour, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 8.
Sometimes represented, as <hi>travelling
in birth</hi> with them that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their charge, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. There
are Ministers, whose Hearts are in
pangs and agonies for the Souls of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
when the things of God are too
apparently neglected, and not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31702:20"/>
by them; and when they see <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from the Almighty is not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to them;</hi> and while they visibly
take <hi>the way that takes hold of
Hell, and leads down to the chambers
of death.</hi> They would, if possible,
<hi>save them with fear,</hi> and pluck <hi>them,</hi>
as firebrands, out of the fire; the fire
of their own lusts, and fervent enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
against God and Godliness, and
save them from his flaming wrath. Is
all this unncecessary, and what makes
it necessary, but that there is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striving,
an enmity working in the
Hearts of men, against the Spirits stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the Ministry, to be overcome?</p>
            <p>2. The Spirit also strives immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
with the Souls of Sinners, and
pleads with them, sometimes, as a
Spirit of conviction, illumination, fear
and dread; sometimes, as a Spirit of
Grace, woing, and beseeching; and
when his motions are not complied
with, there are complaints of mens
grieving, vexing, quenching, resisting
the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
implies continual striving. No
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31702:21"/>
striving, but doth suppose an obstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and difficulty to be striven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
There could be no resisting, if
there were not counter-striving. And
hereby <hi>despite is done to the Spirit of
Grace.</hi> O fearful aggravation! that
such a Spirit is striven against! 'Tis
<hi>the Spirit of Grace, Love</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi>
the Spirit of <hi>all Kindness, Sweetness</hi>
and <hi>Benignity,</hi> which a wicked man
doth despite unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. How
vile, and horrid a thing, to requite
<hi>Grace, Love,</hi> and <hi>Sweetness</hi> with <hi>Spite!</hi>
As if the Sinner should say, Thou
wouldest turn me to God; but I will
not be turned! The blessed God says,
<hi>Turn at my reproof, I will pour out my
Spirit unto you,</hi> Prov. 1. 23. There
are preventive insinuations, upon
which, if we essay to turn, plentiful
effusions of the Spirit may be hoped
to ensue. For he is the Spirit of Grace.
When we draw back, and resist, or
slight those foregoing good motions of
that Holy Spirit, this is despiting him.
And doth not this import enmity in
an high degree? That the Spirit needs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31702:21"/>
strive so much, that it may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
as with some, <hi>at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
he doth; with others, in just
displeasure, he strives no more, and
so it is never overcome.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Application:
Wherein the Subject would admit
and require a very abundant enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if we were not within neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
limits.</p>
            <p>Two things I shall take notice of, as
very necessary to be remark'd, and
most amazingly strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
by way of Introduction to some
further Use.</p>
            <p>1. That ever the Spirit of man, a
reasonable, intelligent Being, God's own
Off-spring; and whereto he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Maker,</hi> but a <hi>Parent,</hi> styl'd the
<hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> should be degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into so horried, so unnatural a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster!
What! to be an <hi>hater of God!</hi>
The most excellent, and all-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Good! and thy own Father!
<hi>Hear, O Heavens—and Earth, saith
the Lord, I have nourished, and brought
up children, and they have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31702:22"/>
me,</hi> Isa. 1. 2. Be astonish'd, O
ye Heavens at this! and be horribly
afraid! be ye very desolate! As if all
the blessed inhabitants of that upper
World should rather forsake their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Mansions, leave Heaven empty,
and run back into their original no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
than endure such a sight! An
<hi>intelligent</hi> Spirit, <hi>hating God</hi> is the
most frightful prodigy in universal
Nature! If all mens Limbs were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted,
and their whole outer-man
transformed into the most hideous
shapes, 'twere a trifle, in comparison
with this deformity of thy Soul.</p>
            <p>2. That it should be thus, and they
never regret, nor perceive it! What
self-loathing Creatures would men be,
could they see themselves! so as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to endure themselves, while they
find they do not love God! But men
are generally well pleas'd with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for all this. Though the case is
so plain, they will not see it. When
all the mention'd indications shew it,
they never charge or suspect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of such a thing as this enmity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31702:22"/>
against God! God charges them, and
doth he not know them? The Pagan
World that they are <hi>God-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Rom. 1. 30. even with
an <hi>hellish hatred,</hi> as the word there sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.
They that profess his Name are
apt to admit this true of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
but do we think our Lord Jesus did
injuriously accuse the <hi>Jews</hi> too, that
<hi>they had both seen, and hated him, and
his Father?</hi> Joh. 15. 24. How remote
was it from a <hi>Jew,</hi> who boasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
God's peculiar people, to think
himself an hater of God! And what
were they, of whom he says, by the
Prophet? <hi>loathed them; and their
Soul abhorred me,</hi> (which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed)
<hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8. and most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for can there be a more loathsome
thing than to abhor Goodness it self!
What the most <hi>perfect Benignity!</hi>
And those <hi>Cretians</hi> had receiv'd the
<hi>Christian Faith,</hi> whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
<hi>Titus</hi> to rebuke <hi>sharply,</hi> that
they might be <hi>sound in it;</hi> and of whom
he says, that <hi>professing to know God, in
works they denied him, being abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:31702:23"/>
Tit. 1. 16. Hence is our labour
lost in beseeching men to be reconciled
to God, while they own no enmity.</p>
            <p>Since this matter is so evident, that
this is the temper of the unconverted
World Godward, that they are <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him, and enemies in their minds</hi>
toward him, by wicked works: It is
then beyond all expression strange,
that they never observe it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
(as the Toad is not offended,
at its own poisonous nature) and are
hereupon apt to think that God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
it not, nor is displeased with
them for it.</p>
            <p>It is strange they should not observe
it in themselves, upon so manifold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
Do but recount with your
selves, and run over the several heads
of evidence that have been given. Can
you deny you have minds capable of
knowing God? Cannot you conceive
of Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Truth,
Justice, Holiness, and that these may
be, either more manifest, or in more
excellent degrees, even among Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in some Creatures more than
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31702:23"/>
in others; but <hi>that Being,</hi> in which
they are in highest, and most absolute
perfection, must be God? Can you
deny that you have lived in great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of God much of your time?
that your ignorance was voluntary,
having such means of knowing him,
as you have had? That you have
usually been thoughtless and unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of him in your ordinary course?
That the thoughts of him have been
ungratefull, and very little welcome,
or pleasant to you? That you have
had little converse with him, little
trust, reverence, delight, or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
plac'd on him as the object? That
you have not been wont to concern him
in your affairs, to consult him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
his concurrence? That you have
not thought of approving your self to
him in your designs and actions, but
lived as <hi>without him in the world?</hi>
That you have not designed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or obeying of him in the course
of your conversation? That the Gospel
under which you have lived, hath had
little effect upon you, to alter the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31702:24"/>
of your Spirits towards him?
That, if his Spirit hath sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
you, raised some fear, or
some desires now and then in your
Souls, you have supprest, and stifled,
and striven against such motions? Do
not these things together discover an
enmity against God, and the ways of
God? And is it not strange you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see this? and perceive a disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to God by all this in your selves?
What is so near a man, as himself?
Have you not in you a reflecting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
<hi>Know ye not your own selves,</hi> as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Yea, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
men never find fault with
themselves, upon any such account!
and, consequently, think themselves
in such respects very innocent in the
sight of God, and think he finds no
fault with them.</p>
            <p>Now these two things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
will make way for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Uses. We infer therefore,</p>
            <p>1. That whereas it so evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that men are at enmity with
God, it cannot but be consequent,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31702:24"/>
that God is not well pleased with
them.</p>
            <p>No one is well pleased to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hate him. God discerns that in
the inward temper of mens minds,
wherewith he is not well pleased, <hi>viz.</hi>
this alienation of mind from him, this
wicked enmity that is so generally
found in them. They are wont to
make light of secret, internal sin. The
ill posture of their minds they think
an harmless innocent thing. But this
he remonstrates against, takes notice
of with dislike and displeasure; and is
counterworking this spirit of enmity,
not only by his word, but by his
spirit of love and power. Though
he doth not testify his displeasure by
flames and thunderbolts; yet he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
and approves not the course
and current of their thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
though he permit them,
sometimes without sensible rebuke, to
run on long in their contempt of him;
yet he declares it to be wickedness.
<hi>The wicked have not God in all their
thoughts,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. He expostulates
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31702:25"/>
about it; <hi>Wherefore do the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
God,</hi> vers. 13. threatens them
with Hell for their forgetting him,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17. yet Sinners are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that God doth not see, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
any thing of that kind, <hi>Psal.
94.</hi> 7. How unapt are they to admit
any conviction of Heart-wickedness!
Tho' 'tis more than intimated to be
destructive, <hi>Jer. 4. 14. Wash thine
heart from wickedness, that thou mayest
be saved;</hi> q. d. thou art lost if thy
Heart be not purged. Yea, when it
is so plain in it self, that enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, which hath its seat in the
Heart, makes a mans Soul a very
Hell! yet they seem to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very innocent Creatures, when
they are as much devilliz'd, as a mind
dwelling in Flesh can be! This is the
common practical error and mistake
men lie under, that they think God
takes notice of no evil in them, but
what other men can observe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them for. But he knows the
inward bent and inclination of their
minds, and Spirits. Why else is he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31702:25"/>
called, the <hi>heart-searching God?</hi> And
knows that this is the principal, and
most horrid wickedness that is to be
found among the children of men, an
alienated mind from God; and the
root of all the rest. The fountain of
wickedness is within a man. <hi>Simon
Magus</hi>'s wickedness lay in his thought.
'Tis said to him, <hi>Repent of this thy
wickedness, and pray the thought of thy
heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> Act. 8. 22.
And when the Prophet exhorts (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<hi>Jer. 4. 14. to wash the heart from
wickedness,</hi> he adds, <hi>how long shall
vain thoughts lodge within thee.</hi> And
our Saviour tells us, <hi>Out of the
heart,</hi> first, <hi>proceed evil thoughts,</hi> and
then all the other wickednesses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mentioned, <hi>murthers, adulteries,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19. And that enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and alienation of mind that turns
off the whole current of a man's
thoughts from God, is the original e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and, by consequence, lets them loose
to every thing else that offends him,
and ruins themselves. Yet when their
very Hearts are such an Hell of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31702:26"/>
(as what is more hellish than
enmity against God?) they are, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
wont to say, they have
good Hearts.</p>
            <p>2. Hence see the absolute necessity
of Regeneration. A Doctrine, at
which most men do wonder; which
our Saviour intimates, when he says,
<hi>Joh. 3. 7. Marvel not</hi> at it, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>I said, you must be born again.</hi> But
who may not now apprehend a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of being regenerate? What will
become of thee, if thou diest with
such a disaffected mind Godward? Do
but suppose your Soul going out of
the Body in this temper! full of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
towards the ever-blessed God,
before whose bright Glory, and flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Majesty (to thee <hi>a consuming fire)</hi>
thou must now appear: tho' most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
and as full of horrour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
dread! How will <hi>thine heart</hi>
then <hi>meditate terrour!</hi> and say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee, <q>This is the God I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love! whom I would never
know! To whom I was always a
willing stranger!</q> whose admirable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31702:26"/>
Grace never allur'd or won my Heart!
who in a day of Grace, that is now
over with me, offered me free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and reconciliation; but I was
never at leisure to regard it. <hi>The love of
this world,</hi> which I might have known
to be <hi>enmity against God,</hi> had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
engag'd me. It hath been the
constant language of my Heart to him,
<hi>Depart from me, I desire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thy ways;</hi> I must now hear
from him, that just and terrible voice,
even by the mouth of the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
and Saviour of Sinners, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me, I knew thee not.</hi> And
into how hOrrid Society must I now
go! <hi>The things that eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard,</hi> more glorious things
than <hi>ever enter'd into the heart,</hi> are
all <hi>prepared for lovers of God.</hi> And
for whom can everlasting <hi>Fire be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
but for the Devil and his Angels,</hi>
and such other accursed <hi>God-haters,</hi> as
I have been! <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 41.</p>
            <p>Recollect your selves; consider the
present posture, and temper of your
Souls; and what your way and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31702:27"/>
course is: You care not to come nigh
to God now, but love to live at a
distance from him, through enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; from whence proceeds
your departing from him, and saying
to him, <hi>depart from us?</hi> But another
day you will have enough of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God. A wicked man's life
is nothing else but a continual forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of God, or departing from him.
I appeal to your own hearts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the justice of that mentioned
Repartee, <hi>They say</hi> now <hi>to God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us,</hi> Job 21. 14. And God
will then say to them, <hi>depart from
me,</hi> Matth. 25. 41. That man's Soul
must thus perish, that lives and dies
at enmity with God. Regeneration
slays this enmity; and implants in the
Soul <hi>Divine Love.</hi> Therefore we must
be regenerate, or we <hi>cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 3, 5. A man
must have a new Heart, and a new
Spirit created in him, in which Heart
and Spirit the <hi>Love of God</hi> is the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
principle. And therefore I repeat
to you, <hi>the things, which eye hath not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31702:27"/>
seen</hi>—and <hi>a crown of life,</hi> are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi>
and <hi>promised to them that love
him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9. Jam. 1. 12. You
may your selves collect the rest.</p>
            <p>3. Hence take notice of the Seat
and Subject of this Regeneration and
Change. It is the <hi>mind of man.</hi> For
<hi>you were enemies in your minds by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
works. We are to be renewed in the
spirit of our minds,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23. To
be <hi>transformed, by the renewing of our
minds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. You that
have not considered what Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, I tell you, 'tis to have your minds
altered, and changed. That whereas
you did not mind God, or Christ,
your minds being changed, you sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and delight in the things of
God, <hi>Rom. 8. 5, 7. They that are after
the flesh, savour the things of the flesh.
The carnal mind is enmity against God.</hi>
It is the mind, therefore, not as spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
meerly; but as practical, and
active, that must be renewed. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
therefore, what change do you
find in your minds? Are you in mind
and spirit more holy, spiritual and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31702:28"/>
And are your minds more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully
taken up with the things of
God than formerly? Till your minds
are thus changed, they cannot be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God; but will be perpetually
full of enmity against God. You
will only mind earthly things, <hi>Phil.
3.</hi> 19, 20. with the neglect of God,
and Heaven, and heavenly things. If
ever the Gospel doth us good, it must
be by the change of our minds.</p>
            <p>4. And in the last place. Hence
understand the absolute necessity of
Reconciliation with God; because you
have been alienated, and enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him by wicked works. Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
cures in part your enmity;
but makes no atonement for your
guilt in having been enemies. For
this you need a Reconciler, that could
satisfy for you. What will become
of the man that is not reconciled to
God? If you be God's Enemy, can he
be your Friend? And if God be your
Enemy, he is the most terrible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
How can we lie down in peace
in an unreconciled state? or without
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31702:28"/>
knowing, whether we are reconciled,
or not? Let not the Sun go down
this day, and leave you at enmity
with God. If you have fallen out
with a man, the <hi>Sun is not to go down
on your wrath.</hi> And is your enmity
against God a juster, or more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing? O let not the Sun go down
before you have made your peace.</p>
            <p>And for your encouragement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that it is the Office of the Son
of God to reconcile you to him. He
is the Reconciler, the Peace-maker,
the maker up of Breaches between
God and Man. He is, if you resist
not, ready, by his Spirit, to remove
the enmity that lies in your minds
against God; and, by his bloud, he
causes Divine Justice to be at Peace
with you. If you find the former ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that assures you of the latter.
Bless God that he hath provided, and
given you notice of such a Reconciler,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. God was in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the world to himself.</hi> Bless God
that he hath sent and settled one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you on this errand, <hi>to beseech
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31702:29"/>
you to be reconciled to God,</hi> vers. 20.
<hi>Blessed is the man, whose iniquities are
forgiven;</hi> and blessed is the man who
can say, I was once an enemy, but
now am I reconciled; formerly I saw
no need of Christ, but now I cannot
live without him. How fearfull a
thing will it be to die unreconciled
to God under a Gospel of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
While the voice of the Gospel
of Grace is calling upon you, <hi>Return
and live; Turn ye, turn ye, why will
ye die?</hi> beware of dying unreconcil'd
under such a Gospel.</p>
            <p>When you return hence, retire into
a corner, and consider what a wicked
enmity of mind you have had against
God, and Christ; and pray that you
may be renewed in the spirit of your
mind, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23. Let an holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
be taken up at last (after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
neglects) as was by the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Prodigal, after he had long
liv'd a wandring life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18.
and onward, <hi>I will arise, and go to my
Father,</hi> &amp;c. and you will find God
a mercifull Father, ready to receive
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31702:29"/>
you, and with joy! Oh the joyfull
meeting between a returning Soul,
and a sin-pardoning God! When once
your strangeness, and your enmity are
overcome, and you are come into a
state of amity and friendship with
God; then will the rest of your time
be pleasantly spent in an holy, humble
walking with God, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Grace, till you come eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enjoy him in Glory.</p>
