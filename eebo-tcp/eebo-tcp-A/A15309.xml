            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Urteous and welbeloued, before that we proceede to the Treatise of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Cittie, we will first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse some particuler Actions &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedinges of <hi>Soliman</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and of the scituation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the said Cittie. Wee do reade in the Turkish Histories, that after the decease of <hi>Selimus,</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Emperour, succéeded his sonne <hi>Soliman,</hi> who in the beginning of his Raigne, shewed him-selfe to be of a very méeke and tractable Disposition, and gouerning his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in quiet and peaceable estate, resembling a Lambe in nature, as being then but young and vn-experienced: but after that he grow to ripe yeeres, and that with th'increasing of his age, the olde Turkish Ambition and Tiranie began to créepe in his heart: his louing lambe-like Disposition was conuerted to a most furious Lion-like rage; and an vn-quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheable bloud-thyrst, insomuch that all men were deceiued in their former hopes and expectations of him, for there was neuer any Turkish Emperor since the first springing of their Mahometan Religion vntil this day, that euer did soe much annoy and vex Christendome as this <hi>Soliman</hi> hath done.</p>
            <p>First in the yéere of our Sauiour Christ 1521. he <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23690:3"/>
in short time he tooke. Next went he to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there he shot downe the Walles, the Turrets and Houses: hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continnuing his violent assaults for halfe a day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther, insomuch that at one assault he lost 2000. of his men.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Christian Knights be-haued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so valiantly that they repulsed him with small loss on their side: but at length, by reason they coulde not receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ayde or succour which they expected, and further by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a great scarsitie of Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Munition and Uictuals (he hauing continnued his siedge for the space of nine Moneths) they were constrained to yeelde him the Forte, togither with great guifts and presents, conditionally, they shoulde enioy their Liues and Goodes: so that euery one with his Wife, Children and goodes departed thence into Italy.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he surprised the Cittie of <hi>Mongacum.</hi> scita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the <hi>Danubie,</hi> betwéene <hi>Ofen</hi> and Gréekish <hi>Weissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in the yeare 1526. the 26 of August.</p>
            <p>Next hee Rapayred to <hi>Ofen,</hi> besiedging the same with a huge and in-uincible Armie, whereat the Christians who kept the same, dispayring of any Rescue or succour, rendred it vp vnto him, vpon Condition of their liues safetie; but he hauing possession therof, kept not his agréement with them, but murdred the most part of them, and made the Residue of them Captiues.</p>
            <p>After this the King <hi>FERDINANDO</hi> went into <hi>Hungarie</hi> accompanied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>CASSIMIRVS</hi> Marques of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> being his General vnder him. He tooke and Re-gayned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citties and Castles from the Turks againe, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques dyed in that iourney.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Soliman</hi> vnderstoode thereof, he Returned againe to <hi>Ofen,</hi> molesting them with a violent siedge, and lost eight assaultes, but he continuing the same still without intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion, insomuch that the Souldiers of the Cittie being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied, and quite tyred, they yéelded the Cittie to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againe, who most miserably murdred them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23690:3"/>From thence he went to <hi>Pest,</hi> and <hi>Gran,</hi> &amp; Reduced them all to his will, and in this his fortunat vn-controlde vaine, no Fort nor Castle was almost able to resist him. He also came vnto the Cittie of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> thinking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same as easily as the others, and be-gyrt the same in 16. places rounde about with a strong siedge. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Cittie themselues fired thrée of the Subburbes, to th'end they might not aduantage the Tyrants, nor enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage themselus, They also auoyded the Citty of many thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sandes of vn-necessarie persons, as, Spirituall men, Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children: whereof the woemen and Children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the most part of them, fel into the Bloud-houndes Clawes.</p>
            <p>In the Cittie of <hi>Vienna</hi> remayned onely 2000. menne, who making continuall sallies vpon the Enemie in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Camp, tooke away 8. Barrels of Powder, whibh they had laide and appointed to vndermine the Cittie, &amp; blowing vp the Walles in many places: but perceiuing he could not preuaile, he was forced (God be praysed) with shame to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence,</p>
            <p>There was a speach giuen out of a thousand persons which the Tyrant notwithstanding should haue taken and caried out of the neighbour countrie and villages.</p>
            <p>This done, he departed towardes <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise his thrée sons, to wit, <hi>MVSTAPHA, MAHOMET</hi> and <hi>SELIM,</hi> which was done with great Triumph and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnitie.</p>
            <p>Also, in <hi>An.</hi> 1541. the saide <hi>Soliman</hi> tooke in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Morea,</hi> diuers Citties belonging to the <hi>Venetians.</hi>

Likewise, if at any time, their Kinges desiring to holde their Courts in any other Cittie or Castle, and that in the same they chaunced to dye, their Bodies were alwayes conueyed thither againe, where their Funerals were in most Royal sort celebrated, and were interred in a most stately &amp; worthy Cathedrall Church, which in former time was founded and built by <hi>Stephanus,</hi> Father vnto <hi>Emericus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the Honour of the blessed Uirgin <hi>Mary</hi>: which saide Church is soe endowed with such aboundance of Treasure and Priueledges, as it is acompted farre to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede all others neere vnto it.</p>
            <p>This Cittie is scituated on a Boggie place, seeming alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in Mens iudgments invincible, for it is fortified and begyrt with mighty strong Walles and Bulwarkes, &amp; hath also great Subvrbs thereunto, with particuler and priuat entrances, likewise there are strong Gates which are also fortified with Bulwarks and Walles against any suddain incurtion or inuasion of the Enemy insomuch that it can not possibly be entred, neyther is there any ordinary accesse but vpon the Bankes &amp; Walles of Earth cast vp in the Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish ground to trauel on.

            </p>
            <p>This invincible Cittie was by composition taken by the saide <hi>Soliman</hi> the 2 of Nouember, in <hi>An.</hi> 1543. and euer since hath bin possessed by those Infidels.</p>
            <p>Also, togither with this Cittie, he tooke many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was even at the same time when <hi>Fraunois</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> would haue invaded Germany, surprising diuers Citties in the prouince of <hi>Elsash,</hi> whereof many of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors

met him with the keyes in their handes: whereby those Citties were not spoyld nor distroyed, by reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> (of worthy memory) was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leaue the defence of <hi>Hungary</hi> to resist the French, and besiedged the Ile of <hi>Malta</hi>: but he was forced to leaue the same to his great Dammage.</p>

            <p>The Tyrant then perceiuing that with his Tyrany, hee could no further preuaile against Christendome, hee caused his first borne sonne called <hi>Sultan Mustapha</hi> through false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be murdred in 1553.</p>

               <p>In the Cittie was great store of powder (as some doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port 30000. waight) which the Turks had dispersed in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places and churches.</p>
               <p>But when as now our men in the assault were Running to and fro at vn-awares, or any of the Turkes witting of it, haue set the same on fire, and haue blowne vp all the houses and churches about their eares: so that it should seeme, that little more then the bare Walles are left standing.</p>
               <p>All the Riches and Treasure of the Turkes is consumed by fire, or else the poore Souldiers had gotten-good pillage, (the cittie being very Rich) but there was nothing at all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued except 300. imprisoned christians.</p>
               <p>By the fire also, we lost 300. of our men, as also many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordinance were molten.</p>
