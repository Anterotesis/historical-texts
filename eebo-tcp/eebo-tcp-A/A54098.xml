            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ye believe, that there is a God, that he is <hi>Holy, Juſt</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> that he Made us, that we Owe our ſelves to him, &amp; that he is not Careleſs of us, but the Conſtant Obſerver of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> and that as he is the Rewarder of them that <hi>fear, love</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, ſo he is the ſevere Puniſher of all ſuch as tranſgreſs his Law, and break his Righteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: if (I ſay) ye believe theſe things, and not only, that there is a Final <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Reckoning,</hi> but that God even in this World recompences his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon the Wicked, and viſit <hi>Nations</hi> with his hot Diſpleaſure becauſe of their <hi>Impiety</hi> (which hath been the Experience and Confeſſion of all Ages) <hi>then</hi> it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52323:4"/>
belongs to us of theſe <hi>Kingdoms</hi> to reflect upon our ſelves, and to take a true <hi>View</hi> of our Actions, ſince <hi>Divine Vengeance is at the door.</hi> And for the Lords ſake, let us have a Care in the doing of it, ſince God will not be mocked; and that our <hi>miſcarriage</hi> in ſuch an Inquiry will be as only our own Infelicity, ſo of infinite Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us. I muſt needs be Plain and Earneſt here; for if we miſcarry in the <hi>Search,</hi> we ſhall certainly miſcarry in the <hi>Cure. Sin</hi> gives the deadlieſt of all Wounds to Mankind; I grieve to ſay it, but 'tis too true; there is no Wound ſo ſlightily healed: we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek our <hi>Eaſe,</hi> than our <hi>Security,</hi> like thoſe Fools that love the <hi>pleaſanteſt,</hi> not the <hi>ſafeſt Potions.</hi> It is ill at all times, to flatter a Man's <hi>Self;</hi> but it is moſt Fatal about <hi>Repentance:</hi> Something men would keep, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing men would hide; and yet they have to do with that <hi>Searcher</hi> of <hi>Hearts,</hi> from whom its impoſſible they ſhould hide any thing. This <hi>Folly</hi> increaſes our Account, endangers our <hi>Cure</hi> and makes our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Deſperate, if not <hi>Irrecoverable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>England,</hi> my Native Country, <hi>Come to Judgment, bring thy deeds to the true Light;</hi> ſee whether they are wrought in God or no. Put not off thy ſelf with <hi>Hay, Straw</hi> and <hi>Stubble;</hi> for they will burn, and the <hi>Fire is at the Door,</hi> that will conſume them: he is coming, whoſe Reward is with him, and will give every one according to his Works. Let us therefore <hi>Examine</hi> our ſelves, <hi>Try</hi> our ſelves, <hi>Prove</hi> our own ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be in us or not; if his <hi>Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi> his <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> his <hi>Patience,</hi> his great <hi>Self-denyal</hi> dwell in us; if not, we are yet Reprobates, yet under the <hi>Reproofs</hi> of the Almighty; the Charge and <hi>Guilt</hi> of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52323:4"/>
               <hi>Sin;</hi> and his Witneſs in our own Conſciences ſends up Evidence to Heaven againſt us every day: this I juſtly fear and take to be our Caſe. Let us therefore ſtrictly look into our Converſations, and with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Eye take a view of thoſe Sins, that moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cry to the <hi>Great Judge</hi> againſt us. And they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be of Two Sorts; the one relating more particularly to the <hi>State,</hi> the other to the <hi>Church</hi> (if I may without Offence uſe that <hi>Diſtinction)</hi> for my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is with God, I intend not Provocation, but <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Impieties that relate more particularly to the <hi>State</hi> to correct, are <hi>Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms</hi> and <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Exceſs, in Apparel,</hi> in <hi>Furniture</hi> and in <hi>Living; Profuſe Gaming;</hi> and finally <hi>Oaths, Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> or Exceſs in Drinking, is not only a <hi>Violation</hi> of <hi>God's Law,</hi> but of our own <hi>Natures;</hi> it doth of all other Sins rob us of our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> deface the Impreſſions of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and extinguiſh the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God's Mercies and our own Duty: It fits men for that, which they would abhor, if <hi>Sober.</hi> The <hi>Inceſt, Murder, Robberies, Fires</hi> and other <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> that have been done in <hi>Drunken Fits,</hi> make <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> a Common Enemy to Humane Society. It renders men unfit for <hi>Truſt</hi> or <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> it tells <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,</hi> betrays <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> diſpoſes men to be <hi>Trappan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> and <hi>Cheated:</hi> Finally, it ſpoils <hi>Health,</hi> weakens <hi>Humane Race,</hi> and above all <hi>provokes the Juſt</hi>

               <hi>God to Anger,</hi> who cried thus of Old; <hi>Wo to the</hi> Drunkards <hi>of</hi> Ephriam! <hi>the</hi> Drunkards
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52323:5"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Ephriam <hi>ſhall be trodden under feet: they have erred through</hi> Wine, <hi>and through</hi> Strong Drink <hi>are out of the Way; the Prieſt and the Prophet have erred through</hi> Strong Drink, <hi>they erred in Viſion, they ſtamble in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Again, <hi>Wo unto them that are Mighty to drink Wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle</hi> ſtrong drink. <hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the Morning, that they may follow</hi> ſtrong drink; <hi>that continue until night, till Wine inflame them: and the Harp, and the Viol, the Tabret and the Pipe, and Wine are in their Feaſts; but they regard not the Work of the Lord, neither conſider the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of his hands. Therefore Hell hath enlarged her ſelf and opened her Mouth without meaſure, and their Glory and their Multitude, and their Pomp, and he that rejoyces, ſhall deſcend into it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet you will bear me witneſs, I do not <hi>wrong</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Humor</hi> of too many in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and thoſe not of the loweſt <hi>Quality,</hi> in ſaying, that it is too often the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> and <hi>top</hi> of their <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> it is their Common Diverſion and Entertainment; I might ſafely ſay, the Poor of <hi>England</hi> could be maintain'd by their Exceſs. Oh! hath the God of Heaven given men <hi>Plenty</hi> for ſuch Ends? or will this kind of Improvement of their Worldly <hi>Talent</hi> give them Peace in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But that men ſhould do all this without ſhame, nay, glory in it too, is greatly to be lamented; for 'tis not only Appetite, but the Vanity of Conqueſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites not a few, as if it were matter of <hi>Triumph</hi> to Drown a Man's <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and to Degrade him to the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Let us hear upon the whole matter the Sentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">

Thine Eyes ſhall behold ſtrange Women, and thine Heart ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perverſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is much of the Miſchief of <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> in a little, &amp; of the Exceſs and Wantonneſs of the <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;</hi> But did ever any Age come near ours, when the very Taſting of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Wine</hi> (that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally drunk of at many Tables) is enough to diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a Temperate Head? But that ſuch, Exceſſes ſhould be, while the Backs of the <hi>Poor</hi> are almoſt <hi>Naked,</hi> and their Bellies miſerably pinch'd with <hi>Hunger,</hi> is almoſt as great a ſhame to our pretences to <hi>Policy,</hi> as thoſe (I fear) we Unwarrantably make to <hi>Religion.</hi> Oh! that we were fit to receive that Heavenly Exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Be not</hi> Drunk <hi>with</hi> Wine, <hi>wherein is Exceſs; but be filled with the Spirit,</hi> (but God knows, this is mockt at! He goes on) <hi>ſpeaking to your ſelves</hi> (not in <hi>Lampoons</hi> nor <hi>Obſcene Songs,</hi> that excite Luſts, but) <hi>in Pſalms, and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging and making Melody in your Heart to the Lord, giving Thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

and was buried: And in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Torments, and ſeeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Boſom.

But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, Son, remember that thou in thy Life-time receivedſt thy good things, &amp; likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> Evil things; but now he is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thou art tormented.

It may not be improper for me here to add by way of <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Head of Exceſs the Sin of <hi>GA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MING,</hi> an Invention of much Miſchief in the World, &amp; therefore inconſiſtant both with <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Civil Government.</hi> The <hi>Evils</hi> that attend it, are neither ſmall nor few: It is <hi>Firſt</hi> a Great Enemy to <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and that Juſt Care, that people ought to have for the Diſcharge of their Reſpective Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their <hi>Civil Affairs. Next,</hi> It is one of the Greateſt Thieves to Mens <hi>Eſtates:</hi> Many brave Families have been ruin'd by a <hi>Gameſter:</hi> That which hath been got by the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> of a Father, it may be hath been loſt in one Night by the <hi>Extravagant Humor</hi> of a Son: But that the Reward of <hi>Virtue</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Stake</hi> of <hi>Folly,</hi> and the Acqueſt of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Anceſtors</hi> expoſed to the <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Hazard</hi> of the <hi>Die,</hi> is ſuch Impiety to <hi>God's Providence,</hi> Ingratitude to <hi>Parents,</hi> Injury to their own <hi>Families</hi> and Diſgrace to the <hi>Government,</hi> that I conceive, it may very well deſerve the Care of our <hi>Superiors,</hi> to prevent that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy</hi> for the future. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi> They who are addicted to <hi>Gaming,</hi> are the moſt Idle and Uſeleſs people in the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and give me leave to ſay, that men are <hi>Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the Government for their <hi>Time:</hi> there ought to be no Idleneſs in the Land; for that End <hi>Bridewels</hi> are provided. Of many other Sins people are Weary, but of this never, unleſs to <hi>Sleep,</hi> or <hi>Eat,</hi> or for <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> to Play: We are commanded to <hi>Redeem the Time, bècauſe the Dayes are Evil;</hi> but theſe people chuſe rather to <hi>Loſe their Time,</hi> and <hi>fall into the Evil,</hi> they

ſhould avoid. A <hi>Gameſter</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> are as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite as a <hi>Saint</hi> and a <hi>Sinner;</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> looks to God in the increaſe of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> the <hi>Gameſter</hi> to Skill and Chance; and there is no more of God in his Mind, than there is in his <hi>Game:</hi> and it cannot be otherwiſe. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Therefore <hi>Gaming</hi> deſerves to be ſuppreſt, becauſe it has been the Occaſion of <hi>Breach of Friendſhip, Quarrels, Bloodſhed</hi> and <hi>Murder:</hi> if we ought to ſhun the Occaſions of Evil, to be ſure we ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> Miſchief that belongs to <hi>Gaming</hi> (which I ſhall mention at this time) is the <hi>Horrid</hi> OATHS and <hi>Paſſionate Imprecations</hi> uſed by the generality of <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> but becauſe they are not confin'd to <hi>Gaming,</hi> but run through the <hi>whole Converſation</hi> of men, they may very well challenge a place among thoſe <hi>FourCry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins,</hi> that I found my ſelf Obliged in Conſcience to Complain of to ſuch, as have Power in their Hands to <hi>puniſh</hi> and <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> them. I have therefore reſerved to ſpeak of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> till <hi>laſt,</hi> becauſe I take them to be the moſt <hi>Provoking Sin.</hi> The other Enormities of <hi>Drunkenneſs, Whoredom</hi> and Exceſs in <hi>Apparel, Furniture, Feaſtings</hi> and <hi>Gaming</hi> do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate to our ſelves; and are therefore Sins againſt God, becauſe they are a Tranſgreſſion of that <hi>Order,</hi> which he hath placed in the <hi>Nature</hi> of things: but <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> muſt be referred to God himſelf; they are Sins committed more immediately againſt his <hi>Being,</hi> his <hi>Name,</hi> and the Majeſty and Dignity of his <hi>Nature.</hi> It is Horrible to hear, how he is <hi>called upon</hi> about every thing, be it never ſo <hi>Trivial;</hi> yea, about nothing, and worſe than nothing. He is

Summon'd at their <hi>Games,</hi> their <hi>Sports,</hi> their <hi>Obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> in their <hi>Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms, Murders, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> and <hi>Treachery:</hi> there is a Generation that cannot ſpeak without him, though they live without him; They would make him a <hi>Voucher</hi> of all their <hi>Falſhood</hi> and a <hi>Witneſs</hi> for their <hi>Lyes,</hi> as often as they would have them believed. But I tremble to Remember, with what <hi>Preſumption</hi> ſome Men, when tranſported into <hi>Rage,</hi> Invoke him to <hi>Damn</hi> thoſe, they are <hi>Angry</hi> with, yea, themſelves too! and how Impiouſly they ſend him at their pleaſure upon the Errands of their <hi>Vengeance!</hi> Can there be greater <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> then to dare ſo much as to think, that the <hi>Holy, Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> God ſhould be the Executioner of their <hi>Paſſion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fury,</hi> and the Avenger of their <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Corrupt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts!</hi> And it is Obſervable, that if in any thing they are Croſs'd or Diſappointed, they fall a <hi>Swearing, Curſing, Damning, Blaſpheming,</hi> as if the Name of God ſhould make them Satisfaction; and that it were a Sort of <hi>Eaſe</hi> to them, to deliver themſelves of a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> of <hi>Oaths.</hi>

            <p>To this I ſhall add a <hi>Brief Reflection</hi> upon that Pernicious Sin of <hi>PROPHANENESS</hi> ſo near a kin to <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> Such is the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of the <hi>Age</hi> we are fallen into, that <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> does not only go Unpuniſht, but boldly lays Claim to <hi>Wit,</hi> and fills the Converſation of too many of thoſe, that think themſelves rais'd above the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar.</hi> He is reputed <hi>Formal,</hi> that will not be <hi>Rude</hi> to <hi>Sacred Things;</hi> and a Man Inſipid, of no <hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> who cannot <hi>Jeer Devotion:</hi> And which is ſtrange, they make the Bible a ſort of <hi>Common Place;</hi> but 'tis for <hi>Mockery,</hi> not for <hi>Piety.</hi> The <hi>Phraſes</hi> they uſe, are pick't to <hi>Abuſe</hi> that Holy Book; and that <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> is placed to the Account of <hi>Wit:</hi> But truly, if Men muſt <hi>Rallie Religion</hi> at the Peril of paſſing elſe for <hi>Fools,</hi> and <hi>Abuſe Scripture</hi> to purge themſelves from the <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition</hi> of Reverencing it, there is here an Unhappineſs in being <hi>Conſcientious,</hi> and on the ſide of this World the Temptation to be <hi>Prophane,</hi> is ſtronger than the Encouragement to be <hi>Virtuous.</hi> For this is my Soul grieved, that Men ſhould uſe their <hi>Wit</hi> to Abuſe him, that gave it them: and that though there is more to be ſaid for <hi>Religion,</hi> than there can be ſaid againſt it, both with Reſpect to its Reaſonableneſs and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that the Hazard of being <hi>Irreligious,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater on the part of theſe <hi>Atheiſtical Scoffers,</hi> than of Men profeſſing to fear God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

another World; they would yet be ſo <hi>Conſtant</hi> and <hi>Obſtinate</hi> in their <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>lewd Converſation!</hi> But if the <hi>Prophaning</hi> of the leaſt thing, that was Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Worſhip of God in the Times of the <hi>Law,</hi> was ſo <hi>Hainous a Sin;</hi> what ſhould we ſay, when men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And to you all, that live in the Practice of theſe <hi>Crying Sins</hi> I have at this time inſiſted upon, this I ſay unto you in the Fear of God: <hi>REPENT OF THE EVIL OF YOUR DOINGS!</hi> Bring not down the <hi>Judgments</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon this Land; they may be the <hi>Affliction</hi> of many, but they will be your <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> ye ſhall pay the Reckoning of their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> in the other World, and God will charge you with the <hi>Calamity</hi> that they ſhall Endure!

            <p>Having thus ended my <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the <hi>Five great Crying Sins</hi> of the Kingdom, and my Reproof of the <hi>Actors</hi> and <hi>Promoters</hi> of them; give me leave to make my <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Addreſs</hi> to you, that are in <hi>Authority.</hi> And in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, I beſeech you to remember, that though ye are as <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth, yet ye ſhall Dye like <hi>Men;</hi> that ye are Encompaſs'd with like <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and are ſubject to <hi>Sin.</hi> Such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of you, as may be concern'd in any of theſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities</hi> (to what-ever Degree of <hi>Guilt</hi> it be) I beg you in the Name of God to <hi>ſearch your ſelves,</hi> and to be Juſt to your own <hi>Souls.</hi> O! let the Mercies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God conſtrain you to <hi>Unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance!</hi> Turn to the Lord, Love Righteouſneſs, Hate Oppreſſion, and he will turn to you, and love you and bleſs you.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Three</hi> Great <hi>Reaſons,</hi> which inforce my <hi>Supplication.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, The <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> which by ſuch <hi>Improvidence</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery</hi> is like to be greatly Weakened, if not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

            </p>
            <p>But there is an <hi>Higher Voice,</hi> unto which <hi>Chriſtian Men</hi> ought to have Regard, and that is the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who requires us to <hi>Fear him</hi> and obey his <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commandments</hi> at the Peril of making him our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let Care be taken <hi>To breed up Youth in</hi> MORALITY: for <hi>Virtue</hi> prepares the Mind, helps the Underſtanding and gives Induſtry to compaſs this. Let no <hi>Books</hi> be uſed in Schools, in which there may be the leaſt <hi>Indecency,</hi> there were (and not without Reaſon) Ancient Canons againſt the <hi>Reading</hi> of ſuch <hi>Heathen Authors;</hi> and not a few <hi>Learned</hi> &amp; <hi>Sober Men</hi> have rebuked that Practice amongſt us: It is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> yea, to our <hi>Natures,</hi> to fetch our <hi>Wit</hi> or our <hi>Manners</hi> from them. It were well, if ſome Tracts of <hi>Moral Virtues</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt <hi>Vice</hi> were written in thoſe <hi>Languages</hi> we would have <hi>Youth</hi> to learn: for in ſuch <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> they might obtain <hi>Good Manners</hi> with the <hi>Languages;</hi> whereas by tying up

               <hi>Schools</hi> to <hi>Heathen Authors,</hi> our <hi>Youth</hi> has learned <hi>Baſe Obſcenities</hi> and a <hi>Corrupt Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In the <hi>Next</hi> place, I would propoſe ſome of the eaſier Parts of <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and the Knowledge of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Natural Bodies</hi> to be compos'd on purpoſe after a <hi>Familiar Manner,</hi> that they may be Inſtituted in the Knowledge of <hi>Nature,</hi> and learn <hi>Things</hi> at the ſame time they learn <hi>Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Laſt</hi> Sort of Books, which I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend (and are in my Opinion moſt ſuitable to their Maturity of <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding)</hi> are ſuch as relate to the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of our own <hi>Kingdom;</hi> the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the True <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Policy</hi> amongſt us. But becauſe there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few (if any) of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> extant, it were Worth the Care of our <hi>Superiors,</hi> and an Act deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Praiſe, That ſome <hi>Skilful, Socer</hi> and <hi>Judicious Men</hi> were ſet to work for the Compoſure of ſome <hi>ſmall Tracts</hi> of this Nature; and as an Appendix to the whole, that there might be a <hi>Summary</hi> of the <hi>Moſt Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Infamous Actions</hi> of <hi>Former Times,</hi> with the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> they have received from God and Juſt Government: that by the Power of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> they may be deterr'd from <hi>Vice,</hi> and provoked to an Honeſt <hi>Emulation</hi> of the <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>Antients.</hi>

            <p n="4">(4.) In the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, <hi>Croſs not the</hi> Genius <hi>of your Youth,</hi> Match their <hi>Talents</hi> well; for if ye do not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">(5.) My <hi>Laſt</hi> Obſervation: <hi>Let all Honeſt Arts be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by</hi> Maſters <hi>of</hi> Schools <hi>to provoke their</hi> Youth <hi>to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without much</hi> Fierceneſs <hi>or</hi> Beating: For that Sort of <hi>Education</hi> has nothing of the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Generous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> in it; which might be raiſed and improved in <hi>Youth</hi> by more <hi>Gentle</hi> and <hi>Reaſonable Methods.</hi> They that are taught to obey only for Baſe <hi>Fear,</hi> make that <hi>Fear</hi> and not <hi>Reaſon</hi> the Rule of their Obedience; and this grows in too many with their Age, that they turn meer <hi>Mercenaries</hi> and worſhip <hi>Violence. In ſhort,</hi> Make <hi>Inſtruction Eaſie, Correction Reaſonable: Convince</hi> them of their Miſcarriage with <hi>Mildneſs,</hi> then <hi>Pardon</hi> them; and <hi>finally</hi> excite them to <hi>Amendment</hi> by Smiles and Favour. This awakens the <hi>Noble Part</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites <hi>Youth</hi> to effect that, which may ingratiate them with their <hi>Tutors;</hi> who, if they at any time commit an <hi>Error,</hi> ſhould rather ſhew themſelves affectionately <hi>Sorry</hi> for them, than <hi>bitterly Angry. Plato</hi> being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with his Servant, and going about to Correct him, gave the <hi>Wand</hi> to one that ſtood by, ſaying: <hi>Do thou beat him; for I am Angry. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizement</hi> ſhould be uſed with Reaſon and <hi>Reluctancy:</hi> a <hi>Diſcreet</hi> and <hi>Cool</hi> Hand may direct the Blow right and hit the Mark; when Men of <hi>Fury</hi> rather eaſe their Paſſion, than mend their <hi>Youth:</hi> eſpecially, if the <hi>Correction</hi> exceed the <hi>Fault;</hi> for that hardens: This very <hi>Bruitiſhneſs</hi> is more <hi>Injurious</hi> to the Nature of our <hi>Youth,</hi> than uſually their <hi>Inſtruction</hi> is <hi>beneficial.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52323:27"/>
Upon the whole Matter I take the Boldneſs to ſay, That if we would <hi>Preſerve</hi> our <hi>Government,</hi> we muſt endear it to the People. To do this (beſides the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of preſent <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Wiſe things)</hi> we muſt <hi>Secure</hi> the <hi>Youth:</hi> and this is not to be done but by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the <hi>Way</hi> of their <hi>Education,</hi> and that with all Conceivable Speed and Diligence. I ſay, the <hi>Government</hi> is Highly oblig'd: it is a ſort of <hi>Truſtee</hi> for the <hi>Youth</hi> of the Kingdom, though now <hi>Minors,</hi> yet will have the <hi>Government,</hi> when we are gone. Therefore depreſs <hi>Vice</hi> and cheriſh <hi>Virtue,</hi> that through <hi>good Education</hi> they may become <hi>Good;</hi> which will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render them <hi>Happy</hi> in this World, and a Good Way fitted for that which is to come. If this be done, they will owe more to your <hi>Memories</hi> for their <hi>Education,</hi> than for their <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>THIRD</hi> and <hi>Laſt Reaſon</hi> for this <hi>Serious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> is ſo Great, that I find Difficulty to expreſs it: 'Tis the <hi>GLORY</hi> of that <hi>GOD,</hi> that <hi>Made</hi> us, that hath ſo often <hi>Deliver'd</hi> us, and doth ſo plentifully provide for us; who <hi>ſent his Son into the World</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> us, and waits every Day to be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Gracious</hi> to us.

            <p>
               <hi>Your</hi> Sins (ſaid God of Old) <hi>have with-held Good Things from you: 'tis</hi> Righteouſneſs <hi>that exalts a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but</hi> Sin <hi>is the Reproach of any people.</hi> Would ye <hi>Proſper?</hi> then pleaſe God; and if ye will <hi>pleaſe</hi> him, ye muſt put away the <hi>Wicked</hi> from amongſt you.

            <p>Suppoſe a Father dying makes his <hi>Laſt Will</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> and (as he thinks) ſo plain, that there can be no Miſtake made by the <hi>Executors,</hi> but what is wilful: if they inſtead of proving this <hi>Will</hi> and acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the plainneſs of it, turn <hi>Commentators,</hi> make more Difficulties than they find, and perplex the <hi>whole Matter</hi> to the Children and <hi>Legatees,</hi> and ſend them to the <hi>Law</hi> for their Right; will we not eſteem ſuch <hi>Executors Ill Men,</hi> and juſtifie thoſe Perſons concern'd in their <hi>Refuſal</hi> of the <hi>Paraphraſe?

they are excommunicated from all other ſhare in it, than the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the <hi>Breakers</hi> of it, which is part of their <hi>Anathema,</hi> who of all others are moſt guilty of <hi>Adding</hi> or <hi>Diminiſhing,</hi> by undertaking to determin (for others as well as themſelves) the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>But if it be true (as true it is) that few have writ of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that do not affirm, the very <hi>Penmen</hi> of it to be not only <hi>inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but ſo <hi>extraordinarily acted</hi> by him, as that they were wholely aſleep to their own <hi>Will, Deſires</hi> or <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> like people taken out of themſelves, and purely <hi>Paſſive</hi> (as <hi>Clay</hi> in the hand of the <hi>Potter)</hi> to the <hi>Revelation, Will</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and for this End, that nothing deliver'd by them might have the <hi>leaſt Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Miſtake, Error</hi> or <hi>Imperfection,</hi> but be a <hi>Compleat Teſtament</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to men; I cannot ſee which way ſuch Men can excuſe themſelves from <hi>Great Preſumption,</hi> that will notwithſtanding have the <hi>Wording</hi> of <hi>Creeds</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> and reject that <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>inſufficient</hi> which is deliver'd in the very <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and deny thoſe Perſons to be <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Church,</hi> that in Conſcience refuſe to ſubſcribe any other <hi>Draught,</hi> than their Lord has given them.</p>
            <p>Two things oppoſe themſelves to this Practice: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God</hi> &amp; the <hi>Honor</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> for it naturally draws people from the <hi>Regard Due</hi> to <hi>God</hi> &amp; the <hi>Scriptures</hi> &amp; begits too much <hi>Reſpect</hi> for <hi>Men</hi> &amp; their <hi>Traditions.</hi> This was the <hi>Difficulty</hi> Chriſt met with and complained of in his time; they had ſet up ſo many <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> to learn them <hi>Religion,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>True

And what did they do? <hi>They taught for Doctrines the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men:</hi> They gave their own and their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors <hi>Apprehenſions, Conſtructions</hi> and <hi>Paraphraſes</hi> upon Scripture for the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Peoples <hi>Faith.</hi> They were got near at this paſs in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when they cryed out, <hi>I am for</hi> Paul, <hi>I am for</hi> Apollo, and <hi>I am for</hi> Cephas, though they had not the ſame Temptation.</p>
            <p>And that which followed then, ever will follow in the like Caſe, and that is DISTRACTION; which is the Contrary to that <hi>Second</hi> thing, that oppoſeth it ſelf to this <hi>Practice,</hi> and that is the <hi>Concord</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For <hi>Peace's</hi> ſake conſider it, <hi>Lo here</hi> and <hi>Lo there</hi> always follow'd; one of this mind, and another of that: <hi>As many Sects as Great Men to make and Head them.</hi> This was the Caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and yet I do not hear, that they devour'd one another about their <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon Scripture: but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have done both, <hi>Divided</hi> and <hi>Perſecuted</hi> too. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they have <hi>Divided,</hi> and that moſtly upon the ſcore of <hi>Opinions</hi> about <hi>Religion:</hi> they have not been Contented with the Expreſſions of the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> they liked their own better. And when they were ſet up in the <hi>Room</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISSION was required upon <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Worldly Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> This diſſatisfied <hi>Curioſity,</hi> this <hi>Unwarrantable</hi> (what ſhall I ſay?) this <hi>Wanton Search</hi> has coſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> dear, and poor <hi>England</hi> of any part of it.</p>
            <p>I deſign not to grate upon any to revive old <hi>Stories</hi> or ſearch old Wounds or give the leaſt Juſt Occaſion of <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> to thoſe that are in <hi>Preſent Power:</hi> yet I

            <p>I will conclude this with that Famous Inſtance of the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> who neither knew <note place="margin">Luke 23. 42, 43.</note> nor had time to make a <hi>Large Confeſſion,</hi> like the <hi>Creeds</hi> of theſe dayes: but it ſeems he ſaid enough; Lord, <hi>remember me, when thou comeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Kingdom.</hi> And <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto him; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> By which it is eaſie to learn, that 'twas the <hi>Heart</hi> not the Mouth, the <hi>Sincerity</hi> not the Words, that made the <hi>Confeſſion Valid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this only in the <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Effect of his <hi>Gracious Diſpenſation</hi> or peculiar Indulgence, <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> afford us the like Inſtances. This was the main Bent of <hi>Peter's Sermon:</hi> and when the <hi>Three thouſand believed, that he, whom the</hi> Jews <hi>had crucified, was both</hi> Lord <hi>and</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and repented of their Sins, and gladly received his Word,</hi> they are ſaid to have <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37,—47. Acts 10. 24,—48. Acts 8. 27,—37.</note> been in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Thus <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and his Houſhold and Kindred, ſo ſoon as <hi>Peter</hi> declared <hi>Jeſus to be the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and that they had believed, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt fell upon them;</hi> and they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the <hi>Chriſtian Communion.</hi> But the Story of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> is very pat to our purpoſe: As he rid in his Charriot, he was reading theſe words out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> viz. <hi>That he was led as a Sheep to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and like a Lamb dumb before the Shearers, ſo opened he not his Mouth. In his Humiliation his Judgment was taken away: and who ſhall declare his Generation? for his Life is taken from the Earth. Philip</hi> joyn'd to him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52323:45"/>
and askt him, <hi>If he underſtood what he read?</hi> he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Philip</hi> to interpret the mind of the Prophet, if he ſpoke of him ſelf or another? <hi>Philip</hi> upon the place preached to him <hi>Jeſus:</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Apoſtle, that coming to a Water, he ſaid, <hi>What doth hinder me to be Baptized? Philip</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him; <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou may'ſt:</hi> To this the <hi>Eunuch</hi> replyed; <hi>I believe, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſt is the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God. Upon which he was <hi>Baptized:</hi> and 'tis ſaid, <hi>He went away rejoycing:</hi> which indeed he might well do, that felt the Comfort of his <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Joys</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude theſe Examples with a Paſſage in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> 'tis this: Paul, <hi>as his manner was, went in unto them,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Three Sabbath-dayes <hi>reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alledging, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>muſt needs have</hi> ſuffered, <hi>and</hi> riſen <hi>again from the</hi> dead: <hi>and that this</hi> Jeſus (ſaid he) <hi>whom I preach unto you, is</hi> Chriſt. <hi>And ſome of them believed and conſorted with</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas: <hi>and of the devout</hi> Greeks <hi>a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and of the</hi> Chief Women <hi>not a few.</hi> Thus we may plainly ſee, that they were <hi>Baptiz'd</hi> into the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and not into <hi>Numerous Opinions;</hi> and that this one <hi>Confeſſion</hi> from true <hi>Faith</hi> in the heart was the ground &amp; Principle of their <hi>Church-fellowſhip:</hi> then <hi>God's Church</hi> was at Peace; ſhe thrive: there were then no <hi>Snares</hi> of <hi>Words</hi> made to catch Men of Conſcience in. Then not many <hi>Words,</hi> but much <hi>Integrity;</hi> now <hi>much Talk,</hi> and <hi>little Truth: Many Articles,</hi> but <hi>O ye of little Faith!</hi>

Nor was this only the Judgment and Practice of that Time out of <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> to <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to <hi>Ignorance;</hi> for both Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf and his Apoſtles (thoſe bleſſed <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of holy <hi>Truth)</hi> have doctrinally laid it down, as the <hi>great Teſt</hi> to <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that which ſhould diſtinguiſh them from <hi>Infidels,</hi> and juſtly entitle them to his <hi>Diſcipleſhip</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Communion</hi> one with another. <hi>Then ſaid they to</hi> Jeſus, <hi>what ſhall we do, that we might work the</hi> Works <hi>of</hi> God?

               <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirms this in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he ſays: <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the</hi> Lord Jeſus, <hi>and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.

Secondly, <hi>That thoſe that ſincerely believe, ſhall through him obtain Eternal Life.</hi> Certainly then, if this be true, great muſt their <hi>Incharity</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> be, who have taken other meaſures, and ſet another <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> than <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Apoſtles gave. This <hi>ſincere Confeſſion</hi> contented Chriſt and his Apoſtles;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52323:46"/>
but it will not ſatisfy thoſe, that yet pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them: 'twas enough then for a <hi>Miracle</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> too, but it goes for little or nothing now. A man may ſincerely believe this, and be ſtigmatiz'd for a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> an <hi>Heretick,</hi> an <hi>Excommunicate:</hi> but I may ſay (as Chriſt did to the <hi>Jews</hi> in another Caſe) <hi>From the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I expect here to be Aſſaulted with this <hi>Objection; If this be all, that is neceſſary to be believed to</hi> Salvation, <hi>of what uſe is the reſt of</hi> Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Of <hi>great Uſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle himſelf teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us; <hi>All</hi> Scripture <hi>is given by Inſpiration</hi>

For though it be all <hi>equally True,</hi> it is not all <hi>equally Important:</hi> There is a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> of a thing. For Example: 'Tis as <hi>True,</hi> that Chriſt ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> as that he ſuffered; and that he was pierced, as that he died; and that he did eat after his Reſurrection, as that he riſe from the Dead at all; but no Perſon of common Underſtanding will conclude an <hi>Equal Weight</hi> or Concernment in theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Equally True:</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt was of much greater Value than the Manner of it; his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> than any Circumſtance of his Appearance,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52323:47"/>
after he was riſen. The Queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the <hi>Truths</hi> contain'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> are not to be believed; but Whether thoſe <hi>Truths</hi> are <hi>Equally Important?</hi> and if the <hi>Belief with the heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with the mouth, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the</hi> Chriſt <hi>and</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>be not as ſufficient now to entitle a man to Communion here and Salvation hereafter, as in thoſe times?</hi> againſt which nothing can be of Weight ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that this <hi>Contradicts the Judgment and Practice of many great and good Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer;</hi> I can't help that.

            <p>Laſtly if it be alledg'd, <hi>That this will take in all</hi> Parties, <hi>yea, that</hi> Schiſmaticks <hi>and</hi> Hereticks <hi>will creep in under this General Confeſſion, ſince few of them will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to make it.</hi>

            <p>But to ſhow you, that neither true <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> (who is <hi>One, that unneceſſarily and unwarrantably ſeparates from that part of the</hi> Viſible Church, <hi>of which he was once a Member)</hi> nor true <hi>Heretick</hi> (who is a <hi>Wilful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of True or an Introducer of falſe Doctrines; a Self-condemned Perſon)</hi> can ever ſhelter himſelf under this <hi>Common Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſincerely made, Let us conſider, that who-ever ſo declares <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and <hi>Anointed Saviour</hi> of God to Men, muſt be ſuppoſed to believe all that of him, with reſpect to which he is ſo called. Now that for which he is ſo denominated, is that which God ſent him to do: the Reaſon and End of his coming he could beſt tell, who hath told us thus; <hi>I am come, that ye may have Life, and that ye may have it more abundantly.</hi> The World was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52323:49"/>
as dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, the guilt and defilement of Tranſgreſſion had kill'd the Soul as to <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> and from under this powerful Death he came to redeem the Soul unto <hi>Life:</hi> in ſhort, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Man from this Fearful Degeneracy, his Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God had reduced him to.</p>
            <p>The Way he took to accompliſh this Bleſſed Work was <hi>Firſt,</hi> To preach <hi>Repentance</hi> and the Approach of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is his <hi>Rule</hi> and his Authority in the Hearts of men, which brings us to the <hi>Second thing</hi> to be believed, namely—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What he Taught?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, his Doctrine led Men to <hi>Repentance: Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi> No Man could receive the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 3. 20, 21.</note> whilſt he lived under the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>Satan:</hi> ſo that to <hi>Repent</hi> is not only to <hi>bring</hi> their <hi>Deeds to the Light</hi> (which Chriſt exhorteth Men to;) but to <hi>forſake</hi> that, which upon Examination appeared to be <hi>Evil.</hi> Wherefore I conclude, that ſuch as have not been acquainted with this <hi>Holy Repentance,</hi> do not ſincerely <hi>believe,</hi> neither can Rightly <hi>confeſs Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the Saviour of the World. Therefore ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Let him that nameth the</hi> Name <hi>of the</hi> Lord, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Iniquity:</hi> plainly implying, that thoſe do rather <hi>Prophane</hi> than Confeſs the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who do not <hi>Depart from</hi> their <hi>Iniquities.</hi> And (ſaith the Apoſtle in another place) <hi>No man can call</hi> Jeſus LORD, <hi>but by the</hi> Holy Ghoſt: Which opens to us the Nature of the <hi>True Confeſſion,</hi> to wit, <hi>That the</hi> True
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52323:50"/>
Confeſſion <hi>of</hi> Jeſus <hi>to be both</hi> Lord <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>is from ſuch a Belief in the Heart, as is the work of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt; <hi>and thoſe that do</hi> not <hi>Confeſs</hi> him or call upon him by Virtue of the Overſhadowings of this <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> are not truly Chriſtians, true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, Believers and Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they that receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> receive his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in their Souls; the <hi>ſtrong Man</hi> that kept the houſe, becomes <hi>boun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> God <hi>is within you,</hi> ſaith the King himſelf; and where ſhould the <hi>King</hi> be, but in his own <hi>Kingdom?</hi> they are bleſſed, that feel him to <hi>Rule</hi> and that live under the ſwaying of his <hi>Righteous Scepter:</hi> for when this <hi>Righteous One Rules the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>

For can a Man be ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> in one, that he will not receive? but <hi>To as many as received</hi> Chriſt of Old, <hi>gave he Power to become the</hi> Sons <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>which were born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the</hi>

            <p>But becauſe it may be expected, that I ſhould fix upon ſome few General Heads of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> from the Mouth of Chriſt and his Apoſtles as requiſite to <hi>Chriſtian Communion;</hi> I ſhall proceed to mention, what Chriſt eminently taught. He that reads his Sermon upon the Mount, will find in the Entrance, how many States and Conditions Chriſt <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> The <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> The <hi>Mourners,</hi> The <hi>Meek,</hi> They that <hi>hunger after Righteouſneſs,</hi> The <hi>Merciful,</hi> The <hi>Pure in Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Peace-makers;</hi> which indeed Comprehend the whole of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. By <hi>Mourners</hi> we underſtand true Penitents, Men of <hi>Unfeigned Repentance;</hi> which leads them not only to Confeſs but Forſake their Sins. This <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52323:51"/>
makes Men <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> Empty of themſelves, wanting the <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſuſtain them; in which as they ſted faſtly walk, the <hi>Attonement</hi> of the Blood is felt, and it clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them from all Unrighteouſneſs: which makes them <hi>Pure</hi> in <hi>Heart.</hi> And in this Condition no Food will ſerve their Turn but <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> after this they <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt</hi> more than for the Bread that periſheth. They are full of <hi>Meekneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Mercy, Making Peace</hi> and Promoting Concord, where-ever they come: For being themſelves reconciled to God, they endeavour to reconcile all Men unto God and one unto another.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, let us bring it home to our Conſciences and deal faithfully with our ſelves. Do we know this Holy <hi>Mourning?</hi> this <hi>Godly Sorrow?</hi> are we <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit?</hi> not Self-conceited, but <hi>Humble, Meek</hi> and <hi>Lowly</hi> in Heart, like him that bid us be ſo? Do we <hi>Hunger</hi> after the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of it? and are our <hi>Hearts purified</hi> by the Precious Faith of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God? Infine,</hi> Are we <hi>Merciful? Tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Lovers of <hi>Peace</hi> more than lovers of our ſelves? <hi>Perſecuted</hi> rather than Perſecutors? ſuch as receive <hi>Stripes</hi> for Chriſt's ſake, and not thoſe that beat our Fellow-Servants? No Man has true <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is not acquainted with theſe Bleſſed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications: This is Chriſt's Doctrine; and to <hi>believe</hi> in him is to <hi>obey</hi> it and be like him.</p>
            <p>The great Intendment of this Sermon is to preſs people to a <hi>more Excellent Righteouſneſs</hi> than that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees. For</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude)

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He taught, not only that <hi>Killing</hi> but <hi>Anger</hi> without a very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſt Cauſe <note place="margin">Verſ. 21, 22.</note> is Unlawful to his Diſciples.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) he prefers <hi>Concord</hi> above De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>Mercy</hi> before Sacrifice; He that <note place="margin">Verſ. 23, 24, 25.</note> will not uſe his Utmoſt Endeavour to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to his <hi>Brother,</hi> ſhall find no place for his Prayers: And <hi>Every Man</hi> is this <hi>Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He not only forbids <hi>Adultery,</hi> which the Law forbids; but <hi>Luſt:</hi> the <note place="margin">Verſ. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>Ax</hi> of his Doctrine is <hi>laid to the Root of the Tree;</hi> it reaches to the <hi>Firſt Seeds</hi> of things, to the Innermoſt and moſt hidden Conceptions of the Mind.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.)

            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) He taught <hi>Not</hi> to <hi>reſiſt Evil,</hi> but to ſuffer Loſs rather than enter into Contention: his Divine Wiſdom did fore-ſee, how much <note place="margin">Verſ. 39, 40.</note> eaſier it would be, to <hi>Overcome</hi> the <hi>Violent Paſſions</hi> of Men by <hi>Patience</hi> than <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</hi> And he that conſiders the Unrulineſs of ſome Mens Diſpoſitions, their Heats and Prejudices, it will be found, that it is not alwayes a Real Injury or

            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) He taught us the Higheſt Compleſance and <hi>Charity: If any Man compel thee to go a Mile, go with him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">(7.)

            <p n="8">(8.) He advances the Doctrine of Loving Friends to the Degree of <hi>Loving Enemies. Ye have heard</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jeſus) that it hath been ſaid,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 43, 44, 45.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour and ſhalt hate thine Enemy; but I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies, bleſs them that Curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi> Surely then, where no Anger dwells, no Revenge can grow; and if we muſt <hi>love Enemies,</hi> there is no Man left to be hated. This is the Doctrine of that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that laid down his Life for all: and this is the End for which he preached it, <hi>That</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ye may be the Children of your Father, which is in Heaven; for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil and on the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the</hi> Juſt <hi>and on the</hi> Unjuſt, It is as much as if Chriſt had ſaid; No Man can be like God, that does not <hi>Love</hi> his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and who cannot <hi>do good to all:</hi> Conſequently, he that does <hi>Love
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52323:52"/>
Enemies,</hi> and is ready to <hi>Do good unto all,</hi> he is like God the <hi>Father,</hi> that is in Heaven, who is <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">(9.) Chriſt teaches us to avoid <hi>Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1.</note> in our Charity: <hi>Take heed that ye do not your Alms before Men to be ſeen of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">(10.) He teaches us the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> where and what: not in the <hi>Corners</hi> of the <hi>Streets</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 5, 6.</note> nor in the <hi>Synagogues to be ſeen of Men;</hi> but in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> in the ſecret of the Heart betwixt God and the Soul.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) He forbids Hoarding and Laying up of <hi>Money</hi> in <hi>Bank;</hi> preſſes Treaſuring up of <hi>Wealth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 19, 20.</note> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> and the Reaſon is this, that the one is <hi>Corruptible,</hi> and the other is <hi>Incorruptible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">(12.) He teaches Dependence upon the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> calling the Diſ-truſtful, <hi>O ye of little Faith. Which of you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by taking Thought can add one Cubit to his Stature? therefore</hi>

               <hi>take no Thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat or what ſhall we drink, or wherewith ſhall we be clothed? for after all theſe things the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſeek; for your Heavenly Father knoweth, that you have need of all theſe things. But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">(13.) He ſets up a Diſcrimination or Diſtinction between <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>true Prophets,</hi> thoſe that are his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, from <hi>Counterfeits.

            <p n="14">(14.) <hi>Laſtly</hi> Chriſt preaches the <hi>General Judgment. Many will ſay to me in that Day</hi> [what <hi>Day?</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Account</hi> and <hi>Final Reckoning</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 21. to the end.</note> with Mankind:] Lord, Lord, <hi>have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and done many wonderful works? And then</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, ye that work Iniquity. Not every one that ſaith,</hi> Lord, Lord, <hi>ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but he that doth the Will of my Father, which is in Heaven. Therefore whoſoever heareth theſe Sayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him unto a Wiſe Man, which built his Houſe upon a Rock, and the Rain deſcended and the Floods came, and the Winds blew and beat upon that Houſe, and it fell not; for it was builded upon a Rock. And every one that beareth theſe Sayings of Mine, and doth them not, ſhall be likened unto a Fooliſh Man, which built his Houſe upon the Sand: and the Rain deſcended, and the Floods came and the Winds blew, and beat upon that Houſe, and it fell, and great was the Fall of it, And it came to paſs, when</hi> Jeſus <hi>had ended theſe Sayings, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52323:53"/>
People were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine: for he taught them as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it is moſt plain, that as Chriſt is the <hi>Rock,</hi> on which true <hi>Chriſtians build;</hi> ſo none can be ſaid truly to <hi>build</hi> upon this <hi>Rock,</hi> but thoſe that <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>Sayings,</hi> that do his Commandments, that obey his Doctrine. Wherefore that <hi>Faith</hi> of JESUS to be the SON and CHRIST of GOD muſt be ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>does the Will of the Heavenly Father,</hi> and <hi>keepeth</hi> THESE SAYINGS of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two places,</hi> in which Chriſt ſeems to ſum up his bleſſed Doctrine: One is this, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, whatſoever ye would, that Men</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> Which Chriſt came not to deſtroy, but to <hi>fulfill.</hi> But the other Paſſage ſeems to be more full, the <hi>firſt</hi> relating only to our <hi>Dealings</hi> with <hi>Men;</hi> this <hi>Second Paſſage</hi> comprehends our <hi>Duty</hi> both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 37, 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>thy Heart and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind; this is the firſt and great Commandment: and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. In theſe two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, the <hi>Great Commandment</hi> of Chriſt, the Certain Token of Diſcipleſhip. <hi>A new Commandment</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>I give unto you, that ye</hi> Love one <note place="margin">John 13. 34, 35.</note> another; <hi>as I have loved you, that ye alſo</hi> love one another: <hi>by this ſhall all men know, that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have</hi> love one <hi>to</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:52323:54"/>
another. Again, Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples; <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my</hi> Love, <hi>even as I have kept my Father's Commandments, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in his</hi> Love: <hi>and this is my Commandment, that ye</hi> Love one another, <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> Yet once more: <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye</hi>

               <hi>do, whatſoever I command you; and theſe things I command you, that you</hi> Love one another. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifeſt my ſelf to him: but he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 14. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that loveth me not, keepeth not my Sayings.</hi> So that only thoſe are Friends, and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> that do his Sayings and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and the <hi>Great Commandment</hi> of all is LOVE: for upon this One Commandment all the reſt depend.</p>
            <p>For he that <hi>loves God above all,</hi> will leave all for God; not one of his Commandments ſhall be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and he that <hi>loves</hi> his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> will much more <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Houſhold</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Well may ſuch be <hi>True Chriſtians,</hi> when their <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt works by LOVE, by the Power of this <hi>Divine Love:</hi> he that dwells in this <hi>Love,</hi> dwell in <hi>God,</hi>

one another, <hi>as I have loved you:</hi> and, <hi>Greater love hath no Man than this, that a Man lays down his Life for his Friends; ye are my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> Indeed he gave his Life for the World, and offered up <hi>One Common Sacrifice</hi> for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> and by this <hi>One Offering up of himſelf once for all he hath forever perfected</hi> [that is, quitted and diſcharged and taken into Favour] <hi>them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> who have received the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> in their Hearts: for ſuch as reſiſt it, receive not the Benefit of that <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Holy <hi>Offering up of himſelf</hi> by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> is a Great Part of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip;</hi> for therein he hath both confirmed his Bleſſed Meſſage of <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Life Everlaſting</hi> to as many as truly believe in his Name, and given himſelf a <hi>Propitiation for all that have ſinned,</hi> and ſo <hi>came ſhort of the Glory of God:</hi> in ſo much that God is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>Juſt,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtifier of him, which believeth in</hi> Jeſus, <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So that (to be Brief) the <hi>Chriſtian Creed</hi> ſo far as it is Declaratory, lies eminently in a Confeſſion of theſe Particulars. Of the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old Teſtament Writings;</hi> and therein of theſe Great, General and Neceſſary Truths expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to wit, Of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Miracles, Doctrine, Death, Reſurrection, Advocacy</hi> or <hi>Mediation,</hi> the Gift of his <hi>Grace, Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> unto <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of <hi>Sins,</hi> the Neceſſity of <hi>Keeping</hi> his <hi>Commandments,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Eternal Recompence.</hi>—Leſs once than all this would have done; and it does not ſhew the <hi>Age</hi> more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but more Curious, indeed more <hi>Infidel,</hi> that there is this Stir made about <hi>External Creeds</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> for <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> of Brethren and <hi>Incredulity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians is no ſmall Sign of their Decay of Faith towards God; <hi>From the Beginning 'twas not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be here Objected, <hi>How ſhall we know, that ſuch a</hi> Declaration <hi>of</hi> Faith <hi>is ſincere?</hi> I Anſwer, By recurring to that Evidence, which God ſhall give us.

               <hi>without Ceaſing your</hi> Work <hi>of</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>'Twas this true <hi>Faith,</hi> that brings forth <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> by which <hi>Abel Offered</hi> to God, <hi>Enoch</hi> was <hi>Tranſlated, Noah</hi> was <hi>ſaved:</hi> it is ſaid of him, that he became <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is by <hi>Faith.</hi> By this <hi>Faith Abraham</hi> left his own Country, and obey'd the Voice of God. By <hi>Faith Moſes</hi> was preſerved from his Childhood; and when he came to years, refus'd to be called the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> he forſook <hi>Egypt,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down, and <hi>Rahah</hi> was ſaved. By <hi>Faith Gideon, Barak, Sampſon, Jephtha, David, Samuel</hi> and the Prophets ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſneſs, obtained Promiſes, <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> ſtopped the Mouthes of <hi>Lyons,</hi> quenched the Violence of <hi>Fire,</hi> eſcaped the Edge of the <hi>Sword;</hi> with much more too large to be utter'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52323:56"/>
This is that <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies againſt all falſe <hi>Faiths: Faith</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if it has not</hi> Works, <hi>is dead. A Man may ſay, Thou haſt</hi> Faith, <hi>and I have</hi> Works; <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>ſhew me thy</hi> Faith <hi>without thy</hi> Works, <hi>&amp; I will ſhew thee my</hi> Faith <hi>by my</hi> Works. And as if he had fore-ſeen the Men of <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> he ſpeaks on this wiſe: <hi>Thou believeſt that there is One God, thou doſt well; the</hi> Devils <hi>alſo believe and Tremble. But wilt thou know, O Vain Man, that</hi> Faith <hi>without</hi> Works <hi>is dead. Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father juſtified by</hi> Works, <hi>when he had offered</hi> Iſaac <hi>his Son up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar? ſeeſt thou how</hi> Faith <hi>wrought with his</hi> Works? <hi>and by</hi> Works <hi>was</hi> Faith <hi>made perfect.</hi>—And he was called the <hi>Friend</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Exhortation of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is a plain Diſcrimination of true <hi>Faith; And beſides this, giving all Diligence, add to your</hi> Faith <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Virtue, and to Virtue Knowledge, and to Knowledge Temperance, and to Temperance Patience, and to Patience Godlineſs, and to Godlineſs Brotherly Kindneſs, and to Brotherly Kindneſs Charity. For if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you, that ye ſhall neither he barren nor unfruitful in the Knowledge of our Lord</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſt. But he that lacketh theſe things, is blind, and cannot ſee far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will ſeal up theſe Scripture. Teſtimonies of <hi>Faith</hi> with that <hi>Account</hi> which is given us by the Apoſtle <hi>John; For whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World: and this is the Victory, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the World, even our</hi> Faith. <hi>Who is he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52323:56"/>
that overcometh the World, but he that believed, that</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>is the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God? So that the <hi>Belief</hi> in the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt have this Evidence to prove it true, that by it Men are <hi>born of God</hi> and <hi>overcome the World:</hi> ſo that their <hi>Faith</hi> is falſe, whom the <hi>World Overcomes. I am not of this World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>Jeſus;</hi> neither can that <hi>Faith</hi> be, that is called the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Three Paſſages</hi> left us upon Record by this Beloved Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of Great Weight and Importance to us; when he had diſcourſed of the <hi>Propitiation</hi> and <hi>Advocacy</hi> of Chriſt, he does immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately add; <hi>And hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 2. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him. But whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of God perfected: hereby know we, that we are in him.

            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Paſſage very pertinent to this preſent matter is in the next Chapter; <hi>My little</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Paſſage, which I ſhall mention on this Account is in his fourth Chapter of the ſame <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> viz. <hi>And we have ſeen and do teſtifie, that the</hi> Father <hi>ſent the</hi> Son <hi>to be the Saviour of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>the World. Whoſoever ſhall confeſs, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>God dwelleth in him and he in God. And we have known and believed the</hi> Love, <hi>that God hath to us: God is</hi> Love; <hi>and he that dwelleth in</hi> Love <hi>dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein our</hi> love <hi>is made perfect, that we may have Boldneſs in the Day of Judgment, becauſe</hi> AS HE IS, SO ARE WE IN THIS WORLD.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Holy Fruits</hi> of all that <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> that are the Family of the Faithful, regenerated and redeemed from the Earth; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever two or three of them are met together, Chriſt is in the midſt of them; they neither Ask nor Hope in vain. With this Character let us take a View of all <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Societies</hi> of Chriſtians throughout the World, not forgetting our ſelves: let us hereby <hi>try</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> and our own; if it be of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> it is <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Undefiled,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note> it leads them that have it, to <hi>Viſit the Fatherleſs and Widow</hi> in their Affliction, and to keep themſelves Unſpotted from the World: Is this our Caſe?</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, <hi>Which way ſhall we obtain this like Precious</hi> Faith? I anſwer: They muſt take diligent Heed to the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> that comes by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>Candle</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which he has ſet up
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52323:58"/>
in our Souls: we muſt bring our Deeds to this <hi>Light,</hi> ſee, if they be wrought in God or no? For this gives us to diſcern betwixt the Precious and the Vile; the one gives Joy, the other brings a load of Guilt upon the Soul: do we not <hi>know,</hi> that we <hi>Do the things we ought not?</hi> and that we <hi>Leave undone the thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s we ought to do?</hi> this will be our Judgment: For therefore Men are Condemnable, becauſe they <hi>knon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe therefore, that would <hi>obtain this precious Faith,</hi> that overcomes the World, muſt embrace the <hi>Grace</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, by which this <hi>Faith</hi> is begotten: and they, who believe not in this <hi>Grace,</hi> nor receive it in the love of it, nor give themſelves up to be taught and led by it, can never be ſaid truly to believe in him, from whom it comes, any more then the <hi>Jews</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>believe in God,</hi> when they rejected him that came from God, his <hi>Beloved Son.</hi> He that denyes the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> can never own or receive the <hi>Fulneſs. John</hi> bears Record, <note place="margin">John 1. 14, 16, 17.</note> that he was <hi>Full of Grace and Truth, and that of his</hi> Fulneſs <hi>they received, and Grace for Grace: for the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So that 'tis utterly Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man to <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> and not to be taught by the <hi>Grace</hi> that comes from him and by him.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Common ſaying of People in theſe dayes, <hi>We are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> who are in Truth under <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> Subjects to the Prince of the Power of the Air, who reigns in the hearts of the Children of Diſobedience; and their Lives ſhow it: No; thoſe are under <hi>Grace,</hi> that live the holy Life of it. <hi>For the Grace of</hi> God, <hi>that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 2. ii. 12.) <hi>hath Appeared to

All Men, teaching us, that denying Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent World:</hi> Theſe are the People that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in Chriſt unto the ſaving of the Soul. This is that Bleſſed <hi>Light,</hi> which ſhines in the hearts of thoſe that believe, and <hi>gives them the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the Ancients walk'd in it, and found Eternal Life by it. <hi>I am the</hi> Light <hi>of the</hi> World, ſaid Chriſt, <hi>he that</hi>

               <hi>follows me, ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but have the</hi> Light <hi>of</hi> Life.

And this will be the Condemnation of <hi>Diſobedient Men,</hi> that they ſee, but ſhut their Eyes; know the <hi>Light,</hi> but rebel againſt it. Chriſt by his holy <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> ſhews Men their Danger, warns them of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes upon them: no Man on Earth can plead either <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Surpriſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Candle of the Wicked is often put out;</hi> But that it implies, 'tis often <hi>lighted,</hi> and that men Sin againſt Conviction, againſt Sight and Knowledge: 'tis wilfull, and that's dangerous.

            <p>And I do fervently beſeech Almighty God, the Giver of all <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> mercifully to Vouchſafe more and more to beget a <hi>Serious Enquiry</hi> in us, What that <hi>Eaith</hi> is, which we have? who is the Author of it? and what Fruits it hath brought forth? that we may not prophane the Name of God by a <hi>Vain Profeſſion</hi> of it, nor abuſe our ſelves unto <hi>Eternal Perdition;</hi> But that we may endeavour (by God's Aſſiſtance) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves ſuch Believers, as ſincerely fear God, love Righteouſneſs and hate every Eyil Way, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Redeemed of God by the pretious Blood of his Son. Since therefore we are not our own, but the <hi>Lord's,</hi> who hath bought us with that Great Price, let us glorifie him in our <hi>Bodies,</hi> in our <hi>Souls</hi> and in our <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are his. Then ſhall we be Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed, Heirs of the Promiſes, partakers of that Reſurrection and Life, that Immortality and Glory, which God the Righteous Judge will one Day plentifully diſtribute to them that abide in this pretious <hi>Faith</hi> unto the End.</p>

            <p>By MORALITY I underſtand Vertuous Living, Purity of Manners, that Juſtice, Temperance, Truth, Charity and Blameleſneſs in Converſation, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52323:60"/>
may well Denominate the Man that lives that Life, a MAN JUST; in ſhort, one <hi>that does unto all men, as he would have all Men do unto him,</hi> this is the <hi>Moral Man.</hi> It is Notorious, how ſmall an Eſtimate <hi>Two ſorts</hi> of people have put upon him, the <hi>Prophane</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> (the <hi>Publican</hi> and the <hi>Phariſee:)</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him as too <hi>Squeamiſh, Nice</hi> and <hi>Formal,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride his Regularity and make a Jeſt of his Preciſeneſs.

If they hear any one ſay, <hi>Such a Man is a Sober and Juſt Perſon,</hi> They have learned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to call him <hi>Knave;</hi> that he has a <hi>Deſign</hi> upon ſome body by being <hi>Juſt</hi> in little things, to Cheat in things of more Moment. This Man is very Unfaſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable among Men of <hi>Immoral Principles,</hi> for his very Looks and Life carry a Reproof with them upon <hi>Vitious Men,</hi> who, as if Virtue were their <hi>Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> are in Combination againſt the Lovers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainers of her.

            <p>But the Reproaches that Men of <hi>Morality</hi> receive at the Hands of Lewd Men, are more their Honour than their Suffering.

            <p>For it ſeems a moſt-unreaſonable thing, that <hi>Faith in God</hi> and keeping his Commandments ſhould be no Part of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> but if a <hi>Part</hi> it be (as

            <p>Let us but ſoberly conſider, <hi>What Chriſt is?</hi> and we ſhall the better know, whether <hi>Moral Men</hi> are to be reckoned Chriſtians? What is Chriſt but <hi>Meekneſs, Juſtice, Mercy, Patience, Charity</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? can we then deny a <hi>Meek Man</hi> to be a Chriſtian? a <hi>Juſt,</hi> a <hi>Merciful,</hi> a <hi>Patient,</hi> a <hi>Charitable</hi> and a <hi>Virtuous</hi> Man to be like Chriſt? <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> ſaith Wiſdom, yea, the <hi>Wiſdom that is from above</hi> (ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15.) ſo may I ſay here; By Chriſt men are <hi>Meek, Juſt, Merciful, Patient, Charitable</hi> and <hi>Virtuous.</hi> And <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their <hi>likeneſs</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and not their <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his Holy Qualifications, rather than their own Lofty Profeſſions and Invented Formalities. What ſhall we ſay then of that Extravagancy, which thoſe Men are guilty of, who upon hearing a <hi>ſober Man</hi> commended, that is not of any great Viſible <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> will take upon them to caſt him off with this Sentence; <hi>Tuſh! he is but a</hi> Moral Man: <hi>he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of</hi> ſaving Grace; <hi>be may be damn'd for all his</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.

            <p>Chriſt has determin'd this Point beyond all Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Diſcourſe with the <hi>Jews (John 8. 31, 32, 33, 34.)

In which place it is very remarkable that Men are only to be diſtinguiſh'd by their Works, that no Claims, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Succeſſions or Diſſents are available; but <hi>He that commits Sin, is the Servant of Sin.</hi> So that Chriſt's <hi>Free Man</hi> is he that is <hi>Freed from Sin;</hi> this is his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower and Diſciple.

muſt we oppoſe the <hi>Actions</hi> of Ill Men to their better <hi>Profeſſions:</hi> we muſt faithfully tell them; <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Sin, is the Servant of Sin.</hi> From which <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> Chriſt came to <hi>Save</hi> his people, and is therefore called The <hi>SAVIOUR</hi> and the <hi>REDEEMER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine is cloſely followed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>ſixth Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans. Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the Dead by the</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Let not</hi> Sin <hi>therefore reign in your mortal Body, that ye ſhould obey it in the Luſts thereof. Neither yield ye your Members as Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs unto</hi> Sin; <hi>but yield your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are Alive from the Dead, and your Members</hi>

            <p>To Conclude, nothing can be more apparent, then that <hi>Freedom from Actual Sinning,</hi> and giving <hi>Newneſs</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to the Souls of Men, was the great Reaſon of <hi>Chriſts Coming,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> for which he hath given us out of his fulneſs of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace,</hi> and that to be under <hi>Grace</hi> and not under the <hi>Law,</hi> is not to have Liberty to do that now, which ought not to have been done before (as the <hi>Ranters</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it;) but to be Freed from the <hi>Condemnation</hi> of the Law, Firſt through <hi>Remiſſion of the Sins that are paſt</hi> upon Faith and Repentance, and next, by <hi>Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> in receiving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> that comes by <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Very pertinent is that Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (to <hi>Titus)</hi> to our preſent purpoſe, for it ſeems to comprehend the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Coming,</hi> the Faith and Duty of his people; which our Great <hi>Selden</hi> after all his Painful Readings and Curious Inquiſitions ſaid but a little before his Death, was the <hi>Moſt-Weighty Paſſage of the whole Bible to him, as the Bible was the beſt of Books in the World,</hi> viz: <hi>For the</hi> Grace <hi>of</hi>

            <p>I Conſcientiouſly refuſe to name <hi>Parties,</hi> becauſe I am tender of giving the leaſt Offence; but upon a Juſt Obſervance of thoſe Revolutions of Proteſtancy, that have been amongſt us, we may ſee, with what Stiffneſs (not to ſay <hi>Obſtinacy)</hi> ſeveral <hi>Models</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Draughts of <hi>Creeds</hi> have been contended for. I would beſeech every <hi>Party</hi> in Chriſt's Name to look into it ſelf, for I don't, becauſe ſuch are beſt able (if they will be Impartial and put no Cheat upon themſelves) to make the Application. However I will name thoſe Points, about which the Authority of Man as it ſeems to me has been ſo Poſitive of <hi>God,</hi> as to his Preſcience and Predetermination; Of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to his Natures and Perſonality, and the Extent of his Death and Interceſſion; Of <hi>Free Will</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> Of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works;</hi> Of <hi>Perſeverance</hi> and <hi>Falling away;</hi> Of the Nature of <hi>the Church;</hi> And Laſtly, of the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if men pleaſe but to lay their Hands upon their Hearts, and caſt their Eyes upon the Scriptures, if they will but uſe the <hi>Light</hi> that God has afforded them, and bring ſuch Debates and Reſults to the <hi>Teſt</hi> of that Light and the <hi>Sound Form</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath preſerv'd amongſt us; I need not take the Employment upon me of pointing to <hi>Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> among the ſeveral <hi>Parties</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> as to theſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52323:70"/>
points; nothing will be clearer. For it is about the <hi>Meaning</hi> of this and the <hi>Intention</hi> of that place of Scripture the Conteſt hath been and is; and how to maintain and propagate thoſe Conceits; So that the falling out is in the Wood of our own Opinions, and there the Contention is kindled, that conſumes all about our Ears. O that we would be but impartial and ſee our <hi>over-plus</hi> to the Scriptures, and retrench that redancy or keep it modeſtly! for 'tis an horrid thing that we <hi>Protestants</hi> ſhould aſſume a Power of ranging our apprehenſions with the Text, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining our Imaginations for Indiſpenſible Articles of Faith and Chriſtian Communion.</p>
            <p>But the next proof of the prevalency of <hi>Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> amongſt us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is <hi>The great</hi> Power <hi>and</hi> Sway <hi>of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>and the</hi> Peoples Reliance <hi>upon them for the Knowledge of</hi> Religion, <hi>and the Way of</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Salvation. This is ſuch plain Fact, that almoſt every <hi>Pariſh</hi> proves it. Is not <hi>Prophecy</hi> (once the Church's) now engroſt by them and wholly in their hands? Who dare publickly <hi>preach</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> that is not of that <hi>Claſs</hi> or <hi>Order?</hi> Have not they only the <hi>Keys</hi> in keeping? May any body elſe pretend to the Power of <hi>Abſolution</hi> or <hi>Excommunication?</hi> muchleſs to conſtitute <hi>Miniſters?</hi> Are not all <hi>Church Rites</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> in their Cuſtody? don't they make it their proper Inheritance? Nay, ſo much larger is their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> then <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that only they begin with <hi>Births</hi> and end with <hi>Burials:</hi> Men muſt pay them for <hi>Coming</hi> in and <hi>Going</hi> out of the World. <hi>To pay for dying</hi> is hard! Thus their <hi>Profits</hi> run to the <hi>Grave,</hi> and that which is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52323:70"/>
the <hi>Loſs</hi> of others, is their <hi>Gain,</hi> and a part of their Revenue.</p>
            <p>'Tis of this great <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Sept</hi> of Men only, that all <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations</hi> are (of modern Ages) compounded; and what they determin, is called the <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> though Alas! they be only to <hi>Obey,</hi> what they <hi>Ordain;</hi> giving us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to underſtand, that they want the <hi>Authority</hi> of her <hi>Name,</hi> where they deny her to have a part, or to be preſent.</p>
            <p>But they have not only been the Uſual <hi>Starters</hi> of <hi>new Opinions,</hi> and the great <hi>Creed-Makers</hi> among Chriſtians, but the <hi>Sway</hi> they have with the <hi>People,</hi> makes them ſo Conſiderable an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the Eyes of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> that he often finds it not for his Ends to diſobliege them. Upon this it is, we ſee them ſo Succeſsful in their Solicitations of <hi>Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to give its <hi>Sanction</hi> to their <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Forms;</hi> and not only recommend them (which goes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great way with the People) but impoſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of them, and that on ſevere <hi>Penalties;</hi> in ſo much, that either men muſt offer up their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to their Fears, and <hi>diſſemble Conviction</hi> to be ſafe, or periſh; there is no medium. Something of this lies near us: God Almighty open our Eyes to ſee both the Truth and Miſchief of this thing.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay of that <hi>Implicit Reverence</hi> the people have for the <hi>Clergy</hi> and dependence upon them about <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> as if they were the only <hi>Truſtees</hi> of Truth, and high <hi>Treaſurers</hi> of <hi>Divine Knowledge</hi> to the <hi>Laity:</hi> and we daily ſee, that the blind Opinion they have of their <hi>Office</hi> (as that which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52323:71"/>
is peculiar to that order and not common to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, be their <hi>Gifts</hi> as they will) diſpoſes them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entirely upon their Performances. The <hi>Miniſter</hi> is <hi>Chooſer</hi> and <hi>Taſter</hi> and every thing for them: They ſeem to have deliver'd up their Spiritual SELVES, and made over the buſineſs of Religion, the <hi>Rights</hi> of their <hi>Souls</hi> to their <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and that ſcarcely with any <hi>Limitation</hi> of Truſt too: and as if he were, or could be their <hi>Garante</hi> in t'other World, they become very inſolicitous of any further <hi>Search.</hi> So that if we would examine the reſpective <hi>Pariſhes</hi> of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as well as <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries, we ſhall find (and it is come to that ſad paſs) that very few have any other <hi>Religion</hi> then the <hi>Tradition</hi> of their <hi>Prieſt:</hi> They have given up their Judgment to him, and ſeem greatly at their Eaſe, that they have diſcharged themſelves of the Trouble of <hi>Working out their own Salvation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things, that they might hold faſt that which is good.</hi> And in the room of that care bequeath'd the charge of thoſe Affairs to a <hi>Standing Penſioner</hi> for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the Clergy are become a ſort of <hi>Mediators</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and us, that as we muſt go to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo muſt we come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>them;</hi> they muſt be, it ſeems, like the <hi>high Prieſts</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> that only enter'd into the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> whoſe <hi>Lips pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Knowledge:</hi> and by whom we muſt underſtand a <hi>Divine Oracle.</hi> As if the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation</hi> are not to be intruſted with the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> or that it were a kind of <hi>Prophanation</hi> to expoſe them to their <hi>View:</hi> and the only way to make them <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> to ſuffer <hi>Every Chriſtian</hi> to have the keeping of them:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52323:71"/>
(though they belong to <hi>every Chriſtian.)</hi> But this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (thanks be to God) is that of <hi>humane Authority,</hi> that would magnify the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> by the Ignor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the State of people under the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Prieſt-hood</hi> is called a <hi>Bondage, Childhood</hi> and <hi>Minority,</hi> and the Law thereof is term'd a <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note>

                  </gap>mbroil Age</hi> of our Minority, is not to obtain greater <hi>Freedom,</hi> but to make our Caſe worſe. For it is more tolerable to be uſed as <hi>Children</hi> when we are <hi>Children,</hi> and know nothing above that Condition, then when <hi>riper Years</hi> have brought us to the Underſtanding and Reſentment of <hi>Men.</hi> But it is almoſt as unpardonable as it is unſufferable, to make that <hi>Infancy</hi> the Perfution of the <hi>Chriſtian-Religion,</hi> as if there were nothing <hi>beyond wearing a Bib and being fed, carried and govern'd as</hi> Nurſes <hi>pleaſe;</hi> that is, <hi>as the</hi> Prieſts <hi>will.</hi> It is a Knowing and <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> and not a blind <hi>Obedience,</hi> that commends a <hi>Man; Children</hi> ſhould be ruled, becauſe they have no Underſtanding or Choice; but becauſe 'tis not ſo with <hi>Men, Reaſon</hi> ought to conduct them in their Duty, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they perform to God may be ſuch, as the Apoſtle calls, a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> one: The <hi>Will</hi> is no longer <hi>Will</hi> if

not <hi>Free,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience</hi> to be reputed <hi>Conſcience,</hi> where compell'd. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not the time of Ceremonial Works but <hi>Faith,</hi> therefore not Coercive, becauſe out of our own power; it is the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though this be very unhappy, that ſo excellent a Reformation, founded upon the freeſt Principles of Inquiry, common to all-that had Souls to ſave, ſhould ſo miſerably degenerate into <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Implicit Faith</hi> and <hi>blind Obedience;</hi> yet that part of our Hiſtory is moſt lamentable to me, where we find the <hi>Noble Bereans,</hi> the diligent Inquirers, People that deſire to <hi>prove all things,</hi> that they may <hi>hold faſt that which is good,</hi> ſuch as would ſee with their own Eyes, and that dare not transfer the right of Examination to any mortal man, but who deſire to make their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of their <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> that on which they dare depend and reſt their <hi>eternal Happineſs</hi> in the Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that, theſe I ſay, ſhould inſtead of being cheriſht, be therefore <hi>expoſed to the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>the</hi> Scorn <hi>of the Rude Multitude, and the Proſecution of the</hi> Civil Magiſtrate: this I confeſs is very anxious to remember, and I only do it for this purpoſe, that it may put us in mind of our great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion from <hi>Primitive Proteſtancy,</hi> and how much <hi>Humane Authority</hi> has crept into the Affairs of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſince that time of the day, when we made it a prime Article of our <hi>Proteſtant Creed</hi> to eject and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.

            <p>So as that <hi>Self denyal,</hi> which relates to our Wills and Affections in a corrupt State, they apply to the Uſe of our Underſtanding about Religion; as if it were the ſame thing to deny that which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know to be Evil (which is the <hi>Chriſtian Self denyal)</hi> and to deny that very <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> which is God's Gift and our Honour. Whereas <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are ſo Conſiſtent, as that <hi>Religion</hi> can neither be underſtood nor maintain'd without <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For if this muſt be laid aſide, I am ſo far from being Infallibly aſſured of my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I am not capable of any Meaſure of Good from Evil, Truth from Falſhood. Why? I have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52323:75"/>
no underſtanding or uſe of any, which is the ſame. All the Diſadvantage the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is under in this is that, of his greater Modeſty, and that be ſubmits his Belief to be tryed, which the other refuſes, under the Pretence of unaccountable Infallibility to that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Reaſon decides.</p>
            <p>So that whereas ſome people excuſe their embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that Religion by urging the <hi>Certainty</hi> that is in it, I do ſay, 'Tis nothing but <hi>Preſumption.</hi> For a man can never be <hi>Certain</hi> of that, about which he has not the Liberty of Examining, Underſtanding or Judging: <hi>Confident</hi> (I confeſs) he may be; but that's quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than being <hi>Certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I muſt never deny, but that every Chriſtian ought to believe as the Church believes, provided the Church be true; but the Queſtion is, Which is that <hi>true Church?</hi> And when that is anſwered; as a Man may Unlawfully Execute a Lawful Sentence, ſo he may falſly <hi>believe</hi> as the <hi>True Church</hi> believes; for if I believe, what ſhe believes, only becauſe ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it, and not becauſe I am convinced in my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Conſcience of the Truth of what ſhe believeth, my Faith is falſe, though hers be true: I ſay, it is not true to me, I have no Evidence of it.</p>
            <p>What is this <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> rather (as worthy <hi>Tindal</hi> every where tranſlates it) <hi>but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People agreed together in the ſincere Profeſſion and Obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Now look what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement they <hi>ſeverally</hi> had to believe and embrace the Goſpel, that we muſt have to <hi>joyn</hi> with them: for as they made not one another an <hi>infallible</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52323:75"/>
to one another, upon which they firſt embrac'd the Goſpel; neither are we to ground our Belief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon <hi>their Authority joyntly;</hi> but as they had a Rule to believe and commune, ſo muſt we have the <hi>ſame Rule</hi> to embrace their Communion. So that that Church cannot be the Rule of my Faith, that have the ſame Faith and Object for my Faith that ſhe has. I argue thus,</p>
            <p>I muſt believe as the Church believes, that is, I muſt have the ſame Faith the Church has; then I muſt have the ſame Rule, becauſe the Church can be no more the Rule of that Faith, then ſhe can be that Faith of which ſome would make her the Rule. If then the Church has Faith, and that Faith a Rule; and that ſhe can no more be the Rule of her own Faith, then ſhe can be that Faith it ſelf; it follows, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Rule of the Faith of her Members, becauſe thoſe Members have the ſame Faith, and that they in Society are this Church. For that which is the Rule of the Congregation's Faith in general, muſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be the Rule of every Member's Faith that makes up that Congregation; and conſequently of every Member that may hereafter adhere to it. So that <hi>to talk of believing as the Church believes; to flowriſh upon that Self-denyal and Humility, which takes all upon Truſt, and revile thoſe with the bittereſt Invectives that are modeſtly ſcrupulous, and act the</hi> BEREANS; <hi>for their Souls</hi> (who think that Eaſineſs of Nature and Condeſcention might be better beſtowed, and in this occaſion ill-tim'd and dangerous) <hi>is to put the Knife to the Throat of Proteſtancy; and what in them lies to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it to implicit Faith and blind Obedience.</hi> For it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52323:76"/>
cannot be denyed but that the great Foundation of our Proteſtant Religion is the <hi>Divine Authority of the Scriptures from without us, and the Teſtimony and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Holy Spirit within us.</hi> Upon this foot the firſt Reformers ſtood, and made and maintain'd their Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> and freely offered up their innocent Lives in Confirmation. With good Cauſe therefore it is the general Conſent of all <hi>found</hi> Proteſtant Writers, <hi>That neither Traditions, Councils nor Canons of any viſible Church, much leſs the Edicts of any Civil Seſſion or Juriſdiction, but the Scriptures only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpeted by the Holy Spirit in us, give the final Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in Matters of Religion, and that only in the Conſcience of every Chriſtian</hi> TO HIMSELF. Which Proteſtation made by the firſt publick <hi>Reformers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Imperial Edicts of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Church Traditions without Scripture Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gave firſt beginning to the Name of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> and with that Name hath ever been received this Doctrine, <hi>which prefers the divine Authority of the Scripture and Spirit to that of the Church and her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> And if the Church is not ſufficient implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be believed, as we hold it is not, what can there elſe be named of more force with us, but the Divine Illumination in the Conſcience, or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the beſt Senſe of the Word, then <note place="margin">1 John 3. 20.</note> which God only is greater. But if any man ſhall pretend that the Scripture judges according to his Conceptions or Conſcience for other men, and that they muſt take their Religious Meaſures by the Line of his Direction; ſuch a perſon makes himſelf greater then either Church, Scripture or Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52323:76"/>
And, pray, let us conſider if in any thing the Pope is by our Proteſtant Divinity ſo juſtly reſembled to Antichriſt, as in aſſuming Infallibility over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Scripture to determine as he thinks fit; and ſo in effect to give God, Scripture, Magiſtrates and Conſcience the Law. To this they have <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> without ſcruple applyed that to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians; Sitting in the Temple of God, exalting himſelf above all that is caled God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To check this exorbitancy, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt anothers Servant? to his own Lord he ſtands or falls;</hi> which ſheweth with great Evidence that Chriſtians of all ſizes, great and ſmall, are but Brethren, and conſequently all ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, Lordſhip and Impoſition are excluded; But if there be a Difference 'tis in this, that as Chriſt taught, <hi>He that is greateſt, is to be Servant to the reſt;</hi> but what is more oppoſite to a Servant then a Lord, and to Service then Injunction and Impoſition, and that on Penalties too? Here it is that Chriſt is only Lord and Lawgiver, who is only King of this inward Kingdom of the Soul: And 'tis to be noted that the Apoſtle did not write this to a private Brother, or in ſome ſpecial Caſe, but to the Church, as a General and ſtanding Truth, and therefore now as Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and proper as then: And if this be true, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how any, or even the moſt part of the Church, that are ſtill but Brethren to the reſt, of one volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Communion and Profeſſion, can with any ſhew of Reaſon impoſe upon them and eſcape the Reproof of this Scripture; <hi>for all Societies are to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to their Inſtitution and firſt Principles
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52323:77"/>
of Union.</hi> Where there is Violence upon this part, <hi>Tyranny and not Order is introduced.</hi> Now ſince Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and Conviction began all true Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, all Chriſtian Societies muſt uphold themſelves upon the ſame free Bottom, <hi>or they turn Antichriſtian.</hi> I beſeech you here, let us examine our ſelves faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and I am of belief that ſomething of this will yet appear amongſt us, that ſhew great Reverence to that free Name.</p>
            <p>But to make good their unreaſonable conceit of <hi>Church Authority,</hi> they object Chriſt's Words, GO TELL THE CHURCH, that is, ſay they, <hi>The Church is the Rule and guide of Faith, whatever the Church agrees upon and requires your aſſent to and Faith in, that you muſt neceſſarily believe.</hi> But though, as before, 'tis confeſt in a ſenſe we muſt believe as the true Church believes, yet not becauſe ſhe ſo believes, but for the ſame Reaſons that ſhe her ſelf does ſo believe, becauſe none can truly believe as ſhe believes, but muſt ſo do upon the ſame principles and motives, for which they believ'd that firſt made up that Chriſtian Church: To talk of being the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> in point of Faith, is to contradict Scripture, and juſtle Chriſt out of the Office which is peculiar to him and his Spirit; he is given to his Church an <hi>Head,</hi> that is, a <hi>Counſellor,</hi> a <hi>Ruler,</hi> a <hi>Judge,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah 6. Rom. 8. 14.</note> and is called a <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> and ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>The Children of God are led by the Spirit of God. And he was Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs</hi> to the Church A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick, and is ſo to his own Church all the World over. Beſides, 'tis abſurd that the Church can be the Rule and Guide of Faith, for as ſuch, <hi>ſhe muſt be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52323:77"/>
her own Rule and Guide, the Faith of the Members being that of the Church,</hi> which cannot be.</p>
            <p>But what then can be the meaning of Chriſts words, <hi>Go tell the Church?</hi> Very well. I anſwer, 'tis not about <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Injury?</hi> that Chriſt ſpeaks, and the place explains it ſelf, which is this: <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Moreover, if thy Brother ſhall TRESPASS a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, go and tell him his fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone</hi> (here is <hi>Wrong,</hi> not <hi>Religion; Injuſtice,</hi> not <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> concerned, as ſome would have it, to maintain their Church power) <hi>if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gain'd thy Brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes every word may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed; and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, TELL IT UNTO THE CHURCH; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican. Verily I ſay unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. The matter &amp; manner of which paſſaged eliver'd by Chriſt ſhews that he intended not to ſet up <hi>Church power about Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip;</hi> unto which all muſt bow, even without, if not againſt conviction. The word TRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PASS and FAULT, prove abundantly that he only means private and perſonal Injuries, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the undeniable ſignification and uſe of the word TRESPASS and FAULT, but from the way Chriſt commands for accommodation, viz. that <hi>the perſon wrong'd do ſpeak to him that commits the Injury alone,</hi> if that will not do, <hi>that he take one or two with him;</hi> but no man can think that if it related to <hi>Faith</hi> &amp;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52323:78"/>
               <hi>Worſhip,</hi> I ought to receive the Judgment of one, or two or three againſt mine own. This has not been the practice, at leaſt not the principle of the moſt dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated Church ſince the Primitive times; for moſt, if not all agree, <hi>that nothing below the Church can dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine about matters of Faith,</hi> and even many with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot go ſo far: yet Chriſt ſeems to fix a blame upon him that complies not with the Perſon he has offended, but more if he refuſe to give ſatisfaction, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one or two have alſo intreated him; therefore it cannot relate to matters of Faith and ſcruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>but perſonal and private Injuries:</hi> Which is yet clearer from this part of Chriſt's ſaying, viz. <hi>That in the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes every Word may be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Which Implies a <hi>Tryal</hi> and <hi>Judicial</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as is cuſtomary in civil caſes, about perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and private Treſpaſſes; for it were not ſo proper to ſpeak of Witneſſes on any other account. This is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpreted beyond exception by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where he reproves and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1, 2.</note> forbids them, <hi>to go to Law one with another before Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> arguing thus, <hi>Do you not know that the Saints ſhall Judge the World, and if the World ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters?</hi> This ſhews the meaning of Church Authority is thoſe dayes, and is a natural Expoſition upon Chriſt's words (in caſe of Treſpaſs and Refractorineſs) <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> And 'tis yet the Practice of all ſober, juſt and quiet People, raher to refer their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies to approved men, than to tare one another to pieces at Law.</p>
            <p>But it is worth our notice that as any Deciſion up
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52323:78"/>
on an arbitration oblieges only the Parties to ſit down content with the awardment of ſuch <hi>loſs</hi> or <hi>gain</hi> as they the Arbitrators think equal (as the next beſt way to accommodate differences, and not that ſuch awardment ſhould alter their firſt Thoughts and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they had of their right, or force them to declare they are of the Arbitrators mind.) So is it moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, where the Church is only an Arbitrator about Perſonal treſpaſſes or umpire at moſt, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a Power to determine and impoſe Faith, and that upon ſevere Penalties as well of this (unto which Chriſt's Church has no relation) as of the other World; I ſay, this very thing well weigh'd breaks all their Fallacies to pieces, and decides the buſineſs beyond all contradiction between thoſe that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Spirit within and the Scripture without</hi> on the one hand, and ſuch as meerly <hi>reſt upon the Traditions of Men and Authority of the Church</hi> on the other hand. For if in an Arbitration I am not bound to be of the Arbitrators mind, though for Peace ſake I ſubmit to their Award, and that the Church Power in this place controverted relates only to external and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treſpaſſes, Injuries or Injuſtices, as the place it ſelf plainly proves, there can be no ſenſe, reaſon or modeſty in the Earth, on the part of thoſe high Church men, who would from hence <hi>wring</hi> and <hi>extort the Power</hi> of <hi>defining, reſolving</hi> and <hi>impoſing upon all people, under temporal and eternal puniſhment, Articles of Faith and Bonds of Chriſtian Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Conclude this of the Church with ſaying, that 'tis not <hi>Identity of Opinion,</hi> but <hi>Juſtice,</hi> not <hi>Religious Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> but <hi>Perſonal Satisfaction</hi> that concerns the <hi>text,</hi>

            <p>To this let me add ſomthing about this great Word CHURCH. Some men think they are ſure enough if they can but get <hi>within the pale of the Church</hi> that have not yet conſider'd what it is. The Word CHURCH, ſignifies any Aſſembly, ſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed it; and it is by Worthy <hi>Tindal</hi> every where tranſlated <hi>Congregation.</hi> It has a two fold ſenſe in Scripture. The firſt and moſt excellent Senſe is that, in which ſhe is called the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bride</hi> of Chriſt. In this reſpect ſhe takes in all Generations, and is made up of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, be they in Heaven or on Earth, thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. 5. 23, to 33. <hi>Col. 1. 16, 17. 18. Heb. 12. 22, 23. Rev.</hi> 21. 2. Chap. 22. 17. Here Chriſt only can be Head; this Church is waſhed from all Sin, not a Spot nor a Wrinkle left; ill men have nothing to do with this Church, within whoſe pale only is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor is this Univerſal and truly <hi>Catholick</hi> Church capable of being conveen'd to be told of Wrongs or Treſpaſſes. The other uſe of that Word in Scripture is alwayes referred to Particular Aſſemblies and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is the <hi>Church</hi> which by Chriſt's Doctrine is to be told of Perſonal Injuries and whoſe determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Peace ſake is to be adhear'd to muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be the adiacent or moſt contiguous company of Chriſtian Believers, thoſe to whom the Perſons in difference are by external Society and Communion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and that ſuch private and diſtinct Aſſemblies
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52323:80"/>
are ſo called the Church, is apparent from the acts and writings of the Apoſtles the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Antioch, Corinth, Epheſus, Galatia, Theſſalonica, Crete, &amp;c.</hi> peruſe theſe places, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 11. &amp; 9. 31. &amp; 11. 22, 26. &amp; 14 23, 27. <hi>Rom. 16. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 4. 17. &amp; 14. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. Chap. By which it plainly appears that the Univerſal viſible Church, ſo much bragg'd of for the Rule and Judge of Faith, &amp;c. is an upſtart thing, and like mean Families or ill got Goods, it uſes falſe Heraldry to give it a Title.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtoilick times, to which all others muſt vail and by whom they muſt be tryed, know no ſuch conceit; and the Truth is, it was then firſt ſtarted, when the Pride of one man made him ambitious, and his Power able to bid for <hi>Headſhip, Empire</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity;</hi> 'twas then needful to his being <hi>Univerſal head,</hi> that he ſhould firſt have an <hi>Univerſal body.</hi> But ſuppoſe ſuch a Church there were, 'tis utterly Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch a Church could be called together in anyone place, or at any one time to be told or to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of any thing; ſo that yielding the thing by them deſired, it is uſeleſs and impracticable to the ends they deſire it for. But alas! who knows not, that loves not to be blind, that the Church among them is the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> the few cunning men govern the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, and intitle their conceits, <hi>the Canons of Chriſt's Church;</hi> and humane Power and Force, the Policy and Weapons of this world, muſt back their decrees. And all this comes from the Ignorance and Idleneſs of the People, that give the Pride and Induſtry of the Clergy an opportunity to effect their crafts upon them. For ſo mean ſpirited are the People as to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52323:81"/>
take all upon truſt for their Souls, that would not truſt an <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> about a <hi>ſlit Groat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis prodigious to think what <hi>Veneration</hi> the <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> have raiſed to themſelves by their uſurpt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Apoſtleſhip, their pretended Succeſſions, and their CLINK CLANK of extraordinary Ordination. A <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>God on Earth,</hi> a <hi>Man that has the Keys of Heaven and Hell; do as he ſays, or be damn'd;</hi> what power like to this? The Ignorance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Title and Pretences, have prepared them to deliver up themſelves into their hands, like a Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Uſurer, that hedges in the Eſtate on which he has a Mortgage; and thus they make themſelves ever <hi>in Fee</hi> to the Clergy, and become their proper <hi>Patrimony.</hi> So that believing as the Church believes, is neither more nor leſs then Rooking men of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or doing as ill Gameſters are wont to do, get by uſing falſe Dice. Come, come, 'tis believing as the Prieſthood believes, which made way for that offence wiſe and good men have taken againſt the Clergy in every Age: And did the People examine their bottom, the ground of their Religion and Faith, it would not be in the Power of their Leaders to cauſe them to Err; an implicit Veneration to the Clergy begun the Miſery! What! Doubt my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! arraign his Doctrine, put him to the Proof! by no means; but the Conſequence of not doing it has been the Introduction of much falſe Doctrine Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Formality, which gave juſt occaſion for Schiſm (for the Word has no hurt in it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies only a Separation, which may as well be right as wrong.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52323:81"/>
But that I may not be taxed with partiallity or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with ſigularity, there are two Men, whoſe Worth, Good Senſe and True Learning I will at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time engage againſt an entire Convocation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgment, viz. <hi>Jacobus Acontius</hi> and <hi>John Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton,</hi> that are of the ſame mind; who, though they have not writ much, have writ well and much to the purpoſe. I will begin with <hi>Jacobus Acontius</hi> at large, and do heartily beſeech my Readers to be more then ordinarily intent in reading what I cite of him, their Care and Patience will be requited by his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and very acute Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It remains, that we ſpeak of ſuch Cauſes of the not perceiving, that a Change of Doctrine is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as conſiſt in the Perſons that are taught. Now they are cheifly two, Careleſneſs and Ignorance. Carleſneſs for the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>part ariſeth hence, In that the people truſt too much to their Paſtors; and per ſwade themſelves, that they will not ſlip into any Error, and that therefore they have ſmall need to have an Eye over them, but that they are bound ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embrace whatſoever they ſhall hold forth, without any curious Examination. Hereunto may be added many other buſineſſes, whereunto men addict themſelves: For that Saying is of large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Where mens Treaſure is, there is their Heart,</hi> and that other, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi> Now, how it may come to paſs that after a people hath once had a great Knowledge of Divine Truths, the ſaid Knowledge may as it were vaniſh away, beſides that Cauſe which hath been even now alleadged,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52323:82"/>
we ſhall in another place make diſcovery of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons. We ſhall for the preſent add only this one; That the people themſelves are in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual kind of Mutation, ſome daily dying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, others ſucceeding and growing up in their ſtead. Whence it comes to paſs, That ſince the Change which is made in every Age, is ſmall, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people cannot perceive it; or if they do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, yet they eſteem it not of ſuch moment, as to think fit to move any Difference thereabout. This thing alſo is of very great force, to keep the people from taking notice of a Change in Doctrine; when men ſhall perſwade themſelves, that they are not able to judge of matters of Religion, as though <hi>it is, it is not,</hi> and other words uſed in Scripture, do not ſignifie the ſame which they do in common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or as if nothing could be underſtood without ſome great Knowledge in the Tongues and Arts or Sciences, and as if the Power of the Spirit were of no efficacy without theſe Helps. Whereby it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſs, that whilſt they think they underſtand not even thoſe things which in ſome ſort they do underſtand, being expreſſed in moſt clear and evident words; they do at length arrive to that Blockiſhneſs that they cannot underſtand them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; ſo that, though they have before their Eyes a Sentence of Scripture ſo clear, that nothing can be more evident; yet if they to whoſe Authority they in all things ſubject themſelves, ſhall ſay any thing point-blank oppoſite thereunto, they will give credit unto them, and imagine themſelves not to ſee that which they ſee as clear as the Light.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52323:82"/>
And by theſe means verily it comes to paſs, That when the Doctrine of Religion is corrupted, the Mutation is not diſcovered: Furthermore, when the Doctrine is once begun to be changed, it muſt needs be, that out of one Error another ſhould ſpring and propagate infinitely; and God, for Juſt Reaſons of his own, blinding them, men bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves ſo great Darkneſs, and ſlip into ſuch ſoul Errors; That if God out of Mercy open a mans Eyes, and let him ſee thoſe Errors he lives in, he can ſcarcely believe himſelf, or be perſwaded that he was ever enveloped with ſuch blind Errors. Which thing is as true, and as well to be ſeen in Men of greateſt Learning &amp; Experience. If thou ſhalt thorowly peruſe the writings of ſome of the School-men (as they call them) thou ſhalt in ſome places meet with ſo much Accuteneſs, as will make thee admire.

               <q>Now there is need of a double Caution: viz. That there be no Change made in the Doctrine,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52323:83"/>
when it is pure: And if any Change be made, that there be notice taken of it. Now look what Change is made in this kind, all the Blame is laid upon thoſe whoſe Office it is to inſtruct the People; for though themſelves are the Authors of the Change, yet will the people impute it to the Miniſters Sleepineſs and want of Care at leaſt. It concerns therefore the Paſtors and Teachers to be Eagle eyed, and to be very well acquainted with thoſe Cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Change of Doctrine becomes undiſcovered, and to have them at their Fingers ends, and to be wary, that on no hand they may miſcarry. Now it will be an excellent Caution for the keeping of Doctrine pure, if they ſhall avoid all curious and vain Controverſies: If they ſhall ſet before their Eyes the ſcope and end of all Religious Doctrine, and likewiſe a Series or Catalogue of all ſuch things as make to the attainment of that End (of which we formerly ſpake;) if they ſhall affect not only, the matter it ſelf, but alſo the words and phraſes which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture makes uſe of, and exceedingly ſuſpect all different Forms of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Not that I would have them ſpeak nothing but <hi>Hebraiſms;</hi> for ſo their Language would not be plain nor intelligible: but I wiſh that they will ſhun all ſuch Expreſſions, as have been invented by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Diſputants, beyond what was neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſence of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and all thoſe Tenets which men by their own Wits do collect and infer from the Scriptures. Now of what Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this will be, we may gather by this Inſtance: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> think it one and the ſame thing to ſay,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52323:83"/>
                  <hi>The Church cannot err;</hi> and to ſay in the words of our Lord, <hi>Whereſoever two or three ſhall be gathered together in my Name, there will I be in the midſt of them.</hi> Yet is the Difference very great, which may thus appear; foraſmuch as in caſe any one ſhall conceive the Church to be the Pope, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and Biſhops anointed by the Pope: he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aforeſaid Sentence, will judge, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall decree, ought to be of Force. But if he ſhall rather mind the words of our Lord, and ſhall conſider that thoſe kind of men, do regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own Commodity, Wealth and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; he will be ſo far from ſo underſtanding them, that peradventure not being able to allow the Deeds and Practices of theſe Men, he will come to hope from thoſe words, That if himſelf with ſome other good Men loving God with their whole Heart, ſhall come together, and unanimouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Aſſiſtance of God, ſhall be better able to determi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> What it is that ought to be believed and practiſed for the attainment of Salvation, then if they ſhould perſiſt to put their Confidence in ſuch Paſtors. Now this Rule, that the words of the Scripture ought to be uſed rather than any other, is then eſpecially to be obſerved, when any thing is delivered as a certain and tryed Truth, or as a Rule of Faith or Life, or out of which any other thing is to be inferred. For in Expoſitions and Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as there is need happily of greater Liberty, ſo is there leſs Danger if it be taken. For, whenas the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>expoſition</hi> thereof, are at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52323:84"/>
one and the ſame time both together in view, as it were; there no man can be ignorant, that the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>is the word of Man,</hi> ſo that <hi>he may reject it,</hi> in caſe it ſeem impertinent. And look by what means a man may hinder the Doctrine of Religion from being changed, by the ſelf-ſame he may find whether it be chang'd or no. Now every man ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Doctrine of that Age wherein he lives, with no other Doctrine then that which was out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſpotleſs, which is the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. Wherefore, notwithſtanding that in our Age the Goſpel is as it were revived, yet ought not any man thus to think, That he ought to examin whether the Goſpel hath loſt any of that Purity whereunto it had at this time arrived; he ought rather to look again and again, whether ſome Corruption do not yet remain, whether it be not in ſome part, as yet not ſufficiently reſtored to its ancient Purity and Luſtre: and confidently perſwade himſelf, That he cannot be (that I may ſo ſpeak) ſufficiently ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, in rejecting every word which is not in the Scriptures. Foraſmuch as man will ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And becauſe a thing will be ſo much the better preſerved, by how much the greater is the number of thoſe that keep it: the people ought often to be put in mind, That both the reading of the Scriptures, and the <hi>Care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion belongs not to the Paſtors of the Church only;</hi> but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52323:84"/>
that every one that would be ſaved ought to make diligent ſearch, whether any Corruption be already, or is for the future like to be introduced; and this to do no leſs carefully, then if he were perſwaded that all beſide himſelf were aſleep: and whatſoever is wont to take the common people off from ſuch ſtudies, Care muſt be taken that that thing be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away.

               <q>Now, foraſmuch as the profit will be ſmall, if ſome private man ſhall obſerve that an Error is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, unleſs he diſcover the ſaid Error, and lay it open: there muſt of neceſſity be ſome way how this may conveniently be done. Now there cannot be a more fitting way, then that which the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to the <hi>Corinthians.

                  <hi>be revealed to him that ſits by, let the former be ſilent. For ye way all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.</hi> If ſome one perſon ſhall alwayes ſpeak in the Church, and no man at any time may contradict him; it will be a very ſtrange thing, if that one man be not puffed up, if he do not fall into ſuch a Conceit of himſelf, as to think that he is the only man, that he only hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, he alone is wiſe: that all the reſt are a company of brute Animals as it were, who ought to depend only upon him, and to do nothing but learn of him. And if any man ſhall think, that himſelf likewiſe hath ſome ability to teach, he will account that man an hainous offender. But what
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52323:85"/>
ſays the Apoſtle to this? <hi>Did the Word of God come from you? or came it unto you only? If any ſeem to be a Prophet, or Spiritual; let him acknowledge what I write unto you to be the commands of the Lord. But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Wherefore Brethren, labour that ye may Propheſie, and forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues, let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> It is exceedingly to be lamented, That this cuſtom, and the practice of this command of the Lord, is not again reſtored into the Churches, and brought into uſe. But ſome men may ſay; Such is the raſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Age of ours, ſuch the boldneſs, ſuch the impudence, That if it were allowed to every one to ſpeak in the Congregation, there will be no end of Brawls and Contention. Why ſo? Is a man another kind of Creature now, then what he was of Old? Thou wilt ſay, he is. For mankind hath continually degenerated, grown worſe and worſe, and ſeems now to have attained the top of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Is it ſo indeed? But, ſuppoſe it to be ſo; Thou that art the Teacher of the people, art not thou alſo thy ſelf made of the ſame Mold? Art not thou born in the ſame Age? Inaſmuch as this ordinance princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally was intended to keep Paſtors within the bounds of modeſty: that they may underſtand, That they are not the authors of the Word of God, that they have not alone received the Spirit: by how much the more mankind hath degenerated, by ſo much the greater need is there thereof; for that there is now more raſhneſs, Arrogance, Pride, then of Old; this is true, as well of the Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52323:85"/>
as of the reſt of the people, Art thou a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, haſt thou any portion of the Spirit? If thou haſt not, ſo unfitting it is, that thou alone ſhouldſt ſpeak in the Congregation, that there will hardly be found any that deſires rather to be ſilenc't, then thy ſelf. But if thou art a Prophet, if thou haſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, mark what the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Acknowledge</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that thoſe things which I write, are the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord.</hi> Go to then, On the one ſide we have the judgment of our Lord, willing that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (for this is a Word that we are oblieged to uſe) ſhould be common to all, and that not for the Deſtruction, but the Salvation of the Church. On the other ſide, we have thy Judgment who feareſt leſt that may breed Contentions and Confuſion; whoſe Judgment now ought we rather ſtand to? If thou ſhalt conceive we muſt ſtand to thine: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou aſſumeſt unto thy ſelf, and what will become of thy modeſty. Our Lord, it ſhould ſeem, underſtood not what a kind of Creature man was; he wanted thy wiſdom belike to admoniſh him of the danger; or haply he thought not upon that Corruption which ſhould befall mankind, whereby ſuch a Liberty might prove unprofitable. But <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers thee, <hi>That God is not the author of Contention, but of Peace:</hi> Who well knowing what might move Contentions, what beget Peace, and not loving nor willing to have Contention, but Peace, willed that this liberty of Prophecying ſhould be in the Church. What canſt thou ſay to the contrary? what haſt thou to object againſt God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52323:86"/>
himſelf, wilt thou accuſe him of indiſcretion? No man hath ſo wicked a Tongue, as to dare to do it. Yet if thou ſhalt diligently ſearch thine Heart, thou ſhalt find there a certain diſpoſition ready to contend even with God himſelf: Which motion of thy Heart muſt by no means be hearkned unto, but ſharply repreſſed, and wholely ſubjected to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. It may ſeem peradventure an abſurd thing, That after ſome very learned perſon hath ſpoken, ſome contemptible perſon ſhall be allowed to contradict him. Can ſuch a perſon ſo do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great raſhneſs and temerity? Were I to ſpeak according to the judgment of man, verily I could not deny it. But if we be really perſwaded, That the knowledge of matters Divine, ought not to be attributed to our Watching, Studies, Wits, but to God, and to his Spirit, wherewith he can in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment endue the ſimpleſt perſon in the World, and that with no more labour or difficulty, then if he were to give him to one that had ſpent <hi>Neſtor</hi>'s Age in ſtudy: What reaſon is there for me to judge that this man does raſhly and unadviſedly, if he ſhall ariſe and contradict? Is not the Spirit able to reveal ſomewhat to him, which he hath hidden from thee? Now, if the Spirit have revealed ſomewhat to him, and to that end revealed it that he might contradict, that by his means the thing may be revealed to the Church: ſhall I ſay that he hath done raſhly in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Ghoſt? And if thou think otherwiſe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thou art not perſwaded that the Spirit is the Author and Teacher of this Knowledge, but that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52323:86"/>
all the praiſe thereof is due to Studies, Watchings, and the Wits of men. And if this be thy judgment, I tell thee again, That thou art not only unworthy to be the ſole Speaker, but worthy rather to be the only perſon not permitted to ſpeak in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And that thou mayſt the better underſtand, that the moſt Unlearned ought to be allowed to ſpeak, conſider, God will have himſelf to be acknowledged the Author of his own gifts: he will not have his praiſe attributed unto our Studies or Wits, but unto himſelf. But if the man that hath ſpent all his Life in Study, ſpeak wiſely, it is not attributed to God, but to ſtudy: In word, perhaps it may be attributed to God, yet not without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Reluctancy of our Judgment: and this is that which (I ſay) God will not abide. But if ſo be thou ſhalt hear a wiſe word come out of the Mouth of ſome unlearned Perſon, thou muſt needs, whether thou wilt or no, acknowledge God to be the Author thereof.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52323:87"/>
the Cauſe of the Victory, and not the Number or Valour of thoſe that fought. Now, beſides the Glory of God, hereby great Profit does accrue to the Church. For if the People ſhall ſee now one man, now another, endued with the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Expectation; many will thereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to hope for the ſame Gift, if they ſhall ask it; many will learn and profit; and it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by come to paſs, that when Occaſion ſhall be to chooſe a Miniſter, the Church ſhall not need to call ſtrange and unknown Perſons to that Office, but ſhe may have of her own ſuch as are fit to be choſen, Men whoſe Converſation and Manners are ſufficiently known. And when the number of ſuch as are able to propheſie, ſhall be great, the Church will not be forced to uſe ſuch Paſtors as from their very Childhood have propoſed to themſelves ſuch Offices as the reward of their Studies; and addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the ſtudy of Scripture and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no otherwiſe then they would have done to ſome Trade, whereby they meant in time to get their Living: So that a Man can expect but very few of them to prove other then Mercenary or Hireling Paſtors.</q>

               <q>Now, that it was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, that all might thus Propheſie; we may hence conjecture, in that it is upon <note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> Record, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. how our Lord, <hi>upon the Sabbath day decording to the Cuſtom, came into the Synagoguge, took a Book and expounded a place of</hi> Eſay; and how,

                  <hi>being twelve years of Age he ſate at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>in the Temple among the Doctors, and did aiſpute.</hi> For he could not ſo do by vertue of any ordinary office, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as his Age was uncapable, neither did the Doctors know who he was. Yea rather, our Lord in ſo doing muſt needs make uſe of the power which was granted to every one to ſpeak. It remained in the <hi>Chriſtians Congregations</hi> until the times of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> at the leaſt. Foraſmuch as we have theſe words of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the Writer of Church <note place="margin">Eccl. Hiſt. lib. 9.</note> affairs, to that effect: <hi>If any man inſpired by the Grace of God, ſhould ſpeak unto the People, they all with great ſilence fixing their Eyes upon him gave ſuch attention, as if he had brought them ſome Errand from Heaven.</hi> So great was the reverence of the hearers, ſuch order was ſeen among the Miniſters. One af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, another after him. Neither was there only two or three that Propheſied, according to what the Apoſtle ſaid, but to all was given to ſpeak; ſo that the wiſh of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems rather to have been fulfilled in them, when he ſaid, <hi>Would God all the People might Propheſie.</hi> There was no Spleen, no Envy, the gifts of God were diſpenſed, every one, according to his ability, contributing his aſſiſtance for the confirmation of the Church: And all was done with love, in ſuch ſort, That they ſtrove mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to the end this com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon prophecying may be profitable to the Church, we muſt diligently mark what the Apoſtle adviſes, For a ſure thing it is, that the Pride of Man is ſo great, that whatever hath once fallen from him, he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52323:88"/>
will by any means have it ſtand for a Truth, neither can he ſuffer that any man ſhould infringe the ſame. So that if he might be permitted to judge, that laſt ſpake, it will be a Miracle, if a man in his Life time ſhould ſee any one give way to him that contradicts him: What is <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice therefore in this caſe? <hi>Let two or three Prophets ſpeak, and let the reſt judge.</hi> He will not therefore have the ſame Perſons to be Parties and Judges. And he adds a little after, <hi>And the Spirit of the Prophets, is ſubject to the Prophets; for God is not the Author of diſſention, but of Peace.</hi> So that as ſoon as any man hath ſpoken his own mind, he ought to reſt himſelf ſatisfied with the judgment of the reſt, and not obſtinately to make no End of contending: if this be not done, a ſure thing it is, there will be no end of ſtrife. But what if any man will not be content to ſubmit to the Judgment of the reſt: Verily I would avouch, that being ſharply admoniſhed, that he diſturb not the Congregation, and that he go not againſt the command of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or rather of our Lord, commanding the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets to be ſubject to the Prophets; he ought to be caſt out of the Society, though he ſhould hold the prime place in the Congregation. The people likewiſe muſt frequently be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that liberty for any one to ſpeak in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is not therefore granted by the Apoſtle, to the end every one ſhould ſpeak what comes to his Tongues end, as if he were in a Market; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he gives liberty to him to ſpeak to whom any thing is revealed, he would have all Raſhneſs and Impudence to be laid aſide. He that reverences not the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52323:88"/>
Church of God, let that man know, he deſpiſeth the Spirit of God, who is Preſident there; and ſhall be ſure not to eſcape unpuniſhed. Before a man propounds any thing to the Church, he ought to conſider again and again, how ſure a manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath of that thing, and whatever the matter be, let him be ſure not to forget a ſober, modeſt, baſhful behaviour, without which vertues, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs no good can be effected. But here we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſider, both how far a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ught to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the judgment of the Congregation, and who may deſervedly be accounted a Troubler of the Church. Verily, I conceive a man ought ſo far to give way, as that after I have alledged what I had to ſay for my Opinion, if yet the reſt ſhall not allow of my Judgment, I ought to give over defending of it, and ceaſe to be troubleſome to the Congregation concerning the ſame: But I ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to confeſs that I have erred, or to deprecate any fault, whiles I do not yet underſtand that I have erred, for ſo I ſhould ſin againſt God. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Troubler of the Church, that will not, ſo far as we have expreſſed, ſubmit to the judgment of the Church, but goeth on to be troubleſome; but eſpecially that man who would exact of another that which he ought not to do; <hi>viz.</hi> to recant, being not perſwaded that he is in an Error. But thoſe men are commonly reputed troublers of the Church who refuſe to ratifie whatever ſhall any ways fall out of the Paſtors Mouthes. Again, in this place it may reaſonably be demanded, whether, when that a matter hath been once or twice debated, and ſome
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52323:89"/>
man knowing the judgment of the Congregation, would again reduce it into Controverſie, he ought to be heard, or enjoyned ſilence, and take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for determined. But of this we ſhall in another place more conveniently diſpute. That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore, is, that we wreſtle with God, by daily Prayers, to grant that we may have the uſe of this ſo ſoveraign and ſaving liberty, ſo profitable to the Church, and that thereby we may reap abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Fruit. And that he would, to that end, tame and break our Spirits with his Spirit, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them milde and gentle: and not ſuffer what he hath ordain'd for the confirmation and eſtabliſhment of his Church, to be by the ſtubbornneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of our Wits and Minds, turned to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and deſtruction thereof.</q> With much more to the ſame purpoſe, too large to be here inſerted.</p>

of men in the World (the</hi> CLERGY <hi>they call them) who impropriate the Keyes unto themſelves, and would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry to underſtand, that others from themſelves ſhould claim a right unto them.</hi> To your Queſtion then, no doubt but originally none received the Keyes from the Mouth of our Saviour, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles only; none did nor ever could manage them with that Authority and Splendor, as the Apoſtles did, who were above all moſt amply furniſhed with all things fitting ſo great a Work. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſeem to intimate, that the preaching Miſſion was communicated to others, as the ſeventy two Diſciples, as well as the Apoſtles; you do but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake your ſelf, if you conceive that the Keyes of the Goſpel were any way committed to them; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for the Sins of the World (wherein indeed the opening of the Kingdom of Heaven did conſiſt) they received it not, they knew it not. To be the prime Reporters of this, was an honour imparted only to the Apoſtles: Yet were they not ſo impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that they ſhould be confin'd to them. Every one that heard and received the <hi>Light</hi> of the ſaving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from them, ſo far forth as he had underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wayes of <hi>Life, had now the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven committed to his Power, both for his own and others uſe. Every one, of what State or Condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that hath any occaſion offered him, to ſerve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the wayes of Life,</hi> CLERGY, or LAY, MALE or FEMALE, <hi>whatever he be, hath theſe Keys not only for himſelf, but for the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then how much more doth Chriſtian Goodneſs require of every one, to his ability, to be a Light to thoſe who ſit in Darkneſs, and direct their ſteps, who moſt dangerouſly miſtake their way? <hi>To ſave a Soul, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a Prieſt.</hi> To whom I pray you, is that ſaid in <hi>Leviticus, Thou ſhalt not ſee thy Brother Sin, but thou ſhalt reprove, and ſave thy Brother?</hi> And if the Law binds a Man, when he ſaw his Enemies Cattel to ſtray, to put them in their way; How much more doth it obliege him to do the like for the Man himſelf? See you not how the whole World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires with me in the ſame Opinion? Doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Father teach his Son, every Maſter his Servant, every Man his Friend? How many of the Laity in this Age, and from time to time in all Ages, have by writing for the publick good, propagated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, as if ſome <hi>ſecret inſtinct</hi> of Nature had put into mens minds thus to do, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this let me add his Senſe of the force of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Authority in the deciſion of Controverſies, and how far the Antients, whether Fathers or Councils ought to be interreſted in the debates of theſe times, which may not be improper to the preſent ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not a few build upon their bottome.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſhall find (ſays he) that all <hi>Schiſms</hi> have crept into the Church by one of theſe three wayes; either upon matter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>J Hales,</hi> Tract of Schiſm, p. 201, 202, 203, 204.</note> of <hi>Fact,</hi> or matter of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or point of <hi>Ambition.</hi> For the firſt; I call that matter of Fact, when ſomething is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be done by us, which either we know, or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52323:90"/>
ſtrongly ſuſpect to be unlawful; ſo the firſt notable <hi>Schiſm,</hi> of which we read in the Church contained in it matter of Fact; For it being, upon <hi>Error</hi> taken for neceſſary, that an <hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt be kept; and upon worſe then Error, if I may ſo ſpeak, (for it was no leſs than a point of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> forced upon the Church) upon worſe than Error, I ſay, thought further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the ground for the time of our keeping that Feaſt, muſt be the Rule left by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> there aroſe a <hi>ſtout</hi> Queſtion, whether we were to Celebrate with the <hi>Jews,</hi> on the fourteenth Moon, or the <hi>Sunday</hi> following? This matter, though moſt <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> moſt <hi>vain,</hi> yet cauſed as great a Combuſtion. as ever was in the Church; The Weſt ſeparating and refuſing Communion with the Eaſt, for many Years together. In this <hi>Fantaſtical</hi> Hurry, I cannot ſee, but all the World were Schiſmaticks: neither can any thing excuſe them from that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; excepting only this, that we charitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe that all Parties out of Conſcience did what they did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A thing which befell them through the <hi>Ignorance of their Guides,</hi> (for I will not ſay their malice) and that through the juſt Judgment of God, becauſe <hi>through ſloath and</hi> BLIND OBEDIENCE <hi>Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined not the things, which they were taught, but like Beaſts of Burthen patiently couched down, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>indifferently underwent whatſoever their Superiors laid upon them.</hi> By the way, by this you may plainly ſee the <hi>danger</hi> of our appeal unto Antiquity, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in Controverted points of Faith, and how <hi>ſmall Relief</hi> we are to expect from thence. For if
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52323:91"/>
the diſcretion of the <hi>chiefeſt Guides and Directors of the Church,</hi> did in a Point ſo <hi>trivial,</hi> ſo <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> ſo <hi>mainly fail them,</hi> as not to ſee the Truth in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein it is the <hi>greateſt Marvel how they could avoid the ſight of it;</hi> can we without imputation of extream groſneſs and folly, <hi>think ſo</hi> POOR SPIRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED <hi>perſons competent Judges of the Queſtions now on Foot betwixt the Churches?</hi> Pardon me, I know not what Temptation drew that Note from me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How theſe men will come off I can't tell; they have ventured fairly, and yet I think their caſe not hazard us at all; you have them in three points plain. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That relying upon the Clergy as Guardians of Truth to the People, and the Peoples not examining the truth of things from them, is not Apoſtolical, but Apoſtatical. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no Councils or Fathers ought to be the Rule or Judge of our Faith. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That to ſave Souls every Man is a Prieſt; that is, the people are interreſſed in the Chriſtian Miniſtry, which is not tyed to Times, Places, Perſons and Orders, as under the Law; but free to all that have obtained Mercy and Grace from God; and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> calls the believers a Royal Prieſthood. So that every one is Prieſt to himſelf under the Goſpel. But all this I have mentioned with deſign, if it be poſſible, to beat men off that ſuperſtitious and dangerous Veneration they carry to the Names of <hi>Church, Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> as if they were to be ſayed by them, and not by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is only <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of the true Church. And truly, when I conſider the <hi>wilde</hi> dependance ſome people have upon the <hi>Church,</hi> whilſt they know not what ſhe is, <hi>and make it a Principle not to Inquire,</hi> I am
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52323:91"/>
amazed with what Confidence, they expoſe their Souls. This Principle it is, and not <hi>Inquiry,</hi> that makes men careleſs and unactive about their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But let none deceive themſelves, <hi>as they Sow they muſt Reap.</hi> 'Tis not to be ſaved, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pale of any viſible Church in the World. That is putting an eternal Cheat upon our ſelves. <hi>Ill things are Ill things,</hi> within or without the pale; that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; and as <hi>Sin</hi> can't be <hi>Chriſtened,</hi> nor <hi>impiety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Chriſtianity</hi> by no Arts of men, <hi>ſo the Wages will be Death;</hi> eternal Death. To be therefore of the Church, of which Chriſt is Head, the <hi>redeemed, regenerated Church of Chriſt,</hi> is quite another thing, then to be of any viſible Society whatever; for in all ſuch Communions there are but too many that have no true Title to Chriſtianity. If then that Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Church of which Chriſt is head, be made up only of holy and regenerated Souls throughout the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> this will adminſter but little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thoſe that preſume upon their being within the Pale of the Viſible Church.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to thoſe Scriptures that oppoſe themſelves to humane Authority in matters of Faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is one place of Scripture, that is irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> and <hi>Blind Obedience; He that believeth, hath the Witneſs</hi> In HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF: <note place="margin">1 John 1. 10.</note> This general Rule reſpects no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 'tis the Reſult of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to all Believers. Such have no need to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Winefried's</hi> Well, to the <hi>Shrines</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> nor the <hi>Church,</hi> for a Proof of their Faith; they have an
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52323:92"/>
Evidence nearer home: they have the <hi>witneſs</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of their <hi>Hope</hi> IN THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELVES.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, this is a Private Judge; but (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) 'tis one of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt's</hi> ſetting up, of all things I confeſs moſt deſtructive to <hi>Papacy</hi> no doubt; for here is a <hi>Judge</hi> in every man, that ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, to whom he muſt ſtand and fall in this and the other World.

            <p>Of like Tendency is that notable Paſſage of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians; Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your</hi>

            <p>To which I will add another Paſſage to the ſame Purpoſe (in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians) But let</hi>

            <p>I am not unacquainted with the great Objection that is made by <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too, High <hi>Church-men</hi> perhaps, that <hi>Love the Treaſon,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52323:93"/>
but hate the Traytor;</hi> that love this part of <hi>Popery,</hi> but hate the <hi>Pope,</hi> viz. <hi>There are doubts in Scripture, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about the moſt important Points of</hi> Faith; <hi>ſome body muſt guide the Weak, there muſt be ſome one ultimate, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Viſible Judge to appeal to, who muſt Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Conclude all Perſons as to their Doubts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the Interpretation of Scripture, otherwiſe</hi> So many Men, ſo many Minds; <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>would be filled with Controverſie and Confuſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>That</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are made more <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> than they are by ſuch as would fain preſerve to themſelves the Umpiridge &amp; Judgſhip of their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I deny it in point of <hi>Fact,</hi> that Man's Duty is not moſt plainly expreſt in all that concerns Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation; but 'tis very ſtrange, that when God intends nothing more by the Scriptures, than to reach the Capacities of Men as to things on which their Eternal Salvation depends; yet that no Book, if ſuch men ſay true, ſhould be ſo obſcure, nor ſubject to ſo many Various, nay Contradictory Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Name me one Author, <hi>Heathen, Jew</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> that ever wrote with that Obſcurity and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inconſiſtency, which ſome gladly pretend to find in the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> that they might have the Uſe and Keeping of them from the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and make their own Ends by it. Is then every Body's Book to be <hi>underſtood</hi> but God's? Was that writ <hi>not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?</hi> In ſhort, one of theſe two things muſt be true. Either that God intended <hi>Not to be underſtood,</hi> or <hi>To be underſtood,</hi> in what he commanded to be written. If he reſolved <hi>Not to be underſtood,</hi> it had
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52323:93"/>
been better there had been nothing writ; but if it was his purpoſe <hi>To be underſtood</hi> of Men, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that what he cauſed to be written, was plain enough for men to underſtand, or he miſt his own Aim and End, and writ it to no purpoſe, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be told me, <hi>That it is not denyed, but that the Scriptures may be underſtood by ſome body, but not by every body; for that the Great, Viſible Judge muſt needs underſtand them, becauſe it belongs to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to reſolve thoſe Doubts, and determine thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that may ariſe about underſtanding them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt alſo ſay, that this is falſe in <hi>Fact.</hi> For its ridiculous to imagine, that <hi>Luke</hi> did not make <hi>Theophilus</hi> his own <hi>Judge</hi> in the reading of what he writ to him, or that the Apoſtles in writing to the ſeveral Churches, as <hi>Rome, Corinth, Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> to whom they directed their Epiſtles, did not intend that they ſhould underſtand what they writ, or that they erected any ſuch Officer in the Church, as an <hi>Expounder</hi> of their Epiſtles to the Aſſembly to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily believed. For we know in thoſe days <hi>The People made the Church,</hi> they were the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the CLERGY, however it came about that it be now <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed</hi> into fewer hands; as you may ſee in <note place="margin">1 Pet 5. 3.</note> the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Peter:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is tranſlated <hi>Heritage</hi> in all our Bibles. But this is as if the Prieſt's only were the Lord's Heritage, which can't be, for a Reaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all, namely, that they reign as Lords over
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52323:94"/>
God's Heritage or Clergy (forbid expreſly by <hi>Peter)</hi> therefore not the Heritage and Clergy over which they ſo rule like Lords: by no means. I will ſay no more but this, 'tis no convincing Proof to me of their Humility. But to ſhut up this Agument about the Difficulty of Underſtanding the Scripture and pretended a neceſſity of a Viſible Judge, I ſay, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be ſpoken, may be written;</hi> or thus, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Viſible Judge can now ſay, the holy Pen men by God's Direction might have written;</hi> and what an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient and Omnipotent God did know and could do for Man's Salvation, an OMNIBENEVOLENT God, that tells us, <hi>he delights not in the Death of one Soul, but rather that he ſhould be ſaved,</hi> would have done. And becauſe God is as <hi>Omnibenevolent</hi> as <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> we muſt conclude he has done it; and 'tis great Preſumption and a mean Shelter to Ignorance to raiſe a credit to Humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, by beating down the true Value of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>They are dark; what follows? <hi>they muſt not be read?</hi> what follows then? <hi>Why then ſuch Teachers may do as they liſt with the People.</hi> But did the <hi>Phariſees</hi> with their broad Philacteries know God's mind bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Prophets? or could they deliver it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? no ſuch matter; 'tis by the ſame ſtrange Figure that the School-men know the mind of Chriſt better then the Apoſtles, and that the Council of TRENT can decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and yet this is the Engliſh of their Doctrine that hold to us thoſe Lights to read Scripture by, and that would have us ſeach their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52323:94"/>
and Decrees, to find out the Mind of the holy Ghoſt in Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Confuſions that are pretended to follow ſuch an Inquiry are but the wretched Arts of ill men, as much as in them lies, to keep Light and Truth out of the World: When the Net was caſt into the Sea, there came ſome good ſome bad Fiſh, that was not the Fiſhers fault they were no better. Inquiry is not to be blam'd for the ill uſe weak or worſe men make of it: The <hi>Bereans</hi> might not all believe, though they might all ſearch; for men don't inquire with equal Wiſdom, Love and good Deſire, ſome ſeek and find not: Some ask and receive not; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">James 4. 3.</note> muſt none ask or ſeek after that which is good? or becauſe ſome ask or ſeek amiſs, will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the thing it ſelf is naught? If Superſtition, Error, Idolatry and Spiritual Tyranny be detected, and Truth diſcover'd, will it more then make amends for all that Weakneſs and Folly ſome men have brought forth by the liberty of ſuch an Inquiry? The Enemies of Light may be as Rhetorical as they pleaſe upon the exceſs or Preſumption of ſome, bolder then wiſe, and more Zealous then Knowing; but if they had nothing to loſe by the diſcovery, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the Enemies of a prudent <hi>Search.</hi> It is to be fear'd ſuch get that Obedience by a blind devotion; which no man could yield them upon better Information; and is it reaſonable that men of that Stamp ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Empire by the Ignorance of the People? Ignorance ought to be the Mother of Devotion with none but thoſe that cannot be devout upon better terms; it is the glory of a man that he is Religious
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52323:95"/>
upon Reaſon, and that his Duty and Sacrifice are not blind or forc'd, but free and reaſonable; Truth upon Knowledge though vext with Schiſm, wiſe and good men will chuſe before Ignorant Religion with Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Enough of this.</p>
            <p>But this Notion of an <hi>Infallible Viſible Judge</hi> is as falſe in <hi>Reaſon</hi> as in <hi>Fact.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> it takes away the Uſe of every Man's <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and it is a Contradiction to have any, unleſs he were <hi>ſuch an Interpreter and ſuch a Judge, as would conclude us by Conviction,</hi> and not by Authority: that would be the moſt Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perſon in the World. But to over-rule my own Sight, to give the Lye to my own Underſtanding, ſay <hi>Black is White,</hi> and that <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Three make Ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>Conſcience</hi> (in the beſt Senſe) has ever been allow'd to be a <hi>Bond</hi> upon Men in all Religions; But that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which under Pretence of Authority would ſuperceed <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and inſtead of making Men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (the End of Religion) makes them worſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding all Diſtinction betwixt <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and reſolving all into an <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> and blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Commands of a <hi>Viſible Guide</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> is falſe, it cannot be otherwiſe. For to admire what Men don't know, and to make it a Principle not to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52323:96"/>
inquire is the <hi>laſt mark of Folly</hi> in the Believer, and of <hi>Impoſture</hi> in the Impoſer. To be ſhort, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Man, and a Man implies <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> but he that has no <hi>Conſcience</hi> not <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (as he has not, that has delivered them up to the Will of another Man) is no <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore no <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do beſeech you <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all Sorts, to conſider of the danger of this Principle with reſpect to <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of old'tw is the Fool that ſaid in his Heart there is no God;</hi> But now upon this Principle Men muſt be made <hi>Fools</hi> in order to <hi>believe:</hi> Shall <hi>Folly,</hi> which is the <hi>Shame</hi> (if not the Curſe) of a Man, be the Perfection of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</hi> Chriſt indeed has adviſed us to become <hi>Little Children,</hi> but never to become ſuch <hi>Fools;</hi> for (as the Proverb is) this is <hi>to be led by the Noſe,</hi> and not by our Wits. You know that God hates the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Fools: I will pray with the Spirit and with</hi> Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>alſo,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Let us commend that Teſtimony, which we believe to be true, to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> of Men, and let them have the Goſpel privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Examination: Error</hi> only looſes upon Trial. For if this had been the Way to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> (with Reverence be it ſpoken) God had not made our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition better, but worſe: For this tranſlates our Faith and Dependence upon God, to Man, and the Poſſibility, if not Probability of Man's erring expoſes us to greater inſecurity than before. For <hi>where I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I never could be deceived.</hi> But if I muſt abandon my own Senſe and Judgment, and yield my ſelf up to the Faith and Authority of another (to ſay no more of the Blindneſs and La neneſs of ſuch Belief
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52323:97"/>
and Devotion) <hi>what Security can I have, that the Man or Men, whom I truſt may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Again, ſince Mankind is a reaſonable Creature, and that the more reaſonable he is in his Religion, the nearer to his own being he comes, and to the Wiſdom and Truth of his Creator, that did ſo make him, a Religion without Reaſon, Impoſed by an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authority againſt Reaſon, Senſe and Conviction cannot be the Religion of the God of Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for it is not to be thought that he requires any thing that carries any violence upon the Nature of his Creature, or that gives the Lye to that Reaſon or Sence, which he firſt endow'd him with.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; Either Convince my underſtanding by the Light of Truth and Power of Reaſon, or bear down my Infidelity with the force of Miracles: for not to give me Underſtanding or Faith, and to preſs a ſubmiſſion that requires both, is moſt unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>But if there were no other Augument then this, it goes a great way with me, that as to ſuch as have their underſtanding at liberty, if they are miſtaken, there may be hopes of reclaiming by Informing them: but where <hi>the Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> are enſlav'd to Authority, and where Men make it a Principal Doctrine to ſuſpect their own Senſe and ſtrive againſt their own Convictions, (to move only by other mens Breath and fall down to their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) <hi>nothing ſeems to be left for the ſoundeſt Arguments &amp; cleareſt Truths to work upon.</hi> They had almoſt need to be re Created in order to be converted; for who can reaſonably endeavour to make him a Chriſtian that is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52323:97"/>
not a Man, which he cannot be truly ſaid to be, who has no underſtanding, or reſolves not to uſe it, but reject it, which is yet worſe; for he that has no underſtanding has no prejudice againſt it, but he that purpoſely denys &amp; abuſes it, is ſo much worſe, as that he turns Enemy to him that has and uſes his underſtanding. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never be convinced o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To Conclude, I have reſerved till laſt one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is <hi>ad hominem</hi> unanſwerable by us <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and without yielding to which we cannot be conſiſtent with our ſelves, or be thought to do unto others, what we would have others do unto us, and that is this: <hi>The Tranſlation of the Scripture</hi> was the painful work of our worthy <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> This I call their <hi>moſt ſolemn Appeal to the People againſt the Pope and Traditions of</hi> Rome <hi>in the buſineſs of their Separation.</hi> For when the queſtion roſe of the divine Authority of this or the other Practice in the Doctrine or Worſhip of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> preſently they recur'd to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and therefore made them ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they might witneſs for them to the people. This <hi>appeal</hi> to the People in defence of their Separation, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Judges of their proceeding againſt the Church according to the Teſtimony of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, puts every man in poſſeſſion of them. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſay the firſt <hi>Proteſtants, Prove all things, ſee if what we ſay againſt Pope &amp; Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be not true;</hi> and in caſe any difficulty did ariſe, they exhorted all to wait upon God, for the divine aid of his Spirit to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate

their underſtandings, that one ſhould not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the other, but commend them to God, be Brotherly, Patient, Long ſuffering, ready to help the Weak, inform the Ignorant, ſhew tenderneſs to the Miſtaken, and with reaſon and moderation to gain the Obſtinate. In ſhort, Proteſtancy <hi>is a reſtoring to every man his juſt right of Inquiry and Choice;</hi> and to its honour be it ever ſpoken, there is greater likelihood of finding Truth, where all have Liberty to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, then where it is denyed to all, but a few Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, and thoſe too as ſhort ſighted as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But now let us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> examine, if we have not departed from this Sobriety, this Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance? how comes it, that we who have been forgiven much, have our ſelves fallen upon our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servants, who yet owe us nothing? have not we refuſed them this reaſonable choice? have we not <hi>threatned, beaten</hi> and <hi>impriſoned</hi> them? Pray Conſider, have you not <hi>made Creeds, ſet Bounds</hi> to Faith, <hi>form'd</hi> and <hi>regulated</hi> a Worſhip and <hi>ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd</hi> all mens obedience by the help of the Civil Power upon pain of great Sufferings, which have not been ſpared to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> though in Common, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncers and Proteſtors with you againſt the Pope &amp; Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for this the Land mourns, Heaven is diſpleas'd, and all is out of due courſe.</p>

               <hi>To give us the Scriptures, and knock our Fingers for taking them! to Tranſlate them that we may read them, and puniſh us for endeavouring to underſtand and uſe them as well as we can, both with reſpect to God, and our Neighbour;</hi> 'tis very unreaſonable upon our <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Principles.

For if we will conſider it ſeriouſly, we ſhall find it not much more injurious to Scripture, Truth and good Conſcience that we believe as the Church believes, then that we believe as the Church ſays the Scripture would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For where is the difference, ſince I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to uſe my underſtanding about the Senſe of Scripture any more then about the Faith of the Church: and if I muſt not receive any thing for Faith or Worſhip from Scripture, but what is <hi>handed</hi> to me by the Church, or her Clergy, I ſee my ſelf in as ill terms, as if I had ſat down with the old Doctrine <hi>of believing as the Church believes.</hi> And had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie been only for the Word <hi>Scripture,</hi> without the uſe and application of it, (for at this rate that is all that is left us) truly the enterpriſe of our Fathers had been weak and unadviſed; but becauſe nothing leſs was intended by them, and that the Tranſlation of the Scripture was both the <hi>Appeal</hi> and <hi>Legacy</hi> of thoſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Anceſtors, for the reaſons before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, I muſt conclude we are much degenerated from the ſimplicity of Primitive Proteſtancy, and need to be admoniſht of our Backſlidings; and I heartily pray to Almighty God, that he would quicken us by his preſent Mercies and Providences to return to our firſt Love.</p>

            <p>I am now come to the laſt point, and that is PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAGATION of FAITH by FORCE.

            <p>That in this Proteſtant Country Laws have been made to proſecute men for their Difference and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the National Worſhip, and that thoſe Laws have been executed, I preſume will not be denyed; for not only our own Hiſtories ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will furniſh us with Inſtances, but our own Age abounds with Proofs. <hi>Thouſands have been Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and Impriſoned, whole Familes Undone, not a Bed left in the Houſe, not a Cow in the Field, nor any Corn in the Barn: Widows and Orphants Uncommiſerated, no regard had to Age or Sex:</hi> and what for? <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Meeting to Worſhip God after another</hi> (yet not a leſs Peaceable) <hi>Manner then according to the Way of the Church of</hi> England.</p>

Nor have they only ſuffered this by Laws intended againſt them, but after an exceſſive rate by <hi>Laws</hi> known to have been never deſign'd againſt them, and <hi>only intended againſt the Papiſts;</hi> and in theſe Caſes four times the Vallue has not ſerved their turn; we can prove 60 l. taken for 13 l. and not one Penny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, as we made appear before a <hi>Committee</hi> of the late Parliament, <hi>which is the Penalty of four Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for one:</hi> to ſay nothing of the groſs Abuſes that have been committed againſt our Names and Perſons by men of ill Fame and Life, that have taken the Advantage of our Tenderneſs, and the preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Law againſt us to have their Revengeful and Covetous Ends upon us.

Author, Promoter and Example of this Holy Way; ſo have I not only never taught my Diſciples to live or act otherwiſe, or given them a Power I refuſe to uſe my Self; but expreſly forbad them, and warn'd them in my Inſtructions, of exerciſing any the leaſt Revenge, Impoſition or Coertion towards any. This is evident in my Sermon preached upon the Mount, where I freely, publickly and with much Plainneſs, not only <hi>prohibited Revenge,</hi> but <hi>injoyned Love to Enemies,</hi> making it to be a great <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44, 45, 46, 47.</note> Token of true Diſcipleſhip to ſuffer Wrongs, and conquer Cruelty by Patience and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, which is certainly a great Way off Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Compulſion upon other Men.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when I was ſtrongly bent for <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> &amp; ſent Meſſengers before to prepare ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for me and my Company in a Village belonging to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and <note place="margin">Luke 9. 53, 54, 55, 56.</note> the People refuſed, becauſe they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I was going to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> though ſome of my Diſciples, particularly <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were provok'd to that Degree, that they asked me, if I were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that they ſhould command Fire from Heaven to deſtroy thoſe <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> in another Caſe had done; I turned about, and rebuked them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what Manner of Spirit ye are of; for am not come into the World to deſtroy Mens Lives, but</hi> by my peaceable Doctrine, Example and Life <hi>to ſave them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time one of my Diſciples, relating to me ſome Paſſages of their Travails, told me of a certain Man they ſaw, that caſt <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 49, 50.</note> out Devils in my Name, and becauſe he was not of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52323:106"/>
their Company, nor followed them, ſaid he, <hi>we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him;</hi> as if they had thereby ſerved and pleaſed me; but I preſently teſtified my Diſlike of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Narrowneſs of their Zeal, and to inform them better told them, they ſhould not have forbid him; <hi>for he that is not againſt us is for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Drift is not Opinion, but Piety; they that caſt out Devils, convert Sinners, and turn Men to Righteouſneſs, are not againſt me, nor the Nature and Religion of my Kingdom, &amp; therefore ought to be cheriſht rather then forbid. That I might ſufficiently declare and inculcate my Mind in this Matter, I did at another Time, and upon a different Occaſion, preach againſt all Coertion and Perſecution for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith and Practice towards God, in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sower, as my Words manifeſt, which were theſe; <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Man which ſowed good Seed in his Field; but while Men ſlept, his Enemy came, and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, and went his Way; but when the Blade ſprung up, and brought forth Fruit, there appeared the Tares alſo; ſo the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Houſhoulder came and ſaid, didſt thou not ſow good Seed in thy Field? from whence then hath it Tares? he anſwered, an Enemy hath done</hi>

And that I might ſufficiently deter my Followers from any ſuch Thing, as I profeſs my ſelf to be their Lord and Maſter, ſo have I commanded them to love one another in a more eſpecial Manner. But if inſtead thereof any ſhall <note place="margin">John 15. 12.</note> grow proud, high-minded, and beat or abuſe their Fellow-Servants in my Religious Family, when I come to take an account of my Houſhold, he ſhall be cut aſunder, and appointed his Portion among the Unbelievers.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52323:107"/>
to Impoſing Lordly Perſons, ſuch as count others In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and to make them ſuch Believers as themſelves, will exerciſe Violence towards them, and if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not, will call for <hi>fire</hi> from Heaven to devour them, and if Heaven refuſe them, will fall a Beating and Killing (and think, it may be, they do God good Service) but their Lot ſhall be with Unbelievers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Nay, I have ſo effectually provided againſt all Maſtery, that I expreſly charged them, <hi>not to be many Maſters; for one was their Maſter:</hi> I told them, that <hi>the greateſt amongſt them was to be Servant to the reſt,</hi> not to impoſe upon the reſt; nay, that to be great in my Kingdom, they muſt become as gentle and harmleſs as little Children, and ſuch cannot force and puniſh in Matters of Religion. In fine, I ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded them to love one another, as I have loved them, who am ready to lay down my Life for the Ungodly, inſtead of taking away Godly Men's Lives for Opinions; and this is the great Maxim of my holy Religion, <hi>He that would be my Diſciple, muſt</hi> not crucifie other Men, but <hi>take up his Croſs and follow me, who am meek and lowly,</hi> and ſuch ſo enduring ſhall find Eternal Reſt to their Souls; this is the Power I uſe, and this is the Power I give.</p>
            <p>How much this agrees with the Language, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Example of Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall leave them to conſider, that read and believe Scripture; but ſome affected to preſent Church Power, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring their Ruin that conform not to her Worſhip and Diſcipline, will object, <hi>That Chriſt did give his

Church Power to bind and looſe, and bid any Perſon agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved tell the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant it; but what binding was that? with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chains and Fetters, in naſty Holes and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons? nothing leſs: Or was it, that his Church had that true Diſcerning in her, and Power with him, that what ſhe bound, that is condemned, or looſed, that is remitted, ſhould ſtand ſo in God's Sight and Chriſt's Account.</p>
            <p>But tell the Church; and what then? obſerve Chriſt's Extent in the Puniſhment of the Offender, <hi>If the Offender will neither receive private Admonition, nor hear the Church, then</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>let him be to thee as an</hi> Heathen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here's not one word of <hi>Fines, Whips, Stocks, Pillories, Goals,</hi> and the like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cruelty, to puniſh the Heretick; for the Purport of his Words ſeem to be no more than this; If any Member of the Church refuſe thy private Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and the Church's Admonition, look upon ſuch a Perſon to be obſtinate, perverſe, no more of you; let him take his courſe, thou haſt done well, and the Church is clear of him.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſay the <hi>Church Fighters</hi> of our Age, <hi>Did not</hi> St. Paul <hi>wiſh them cut off that troubled the Church in his time?</hi> Yes: But with what Sword think you? Such as Chriſt bid <hi>Peter</hi> put up, or the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God?

And with Men of any Tenderneſs or common Senſe, their continual great Sufferings in Priſon and Eſtate, and their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under them, are a Demonſtration, or there can he none in the World.</p>
            <p>Nor can their Perſecutors diſprove them, unleſs they could ſearch Hearts, and that is a little too far for a Fallible Spirit to reach, and an Infallible One they deny.

            <p>But was this the Evangelical Rule and Practice? Yes, that it was; Oh then whence comes Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Force, Cruelty, Spoil of Goods, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Knockings, Beatings, Bruiſings, Stockings, Whippings, and Spilling of Blood for Religion? What Church is that, whoſe Officers are ſo far from clothing the Naked, as that they ſtrip the Clothed; from feeding the Hungry, that they take their Bread from them, and thoſe poor Widows and helpleſs Orphans too; and ſo remote from viſiting the Sick and Impriſoned, that they drag away their Beds from

Nay, they haled away an Honeſt Man from a Meeting to Goal at <hi>Reading,</hi> (a while ſince) not permitting him to TAKE LEAVE of his poor Wife, newly delivered, and in a DYING Condition, though ſhe much deſired it, and liv'd but juſt by the Meeting houſe whence they took him. In fine, what are they that for no other Cauſe paſs ſuch <hi>Dreadful Excommunications,</hi> as render the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicants little better then <hi>Outlawed</hi> Perſons, <hi>ſubjecting</hi> their <hi>Civil</hi> &amp; <hi>Natural Rights</hi> to their Pride, Paſſion, Intereſt or Revenge, unleſs they will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their Enjoyment at the dear rate of giving their own Conſciences the Lye?

For it ſuppoſes that nothing is Truer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Perfecter, or elſe they both perſecute Men to embrace a Fallible, and Inperfect Religion, and with cruel Penalties provide againſt any thing more true or Infallible, and the greateſt Injury to the World that can be: for it is a plain Endeavour to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all thoſe excellent Prophecies and gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes God has given, and the holy Scriptures declare of the latter Days. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> It expoſes you to the laſh and ſcorn of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> unavoidably; for at this rate you, that with reaſon think it Ignorance and Irreligion in the <hi>Papiſt</hi> to imagin himſelf diſcharged in God's account, by believing only as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, conceive your ſelves at the ſame time juſtified by believeing only as a <hi>few of your own Doctors,</hi> or elſe as the <hi>State</hi> believes. But if the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe force in Religion, for this reaſon, becauſe ſhe cannot Infallibly determin to the Conſcience without convincement, much leſs can a few Doctors or the Civil Authority uſe force where they can much leſs judge.

This is hard, but true upon the <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> for what is plainer then that he afflicts <hi>Thoſe</hi> that according to his own Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and honour holy Scripture, but againſt it will receive no humane Interpretation though Univerſal? <hi>Them,</hi> I ſay, who interpret Scripture to themſelves, <hi>which by his Poſition none but they to themſelves can Inter-pret; Them,</hi> that uſe the Scripture no otherwiſe, by his own Doctrine, to their Edification, than he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf uſes it to their puniſhing, and ſo whom his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine acknowledges true Believers, his Diſcipline perſecutes as Hereticks.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all at this time; If we muſt believe as <hi>Caeſar</hi> appoints, why not then as the Church believes? But if not as either <hi>without Convincement,</hi> pray how can force be lawful?

For our own <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> can only <hi>direct</hi> the hand that ſeeks to Stab us; and ſhall we make it ſuccesful to our own ruin? <hi>Let us therefore turn away from all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; let the Magiſtracy diſcourage and puniſh it; and let us forhear, and love one another.</hi> If we begin with God, we ſhall end with God, that is, <hi>with Succeſs;</hi> Elſe be aſſured, we ſhall only inherit the Wind of our own Invention, and be deſerted of him, then, when we ſhall moſt want him.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, reverence the preſent providence; though your Lives have not deſerv'd it, let your Lives now be grateful, and not abuſe it. Purſue your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages throughly, but wiſely; be as temperate as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,

This will be the greateſt coufutation upon them, that they be taught the Goodneſs of your Religion by the mildneſs of it, and by its mercy, the Cruelty of their own. The Indian <hi>Atabaliba</hi> rejected the <hi>Romiſh Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Spaniſh Tyranny,</hi> whence it was uſual with thoſe poor <hi>Americans,</hi> to deſire they might not go to <hi>Heaven</hi> if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went thither. I know there be little Arts uſed to prevent <hi>Proteſtant Union,</hi> and that in a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Guiſe; and 'tis a <hi>Trick,</hi> not of yeſterday, to put one Party of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring four or five, that both the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church may have the Odium of <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>Devouring</hi> her own <hi>Children, &amp; that another Intereſt behind the Hangings</hi> may find the more eaſie and creditable acceſs to the Chair: 'Tis the Men of this Strain, though under diſguiſe, that now ſeek to diſtract you, and to effect it the better, old Stories muſt be had up, <hi>Acts of Olivion violated, the dead diſturb'd, their Tombs rifl'd and they hal'd out of their Graves to receive a new Sentence;</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Living</hi> of that intereſt by the <hi>Dead,</hi> they might be deſerted of thoſe, that to ſay we cannot be ſafe without them.</p>

as theſe are devoid of natural Affection, their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has no Bowels, or they are without Mercy in the Profeſſion of it; which is the quite contrary to true Religion, that <hi>makes us love Enemies, do good to them that hate us, and kindly entreat thoſe that deſpightfully uſe us:</hi> and ſo much ſtronger, in Souls truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is the power of Love to Mankind then any Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenging Paſſion, that from an humble and ſerious reflection upon the Mercies and Goodneſs of God to them, they do not only ſuppreſs any riſing of Heart againſt their Perſecutors (much more againſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diſſenters) but with much ſoftneſs &amp; charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate their Ignorance and Fury; offering to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, and praying that they may be forgiven. This is to be Religious, and therefore thoſe that Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute for Religion are <hi>Irreligious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> The next Cauſe of Perſecution, is the groſs but general Miſtake which People are under concerning the Nature of the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, for the lamentable Worldlineſs of mens minds hath put them upon thoſe Carnal Conſtructions, which have made way for all the external Coertion and Violence uſed by bad, and ſuffer'd by good Men on the ſcore of Religion from the beginning. And no wonder if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſons tumble upon this Conſtruction, when the Diſciples of Jeſus ſhew'd themſelves ſo ill read in the Myſteries of his Kingdom, that after all the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy they had had with him, they reſrain'd not to ask, <hi>When ſhall the Kingdom be reſtored to</hi> Iſrael. They look't abroad, had a Worldly <hi>Idea</hi> in their minds; <hi>Jew</hi> like they waited for external Deliverance from
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52323:119"/>
the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> rather then an Internal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the Dominion of <hi>Satan,</hi> and interpreted that to Worldly loſs and freedom, which did relate to the loſs and Redemption of the Soul; but Jeſus taught them better things; yet ſo, as not to deny or flatly diſcourage and rebuke them; that (though true) might have been more then they could have bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> therefore he winds off with them upon the <hi>Time</hi> and the <hi>Seaſon</hi> of the thing, knowing that the Time was at hand, that they ſhould be better taught and ſatisfied of the nature of his Kingdom, unto which he referred them. <hi>When the Spirit</hi>

               <hi>of Truth comes, it ſhall lead you into all Truth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this World, has been before obſerved, and the Reaſon is ſo great, that all men of common Senſe muſt allow it upon Chriſt's Principle; for ſays he, <hi>then would my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight for me;</hi> truly implying, that becauſe the Kingdoms of this World are evidently ſet up and maintained by Worldly Force, and that he will have no Worldly Force uſed in the Buſineſs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, therefore it is not of this World. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, thoſe that attempt to ſet up his Kingdom by Worldly Force, or make that their Pretence to uſe it, are none of his Servants; they are truly but Men of this World; ſuch as ſeek an Earthly, and not an Heavenly Kingdom; themſelves, and not Chriſt Jeſus. Where by the way let me obſerve, That though the <hi>Jews,</hi> to engage <hi>Pilate</hi> the more eaſily to their ſide, impeach't <hi>Chriſt</hi> of being an E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e my to <hi>Caſar,</hi> they were Enemies, and <hi>He a Friend</hi> to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52323:120"/>
               <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for he came to reform the Lives of Men, to make them better Subjects, to obey <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not for Fear, but for <hi>Conſcience ſake</hi> (ſo would <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinec have been eaſie and ſafe.) But the <hi>Jews</hi> would have had him <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Enemy, one that ſhould have <hi>forcibly reſcued them from</hi> Caeſar's <hi>Power; they waited for a Captain General to begin the Revolt, and with an high Hand to over bear and captive</hi> Caeſar, <hi>as he had done them:</hi> and 'tis more than probable, that his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being to another End, they therefore rejected him, their Heart being ſet upon this.</p>
            <p>But to return; Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>that he had choſen them out of the World;</hi> how? not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or live bodily in it? no ſuch matter: but he had choſen or <hi>ſingled them from the Nature, Spirit, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Policy and Pomp of this World.</hi> How Perſons ſo qualified can make a Worldly Church or Kingdom, unleſs they deſert Chriſt's Doctrine, is paſt my Skill to tell. So that the Capacity that Chriſtians ſtand in to Chriſt is Spiritual, and not Worldly or Carnal; and therefore not Carnal or Worldly, but Spiritual Methods and Weapons only are to be uſed to inform or reclaim ſuch as are Ignorant or Diſobedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ent. And if we will give Antient Story credit, we ſhall find that Worldly Weapons were never employed by the Chriſtian Church till the became <hi>Worldly</hi> and ſo ceaſt to be truly Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I ſay the Church (the moſt abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed word in the World) her Leaders have taught her to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and that of <hi>believing as the Church believes</hi> is ſo far from being true in point of Faith as well as Reaſon, <hi>that the Church her ſelf his ever believed as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52323:120"/>
the Clergy</hi> (that is, the <hi>Prieſts) believed, ſince that ſort of Men have practiſed Diſtinction from and Superiority upon the Laity.</hi> He that will peruſe the Eccleſiaſtical Story delivered us by <hi>Euſebius Pamphili, Secrates Scholaſticns, Evagrius, Ruffinus, Sozomen, &amp;c.</hi> will find but too many and ſad Inſtances of the Truth of this.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; Peoples apprehending the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt to be Viſible and Worldly, like other Societies and Government, have thought it not only to be Lawful but Neceſſary to uſe the Arts and Force of this World to ſupport that Church and Kingdom, eſpecially ſince this Intereſt of Religion hath been <hi>embodied</hi> with that of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> for from that time he hath been made <hi>Cuſtos utriuſ<expan>

Whereas had <hi>Chriſtians</hi> remain'd in their primitive Simplicity and Purity, in the Self-denying, Patient and Suffering Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Chriſtianity had ſtood in Holy Living, not in World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regiment; and its Compulſion would have been Love; its Arms, Reaſon and Truth; and its utmoſt Rigour, even to obſtinate Enemies or Apoſtates, but Renouncing of their Communion, and that not till much Forbearance had been uſed to them.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all; The Kingdoms of this World, ſtand in outward Bodily and Civil Matters, and here, the Laws and Power of Men reich and are effectual. But the Kingdom and Church of Chriſt, that is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the World, ſtands not in Bodily Exerciſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52323:121"/>
(which the Apoſtle ſays profits little) nor in Times nor Places, but in Faith and that Worſhip which Chriſt tells us is in Spirit and in Truth; to this no Worldly Compulſion can bring or force men, 'tis only the Power of that King of Righteouſneſs, whoſe Kingdom is in the Minds and Souls of the Juſt, and he rules by the Law of his own free Spirit, which like the Wind, <hi>Bloweth where it liſteth:</hi> And as without this Spirit of Regeneration no man can be made a Member of Chriſts Church or Kingdom, ſo neither is it in the Power of Man to command or give it, and conſequently all Worldly force employ'd to make men Members of Chriſts Church and Kingdom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ineffectual. I could be very large upon this point, for 'tis very fruitful, and ſo much the cauſe of Perſecution, that if there were never another to be aſſign'd, this were enough; for upon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it muſt needs meet with every mans Judgment and Experience.

               <q>When our Saviour in the <hi>Acts</hi> after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was Diſcourſing to his Diſciples concerning the Kingdom of God, they preſently brake forth into this <note place="margin">J.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The firſt Head wherein the Difference is ſeen, are the Perſons and <hi>Subjects</hi> of this Kingdom: For as the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt is not of this World,</hi> ſo the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52323:122"/>
of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> are <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>another World,</hi> and not of this. Every one of us bears a double Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and accordingly is the <hi>Subject</hi> of a double King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The Holy Ghoſt by the Pſalmiſt divides Heaven and Earth betwixt God and Man, and tells us, as for God, <hi>He is in Heaven, but the Earth has he given to the Children of Men:</hi> So hath the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> divided every one of our Perſons into Heaven and Earth, into an outward and <hi>earthly</hi> Man, and into an inward and <hi>heavenly</hi> Man: This <hi>Earth,</hi> that is, this <hi>Body</hi> of Clay hath he given to the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> to the <hi>Princes</hi> under whoſe Government we live; but <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is, the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Man,</hi> hath he reſerved unto <hi>himſelf:</hi> They can reſtrain the <hi>outward Man,</hi> and moderate our <hi>outward Actions</hi> by <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> they can tye our <hi>Hands</hi> and our <hi>Tongues;—Illa ſe jactat in aula Aeolus:</hi> Thus far they can go, and when they are gone thus far, they can go no farther: But to rule the <hi>inward Man</hi> in our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> to ſet up an Imperial Throne in our Underſtandings and Wills, this part of our Government belongs to <hi>God</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Theſe are the Subjects, this the Government of his Kingdom; Men may be Kings of Earth and Bodies, but Chriſt alone is the King of Spirits and Souls. Yet this <hi>inward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath influence upon our <hi>outward Actions;</hi> For the Authority of Kings over our outward Man is not ſo abſolute, but that it ſuffers a great Reſtraint; it muſt ſtretch no farther then the Prince of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man pleaſes: for if ſecular Princes ſtretch out
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52323:123"/>
the Skirts of their Authority to command ought by which our Souls are prejudiced the King of Souls hath in this caſe given us a greater Command, <hi>That we rather Obey God then Men.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>3dly, A third great Cauſe of Perſecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is this, <hi>that men make too many things neceſſary to be believed to Salvation and Communion. Perſecution</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with <hi>Creed making;</hi> for it ſo falls out, that thoſe who diſtinguiſh the Tree in the bulk, cannot with the like eaſe diſcern every Branch or Leaf that grows upon it; and to run out the neceſſary Articles of Faith to every good or true thing that the Wit of Man may deduce from the Text, and ſo too, as that I ought to have a diſtinct <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and muſt run them over in my mind as a Child would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on a Leſſon by Heart, and that as the Creed of which I muſt not miſs a tittle upon my Salvation; this I think to be a Temptation upon men to fall into Diſpute and Controverſie, and then we are taught, by long Experience, that he that has moſt Power, will oppreſs his Opinion that is weaker, whence comes Perſecution; this puts Unity &amp; Peace too much upon the Hazard. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Choice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not of many things, <hi>but the one thing neceſſary,</hi> as Chriſt terms it, the Lord <note place="margin">Luke 10. 42.</note> of the true Divinity; and pray what was this one needful thing, <hi>but Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, and her Faith, Love and Obedience in and to him:</hi> here is no perplext Creed to ſubſcribe, no <hi>Syſthime</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> to charge the Head with, this <hi>One Needful thing</hi> was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52323:123"/>
               <hi>Mary's</hi> Choice &amp; Bleſſing; may it be ours, and I ſhould hope a quick End to Controverſies, and conſequently to Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> Another Cauſe of Perſecution, is <hi>The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Education, and that Byaſs Tradition gives to thoſe men, who have not made their Religion the Religion of their Judgment:</hi> For ſuch will forbid all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, which might queſtion the Weakneſs or Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Religion, and had rather be deceiv'd in an honorable Decent, then be ſo uncivil to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Anceſtors, as to ſeek the Truth which ſound muſt reprove the Ignorance of their Ages; of this (the vaineſt of all Honours) they are extream careful, and at the very mention of any thing, to them new (though as old as Truth, and older then this World) are eaſily urg'd into a Tempeſt, and are not appeaſed but by a Sacrifice. This Ignorance and want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry helps on Perſecution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> Another Reaſon and that no ſmall one, is <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Impatiency of Men under contradiction,</hi> be it out of Ignorance, that they are angry with what they cannot refuſe, or out of private Intereſt, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; their Opinion muſt reign alone, they are tenacious of their own ſenſe and can't indure to have it queſtion'd, be there never ſo much reaſon for it; Men of theſe Paſſions are yet to learn they are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Religion, by the want they have of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſuch Perſons can eaſily let go their hold on Charity, to lay Violent hands upon their Oppoſers; if they have power, they rarely fail to uſe it ſo; not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52323:124"/>
remembring, that when they abſolv'd themſelves from the tye of Love, Meekneſs and Patience, they have abandon'd true Religion, and contend not for the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints, (which ſtood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) but for meer Words.</p>
            <p>It is here proud Fleſh and a capricious Head that diſputes for Religion, and not an humble Heart, and a divine frame of Spirit. <hi>Men that are angry for God, Paſſionate for Chriſt, that call Names for Religion, and fling Stones and Perſecute for Faith,</hi> may tell us they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch by their Fruits, to be ſure they are no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Chriſt's making.</p>
            <p>I would to God that the Diſputants of our time did but coolly weigh the Irreligiouſneſs of their own <hi>Heats</hi> for Religion, and ſee if what they contend for will quit the Coſt, will countervail the Charge of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Charity and making a Sacrifice of Peace to gain their point; upon ſo ſeaſonable a reflection I am confident they would find that they rather ſhow their love to Opinion then Truth, and ſeek Victory more then Concord.</p>
            <p>Could men be contented as he, whom they call their Lord, was, <hi>to declare their Meſſage, and not ſtrive for Proſelites, nor vex for Conqueſt,</hi> they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend all to the Conſcience, and if it muſt be ſo, patiently endure Contradiction too, and ſo lay their Religion, as he did his, not in Violence but Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But I muſt freely profeſs, and in duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I do it, that I cannot call that Religion, which is introduced againſt the Laws of Love, Meekneſs &amp; Friendſhip: Superſtition, Intereſt or Faction I may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52323:124"/>
There is a Zeal without Knowledge, that is <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;</hi> there is a Zeal againſt Knowledge, that is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> (the true <hi>Hereſie;)</hi> there is a Zeal with Knowledge, that is <hi>Religion;</hi> therefore blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be ſuperſtition, it can't be Religion: and if you will view the Countries of Cruelty, you ſhall find them Superſtitious rather then Religious. Religion is gentile, it makes men better, more Friendly, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Patient then before. And the ſucceſs, which followed <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> whilſt the antient Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it betook themſelves to no other defence, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves both the force of thoſe paſſive Arguments above all corporal Puniſhments, &amp; that we muſt never hope for the ſame Proſperity <hi>till we fall into the ſame Methods.</hi> Are men impatient of having their conceits own'd? they are then moſt to be ſuſpected. Error and Superſtition, like crackt Titles, <hi>only fear to be toucht, and run for Authority and number.</hi> Truth is plain and ſtedfaſt, without Arts or Tricks, will you receive her, well: if not, there is no compulſion. But pray tell me, what is that deſired Uniformity that has not Unity? and that Unity, which has not Love, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience in it? I beſeech you hear me, for thoſe men depart from the Spirit of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that ſeek with Anger and Frowardneſs to promote it. Let us not put ſo miſerable a Cheat upon our ſelves, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as to think, <hi>That a moſt gentle and patient Religion can be advanc'd by moſt ungentle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Ways.</hi> I ſhould ſooner ſubmit to an humble op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition then to the greateſt Zealot in the World, and ſooner deliver my ſelf up to him that would modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drop a controverted Truth, then to ſuch as ſeek
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52323:125"/>
tempeſtuouſly to carry it; for even Error, baſhfully and patiently defended endangers Truth in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of impudent &amp; haſty Zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gives to it that Lnſtre which only good Eyes can ſee from Gold. Alas! 'tis for want of Conſidering, that men don't ſee, that to diſorder the mind in Controverſie is a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief then to carry the point can be a benefit; in that it is not to be Religious to apprehend rightly, but to do well; the latter can ſcarcely be without the former, but the former often is without the latter, which brings me to my ſixth Cauſe of Perſecution.</p>

               <hi>6 hly,</hi> Another, and that no ſmall cauſe of <hi>Perſecution</hi> is a miſapprehenſion of the word <hi>Religion.</hi> For when once the Ignorance or Prejudice of men has perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to lay more weight upon their own <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſent</hi> of their Neighbours then in truth the thing will bear, to excuſe their Zeal or juſtifie their Spleen, they preſently heighten the difference to a <hi>new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> whence we ſo frequently hear of ſuch reflections as theſe, <hi>new Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Faiths, upſtart Religions and Lights,</hi> and with the like <hi>Scare-crows</hi> amuſe the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and render their own deſign of ruining honeſt men the more practicable. But I would obviate this miſchief; for a <hi>new Religion</hi> has a <hi>new Foundation,</hi> and Conſequently where there is the <hi>ſame Foundation,</hi> there cannot be a <hi>new Religion.</hi> Now the Foundation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that only is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Religion then the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which profeſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Foundation, or corruptly adds to that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by adding other Mediators, and introducing a new way of Remiſſion of Sin: Which cannot be ſaid
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52323:125"/>
of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> therefore for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> to reproach each other with <hi>new Religions and Goſpels,</hi> and by their Indecent and Unchriſtian beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to enſlave their own Reckoning, and draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more diſcord, is a Sin againſt God, an Injury to the common Cauſe of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and to the Security of the Civil Intereſt of that Country where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are of that Religion, as well as a real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to one another; for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> don't only agree in the <hi>ſame Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> too, that is, in the reaſons of Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> which indeed is <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Let not every circumſtantial difference or Variety of <hi>Cult</hi> be <hi>Nick-named a new Religion,</hi> neither ſuffer ſo ill an uſe to be made of ſuch Diſſents as to carry them beyond their true bounds; for the meaning of thoſe Arts of ill men, is to ſet the People further off from one another then they really are; and to aggrevate Differences in Judgment, to Contrariety in affection, and when they have once inflam'd them to Variance and Strife, nothing can hinder Perſecution but want of Power, which being never wanted by the ſtrongeſt ſide, the weakeſt though trueſt, is oppreſt, not by <hi>Argument,</hi> but <hi>Worldly Weapons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Cauſe I ſhall now aſſign for Perſecution is this, <hi>That Holy living is become no teſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, unleſs againſt the liver.</hi> The Tree was once known by its Fruits, 'tis not ſo now; the better Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the more dangerous, <hi>if not a Conformiſt:</hi> this has made way for Perſecution. There was a time,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52323:126"/>
when Virtue was Venerable and good Men admired, that's derided, and Opinion carries it.</p>
            <p>He that can perſwade his Conſcience to comply with the times, <hi>be he Vitious, Knaviſh, Cowardly, any thing;</hi> he is protected, perhaps preferr'd. A Man of Wiſdom, Sobriety and Ability to ſerve his King and Country, <hi>if a Diſſenter,</hi> muſt be blown upon for a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> a man of Faction, of diſloyal Principles, and what not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rewards and Puniſhments are the Magiſtrates duty and the Governments intereſt and ſupport.</hi> Rewards are due to Virtue, Puniſhments to Vice. Let us not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake nor miſcall things; let Virtue be what it al. wayes was in Government, <hi>good Manners, ſober Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> and Vice, <hi>ill Manners and ill Living.</hi> Reduce all to this: let <hi>ſuch good Men have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>miles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſuch ill Men the Frowns and Puniſhments of the Government;</hi> this ends Perſecution, and lays O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to ſleep. Ill men will make no more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by <hi>ſuch</hi> Conformity, nor good men no more ſuffer for want of it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, As that Religious Society deſerves not the Protection of the Civil, which is inconſiſtent with the Safety of it; ſo thoſe Societies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that are not only not Deſtructive of the Civil Government, but Lovers of it, ought by the Civil Government to be ſecured from Ruin.</p>
            <p>God Almighty open our Underſtandings, &amp; pour out the Spirit of thorow Reformation upon us, that we may be all Conſcientiouſly Diſpos'd to ſeek and
