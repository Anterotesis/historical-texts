            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

1. Mens harts are full of euill,</hi>
there's the <hi>Comma. 2. Madnesse
is in their hearts whiles they liue:</hi>
there's the <hi>Colon.</hi> 3. whereat not staying, <hi>after that they

Here is <hi>Mans</hi> setting forth, his peregrination, and
his iourneyes end. 1. At first putting out, <hi>His heart is
full of euill. 2. Madnesse is in his heart,</hi> all his peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>whiles they liue.</hi> 3. His <hi>iourneyes</hi> end, is the <hi>Graue, He
goes to the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Man</hi> is borne from the wombe, as an arrow
shotte from the Bow. 2. His flight through this ayre, is
wilde, and full of <hi>madnesse;</hi> of indirect courses. 3. The
<hi>Center,</hi> where he lights, is the <hi>Graue.</hi>

               <p>First, his <hi>Comma</hi> beginnes so harshly, that it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
no good consequence in the <hi>Colon.</hi> 2. The <hi>Colon</hi> is
so madde and inordinate, that there is smal hope of the

                     <hi>Behold,</hi> sayth
<hi>Dauid, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sinne did my mother
conceiue me.</hi> The originall word is, <hi>warme me:</hi> as if the

owne likenesse, after his image, and called his name Seth.</hi>
This <hi>image</hi> and <hi>likenesse</hi> cannot bee vnderstood of the
Soule: for this <hi>Adam</hi> begate not. Nor properly and
meerely of the <hi>Bodies</hi> shape; so was <hi>Cain</hi> as like to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
as <hi>Seth,</hi> of whom it is spoken. Nor did that <hi>image</hi>
consist in the <hi>piety</hi> and purity of <hi>Seth: Adam</hi> could not
propagate that to his <hi>sonne,</hi> which hee had not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
vertues are not giuen by birth, nor doth <hi>grace</hi>
follow generation, but regeneration. Neyther is <hi>Seth</hi>
said to bee <hi>begotten in the Image of Adam,</hi> because man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was continued and preserued in him. But it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
that <hi>corruption,</hi> which descended to <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
by naturall propagation. The <hi>Pelagian</hi> error
was, <hi>Peccatum primae transgressionis in alios homines, non
propagatione, sed imitatione transisse:</hi> that the guilt of
the first <hi>sinne</hi> was deriued to other men, not by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
but by imitation: but then could not <hi>Adam</hi> be
said, to <hi>begette</hi> a <hi>sonne in his owne image:</hi> neyther could
<hi>Death</hi> haue seazed on <hi>Infants,</hi> who had not then sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But all haue sinned, Rom. 5.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note>

                  <p>This title then, <hi>the sonnes of men,</hi> puts vs in mind of

they that brought vs into the world, haue gone out of

Ier. 31. 29.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 2.</note> As if we might say to euery <hi>sonne of man,</hi> as

                  <p>I answere, <hi>Adam</hi> is considered as the roote of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:

<hi>world:</hi> by a <hi>profest,</hi> the <hi>Deuill.</hi> Euery perpetrated sinne
doth some hurt to the walls; but if the <hi>Heart</hi> be taken,
the whole <hi>Corporation</hi> is lost.</p>
                  <p>How should <hi>Christ enter</hi> thy house, and <hi>suppe with
thee,</hi> when the Chamber is taken vp, wherein he would
rest,<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 20</note> the <hi>Heart?</hi> All the faculties of <hi>Man</hi> follow the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:518:9"/>
                     <hi>Heart,</hi> as seruants the Mistresse, wheeles the poyse, or
linkes the first end of the chaine. When the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
all rise; beasts from their dennes, birds from their
nests, men from their beds. So the <hi>Heart</hi> leads, directs,
moues the parts of the body, and powers of the soule:
that the mouth speaketh, hand worketh, eye looketh,
eare listneth, foote walketh; all producing good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
<hi>from the good or euil treasure of the heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6. 45.</note> Therfore the
penitent <hi>Publican</hi> beat his <hi>Heart,</hi> as if he would cal vp

                  <p>It is conspicuous then, that the <hi>heart</hi> is the best <hi>vessel,</hi>
whereof any <hi>sonne of man</hi> can boast himselfe possessour:
and yet (<hi>prohdolor!</hi>) euen this is corrupted. To declare
this pollution, the next circumstance doth iustly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge:
onely one caueat to our hearts, of our <hi>Hearts,</hi>
ere we leaue them. Since the <hi>Heart</hi> is the most precious
<hi>vessell,</hi> man hath in all his corporall housholde, let him
haue good regard to it. <hi>Omni custodia custodi cor tuum:
Keepe thy heart with all diligence,</hi> sayth <hi>Solomon.</hi> GOD
hath done much for the <hi>Heart, naturally, spiritually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the former; He hath placed it in the middest of
the <hi>body,</hi> as a Generall in the midst of his Army: bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warck'd
it about with brest, ribbes, backe. Lest it
should bee too cold, the liuer lies not farre off, to giue
it kindly heate: lest too hote, the lungs lye by it, to
blow coole winde vpon it. It is the chiefe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should wisely temper all other members: by the
<hi>spleene</hi> we are moued to laugh; by the <hi>gall</hi> to be angry:
by the <hi>braine</hi> wee feele, by the <hi>liuer</hi> we loue, but by the
<hi>heart</hi> we be wise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spiritually,</hi> hee hath done more for the <hi>heart,</hi> giuing
the <hi>bloud</hi> of his <hi>Sonne</hi> to clense it, soften it, sanctifie it,
when it was full, both of hardnesse and turpitude. By
his omnipotent grace hee vnroosted the Deuill from
it, who had made it a stable of vncleannesse: and
now requires it (being created <hi>new</hi>) for his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:518:10"/>
for his owne bed. The purified <hi>heart</hi> is Gods Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crary,
his Sanctuary, his House, his Heauen. As Saint
<hi>August.</hi> glosseth the first words of the <hi>Pater noster. Our
Father which art in heauen, that is, in a heart of an heauenly
disposition. Quàmpropitia dignatio ista,</hi> that the King of
Heauen will vouchsafe to dwell in an earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle!</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> then being so accepted a <hi>vessell,</hi> keepe it
at home: hauing but one so precious supellectile or
moueable, part not with it vpon any termes. There are
foure busie requirers of the <hi>Heart,</hi> besides he that iustly
oweth it. <hi>Beggars, Buyers, Borrowers, Theeues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 He that <hi>begges</hi> thy <hi>Hart,</hi> is the <hi>Pope:</hi> and this hee

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
condemnations rather, his <hi>Seminary</hi> factors.
He begs thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and offers thee nothing for it, but
crucifixes, images, &amp;c. meere images or shadowes of
reward: or his blessing at <hi>Rome;</hi> which, because it is so
farre distant, as if it lost all the vertue by the way, doth
as much good, as a candle in Sunshine.</p>
                  <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that would <hi>buy</hi> this <hi>vessell</hi> of vs, is the Deuill;
as one that distrusts to haue it for nothing: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>3 The <hi>Flesh</hi> is the <hi>Borrower,</hi> and hee would haue this
<hi>vessell</hi> to vse, with promise of restoring. Let him haue
it a while, and thou shalt haue it againe; but as from

that though it went forth rich, like the <hi>Prodigall,</hi> it

Thou wouldest not lend thy beast, nor the worst ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

                  <p>4. The <hi>World</hi> is the <hi>Theefe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 6.</note> which (like <hi>Absolon) steales

                  <p>2 It makes no noyse in comming, lest the family of
our reuiued thoughts wake, and our sober knowledge
discerne his approch. This <hi>theefe</hi> takes vs, as it tooke
<hi>Demas,</hi> napping: terrifies vs not with noyse of tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:518:11"/>
troubles, and alarum of persecutions; but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
giues vs the musicke of gaine, and lappes vs
warme in the couch of lusts. This is the most peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
oppugner of our <hi>hearts:</hi> neyther <hi>begger, buyer,</hi> nor
<hi>borrower</hi> could doe much without this <hi>theefe.</hi> It is some
respect to the world, that makes men eyther giue or
sell, or lend the <hi>vessell</hi> of their <hi>heart. Astus pollentior ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis:</hi>
Fraud is more dangerous then force. Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
this <hi>theefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, turne the <hi>begger</hi> from thy dore, hee is too saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in asking thy best moueable, wheras beggers shuld
not chuse their almes. That <hi>Pope</hi> was yet a little
more reasonable, that shewed himselfe content with a
King of <hi>Spaines</hi> remuneration; <hi>The present you sent mee
was such, as became a King to giue, and</hi> S. <hi>Peter to receyue:</hi>
But <hi>da pauperibus:</hi> the <hi>Pope is</hi> rich enough.</p>
                  <p>Then reiect the <hi>buyer:</hi> set him no price of thy <hi>heart,</hi>
for he wil take it of any reckoning. He is neere driuen,
that sels his <hi>heart.</hi> I haue heard of a Iew that would
for security of his lent money, haue onely assur'd to
him a pound of his Christian debters liuing flesh: a
strange forfeit, for default of paying a little money. But
the Deuill, in all his couenants, indents for the <hi>heart.</hi>
In other bargaines, <hi>caueat emptor,</hi> sayth the Prouerbe:
Let the buyer take heed: in this, let the seller looke
to it. Make no marte nor market with Sathan.</p>
                  <p>Non benè pro multo libertas venditur auro.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>heart</hi> is ill solde, what euer the price be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the <hi>borrower:</hi> Lend not thy <hi>heart</hi> in hope
of interest, lest thou lose the principall. Lend him not
any implement in thy house, any affection in thy heart:
but to spare the best <hi>vessell</hi> to such an abuser, is no lesse
then mad charity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, ware the <hi>theefe:</hi> and let his subtilty excite thy
more prouident preuention. Many a man keepes his
goods safe enough from <hi>beggers, buyers, borrowers,</hi> yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:518:11"/>
is met withall by <hi>theeues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore locke vp this <hi>vessell</hi> with the Key of faith,
barre it with resolution against sinne, guard it with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisiting
diligence, and repose it in the bosom of thy
Sauiour. There it is safe from all obsidious, or insidious
oppugnations: from the reach of fraud or violence. Let
it not stray from this home, lest like <hi>Dinah</hi> it be deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
If wee keepe this vessell our selues, wee indanger
the losse. <hi>Iacob</hi> bought <hi>Esau's</hi> birth-right, &amp; <hi>Satha</hi> stole
<hi>Adams</hi> Paradise, whiles the tenure was in their owne
hands. An <hi>Apple</hi> beguiled the one, a messe of <hi>pottage</hi>
the other. Trust not thy <hi>heart</hi> in thine owne custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but lay it vp in <hi>heauen</hi> with thy <hi>treasure.</hi> Commit it
to <hi>Him,</hi> that is the <hi>maker</hi> and <hi>preseruer of men:</hi> who will
lappe it vp with peace, and lay it in a bed of ioy, where
no aduersary power ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuade it, nor <hi>theefe break through
to steale it.</hi>

                  <p>But how can this euill iuyce in our <hi>hearts</hi> be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
what beames of the Sunne euer pearced into that

day.<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 14.</note> Rom, 2. 16. As no eye can looke into it, so let no
reason iudge it. But our Sauiour answeres, <hi>Out of the
heart proceede actuall sinnes:</hi> the water may bee close in
the fountaine, but will bee discerned issuing out. The
<hi>heart</hi> cannot so containe the vnruly affections, but
like headstrong rebels they wil burst out into actions;
and <hi>works</hi> are infallible notes of the <hi>hart.</hi> I say not, that
<hi>works</hi> determine a man to damnation or blisse: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God orders that: but <hi>works</hi> distinguish of a
good or bad man. The Saints haue sinned, but the

holy.</p>
                  <p>Indeed wee are all subiect to passions, because
men: but let vs order our passions wel, because <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
men.</hi> And as the skilful Apothecary makes whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
potions of noysome poysons, by a wise melling
and allaying them: so let vs meete with the intended
hurt of our corruptions, and turne it to our good. It
is not a sufficient commendation of a prince to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
peaceable and loyall subiects: but to subdue
or subuert rebels. It is the prayse of a Christian to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
refractary and wilde affections, more then to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
yeelding and plyable ones. As therefore it is a
prouident policy in Princes, when they haue some
in too likely suspition, for some plotted faction,
to keepe them downe, and to holde them bare: that
though they retaine the same minds, they shall not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:518:15"/>
haue the same meanes to execute their mischiefes: so
the rebellious spirites impotency giues most security
to his Soueraigne: whiles <hi>Hee</hi> sees afarre off what he
would doe, but knowes (neere at hand, that's certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
hee cannot. So let thy heart keepe a straight &amp; aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hand ouer thy passions and affections: <hi>Vt si moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
non remoueant:</hi> that if they moue thee, they may
not remoue thee from thy rest. A man then sleepes
surely, securely; when hee knowes (not that hee will
not, but) that his enemy cannot hurt him. Violent is
the force and fury of passions, ouerbearing a man to
those courses, which in his sober and collected sense he
would abhorre. They haue this power, to make
him a foole, that otherwise is not; and him, that is a
foole, to appeare so. If in strength thou canst not keep
out passion, yet in wisdom temper it: that if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the former, it comes to whisper in thine eares
thine owne weakenes; yet it may be hindered by the
latter from diuulging it to thy shame.</p>
                  <p>Thou seest how excellent and principall a worke it
is to manage the <hi>heart,</hi> which indeed manageth all the
rest: and is powerfull to the carrying away with it
selfe, the attendance of all the senses: who bee as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at call, and as speedy to execution, as any seruant
the <hi>Centurion</hi> had: wayting onely for a <hi>come, goe, doe,</hi>
from their leader the <hi>Heart.</hi> The eare will not heare,
where the <hi>heart</hi> minds not, nor the hand relieue, where
the <hi>heart</hi> pitties not: nor the tongue prayse, where the
<hi>heart</hi> loues not. All looke, listen, attend, stay vpon
the <hi>heart,</hi> as a Captaine to giue the onset. The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi>
sayth; It is not the eye that seeth, but the <hi>heart:</hi>
so it is not the eares that heare, but the <hi>heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed: it sometimes falleth out, that a man heares
not a great sound or noyse, though it be nigh him. The
reason is, his <hi>heart</hi> is fixed, and busily taken vp in some
obiect, serious in his imagination, though perhaps in it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:518:16"/>
selfe vain: &amp; the eares like faithfull seruants attending
their master the <hi>heart,</hi> lose the act of that auditiue Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
by some suspension, till the <hi>heart</hi> hath done with
them, and giuen them leaue. Curious and rare sights,
able to rauish some with admiration, affect not others,
whiles they stand as open to their view: because their
eyes are following the <hi>heart,</hi> and doing him seruice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an other matter. Hence our feet stumble in a plain
path, because our eyes, which should bee their guides,
are sent some other way on the <hi>hearts</hi> errand. Bee then
all <hi>cleane,</hi> if thou canst: but if that happinesse bee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on earth, yet let thy <hi>heart</hi> be clean; there is then the
more hope of the rest.</p>

                  <p>This is the precipitation of sinne, if God doth not
preuent, as Sathan doth prouoke: it rests not, till it bee

Since it is not onely expedient, to be made experient

me leaue therfore briefly to tel you, that some principal
intentions, to the repaire of your <hi>Hearts</hi> ruines are
these. 1. Seeing this <hi>vessell is full,</hi> to <hi>empty</hi> it. 2. Seeing
it is <hi>foule,</hi> to <hi>wash</hi> it. 3. Since it hath caught an ill tang,

with these foure <hi>vses,</hi> goe in peace.</p>
                  <p>1. There is first a necessitie, that the <hi>hart</hi> which is <hi>full</hi>
of <hi>euill</hi> by nature, must be emptied by conuersion, and
replenished with <hi>grace,</hi> or not saued with <hi>glory.</hi> what
scuppet haue we then to free the <hi>heart</hi> of this muddy
pollution? Loe, how happily we fall vpon <hi>Repentance;</hi>
God grant <hi>Repentance</hi> fall vpon vs. The proper engine
ordained &amp; blessed of God to this purpose, is <hi>Repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:</hi>
a grace, without which man can neuer extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the bondage of <hi>Satan:</hi> a grace whereat (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it lights on a sinnefull soule) the deuils murmure and

in heauen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 6. 16.</note> This is that blessed engine, that lightens
the <hi>hearts</hi> of such a burden, that <hi>Rockes</hi> and <hi>Mountains,</hi>
and the vast body of the earth layed on a distressed &amp;
desperate sinner, are corkes and fethers to it.</p>
                  <p>This is that, which makes the eternal <hi>wisedome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to admit a forgetfulnesse, and to remember our
iniquities no more then if they had neuer beene. This
speakes to <hi>Mercy,</hi> to separate our sinnes from the face
of God, to binde them vp in heapes and bundels, and
drowne them in the sea of <hi>obliuion.</hi> This makes <hi>Mary

He is <hi>madde,</hi> that <hi>cals euill good,</hi> and <hi>sowre sweet:</hi> but

                        <p>But many learned men are patrons and patterns for

by another mans exemplary <hi>madnesse.</hi> Were it more
questionable; yet he is no lesse <hi>madde,</hi> that will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously
doe, what hee is not sure is safe to bee done;
then he, that hauing a whole field to walke in, will yet
goe on a deepe riuers dangerous banke. He is in more

will euer keepe him leane: and is indulgent to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

the wrongs on himselfe, which his aduersary
doth him. Is not this a <hi>mad-man?</hi> Others strike him,
and like a strangely-penitentiall <hi>Monke,</hi> as if their
blowes were not sufficient, hee strikes himselfe. That
Physitians may not begge him when hee's dead, hee
makes himselfe an Anatomie liuing. Sure, hee giues
cause to thinke, that all the olde fables of walking
ghosts were meant of him, and but for a little star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
flesh, he demonstratiuely expounds them. If it
were not for his soule, the Deuil could scarce tell, what
to doe with his body. Hee would doe much mischiefe,
if he liue's to't: but there is great hope, that he wil kil
himselfe before-hand. If you misse him in a Stationers
shoppe geering at books, or at a Sermon cauilling at

Eyther like that wretch, hee would be <hi>mute,</hi> or els an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
<hi>Man let me into his heart.</hi> What a Traytour is

                        <p>2 That hee doth not pay the <hi>rent</hi> of Gods house.
God rich in mercies, lends and (as it were) lets to farme
diuers possessions; as the graces of the <hi>Spirite,</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues

for all these requires no <hi>rent,</hi> but <hi>thanksgiuing:</hi> that we
prayse him in heart, tongue, and conuersation. But so
long as <hi>Madnesse</hi> is in any of these Tenements, God
cannot haue this little <hi>rent</hi> of his Farme. They are <hi>mad,</hi>

or the due payment of an accountant tribute.</p>
                        <p>3. That hee doth suffer Gods <hi>Tenement</hi> to decay: he
doth ruinate where hee dwels. For the out-houses of
our bodies, <hi>madnesse</hi> doth striue eyther to burne them
with lust, or to drowne them with drunkennesse, or to
starue them with couetousnesse. For the spirituall and
inward building, the foundation of Gods <hi>Tenement</hi> in
our soule is <hi>faith,</hi> the walles <hi>hope,</hi> the roofe <hi>charity.</hi> Now
<hi>madnes</hi> continually endeuours to raze our foundation,
to digge through our walles, to vncouer our roofe: that
hauing neyther <hi>faith</hi> in God, nor loue to men, our soule
may bee without <hi>hope,</hi> exposed to the tempests of the
deuill. Shall not <hi>madnesse</hi> account for these dilapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                        <p>4. That he doth imploy the <hi>house</hi> to base vses. It
is ill done in a <hi>Tenant</hi> to a fayre house, to make the best
roomes stables for his horses, stalls for his oxen, or styes
for his hogges. But <hi>madnes</hi> makes the <hi>Memory</hi> a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for malice and reuenge: the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
