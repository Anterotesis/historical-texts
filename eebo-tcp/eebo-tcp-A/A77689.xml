            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nature hath furniſhed one part of the Earth, and man another. The treaſures of time lie high, in Urnes, Coynes, and Monuments, ſcarce below the roots of ſome vegetables.

That great Antiquity <hi>America</hi> lay buried for a thouſand years; and a large part of the earth is ſtill in the Urne unto us.</p>
                     <p>Though if <hi>Adam</hi> were made out of an extract of the Earth, all parts might challenge a reſtitution, yet few have returned their bones farre lower then they might receive them; not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the graves of Giants, under hilly and heavy coverings, but content with leſſe then their owne depth, have wiſhed their bones might lie ſoft, and the earth be light upon them; Even ſuch as hope to riſe again, would not be contenr with centrall interrment, or ſo deſperately to place their reliques as to lie beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and in no way to be ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; which happy contrivance hath made communication with our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

                     <p>That carnall interment or burying, was of the elder date, the old examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to illuſtrate; And were without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, if it could be made out, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was buried near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> according to ſome Tradition.

Not totally purſued in the higheſt runne of Cremation; For when even Crows were funerally burnt, <hi>Poppaea</hi> the Wife of <hi>Nero</hi> found a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar grave enterment. Now as all cuſtomes were founded upon ſome bottome of Reaſon, ſo there wanted not grounds for this; according to feverall apprehenſions of the moſt rationall diſſolution. Some
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114622:12"/>
being of the opinion of <hi>Thales,</hi> that water was the originall of all things, thought it moſt equall to ſubmit unto the principle of putrefaction, and conclude in a moiſt relentment. Others conceived it moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to end in fire, as due unto the maſter principle in the compoſition, according to the doctrine of <hi>Heraclitus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heaped up large piles, more actively to waft them toward that Element, whereby they alſo declined a viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation into worms, and left a laſting parcell of their compoſition.</p>
                     <p>Some apprehended a purifying virtue in fire, refining the groſſer commixture, and firing out the Aethereall particles ſo deeply immerſed in it. And ſuch as by tradition or rationall conjecture held any hint of the finall pyre of all things; or that this Element at laſt muſt be too hard for all the reſt; might conceive moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally of the fiery diſſolution. Others pretending no natural grounds, politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declined the malice of enemies upon their buried bodies. Which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion led <hi>Sylla</hi> unto this practiſe; who having thus ſerved the body of <hi>Marius,</hi> could not but fear a retaliation upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114622:12"/>
his own; entertained after in the Civill wars, and revengeful contentions of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as many Nations embraced, and many left it indifferent, ſo others too much affected, or ſtrictly declined this practice. The <hi>Indian Brachmans</hi> ſeemed too great friends unto fire, who burnt themſelves alive, and thought it the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt way to end their dayes in fire; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expreſſion of the Indian, burning himſelf at <hi>Athens</hi>

                     <p>But the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> the great Idolaters of fire, abhorred the burning of their carcaſſes, as a pollution of that Deity. The <hi>Perſian Magi</hi> declined it upon the like ſcruple, and being only ſollicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their bones, expoſed their fleſh to the prey of Birds and Dogges. And the <hi>Perſees</hi> now in <hi>India,</hi> which expoſe their bodies unto Vultures, and endure not ſo much as <hi>feretra</hi> or Beers of Wood, the proper Fuell of fire, are led on with ſuch niceties. But whether the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> who burned their dead, held any ſuch fear to pollute their Deity of <hi>Herthus,</hi> or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114622:13"/>
the earth, we have no Authentick conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                     <p>The Aegyptians were afraid of fire, not as a Deity, but a devouring Element, mercileſly conſuming their bodies, and leaving too little of them; and therefore by precious Embalments, depoſiture in dry earths, or handſome incloſure in glaſſes, contrived the notableſt wayes of integrall conſervation. And from ſuch Aegyptian ſcruples imbibed by <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> it may be conjectured that <hi>Numa</hi> and the Pythagoricall Sect firſt waved the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſolution.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> who ſwore by winde and ſword, that is, by life and death, were ſo farre from burning their bodies, that they declined all interrment, and made their graves in the ayr: And the <hi>Ichthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophagi</hi> or fiſh-eating Nations about Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, affected the Sea for their grave: Thereby declining viſible corruption, and reſtoring the debt of their bodies.

Many Urnes are red, theſe but of a black colour, ſomewhat ſmooth, and dully ſounding, which begat ſome doubt, whether they were burnt, or only baked in Oven or Sunne: According to the ancient way, in many bricks, tiles, pots, and teſtaceous works; and as the word <hi>testa</hi> is properly to be taken, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring without addition: And chiefly intended by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bricks and tiles of two years old, and to make them in the ſpring.

                     <p>CHriſtians have handſomely gloſſed the deformity of death, by careful conſideration of the body, and civil rites which take of brutall terminations. And though they conceived all reparable by a reſurrection, caſt not off all care of enterrment. And ſince the aſhes of Sacrifices burnt upon the Altar of God, were carefully carried out by the Prieſts, and depoſed in a clean field; ſince they acknowledged their bodies to be the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Chriſt, and temples of the holy Ghoſt, they devolved not all upon the ſufficiency of ſoul exiſtence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with long ſervices and full ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concluded their laſt Exequies, wherein <note n="a" place="margin">Rituale Graecum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera J.

                        <hi>Socrates,</hi> and regarding only his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall part, was indifferent to be burnt or buried.

                     <p>Men have loſt their reaſon in nothing ſo much as their religion, wherein ſtones and clouts make Martyrs; and ſince the religion of one ſeems madneſſe unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to afford an account or rationall of old Rites, requires no rigid Reader; That they kindled the pyre averſly, or turning their face from it, was an handſome Symbole of unwilling mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; That they waſhed their bones

with wine and milk, that the mother wrapt them in Linnen, and dryed them in her boſome, the firſt foſtering part, and place of their nouriſhment; That they opened their eyes towards heaven, before they kindled the fire, as the place of their hopes or originall, were no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Ceremonies. Their laſt vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <note n="f" place="margin">Vale, vale, nos te ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo natura permittet ſequemur.</note> thrice uttered by the attendants was alſo very ſolemn, and ſomewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Chriſtians, who thought it too little, if they threw not the earth thrice upon the enterred body.

For that he ſeeming dead, will reſtore it ſelf from the root, and its dry and exuccous leaves reſume their verdure again; which if we miſtake not, we have alſo obſerved in fures.

                     <p>They made uſe of Muſick to excite or quiet the affections of their friends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to different harmonies.

                     <p>They burnt not children before their teeth appeared, as apprehending their bodies too tender a morſell for fire, and that their griſtly bones would ſcarce leave ſeparable reliques after the py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall combuſtion. That they kindled not fire in their houſes for ſome dayes after, was a ſtrict memoriall of the late afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire.

                     <p>They cloſed their eyes as parts which firſt die or firſt diſcover the ſad effects of death. But their iterated clamations to excitate their dying or dead friends,

of our few and evil dayes, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſenſes not relapſing into cutting remembrances, our ſorrows are not kept raw by the edge of repetitions. A great part of Antiquity contented their hopes of ſubſiſtency with a tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſouls. A good way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their memories, while having the advantage of plurall ſucceſſions, they could not but act ſomething remarkable in ſuch variety of beings, and enjoying the fame of their paſſed ſelves, make accumulation of glory unto their laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Others rather then be loſt in the uncomfortable night of nothing, were content to recede into the common being, and make one particle of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſoul of all things, which was no more then to return into their unknown and divine Originall again. Aegyptian inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity was more unſatisfied, contriving their bodies in ſweet conſiſtences, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the return of their ſouls.

                     <p>In vain do individuals hope for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, or any patent from oblivion, in preſervations below the Moon: Men have been deceived even in their flatteries above the Sun, and ſtudied conceits to perpetuate their names in heaven. The various Coſmography of that part hath already varied the names of contrived conſtellations; <hi>Nimrod</hi> is loſt in <hi>Orion,</hi> and <hi>Oſyris</hi> in the Dogge-ſtarre. While we look for incorruption in the heavens, we finde they are but like the Earth; Durable in their main bodies, alterable in their parts: whereof beſide Comets and new Stars, perſpectives begin to tell tales. And the ſpots that wander about the Sun, with <hi>Phaetons</hi> favour, would make clear conviction.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing ſtrictly immortall, but immortality; whatever hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning may be confident of no end. All others have a dependent being, and within the reach of deſtruction, which is the peculiar of that neceſſary eſſence that cannot deſtroy it ſelf; And the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114622:49"/>
higheſt ſtrain of omnipotency to be ſo powerfully conſtituted, as not to ſuffer even from the power of it ſelf. But the ſufficiency of Chriſtian Immortality fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates all earthly glory, and the quality of either ſtate after death, makes a folly of poſthumous memory. God who can only deſtroy our ſouls, and hath aſſured our reſurrection, either of our bodies or names hath directly promiſed no duration. Wherein there is ſo much of chance that the boldeſt Expectants have found unhappy fruſtration; and to hold long ſubſiſtence, ſeems but a ſcape in oblivion. But man is a Noble Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, ſplendid in aſhes, and pompous in the grave, ſolemnizing Nativities and Deaths with equall luſtre, nor omitting Ceremonies of bravery, in the infamy of his nature.</p>
                     <p>Life is a pure flame, and we live by an inviſible Sun within us. A ſmall fire ſufficeth for life, great flames ſeemed too little after death, while men vainly affected precious pyres, and to burn like <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> but the wiſedom of fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Laws found the folly of prodigall

If in the decretory term of the world we ſhall not all dye but be changed, according to received tranſlation; the laſt day will make but few graves; at leaſt quick Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will anticipate laſting Sepultures; Some Graves will be opened before they be quite cloſed, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> be no wonder.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the leaves ſucceſſively rounding the ſtalke, in foure at the furtheſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs is abſolved, and the fifth leafe or ſprout, returns to the poſition of the other fift before it; as in accounting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is often obſervable in in furre pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye, Ragweed, the ſproutes of Oaks, and thorns upon pollards, and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably in the regular diſpoſure of the rugged excreſcencies in the yearly ſhoots of the Pine.</p>
                     <p>But in ſquare ſtalked plants, the leaves ſtand reſpectively unto each other, either in croſſe or decuſſation to thoſe above or below them, ariſing at croſſe poſitions; whereby they ſhadow not each other, and bettter reſiſt the force of winds, which in a parallel ſituation, and upon ſquare ſtalkes would more

forcibly bear upon them.</p>
                     <p>And to omit, how leaves and ſprouts which compaſſe not the ſtalk, are often ſet in a Rhomboides, and making long, and ſhort Diagonals, doe ſtand like the leggs of Quadrupeds when they goe: Nor to urge the thwart encloſure and furdling of flowers, and bloſſomes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explication, as in the multiplyed leaves of Pionie; And the Chiaſmus in five leaved flowers, while one lies wrapt about the ſtaminous beards, the other foure obliquely ſhutting and cloſing upon each other; and how even flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which conſiſt of foure leaves, ſtand not ordinarily in three and one, but two, and two croſſe wiſe unto the Stylus; even the Autumnal budds, which awaite the returne of the ſun, doe after the winter ſolſtice multiply their calicular leaves, making little Rhombuſes, and network figures, as in the Sycamore and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac.</p>
                     <p>The like is diſcoverable in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal production of plants, which firſt putting forth two leaves, thoſe which ſucceed, bear not over each other, but

ſhoot obliquely or croſſewiſe, untill the ſtalke appeareth; which ſendeth not forth its firſt leaves without all order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and he that from hence can diſcover in what poſition the two firſt leaves did ariſe, is no ordinary obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                     <p>Where by the way, he that obſerveth the rudimental ſpring of ſeeds, ſhall finde ſtrict rule, although not after this order. How little is required unto effectual ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and in what diminutives the plaſtick principle lodgeth, is exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſeeds, wherein the greater maſs affords ſo little comproduction. In Beanes the leaf and root ſprout from the Germen, the main ſides ſplit, and lye by, and in ſome pull'd up near the time of blooming, we have found the pulpous ſides intire or little waſted. In Acorns the nebb dilating ſplitteth the two ſides, which ſometimes lye whole, when the Oak is ſprouted two handfuls. In Lupins theſe pulpy ſides do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe with the ſtalk in a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of two fat leaves. Wheat and Rye will grow up, if after they have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114622:74"/>
ſhot ſome tender Roots, the adhering pulp be taken from them. Beanes will proſper though a part be cut away, and ſo much ſet as ſufficeth to contain and keep the German cloſe. From this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous pulp in unkindely, and wet years, may ariſe that multiplicity of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſects, which infeſt the Roots and Sprouts of tender Graines and pulſes.</p>
                     <p>In the little nebbe or fructifying prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the motion is regular, and not tranſvertible, as to make that ever the leaf, which nature intendeth the root; obſervable from their converſion, until they attain their right poſition, if ſeeds be ſet inverſedly.</p>
                     <p>In vain we expect the production of plants from different parts of the ſeed, from the ſame <hi>corculum</hi> or little original proceed both germinations; and in the power of this ſlender particle lye many Roots, that though the fame be pull'd away, the generative particle will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again, and proceed to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect plant; And malt may be obſerved to grow, though the Cummes be fallen from it.</p>

The ſeminall nebbe hath a defined and ſingle place, and not extended unto both extremes. And therefore many too vulgarly conceive that Barley and Oats grow at both ends; For they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from one <hi>punctilio</hi> or generative nebbe, and the Speare ſliding under the husk, firſt appeareth nigh the toppe. But in Wheat and Rye being bare the ſprouts are ſeen together. If Barley un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hulled would grow, both would appear at once. But in this and Oat-meal the nebbe is broken away, which makes them the milder food, and leſſe apt to raiſe fermentation in Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Men taking notice of what is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly vifible, conceive a ſenſible prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Root. But as they begin from one part, ſo they ſeem to ſtart and ſet out upon one fignall of nature. In Beans yet ſoft, in Peaſe while they adhere unto the Cod, the rudimentall Leafe and Root are diſcoverable. In the seeds of Rocket and Muſtard, ſprouting in Glaſſes of water, when the one is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the other is alſo peeceptible. In
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114622:75"/>
muddy waters apt to breed <hi>Duckweed,</hi> and Periwinkles, if the firſt and rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſtroaks of Duckweed be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Leaves and Root anticipate not each other. But in the Date-ſtone the firſt ſprout is neither root nor leaf diſtinctly, but borh together; For the Germination being to paſſe through the the narrow Navell and hole about the midſt of the ſtone, the generative germ is faine to enlengthen it ſelf, and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out about an inch, at that diſtance divideth into the aſcending and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portion.</p>
                     <p>And though it be generally thought that Seeds will root at that end, where they adhere to their Originals, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable it is that the nebbe ſets moſt often next the ſtalk, as in Grains, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and moſt ſmall Seeds, yet is it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out in many greater plants. For in Acornes, Almonds, Piſtachios, Wallnuts, and accuminated ſhells, the germ puts forth at the remoteſt part of the pulp. And therefore to ſet Seeds in that poſture, wherein the Leaf and Roots may ſhoot right without contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114622:75"/>
or forced circumvolution, which might render them ſtrongly rooted, and ſtraighter, were a Criticiſme in Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture. And nature ſeems to have made ſome proviſion hereof in many from their figure, that as they fall from the tree they may lye in Poſitions agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch advantages.</p>
                     <p>Beſide the open and viſible Teſticles of plants, the ſeminall pores lie in great part inviſible, while the Sun findes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypody in ſtone-wals, the little ſtinging Nettle, and nightſhade in barren ſandy High-wayes, <hi>Scurvy-graſſe</hi> in <hi>Greeneland,</hi> and unknown plants in earth brought from remote Countries, Beſide the known longevity of ſome Trees, what is the moſt laſting herb, or ſeed, ſeems not eaſily determinable.

For ſince the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſtinction is made from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of leaf or ſtalk, and plants after the two firſt ſeminall leaves, do either proceeed to ſend forth more leaves, or a ſtalk, and the folious and ſtalky emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion diſtinguiſheth herbs and trees, and ſtand Authentically differenced, but from the accidents of the ſtalk.</p>

In many the flowers, blades, or ſtaminous ſhootes and leaves are all equally five, as in cockle, mullein and <hi>Blattaria;</hi> Wherein the flowers before explication are pentagonally wrapped up, with ſome reſemblance of the <hi>blatta</hi> or moth from whence it hath its name: But the contrivance of nature is ſingular in the opening and ſhutting of Binde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeds, performed by five inflexures, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable by pyramidcall figures, and alſo different colours.</p>
                     <p>The roſe at firſt is thought to have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114622:79"/>
been of five leaves, as it yet groweth wilde among us; but in the moſt lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant, the calicular leaves do ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that number. But nothing is more admired then the five Brethren of the Roſe, and the ſtrange diſpoſure of the Appendices or Beards, in the calicular leaves thereof, which in deſpair of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is tolerably ſalved from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, beſt ordered and ſuited for the free cloſure of them before expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For thoſe two which are ſmooth, and of no beard are contrived to lye undermoſt, as without prominent parts, and fit to be ſmoothly covered; the other two which are beſet with Beards on either ſide, ſtand outward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but the fifth or half-bearded leaf is covered on the bare ſide but on the open ſide ſtands free, and bearded like the other.</p>
                     <p>Beſides a large number of leaves have five diviſions, and may be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a <hi>Pentagon</hi> or figure of five An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, made by right lines from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of their leaves, as in Maple, Vine, Figge-Tree: But five-leaved
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114622:79"/>
flowers are commonly diſpoſed circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about the <hi>Stylus;</hi> according to the higher Geometry of nature, dividing a circle by five <hi>radii,</hi> which concurre not to make Diameters, as in Quadrilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſexangular Interſections.</p>
                     <p>Now the number of five is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in every circle, not only as the firſt ſphaerical number, but the meaſure of ſphaerical motion. For ſphaerical bodies move by fives, and every globular figure placed upon a plane, in direct volutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, returns to the firſt point of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the firſt touch, accounting by the Axes of the Diameters or Cardinall points of the four quarters thereof. And before it arriveth unto the ſame point again, it maketh five circles equall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf, in each progreſſe from thoſe quarters, abſolving an equall circle.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame number doth nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the circle of the Sea-Starre, and in that order and number diſpoſeth thoſe elegant Semi-circles, or dentall ſockets and egges in the Sea Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogge. And no mean Obſervations

                     <p>The ruſſet neck in young Lambs ſeems but adventitious, and may owe its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to ſome contaction in the womb; But that if ſheep have any black or deep ruſſet in their faces, they want not the ſame about their legges and feet; That black Hounds have mealy mouths and feet; That black Cows which have any white in their tayls, ſhould not miſſe of ſome in their bellies; and if all white in their bodies, yet if black-mouth'd, their ears and feet maintain the ſame colour, are correſpondent tinctures not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily failing in nature, which eaſily u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites the accidents of extremities, ſince in ſome generations ſhe tranſmutes the parts themſelves, while in the <hi>Aurelian Metamorphoſis</hi> the head of the canker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Tayl of the Butterfly. Which is in ſome way not beyond the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Art, in ſubmerſions and Inlays, inverting the extremes of the plant, and fetching the root from the top, and alſo
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114622:88"/>
imitated in handſome columnary work, in the inverſion of the extremes; wherein the Capitel, and the Baſe, hold ſuch near correſpondency.</p>
                     <p>In the motive parts of animals may be diſcovered mutuall proportions; not only in thoſe of Quadrupeds, but in the thigh-bone, legge, foot-bone, and claws of Birds. The legs of Spiders are made after a ſeſqui-tertian proportion, and the long legs of ſome locuſts, double unto ſome others. But the internodial parts of Vegetables, or ſpaces between the joints, are contrived with more uncertainty; though the joints themſelves in many plants, maintain a regular number.</p>
                     <p>In vegetable compoſure, the unition of prominent parts ſeems moſt to anſwer the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> or proceſſes of Animall bones, whereof they are the produced parts or prominent explantations. And though in the parts of plants which are not ordained for motion, we do not expect correſpondent Articulations; yet in the ſetting on of ſome flowers, and ſeeds in their ſockets, and the lineal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſure of the pulpe of ſeverall ſeeds,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114622:88"/>
may be obſerved ſome ſhadow of the Harmony; ſome ſhow of the Gomphoſis or mortis-articulation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diarthroſis or motive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation, there is expected little Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, though long-ſtalked leaves doe move by long lines, and have obſervable motions, yet are they made by outward impulſion, like the motion of pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bodies, while the parts themſelves are united by ſome kinde of <hi>ſymphyſis</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtock.</p>
                     <p>But ſtanding vegetables, void of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Articulations, are not without many motions. For beſide the motion of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upward, and of radiation unto all quarters, that of contraction, dilatation, inclination, and contortion, is diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in many plants. To omit the roſe of <hi>Jericho,</hi> the ear of Rye, which moves with change of weather, and the Magical ſpit, made of no rare plants, which windes before the fire, and roſts the bird without turning.</p>
                     <p>Even Animals near the Claſſis of plants, ſeem to have the moſt reſtleſſe motions. The Summer-worm of Ponds and plaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

And if his garden had the ſame ſituation, which mapps, and charts afford it, on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and having the wall on the Weſt; theſe were the windes, unto which it was well expoſed.</p>
                     <p>By this way of plantation they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of their trees, which they loſt in <hi>Quaternio's,</hi> and ſquare-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which is a commodity inſiſted on by <hi>Varro,</hi> and one great intent of nature, in this poſition of flowers and ſeeds in the elegant formation of plants, and the former Rules obſerved in naturall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114622:93"/>
and artificiall Figurations.</p>
                     <p>Whether in this order and one Tree in ſome meaſure breaking the cold, and pinching guſts of windes from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, trees will not better maintain their inward circles, and either eſcape or moderate their excentricities, may alſo be conſidered. For the circles in Trees are naturally concentricall, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell unto the bark, and unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till froſt and piercing windes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and cloſe them on the weatherſide, the oppoſite ſemicircle widely enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and at a comely diſtance, which hindreth ofttimes the beauty and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Trees, and makes the Timber leſſe ſerviceable; whiles the aſcending juyce not readily paſſing, ſettles in knots and inequalities. And therefore it is no new courſe of Agriculture, to obſerve the native poſition of Trees ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to North and South in their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantations.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is alſo obſervable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground in the circinations and ſphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rounds of Onyons, wherein the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Orbes are ofttimes larger,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114622:93"/>
and the meridionall lines ſtand wider upon one ſide then the other. And where the largeneſſe will make up the number of planetical Orbes, that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the lower planets excede the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the higher: Whether the like be not verified in the Circles of the large roots of Briony and Mandrakes, or why in the knotts of Deale or Firre the Circles are often ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricall, although not in a plane, but vertical and right poſition, deſerves a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry.</p>
                     <p>Whether there be not ſome irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of roundneſſe in moſt plants accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their poſition? Whether ſome ſmall compreſſion of pores be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible in parts which ſtand againſt the current of waters, as in Reeds, Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes, and other vegetables toward the ſtreaming quarter, may alſo be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore ſuch as are long and weak, are commonly contrived into a roundneſſe of figure, whereby the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſſeth leſſe, and ſlippeth more ſmoothly from them, and even in flags of flat-figured leaves, the greater part

Why ſince many ſeeds contain much oyle within them, they endure it not well without, either in their growth or production? Why ſince Seeds ſhoot commonly under ground, and out of the ayre, thoſe which are let fall in ſhallow glaſſes, upon the ſurface of the water, will ſooner ſprout then thoſe at the bottome? And if the water be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with oyle, thoſe at the bottome will hardly ſprout at all, we have not

room to conjecture.</p>
                     <p>Whether Ivy would not leſſe offend the Trees in this clean ordination, and well kept paths, might perhaps deſerve the queſtion. But this were a quaery only unto ſome habitations, and little concerning <hi>Cyrus</hi> or the Babylonian ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory; wherein by no induſtry <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi> could make Ivy grow: And <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> hardly found it about thoſe parts to imitate the pomp of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> And though in theſe Northern Regions we are too much acquainted with one Ivy, we know too little of another, whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not the expreſſions of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <note n="a" place="margin">Galen. de med. ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum loc.</note> Splenetick medicine of <hi>Galen,</hi> and the Emphaſis of the Poet, in the <note n="b" place="margin">Hedera formoſior alba.</note> beauty of the white Ivy.</p>
                     <p>The like concerning the growth of Miſſeltoe, which dependeth not only of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or kinde of Tree, but much alſo of the Soil. And therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in ſome places, not readily found in others, frequent in <hi>France,</hi> not ſo common in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſcarce at all in the Territory of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> Nor eaſily to be found where it is moſt required

Athough in ſome places the Olive eſcapeth it not, requiting its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, in the delightfull view of its red Berries; as <hi>Cluſius</hi> obſerved in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Bellonius</hi> about <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But this Paraſiticall plant ſuffers nothing to grow upon it, by any way of art; nor could we ever make it grow where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not planted it; as we have in vain attempted by inocculation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, upon its native or forreign ſtock. And though there ſeem nothing impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in the ſeed, it hath not ſucceeded by ſation in any manner of ground, wherein we had no reaſon to deſpair, ſince we reade of vegetable horns, and how Rams horns will root about <note place="margin">Linſcholen.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe rurall commodities, it cannot be meanly delectable in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Figures, which theſe orders o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and cloſed do make. Whileſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very incloſure makes a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures obliquely taken a Rhomboides, the intervals bounded with parallell lines, and each interſection built upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114622:95"/>
a ſquare, affording two Triangles or Pyramids vertically conjoyned; which in the ſtrict Quincunciall order doe oppoſitely make acute and blunt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
                     <p>And though therein we meet not with right angles, yet every Rhombus containing four Angles equall unto two right, it virtually contains two right in every one. Nor is this ſtrange unto ſuch as obſerve the naturall lines of Trees, and parts diſpoſed in them. For neither in the root doth nature affect this angle, which ſhooting down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the ſtability of the plant, doth beſt effect the ſame by Figures of Inclination; Nor in the Branches and ſtalky leaves, which grow moſt at acute angles; as declining from their head the root, and diminiſhing their Angles with their altitude: Verified alſo in leſſer Plants, whereby they better ſupport themſelves, and bear not ſo heavily upon the ſtalk: So that while near the root they often make an Angle of ſeventy parts, the ſprouts near the top will often come ſhort of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114622:96"/>
thirty. Enen in the nerves and maſter veins of the leaves the acute angle ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; the obtuſe but ſeldome found, and in the backward part of the leaf, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and arching about the ſtalk. But why ofttimes one ſide of the leaf is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall unto the other, as in Hazell and Oaks, why on either ſide the maſter vein the leſſer and derivative channels not directly oppoſite, nor at equall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, reſpectively unto the adverſe ſide, but thoſe of one part do often exceed the other, as the Wallnut and many more deſerves another enquiry.</p>
                     <p>Now if for this order we affect coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous and tapering Trees, particularly the Cypreſſe, which grows in a coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call figure; we have found a Tree not only of great Ornament, but in its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of affinity unto this order. A ſolid Rhombus being made by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of two Equicrurall Cones, as <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath defined. And theſe were the common Trees about <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Eaſt, whereof the Ark was made; and <hi>Alexander</hi> found no Trees ſo accomodable to build his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114622:96"/>
And this we rather think to be the Tree mentioned in the Canticles, which ſtricter Botanology will hardly allow to be Camphire.</p>
                     <p>And if delight or ornamentall view invite a comely diſpoſure by circular amputations, as is elegantly performed in Hawthorns; then will they anſwer the figures made by the converſion of a Rhombus, which maketh two concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall Circles; the greater circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence being made by the leſſer angles, the leſſer by the greater.</p>
                     <p>The Cylindrical figure of Trees is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contained and latent in this order. A Cylinder or long round being made by the converſion or turning of a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram, and moſt handſomely by a long ſquare, which makes an equall, ſtrong and laſting figure in Trees, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the body and motive parts of animals, the greateſt number of Plants, and almoſt all roots, though their ſtalks be angular, and of many corners, which ſeem not to follow the figure of their Seeds; Since many angular Seeds ſend forth round ſtalks, and ſphaericall ſeeds

And if ancient Anatomy would hold, a like diſpoſure there was of the optick or viſual nerves in the brain, wherein Antiquity concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a concurrence by decuſſation. And this not only obſervable in the Laws of direct Viſion, but in ſome part alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the reflected rayes of ſight. For making the angle of incidence equal to that of reflexion, the viſuall raye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth Quincuncially, and after the form of a V, and the line of reflexion being continued unto the place of viſion, there ariſeth a ſemi-decuſſation, which makes the object ſeen in a perpendicular unto it ſelf, and as farre below the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectent, as it is from it above; obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     <p>And this is alſo the law of reflexion in moved bodies and ſounds, which though not made by decuſſation, obſerve the rule of equality between incidence and reflexion; whereby whiſpering pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are framed by Ellipticall arches laid ſide-wiſe; where the voice being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the <hi>focus</hi> of one extremity, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving an equality unto the angle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence, it will reflect unto the <hi>focus</hi> of the other end, and ſo eſcape the ears of the ſtanders in the middle.</p>

Many Expreſſions by this Number occurre in Holy Scripture, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly laden with myſticall Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and little concerning our order. That the Iſraelites were forbidden to eat the fruit of their new planted Trees, before the fifth yeare, was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto the naturall Rules of Husbandry: Fruits being unwholſome and laſh, before the fourth, or fifth Yeare. In the ſecond day or Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine part of five, there was added no approbation. For in the third or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine day, the ſame is twice repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a double benediction inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both Creations, whereof the one, in ſome part was but an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other. That the Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <note place="margin">Lev 6.</note> was to pay a fifth part above the head or principall, makes no ſecret in this Number, and implied no more then one part above the principall; which being conſidered in four parts, the additionall forfeit muſt bear the Name of a fift. The five golden mice had plainly their determination from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114622:106"/>
the number of the Princes; That five ſhould put to flight an hundred might have nothing myſtically implyed; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering a rank of Souldiers could ſcarce conſiſt of a leſſer number.
