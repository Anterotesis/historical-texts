            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE BOOKSELLERS TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THeſe Two Tomes of <hi>Travels</hi> and <hi>Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> containing great Variety, both as to the ſeveral Countries, the Obſervations, and Authors of them, we think it proper to give the World a ſhort account of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Rauwolf,</hi> a Perſon very famous for his Skill in Natural Products, and in the Practiſe of Phyſick, whoſe Itinerary into the Eaſtern Countries being written in <hi>High Dutch,</hi> was grown very rare, valued as a Manuſcript, and much deſired by ſome learned Gentlemen, who are juſtly eſteem'd to have a delicate Taſte and fine Judgment in the choice of Books and Subjects; therefore being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the <hi>High Dutch</hi> Copy of theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels was only to be found in the <hi>Arundelian</hi> Library at <hi>Greſham College,</hi> we freely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Charge of having it tranſlated, and printed in our Language, which is here perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with great care and diligence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48499:4"/>The Plants collected by the worthy Author Dr. <hi>Leonhart Rauwolff,</hi> in his Itinerary, were curiouſly preſerv'd by the late <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> in four large Volumes, and juſtly eſteem'd by that great man as the moſt noble Rarity and Ornament of his <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> which when it came to be ſold to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> was particularly valued by the Great <hi>Heer van Beverning,</hi> for theſe Volumes of dry'd Plants collected by our Author in his Travels of the Eaſtern Countries; and tho' ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may give a ſlight Character of him, for a Miſtake or two about <hi>Preſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this may very truly be ſaid of <hi>Rauwolff,</hi> that whatever he writes upon his own Obſervation or Knowledge, is moſt faithful and ſincere; therefore it was not without Reaſon, that <hi>Carolus Cluſius</hi> and the two <hi>Bauhines</hi> (all very good Judges) depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo much upon him, and made ſuch frequent and honourable mention of this Itinerary.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſome might think that the aforementioned Journey of Dr. <hi>Leonhart Rau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolff</hi> was conſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:48499:4"/>
to the Publick, who adviſed us to extend it to many other places of the <hi>Levant,</hi> where <hi>Rauwolff</hi> never travell'd, as <hi>Greece, Egypt,</hi> and other adjacent Countries, bordering near the Sphere of <hi>Rauwolff</hi>'s Itinerary: This being thought moſt ſerviceable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of Learning, we immediately conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſupply and enlarge <hi>Rauwolff</hi> with a Second Tome, out of ſome of the moſt renowned Travellers of thoſe parts of the World, ſuch as <hi>Bellonius, Alpinus, Veſlingius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> and many others of great Fame and Reputation for their excellent Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Levant,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spon,</hi> Sir <hi>G. Wheeler,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To theſe we have added ſomething of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Felix</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which curious perſons may be deſirous to read, being taken from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Authentick Voyages.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We prevail'd with Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> to draw up three Catalogues at the end, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs growing in the <hi>Levant</hi> part of the World, together with their various ſynonimous Names, which do much illuſtrate and beautifie the whole.</p>
            <p>But before we take Leave, a Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of Candor and Ingenuity ought not to be forgotten, which is a decent acknowledgment of the Writings from whence the ſeveral parts of the Second Tome were extracted, for the benefit of the Reader; theſe were <hi>Cluſius</hi>'s Edition of Monſieur <hi>Belon</hi>'s Itinerary, by

               <hi>Plantine</hi> at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of <hi>Alpinus,</hi> printed at <hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> The <hi>Pyramidographia</hi> of Mr. <hi>Greaves.</hi> The Collections of Voyages and Travels, by <hi>Ramuſio, Hakluyt, Purchas,</hi> and <hi>Thevenot.</hi> The Philoſophical Tranſactions publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards by Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> at <hi>Oxford:</hi> To which we may add ſome of the moſt learned <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into foreign Countries; ſuch we mean only as applied themſelves to Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical and Philoſophical Obſervations, as Father <hi>Alvarez,</hi> Father <hi>Lobo,</hi> Father <hi>Tellez,</hi> and Father <hi>Vanſleb,</hi> who, ſetting aſide the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their Calling and Miſſion, are not only worthy of entring the Liſt of Gentlemen Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and Virtuoſo's, but of appearing in a Proteſtant Kingdom. From all theſe we fetcht Materials for the forming and raiſing our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume, which we cannot but hope will prove beneficial and grateful to the Publick, ſeeing we had no other deſign in it, than pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of pleaſing and inſtructing, as well as of enlarging the Empire of Knowledge.</p>

            <p>THE Ancient Philoſophers were wont not unfitly to compare the ſtudy and purſuit of Ingenious Arts and Sciences to the practiſe of Merchandizing; for as Merchants fear no Dangers, neither ſpare any Pains or Coſt in travelling to foreign Countries, by Sea and Land, that they may procure and bring thence, to furniſh their Store-houſes, ſuch

Goods and Commodities as they chiefly deal in. So thoſe who make the attainment of Skill in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Liberal Arts their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal End, and the ſtudy thereof their Delight, are not deterred from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting this Deſign, by any diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Places, by Winter or Summer, fearing neither Rain nor Snow, nor the traverſing of horrid Deſarts, or the wild and roaring Seas, nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting or weakening their Patrimonies, if at laſt they can but arrive at thoſe places, where they may gain the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and familiarity of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently-learned Maſters, able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in thoſe Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the Knowledge and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion whereof they aſpire; or where they may inform themſelves of the Conſtitutions and Cuſtoms of famous Nations, and of other things ſubſervient to their Intentions.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> (ſo far as I know my ſelf) yet to confeſs the Truth, I am forced to own, that from my Infancy I alwaies had a great deſire to Travel into foreign parts, and to enquire out Learned and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Men, that I might get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them to encreaſe my Stock of Knowledge. From whence it did proceed (I having chiefly before all
<pb facs="tcp:48499:7"/>
other Faculties, a great inclination to the Study of Phyſick, and finding that it required the aſſiſtance of a great many Sciences more, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Skill in Botanicks) that after ſerious and mature deliberation, with the Conſent of my Parents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and at their Expences, I did leave the <hi>German</hi> Univerſities, and travelled into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Knowledge and Practiſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine doth chiefly flouriſh, where alſo ſeveral rare Plants of great uſe in Phyſick, do naturally grow; to acquaint my ſelf with which, and to gain the knowledge of them I have taken abundance of pains, and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where in company with the highly learned <hi>Jeremias Martius,</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd over ſeveral Hills and Valleys in many places, but chiefly the high Mountain <hi>Ceti,</hi> ſituate near <hi>Frontig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> on the Sea-ſhore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which means I gathered ſeveral hundreds of Simples, and kept them by me as a Treaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48499:8"/>But when I began to conſult Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors concerning them, finding a great many others, no leſs uſeful and advantageous in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that were ſaid to grow in <hi>Greece, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Arabia, &amp;c.</hi> I was highly therewith pleaſed, chiefly when I found alſo thoſe fruitful places of the Eaſtern Countries deſcribed, which ſeveral Authors, and above all the Holy Scriptures have mentioned; and from thence I was enflamed with a vehement deſire to ſearch out, and view ſuch <hi>Plants</hi> growing ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly in their Native places, and propounded alſo to my ſelf to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life, Converſation, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Manners, and Religion of the Inhabitants of thoſe Countries. And although I did not then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately put this my deſign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but delay'd for ſeveral years, doing mean while what Service I could to my Native Country, yet I embraced the firſt opportunity that offer'd it ſelf of accompliſhing it:
<pb facs="tcp:48499:8"/>
For when my deceaſed Brother-in-law Mr. <hi>Melchior Manlich</hi> wiſhed me to take a Voyage into the Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to find out their Drugs and Simples, and other things convenient and profitable for his Trade, and did promiſe me requiſite Charges, and a conſiderable Salary, I immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his agreeable Offer, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced ſo often-deſir'd an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and addreſſing my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the Magiſtrates of this City (for I was then in their Service) cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Leave to go; which I had no ſooner obtained, but I began my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into the <hi>Levant:</hi> What I ſaw, learned, and experienc'd, during the ſpace of Three years, (for ſo much time this Journey took me up) not without great danger and trouble, I conſigned all in good order, as it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred daily, in a Pocket-Journal, to keep as a Memorial of my Life.</p>
            <p>But after I returned home again, being deſir'd, nay, continually impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd by ſeveral <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and others,
<pb facs="tcp:48499:9"/>
my very good Friends, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this my Itinerary to them, and to make it publick. At laſt, after many Refuſals, not being able any longer to reſiſt their Solicitations, I was prevailed upon to comply with their Deſires, to publiſh it in Print.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I looked my Itinerary over again, and whatever Curioſities I had obſerved, I did tranſcribe into a peculiar Diary, which I divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts, according as I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into ſeveral Countries, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to the Preſs, that I might communicate Copies thereof to my Friends.</p>
            <p>It is not Vain-glory that hath prompted me to do this, but rather the Profit and Pleaſure it may afford the Reader; that thoſe who have no opportunity to viſit foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, may have it before their Eyes, as a Map, to contemplate; and that others may be excited further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into theſe things, and induced, by reading this Account, to Travel
<pb facs="tcp:48499:9"/>
themſelves into thoſe parts whereof I have written, to obſerve that more narrowly and exactly wherein I have been too ſhort.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhall object, and ſay, That I might have ſpared this Labour and Trouble, and employed it to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſes; and, that the preſent State, Condition, Situation, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World have been ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurveyed and deſcribed by others, that there is hardly a corner of it left unſearched. To this I anſwer, That what others have written I have not tranſcribed into this Work, but what I have ſeen, experienc'd, obſerv'd and handl'd my ſelf, is only mentioned here: But if any one hath already, out of the like Books printed before, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all theſe things, ſo that nothing here propounded is new to him, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this my Labour is of no uſe to ſuch an one, neither have I written it for him. But he that by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence obſerveth how <hi>Wars, Plagues, Diſtempers,</hi> and other Accidents, may
<pb facs="tcp:48499:10"/>
and do mightily alter <hi>Kingdoms, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> ſo that what was praiſed formerly as glorious and beautiful, lyeth now deſolate and in Aſhes, and what then was accounted barren and waſte, may be now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fruitful and glorious; he will confeſs, that ſtill in our times a great many things remain to be ſearch'd and enquir'd into, which others before us never did nor could obſerve, treat of, or publiſh. Purſuant to this the wiſe <hi>Solon</hi> before mentioned ſaid, <hi>That he grew old, continually learning many things.</hi>

               </gap>ed the <hi>Jews,</hi> his elect and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, which he choſe for his Inheritance, but alſo deſtroyed that once fruitful Land, <hi>flowing with Milk and Honey,</hi> which tho' it ſelf did not ſin, yet he hath curſed with Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the Tranſgreſſions of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.30. and turned the holy City into a deſolation and ſolitude; the due conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be an effectual Motive to provoke <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to amend their Lives and Manners; for, if this was done in the Green Tree, the choſen People of God, what will become of
<pb facs="tcp:48499:11"/>
the Dry, if once the wrath of the Lord be kindled.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he that by this Book is inſtructed in the Manners, Cuſtoms, Laws and Orders of the People of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and what Tricks and Cunning they make uſe of, in time both of Peace and War, will know the better how to behave himſelf in all his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Occaſions of Traffick and Dealings with them.</p>
            <p>Further, this Book alſo teacheth a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> how to behave himſelf in his Slavery, (if it ſhould befal him) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Maſter, without any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Soul or Conſcience; and how by convenient means he may procure his Liberty again.</p>
            <p>You may alſo ſee here how many Sects of Religions there are in theſe places, and how there are many good and well-diſpoſed People, which are not far from the true knowledge of God, and might eaſily be brought to embrace the Orthodox Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48499:11"/>I hope alſo that this my Work will not be very unacceptable to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries and Phyſicians, containing Deſcriptions of many uſeful Herbs, of which I had willingly added the Cuts, but was forced to forbear at preſent, for ſeveral Reaſons, not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here to be related, but I hope it may be done afterwards, when Time and Opportunity ſhall ſerve.</p>
            <p>You will likewiſe find here ſeveral ſtrange Stories, both pleaſant to read, and which may give occaſion to higher Conſiderations: So that I am in good hopes I ſhall not have taken all theſe Pains, and uſed this Diligence altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vain.</p>
            <p>Now, Honoured Gentlemen and Couſins, to return to you; Sith it hath been always uſed by Writers, both ancient and modern, to dedicate their Books to ſome perſon or other, I alſo in compliance with this laudable Cuſtom, have thought fit to dedicate this my Itinerary to you, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:48499:12"/>
of that Relation we ſtand in to each other, by reaſon of conſanguinity, but alſo to acknowledge my Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and declare my Gratitude for the many Favours, Good-turns, and Friendly Offices done me by Mr. <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart Chriſtel,</hi> our dear Uncle of pious Memory (in whoſe Steps you Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Bemer,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Chriſtel,</hi> the Heirs as well of his Virtues as his Eſtate, do tread) when he was alive, and do ſtill at preſent receive of you three my Honoured Kinſmen; which my well-meaning Dedication I hope you will favourably accept, and own and acknowledge as your Couſin.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Marſeilles</hi> where I was lodged in my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Kinſman's Houſe to ſtay until the Ships were ready, I met with one <hi>John Ulrich Kraft,</hi> Son of <hi>John Kraft,</hi> one of the Privy Council at <hi>Ulm,</hi> who was arrived there a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, alſo with the ſame intention to go along with us, about his own Buſineſs; we ſtaid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and while the Ships were fitting out, we made our ſelves acquainted with the Phyſicians and Apothecaries, but above the reſt with one experienced Man, <hi>Jacob Renaud,</hi> a great lover of Plants, who ſhewed me in his Garden many pretty and ſtrange Simples, <hi>viz. Scammonium verum, Ambroſia, Moly, Ammi, Aloes,</hi> &amp;c. and a great many dryed and laid between Papers.

Papaver corniculatum flore flavo.</hi> I alſo found there-about <hi>Chondrilla Viminea,</hi> growing chiefly in the Vineyards, <hi>Conyza major, Vermicularis fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticans, Carduus tomentoſus,</hi> not unlike to <hi>Leucacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, Nepa Lobelii in adverſariis novis.</hi> I alſo found <hi>Tartonrayre, Aſter atticus luteus, Pſyllium, Seſeli Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopicum fruticans, Jujubes, red Valeriana, Corruda Rembert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dodon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>After that the Ship <hi>Santa Croce</hi> was laden, victualled for three Months, and provided with Guns, and all other Neceſſaries for a three Months Voyage, we two went with our Maſter, <hi>Anthony Reinard,</hi> with ſome others belonging to him,<note place="margin">Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1.</note> in a Frigat the firſt day of <hi>September</hi> in the Year 1673. to our Ship, which lay at Anchor with ſeveral other laden Ships, near the adjacent Iſlands, with an intention to ſet Sail the next day.</p>
                  <p>The next day about two in the Afternoon,<note place="margin">2.</note> when God ſent us a good Wind, we hoiſted up our Sails, and went on: When our Patron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exhort his Men to agree together, and to be obedient to him, which they all faithfully promiſed; then we went to Prayers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended our ſelves to the protection of God Almighty.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſetting out, before we got to Sea, our Ship came ſo near to another, that they touched almoſt, and had not the Seamen in time got them off, we might have ſuffered Ship-wrack.</p>
                  <p>When this was over, and we out of danger, we ſailed on with full Sails ſix of us, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo fairly, that we loſt the ſight of Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Night, and could ſee nothing but Sky and Water.</p>
                  <p>Not long after moſt of us began to be Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and to bring up what we had eaten ſome days before,<note place="margin">Sept. 3.</note> but I and my Camrade <hi>Kraft</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our ſelves that Night ſo well, that we were very freſh again the next Morning: Some of the reſt remained ſick for ſeven days after, and not one of us (although we were 48) but was ſick, and found an alteration after our Shipping off.</p>
                  <p>After we had ſailed two days with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wind, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Caurus,</hi> but by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians Maiſtral,</hi> (which bloweth between North and Weſt) and proceeded an Hundred <hi>French</hi> Leagues,<note place="margin">4.</note> there aroſe on the fourth day about Midnight another Wind called <hi>Graeco,</hi> and by the <hi>Latins Caecias,</hi> which the more it went to the Eaſt, the more it was againſt us, ſo that we being hindred from going Eaſtward, were forced to go ſide-ways, and to traverſe up and down, and were driven ſo far Southwards, that on Sunday Night,<note place="margin">5, 6, 7.</note> and Monday Morning we ſailed in ſight of the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> After the Wind was laid a little, and the Dolphins appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great numbers, we hoped for better Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for want of it, finding our ſelves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards <hi>Africa</hi> more and more, we were forced to Tack about, and to direct our Courſe towards <hi>Marſeilles</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>We going thus back again, contrary to our Intentions, feared that the Wind would hold ſo a while ſtill, but contrary to our expectation it came to be ſo calm towards the Night, that we could hardly perceive any. Then we hoped it would change, which did alſo ſucceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for the next Morning before break of day
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48499:21"/>
the <hi>Maiſtral</hi> began to blow again, which pleaſed us extreamly, and ſo we returned and purſued our former Courſe again towards the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Sept. 8.</note> and on Monday we ſailed ſo faſt, that in an hours time we made Ten <hi>Italian</hi> Miles,<note place="margin">9.</note> and on the 9<hi>th.</hi> day came into the Straights of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> where we ſaw an Iſland called <hi>Galicia,</hi> which although it be but ſmall, yet becauſe of the high Mountains is ſeen afar off: we left it about 30 Leagues on one ſide of us. This Iſland is ſubject to no body, wherefore a great many Pirates lye lurking there: In it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſeen, only wild Capers grow there in great plenty. We finding our ſelves in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous place, were not idle, (although the Ship was well provided with Guns, Pikes, and other Arms) but got our Great Guns ready, and filled our Chamber, in which we two were, with Guns and Swords, ſo that it looked rather like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moury of the whole Ship than a Chamber. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over becauſe we were afraid of ſome huge Rocks that lye in the Sea, chiefly of them which the Seamen call <hi>Leuci,</hi> they obſerved them diligently, not only in their Sea-cards, to know which way they might avoid them, but kept a good Watch all that Night to obſerve them, and ſo with the help of God we got ſafely clear of them.</p>
                  <p>A little after we came in view of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Tunis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> with ſome adjacent Iſlands; amongſt them there is one called <hi>Simles,</hi> which, though but ſmall, is very fruitful, and therein groweth the beſt <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda</hi> in abundance.</p>

by above 300 people: <hi>Sicily</hi> on our left, becauſe the Night fell in, we did not then ſee, but came ſo near it, that early in the Morning we could not only ſee the Hills and Mountains, and chiefly the <hi>Mongibello,</hi> which is very high ſituated at the other ſide of the Famous City of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> but alſo the Buildings and Steeple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, ſailed alſo the whole day by that ſide, that lyeth over againſt the Iſland <hi>Malta,</hi> ſo long till we came to the laſt point thereof: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we were not in a little danger there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the War, yet we ſaw no more than one ſmall Ship early in the Morning by <hi>Malta,</hi> which we took to be of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> So (God be praiſed) we arrived very well, and without any hindrance at the furtheſt point of <hi>Sicily</hi> on the 11<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> in the Evening,<note place="margin">Sept. 11.</note> which is reckoned to be 900 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi>; and we hoped alſo with the help of the Almighty to go the reſt of our Voyage to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> which is 1300 more, (three of which are reckoned to a <hi>French</hi> League) for we croſſed the <hi>Adriatick</hi> and <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Seas ſo happily by good Weather, as if we had gone the other way through the Straights. And although we ſailed on very faſt, yet the Wind was uncertain, for one aroſe after another,<note place="margin">12.</note> ſo that we had three ſeveral Winds that Night and Day, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Maiſtral</hi> after Midnight,<note place="margin">13.</note> which laſted until Morning; then the <hi>Betſch,</hi> that blew from South-Weſt very violently, in <hi>Latin</hi> called <hi>Africus,</hi> which laſted till Night: Then followed the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente,</hi> which bloweth from the Weſt, towards Night, which commonly ariſeth upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> as the Old Seamen obſerve, and we found it ſo our ſelves, on the day of the Holy Croſs, not without Trouble or Danger: For as

the Seamen kept that Day, and according to their Old Cuſtom diſcharged three Great Guns,<note place="margin">Sept. 14.</note> the <hi>Betſch</hi> aroſe immediately with very great violence, ſo that the Waves ſwelled very high, and the Ship was toſſed about from one ſide to the other, and did rock us ſo, that if we had not held our ſelves, we could not have kept our places, as did happen to ſome of our Company that did not obſerve this, and were ſtrangely tumbled about in the Ship, and forced to creep on all four to their places again. This Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to remit towards Night, when the <hi>Maiſtral</hi> began to blow.

                     <note place="margin">15.</note> and ſoon after another, now called <hi>Cerigo,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Cythera,</hi> near to the <hi>Morea.</hi> That day we had very good Weather, and it was ſo calm, that we could reach no further than to the Point of <hi>Candy.</hi> Thus going on, another Wind aroſe, blowing from South-Eaſt, called <hi>Sirocco,</hi> and in <hi>Latin Vulturnus,</hi> which was contrary to,<note place="margin">16.</note> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us very much, ſo that we were forced to Sail upon one ſide, to Weather the Point from one ſide to the other; when we came to the ſide of <hi>Creet,</hi> and our Patron would neither Land in <hi>Candy,</hi> nor in a little Iſland called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſia,</hi> we turned on Wedneſday towards <hi>Africa.</hi> Some while after a very great Tempeſt aroſe, with Thunder and Lightning, ſo that we had work enough with our Sails, and to Rule the Ship that it might take no hurt: And we ſailing thus againſt the Wind, that it might not caſt us back, this made us more work then the reſt, for the Waves went againſt us ſo vehemently, that when we were mounted to the top of a Wave, we ſeemed to look down thence into a deep and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48499:23"/>
dark Valley; then down we went again with ſuch a Fury, that we thought we ſhould deſcend to the bottom, which continued almoſt 'till the next Morning. And although the Tempeſt had thrown us a good way back,<note place="margin">Sept. the 17.</note> yet in a little time we got ſo far forward again, that we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry <hi>Candy,</hi> and the little Iſland <hi>Legoſia.</hi> Juſt then we ſpied two Ships, one a Bark, ten Miles off to the Left, and the other a great Ship go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">18.</note>After we were thus gone along by <hi>Creet,</hi> we came on Friday juſt over againſt the City of <hi>Candy</hi>; it came to be ſo calm and ſo warm, that we could hardly perceive we were come above three or four Miles. We going thus ſlowly, ſome of our Company jumped out into the Sea to waſh themſelves, but the Mate of our Ship run a Fiſh through with a long Spear for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, called <hi>Liſcha,</hi> and ſo pulled it out; this was delicately Coloured, and very pleaſant to look upon, his Back was Blew, and his Belly White and Gliſning, above a Yard long, of a tender Fleſh, and very good to Eat. This ſeems to have been a <hi>Tunny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſt over againſt it, is a Monaſtery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in which is a very good Apothecaries Shop, and a delicate Garden filled with ſtrange and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plants.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo not far off, a good and ſafe Port, called <hi>Caliſme,</hi> where we would willingly have taken in Water, but becauſe it lay thirty Miles before us, and the Wind <hi>Sirocco</hi> contrary to us began to blow again, and hindred us in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; we ſteered on Saturday towards the South, that we might reach it the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48499:23"/>About Noon,<note place="margin">Sept. the 19.</note> when we turned again to the <hi>Porto,</hi> we ſaw another Ship on the Left, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we did not know how to truſt her, we looked to our great Guns, of which we had thirteen, and got them ready, and alſo the reſt of our Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the longer we looked upon the Ship, the further we perceived her go from us. When we came within twelve Miles of the Port, (and hoped to make it) the Wind changed, and the <hi>Tramontana</hi> blew from the North vehemently,<note place="margin">20.</note> ſo we went on in our right Courſe to the Iſlands <hi>Calderon</hi> and <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> ſo that on Monday we paſſed the furtheſt Point of <hi>Creet</hi> called <hi>Caput Salomonis,</hi> where we ſaw on the hight another Iſland ſcituated ſixty <hi>Italian</hi> Miles from <hi>Rhodus,</hi> called <hi>Scarpanthos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">21.</note> and alſo <hi>Carpathos,</hi> where Night befel us. But when we expected to go forwards with this Wind we loſt it, and it changed into <hi>Graeco</hi> again, contrary to us, and ſo we could not go on further, but were forced to croſs up and down and to weather the Point.<note place="margin">22.</note> On Monday we ſaw a Ship that came directly down upon us, wherefore we went to meet her, and put our Flag at the top of our Main-maſt. But when we came nearer we knew her to be a <hi>Marſilian,</hi> called <hi>Santa Maria de Lacura Burſa,</hi> they did ſend out one of their Boats to tell us, that they came ſeven Weeks agone from <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and that they wanted Biſcuits very much, and therefore deſired us to let them have ſome of ours, to which we willingly agreed, and let them have what they would, and ſo they were very well pleaſed. While this was done, a good Wind aroſe again, ſerving us both, called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montana,</hi> ſo that we could go forwards and they homewards, and ſo we parted. Then our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ordered three Guns to be diſcharged, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48499:24"/>
they anſwered with two, ſo we went on, and loſt the ſight of one another in half an Hours time.</p>
                  <p>Here is to be obſerved, that of the four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and four ſide Winds five were for us (for we could go on as well with the <hi>Tramontana</hi> and the <hi>Midi,</hi> called North and South, as with the three other, called North-Weſt, Weſt, and South-Weſt, and ſo we had three contrary ones, <hi>Syrocco, Levantino,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sept. the 23.</note> and <hi>Graeco,</hi> which were contrary to us in our going; during this Wind we went on with ſuch ſpeed, that on the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> in the Evening we ſaw the great Iſland <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">24.</note> five hundred Miles beyond <hi>Candy.</hi> But becauſe we had ſteered too much on the Right, we were forced to ſpend all that Night and the next Day before we could come to <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">25.</note> The ſame Morning we ſaw the high Mountain <hi>Libanus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> two hundred Miles diſtant from us, and ſo at Night we got into the Harbour of <hi>Salamine,</hi> here is made the beſt Bay-ſalt that is in the World: Here we alſo diſcharged three Guns, for Joy of our ſafe Arrival, and ſome of us Landed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our Maſter, to take in Water, and to enquire after our Friends and Acquaintance. No ſooner were we Landed, but we met with two travelling <hi>Turks,</hi> with an <hi>Italian</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Language: they ſpake to us by their Interpreter, and conducted us to their Colonel, who was encamped near the Market-place of <hi>Salamine</hi> upon a Hill, where one might ſee a great way off into the Sea. After an Hours walk we came in ſight of him, and ſaw about thirty Tents, and amongſt them his alſo, where we ſaw ſome curious Tapeſtry ſpread, and him ſitting in the midſt, with a delicate white Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, and a long red lined <hi>Caban.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48499:24"/>He held in his Hand a long Iron, like a Grater, we uſe to grate Bread withall, only it was a great deal ſmaller: The Turkiſh Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have generally ſuch Irons in their Hand in the Summer-time; which they put in between their Back and Cloaths to ſcratch their Backs when they itch: About him ſat ſome more Gentlemen bended down, and others kept Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel without his Tent, with Guns and Scym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters well provided. Amongſt the reſt there was one of a good Preſence covered with a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's Skin, that held a great Iron Club in his Hand. Upon his deſire we went to him, with the uſual Reverences, according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, bending our Head and the whole Body downwards, and laying the Right-hand upon our Breaſts: Our Maſter alſo pulled off his Shoes, went in, and ſate down with the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but we two ſet our ſelves down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upon two Seats that were brought us. Then the Lord began to ask our Maſter, by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, from whence we came, how long we had been a coming, what Merchandizes we had brought, and whether we deſigned to make any Sale there: which Queſtions our Maſter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Then he began to enquire after News: <hi>Viz.</hi> Where-about the <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi> was at preſent, and how ſtrong it was reputed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> had made any Leagues with other Princes: and how the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> did agree with his <hi>Hugonots,</hi> how ſtrong the City of <hi>Rochelle</hi> was, and whether the King took it by violence, or whether they ſubmitted themſelves voluntarily. After this Conference had laſted for half an Hour, he diſmiſſed us with great Civility, giving us leave, to go about our Affairs. So we went off with the uſual Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48499:25"/>
and went the ſame Evening into the Market of <hi>Salamine,</hi> to enquire after our Friends, but we found this Market-Town, and alſo all the Neighbourhood ſo ſtrangely ſpoiled, that there were but very few whole Houſes ſtanding. But being that we found none of ours, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any buſineſs there, we returned to our Ship, I found nothing by the way but a few <hi>Caper-buſhes</hi> with ſome <hi>Paliurus's</hi> and <hi>Kali.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the Famous City of</hi> Tripoli, <hi>of its fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neighbourhood, and great Trade: And alſo of the ſplendid Baths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magnificent Buildings, to be ſeen there.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BEfore <hi>Tripoli</hi> near the Sea-ſhore, we ſaw five Caſtles like high Towers diſtant from one an other about a Muſquet-ſhot, where ſome Janiſaries are kept in Garriſon, to cover the Ships in the Harbour (which is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſurrounded with Rocks) and to defend that Cuſtom-houſe, and the ſeveral Ware-houſes (where you may ſee all ſorts of Goods brought from moſt parts of the World) from any hoſtile Attempt or Aſſault: but after the Sun was ſet, and Night began to approach we made what haſte we could to the Town, which was an Hours going diſtant from us. Some <hi>Turks</hi> went with us no other ways armed but with good ſtrong Cudgels, which, as I was told, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly carry to keep off the Wolves called <hi>Jacals</hi> (whereof there are a great many in theſe Countries that are uſed to run, ſeek and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after their Prey in the Night.) While we were a talking of them ſome came up pretty near us, but as ſoon as they ſaw us they turned and ran away. When we came to the Gate of the Town, we found it ſhut up, wherefore one of our Friends (that met us to make us welcom)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48499:26"/>
called to ſome <hi>French</hi> Men that were in their Inn, in their Language called <hi>Fondique,</hi> which is near the Gate, and reacheth quite to the Wall of the Town, and deſired that one of them would take the Pains to go to the <hi>Sangiacho,</hi> to deſire him to let the Gate be opened to let us in, which they were willing to do. But in the mean time that we ſtaid before the Gate, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was an Enemy to our Friend ran alſo away, and beſpoke ſome <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> to ſet upon us, which they were very willing to do, and came with all ſpeed through another Gate that is never ſhut, along the Wall to us, fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares upon us, ſtruck at us, and took hold of us, chiefly at our good Friend, for whoſe ſake all this was done: others drew their Scymmeters upon us, ſo that I thought we ſhould have been all cut to pieces. While this was a doing the Gate was opened, and ſome <hi>French</hi> Men and their <hi>Conſul</hi> himſelf came to our aſſiſtance, and ſpoke to theſe Fellows, earneſtly exhorting them to deſiſt, and to let the Cauſe be decided by the <hi>Sangiacho</hi> and <hi>Cadi,</hi> which at length they did. So we came after this unfriendly welcome in the Croud into their <hi>Fondique,</hi> where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained all that night. The Conſul was very much diſpleaſed at this, conſidering that ſuch like Proceedings would be very troubleſome to them, wherefore he made great Complaints and Enquiries, until at length he found out who was the Author thereof.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning we went to our Friends Houſes in order to ſtay a while with them: in the mean time we walked ſometimes about in our own Cloaths to ſee the Town, which is ſituated in the Country of <hi>Syria,</hi> called <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> which reached along the Sea-ſhore, to <hi>Berinthus,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48499:26"/>
Sidon, Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Acon,</hi> as far to the Mountain of <hi>Carmelus.</hi> The Town <hi>Tripoli</hi> is pretty large, full of People, and of good account, becauſe of the great Depoſition of Merchandizes that are brought thither daily both by Sea and Land, it is ſituated in a pleaſant Country, near the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of the high Mountain <hi>Libanus,</hi> in a great Plain toward the Sea-ſhore, where you may ſee abundance of Vineyards, and very fine Gardens, encloſed with Hedges for the moſt part, conſiſting chiefly of <hi>Rhamnus, Paliurus, Oxyacantha, Phillyrea, Lycium, Balauſtium, Rubus</hi> and little <hi>Palm-Trees,</hi> that are but low, and ſo ſprout and ſpread themſelves. In theſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens as we came in, we found all ſorts of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting and Kitchin-herbs, as <hi>Endive, Lettice, Ruckoli, Aſparagus, Seleri,</hi> whoſe tops are very good to be eaten with Salt and Pepper, but chiefly that ſort that cometh from <hi>Cyprus, Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Tarchon, Cabbages, Colliflowers, Turneps, Horſe-raddiſhes, Carrots,</hi> of the greater ſort of <hi>Fennel, Onions, Garlick,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo Fruit, as <hi>Water-melons, Melons, Gourds, Citruls, Melongena, Seſamum</hi> (by the Natives cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Samſaim</hi>) the Seeds whereof they are very much uſed to ſtrow upon their Bread, and more; but chiefly the <hi>Colocaſia,</hi> which is very common there, and are ſold all the Year long: I have alſo found them grow wild about Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, but could never ſee either Flowers or Seeds on them. I found alſo without the Gardens many <hi>Dates</hi> and white <hi>Mulberry-Trees,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our Aſpen and Nut-Trees in height very much; and alſo <hi>Pomgranat-Trees,</hi> and <hi>Siliqua,</hi> which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call <hi>Xylocerata</hi> the <hi>Arabs, Charnubi.</hi> Alſo <hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>Almond-Trees,</hi> and <hi>Sebeſten,</hi> the Fruit whereof are to be had at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48499:27"/>
Apothecaries Shops by the ſame Name. <hi>Poma Adami Matth</hi>: But in great plenty there are <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Lemons</hi> and <hi>Oranges,</hi> which are as little eaten there as Pears or Crabs here. Between theſe Gardens run ſeveral Roads, and pleaſant Walks, chiefly in the Summer, for they afford many ſhady Places and Greens, where you are defended from the Heat and the Sun-beams: and if paſſing through you ſhould have a mind to ſome of the Fruits, you may either gather ſome that are fallen down, or elſe pull them from the neareſt Trees without danger, and take them home with you.</p>
                  <p>Without at the Sea-ſhore, near the Old Town of <hi>Tripoli</hi> (which together with many more, as <hi>Antiochia, Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. in the Year of our Lord 1183. was ſo deſtroyed by an Earthquake, that nothing but a few Marks remain) there were more Spring-gardens, which ſome of the Merchants ſtill remember. But theſe were a few Years agone by the violence of the Seas ſo deſtroyed, and ſo covered with Sand, that now you ſee nothing there but a ſandy Ground, like unto the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Yet at <hi>Tripoli</hi> they have no want of Water, for ſeveral Rivers flow down from the Mountains, and run partly through the Town; and partly through the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſo that they want no Water neither in the Gardens nor in their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>The New Town in it ſelf is of no ſtrength, for it is ſo meanly walled in, that in ſeveral places in the Night you may get in and out: But within there is a Citadel ſituated upon an aſcent near the Water, where a Garriſon of a few Janiſaries is kept. They have low Houſes ill built and flat at the top, as they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Eaſt, for they cover their Houſes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48499:27"/>
with a flat Roof or a Floor, ſo that you may walk about as far the Houſes go: And the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours walk over the tops of their Houſes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit one another, and ſometimes in the Summer they ſleep on the tops of them: And ſo it may very well be, that the four Men (of which we read in St. <hi>Mark</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> Chapter) that carried the Paralytick Man, and could not come to Chriſt becauſe of the Crowd of the People, did carry him on the tops of the Houſes, and ſo let him down through the Roof into the Room where our Saviour was. They have not great Doors, Gates or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in from the Street as we have in our Country (except ſome few Merchants Houſes) becauſe they uſe neither Wagons nor Carts, wherefore they have only a little low Door, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not above three Foot high, ſo that you cannot go into them without ſtooping. In a great many Houſes the Comings in are ſo dark and deep that one would think he were going into a Cave or Cellar, but when you are come through this Entry into them, you ſee in ſome great Court-yards wherein are Ciſterns to waſh themſelves in, in others large Halls paved, and therein ſome Aſcents that go up two or three Steps, paved delicately with Marble, which they keep very clean, and adorned with rich Tapeſtry, whereupon they ſit, and this is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a large Arch left open at one ſide, that the <hi>Turks</hi> may, chiefly in the Summer, ſit underneath them very airy.</p>
                  <p>Their Doors and Houſes are generally ſhut with wooden Bolts, which are hollow within, and they unlock them with wooden Keys about a Span long, and about the thickneſs of a Thumb, into this Key they have driven, five, ſix, ſeven,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48499:28"/>
eight or nine ſhort Nails, or ſtrong Wires in ſuch an order and diſtance that they juſt fit others that are within the Lock, and ſo pull them forwards or ſhut them backwards as they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Streets are but narrow, paved with broad Stones, and have, chiefly thoſe that are great Roads, a Channel in the middle of them about ten Inches broad, ſo that a laden Camel may walk in them with eaſe, or that a Man may ſtep over them, which they ſay are made that the laden Camels or Aſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that daily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in great Caravans, may be obliged to walk in them one after another, in good order, that People may walk in the Streets without being diſturbed by them. And that theſe Channels may be kept clean and dry, they have in ſome places ſome hidden drains covered with broad Stones, that as well the Rain-water as that of the Wells may run away through them.</p>
                  <p>They cannot brag of any fine Buildings, ſave only the <hi>Moſques</hi> or Temples, into which no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt come, except he hath a mind to be circumciſed, and ſo turn a <hi>Mammeluck</hi> or <hi>Renegado</hi>: And alſo ſome great Houſes by the Natives called <hi>Champ</hi> or <hi>Carvatſcharas, (Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſeries)</hi> wherein are a great many Shops or Ware-houſes, and Chambers by one another, as is in ſtately Cloiſters, in the middle thereof is a great Court-yard, where the ſtrange Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants (that daily bring their Merchandizes in great <hi>Caravans</hi>) do Inn, conſidering that the <hi>Turks</hi> keep no other Inns.</p>
                  <p>The Inns commonly belong to the <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> or his <hi>Baſha,</hi> which they build in ſeveral Towns to get themſelves a yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> do in <hi>Venice</hi> out of the <hi>German</hi> Houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48499:28"/>Beſides theſe Buildings they have alſo Hot-Houſes or <hi>Bagnios,</hi> which are ſo glorious and ſumptuous, that they far exceed all their other Buildings in Beauty, wherefore they are very well worth ſeeing. And becauſe the <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> &amp;c. according to their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Laws are bound to bath themſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to waſh themſelves clean from their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Sins which they daily commit, but chiefly when they are going to their <hi>Moſques,</hi> therefore they have their Hot-houſes always ready, and keep them warm and in an equal heat, with a very ſmall Charge, and with far leſs Wood then one can imagine, all the Week long, both by Night and by Day. They have under-ground a large and deep Vault, like unto a large Cellar, which is every where very cloſe, and it hath no more but two Air holes, one on the top about three or four Inches Diameter, and the other below which is a great deal larger, where they put in Wood, or for want of it pieces of Peat (which they make out of Camels or Goats Dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo out of the Dregs of the preſſed Grapes) theſe are ſo dry that the great Heat melts them juſt like Sea-coals or Turf, which are burnt in the low Countries, and other places where they have not plenty of Wood: and theſe give ſo great a heat that it warmeth the whole Vault quite through. And yet this Vault is ſo cloſe made that you do not perceive the leaſt Smoak nor Vapour, although it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very hot. But that the Fire may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, there is one on purpoſe to attend it, that flings on as much Fuel as is neceſſary to keep it. Theſe Hot-houſes (which according to the Cuſtom of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> are magnificently built) have near to the Entry a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48499:29"/>
delicate Hall which is curiouſly paved; (as alſo is the whole Bath) and ſet with Marbles of all colours very artificially, and a great <hi>Cupolo</hi> at the top thereof, which is covered with an Arch in ſhape of a Ball or Globe. Round about the Walls are broad Benches made, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put off their Cloaths; wherefore this firſt part of the Bath (whereof the Ancients had five) was called <hi>Apodyterium.</hi> In the middle of the Baths is a fine Fountain, where they ſprinkle every one that goeth out of the Bath with ſweet Water, and alſo waſh the Bathing-cloaths that were made uſe of in the Bath, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fling up upon Lines that are hung at the top of the Vault, two or three Fathoms high, with an admirable Certainty, and ſpread them out with a long-Pole, with one-ſtroke (that they may dry the ſooner) ſo even, as if it were done with Hands, which no body can ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admiration; when they have a mind to make uſe of them again, they take them down with the ſame Sticks that are ready ſtuck up about the Fountain. Theſe are wrought finely with all ſorts of Colours, whereof they give two to every one that goeth into the Bath or Bagnio, two others when he cometh out, one to put upon his Head, the other to put about him in the manner of an Apron. When you will go into the Hot-houſe you muſt go through two or three Chambers, whereof one is warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other (which each of them are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with round Arches) until you come into the great Room, theſe Arches are full of round holes all about, which are made in ſuch order, and ſet with Glaſs ſo curiouſly, that they do not only make them very light, but give alſo a fine Ornament to them. In the great Bath are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48499:29"/>
ſeveral great Marble Veſſels which they let the Water into; round about the great Room, there are three or four ſmall Chambers, which they keep chiefly for Perſons of Quality, where they may waſh themſelves apart from others without any diſturbance. Beſides theſe there is ſtill another Room where there is a very great Marble Trough, in which every one may waſh himſelf after his Sweat; there are ſeveral Pipes laid in it, that you may temper your Water ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own deſire. All theſe Rooms are heated with the ſame Fire, and the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> (which two Nations have almoſt the ſame Religion and Ceremonies) go into them very frequently; but chiefly the Women, which flock to them in great numbers, for they never meet any where elſe, but here, and at the Graves of their Relations; wherefore they keep theſe ſumptuous Buildings (the like whereto are hardly any where elſe found) in very good repair. As ſoon as you come into the Hot-houſe, and are grown a little warm one of the Servants (which are generally black <hi>Moors</hi>) meets you, and lays you backwards down upon the Floor, and ſtretcheth and ſnaps all your Joints after ſuch a manner that they crack again; then he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down upon your Arms, which he puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Breaſt one over the other, and holds them ſo for a good while together with his Knees, then he bendeth forwards and ſtretcheth with both his Hands (keeping you ſtill like a Priſoner under him) your Head upwards. (So it happened once, when ſome of us went in together, and were treated by the <hi>Moor</hi> after this manner, that he ſprained the Neck of one of my Companions, ſo that he could not turn his Head in ſeveral Days after it) when this is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48499:30"/>
done he turns you round upon your Belly, toucheth and ſtretcheth your Joints again in ſuch a manner, as if he did malax a Plaiſter; at length he ſtands upon your Shoulder-blades and bending himſelf down, he rubs you all over your Back with his Hands, then he lifteth you up, and goeth away. Then when you lay your ſelf down to reſt you, or to ſweat, he maketh a Paſte, to take of your Hair (for they wear no Hair upon their Body, ſaving only their Arm-pits) he taketh Quick-lime (by the <hi>Arab</hi>'s called <hi>Rils</hi>) and a little <hi>Sarnick, (Arſnick)</hi> that is. Orpiment, powders them, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with Water, and anoints your Hair with it, and looks very often after it, until he finds that the Hair begins to come off, then he waſheth it perfectly off again (before it can hurt you;) when this is done, he takes a fine white Cloth, dips it in Sope-ſuds, and rubs your whole Body over with it. The before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Cloaths are white like unto Cotton, but the Threads are harder, which the Pilgrims bring with them from <hi>Meca:</hi> being made of the Bark of Trees that bear <hi>Bdellium,</hi> and they make Ropes of them, as alſo of the Fibers of the Leaves of <hi>Palm-Trees,</hi> and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Fruit of the ſame Tree (which is of the bigneſs of a Wall-nut) by putting it on a Diſtaff, and ſo ſpinning it out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They waſh Peoples Heads, and mix ſometimes with their Lees (chiefly for Women) an Aſh-coloured Earth called <hi>Nalun,</hi> which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Head, and makes the Hair grow long. They have alſo another Earth called <hi>Juſabar,</hi> which the Women eat frequently, ſo as breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women in our Country uſe to eat ſometimes Coals or other things. Theſe their Baths, are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48499:30"/>
as free to ſtrangers as <hi>Germans, French</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> &amp;c. as to <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> but they muſt have a care not to come into thoſe where the Women are, if they will not run the hazard of their Lives. But that you may know where the Women are, they commonly hang a Cloth over the Door towards the Street, that if any Man ſhould intend to go in there, when he ſeeth this he may find himſelf another entrance.</p>
                  <p>Further concerning their Traffick, there are in the Town (becauſe there is there a very great Depoſition of all ſorts of Merchandizes, that are brought thither from great diſtances) a great many Merchants, chiefly <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> which have two Wiſe, Underſtanding and Grave Preſidents, of which the one that liveth here is a <hi>French</hi> Man, and the other at <hi>Alepo,</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> called Conſuls, to aſſiſt their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with good Counſel. They are ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Government, and confirmed, and have great Priviledges given them of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Emperor, to let the Merchants with their Commodities lodge with them, and to defend them againſt any aſſault of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> that they may trade and deal without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Theſe Conſuls, wear ſtill their uſual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, made of Red Satin, Velvet, or Damask, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> very richly adorned, and they bring along with them, Taylors, Shoe-makers, but chiefly their Phyſicians, Apothecaries, Barber-Surgeons and Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have beſides them their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, skilful in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Language, chiefly the Conſul of <hi>Venice,</hi> becauſe he muſt ſtay there but three Years, when they are expired the <hi>Dogue</hi> ſends another in his place. When the new one is arrived at <hi>Tripoli</hi> he dare
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48499:31"/>
not go on ſhore, before the other gives him a viſit of Reception in the Ship.</p>
                  <p>To theſe two Conſuls there are given two large Buildings, called by them <hi>Fondiques,</hi> ſituated near two Gates of the City, which lead towards the Haven and the Sea-ſhore, that they may the eaſier ſend their Goods in and out. There are all day long a great many <hi>Moors</hi> with their Aſſes, that ſtand waiting for an opportunity to conduct Merchants and Seamen with their Goods in and out. Theſe two Houſes are large, and have abundance of Vaults and Chambers, ſo that there is room enough to lodge both Merchants and their Goods.</p>
                  <p>With the <hi>French</hi> are alſo lodged, thoſe from <hi>Genua, Florence, St. Luck, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo with the <hi>Venetians</hi> thoſe of <hi>Candia, Corfu,</hi> &amp;c. that are under their Maſter's Juriſdiction. Theſe <hi>Fondiques</hi> have no more then one large Gate, where Janiſaries keep watch: when their Maſters the Conſuls go out, they are accompanied with a multitude of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and their Servants, and they are in great Authority with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> himſelf: They always take along with them their Janiſaries, which go before with great and long Cudgels, and beat the People out of the way (even the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves.)</p>
                  <p>The Merchants have daily great Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Jews,</hi> for they know a great many Languages, and the Prizes of all Merchandizes, how to buy and to ſell them; wherefore they always help to conclude Bargains in Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, pay the Money and give Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, wherefore they have their Broakage. I have ſeen chiefly three ſorts of their Silver
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48499:31"/>
Coins, <hi>viz. Aſpers, Medin</hi> and <hi>Saiject,</hi> which are very good, and paſs through all <hi>Turky.</hi> When great Sums are paid, they do not tell the whole, but only part of it, and weigh it, and ſo take the reſt proportionably by the ſame weight. Of Gold Coins they have only Ducats which are made of fine Gold, and are very limber: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe you hardly ſee any other Coins, but <hi>Venetian Ducats, French Teſtons, Joachims Thalers,</hi> of which they have ſo many, that they often do not only pay with them great Sums and their Bills of Exchange, but turn them alſo into their own Coin. So that there is abundance of <hi>Jews</hi> through all <hi>Turky</hi> in any Trading-Town, but chiefly in <hi>Alepo,</hi> and in this Town of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> where they have built a very large Habitation, and a delicate Synagogue. Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> have the Revenues of Cuſtoms of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in their hands, ſo that nothing can be brought in or out, but it muſt go through their hands, which is very troubleſome to the Merchants. Thoſe that buy any thing of them, muſt have a ſpecial care, that they be not cheated, for they are full of it, inſomuch as they confeſs of themſelves, that no body can get any thing by them, except he will be a greater <hi>Harmani</hi> (that is cheat) than they, that dare to ſell Wall-nuts, for Nutmegs or Myrobolans.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Merchandizes: if one will ſee ſeveral ſorts of Goods they are to be found in the <hi>Carvatſcharas</hi> or <hi>Champen,</hi> whereof I have made mention before, but chiefly in the <hi>Batzaren,</hi> or Houſes where they buy and ſell, or Exchanges. Theſe Exchanges are wide and long, and partly arched, partly covered with Timber, that you may walk and trade there without being wetted, they have Shops on both ſides, which are alſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48499:32"/>
kept by Handicrafts, Tradeſmen, as Shoe-makers, Taylors, Sadlers, Silk-embroiderers, Turners, Copper-ſmiths, Cutlers, Woollen-drapers, Grocers, Fruiterers, Cooks, and many more, which are very orderly diſtributed and placed in their ſeveral Streets and Places. They alſo drive a great Trade in Silk, and there are a great many that deal in nothing elſe, but Silk, which is convey'd thither from the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent places, for Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> is inhabited by a numberleſs People, that live by ſpinning and working of Silk, but chiefly they of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where is ſuch plenty of Silk, that a Merchant may quickly lay out in it many thouſand Ducats: Becauſe of the great abundance of white Mulberry-Trees (by the Natives called <hi>Tut</hi>) which grow there ſo high and large, that they have plenty of Leaves to feed their Silk-worms: But the Mulberries thereof are white, and they carry them about in Baskets to ſell to ordinary People. So there is in the <hi>Batzars</hi> many Silk-workers, which make all ſorts of Embroidery, as Purſes, Buttons, and Girdles or Saſhes of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which they tie about their Loins; theſe are at work before their Shops, that every one may ſee them. When they work, or tie two Threads together, they hold the Work oftener with their great Toe, then pin it to any thing, and the ſame do the Turners, (which ſitting to it) hold their turning Irons as well with their Toes as with their Fingers. Further at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time of the Year there is brought from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> and other adjacent places, to theſe <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> ſo great a quantity of large and well-taſted Cibebs, a kind of Raiſins, having but one or no Stone, that ſeveral Ship loads are ſent from thence to us. Theſe and the like Goods are daily
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48499:32"/>
brought and found in their <hi>Batzars,</hi> as rare Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry and delicately wrought Silks with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Roſes of ſeveral colours, ſome of which look like pure Gold. But of all the Trades-men there are not ſo many of one ſort as of them that only deal in Soap and Pot-aſhes, for of theſe Aſhes (beſides Soap) ſeveral Ship-loads are yearly ſent from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> which they uſe for making of Glaſe as well as Soap. Theſe Aſhes are made chiefly of a Herb called by the <hi>Arabians Schivan,</hi> whereof there are two ſorts (which amongſt others I have paſted upon Paper) one whereof is not unlike to our little <hi>Kali,</hi> it is a thick and knobby Plant, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmall Sprigs growing out of it, which have ſeveral full Buttons at the top, and underneath ſmall pointed Leaves, juſt like the leſſer <hi>Kali,</hi> as I ſaid before, taſting ſomewhat ſharp, the Leaves thereof are underneath white, and on the other ſide of the colour of Aſhes. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort becometh alſo many Stalks, which are full of knots like our Equiſetum, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them appears a Woody and Aſh-coloured Root.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe Herbs grow thereabout in great quantities, and are burnt into Aſhes upon the high Mountains, in burning thereof there ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleth an Oily Matter underneath towards the bottom, which united with the Aſhes is almoſt as hard as a Stone when it is cold: at the top thereof a part of the Aſhes remains unmix'd and looſe, therefore it is not ſo good as the reſt. Theſe aſhes are brought down from the Mountains upon Camels backs by the <hi>Moors,</hi> to ſome Merchants that drive a great Trade with them, for partly they ſend away into Foreign parts, and partly they make Soap of them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48499:33"/>
ſome more, ſome leſs, according to every one's Capacity and Pleaſure. The way they make their Soap in <hi>Syria,</hi> I am informed is this, <hi>viz.</hi> They take commonly Twelve hundred weight (or twelve Centners) of theſe Aſhes, which in the Summer they divide into Eight, and in the Winter into Four parts, becauſe the Soap is ſooner boil'd up in Winter (for the Heat being then included by the outward Cold is more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement) then in Summer. Of this they take firſt one part and make it into a good ſharp Lye, which they pour into a very large Kettle or Caldron made of Stone, with a large bottom made of a Copper-plate, and very thick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have before put Sixteen hundred weight of Sallet-Oil, and let it ſimper for twenty four Hours, pouring daily in more Lye of another part. But before it is quite boil'd up (which in Winter requireth perhaps five Days, and in Summer nine or ten) they take an Hundred weight of Quick-lime, and mixing it with the Aſhes, draw a Lye from it, which they put two days before it is quite enough into the Caldron, more or leſs according as they find it thick or thin. But if it ſhould happen, that there ſhould be too much of the Lye in the Kettle, they have a Cock coming out of the Copper-plate, whereby they let out as much of the Lye as is convenient. When it is almoſt boil'd up, they take out, with a Copper-kettle that holds eight or ten Pounds, the thicker part of the Soap that ſwimmeth on the top, and pour it upon the Floor, which is covered with Lime or Chalk beaten to Powder, let it lie there for one Day in the Winter, and two Days in the Summer, and it grows ſo hard that they can walk over it, then they make it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48499:33"/>
ſmooth, cut it into ſquare pieces, and put their Mark upon it.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE City of <hi>Tripoli</hi> is, as well as a great many more of the adjacent Towns and Provinces, ſubject to the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor,</hi> wherein he hath his Officers, as in all other places, that they may be ruled according to his Pleaſure, and protected from all aſſaults and dangers. Such Superiors are by them called <hi>Sangiacks</hi> or <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> which we may render State-holders, which have ſeveral hundred Horſe-men under their Command, more or leſs according to the Revenues of the Provinces that are committed to their care. Theſe are brave and experienced Souldiers, that lead their Men out into the Fields ſeveral times in the Week, to exerciſe them, the Horſe-men in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the Foot in Shooting with Bows and Arrows, which have their ſeveral Marks done upon high Poles to ſhoot at in their running, that if there ſhould be occaſion they may be ready to take the Field preſently to fight their Enemies. Theſe <hi>Sangiachi</hi> have other Captains and Commanders under them, of which the <hi>Soubaſhaws</hi> or Judges are the Chief, theſe are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48499:34"/>
placed by him round about in the adjacent places, to officiate for him where he cannot be preſent. To ſuch places are commonly called the Burgers or Citizens of the ſame places, and they continue no longer then half a Year. By them are examined all Criminal Matters, and they have Power to examine and put to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all Malefactors, to make them confeſs their Crimes. They alſo accompany the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors that are Sentenced and Condemned by the <hi>Cady</hi> to the place of Execution, to ſee the Sentence duly executed: So I have ſeen them often to ride along, but chiefly at one time with a poor Malefactor condemned to die, who was carried on a Camel's back, tied with his Back to a Croſs, with his Arms extended, to the place of Execution, and between the Croſs and his Shoulders were put two burning Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es prepared with Bacon, ſo that the Greaſe ran all over his Body, and burnt it ſeverely. The <hi>Turks</hi> have alſo for ſeveral Crimes (whereof there are a great many) their ſeveral Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as for Thieves and Murtherers the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for Traytors impaling, and for them that kill a Man Beheading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo they keep a great many Servants, which they ſend out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, to bring to them any that are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have tranſgreſſed the Laws, by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wounding one another (which happens very ſeldom) by Stealing or Murthering, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
                  <p>For any other Tranſgreſſions beſides theſe, the <hi>Turks</hi> are brought before other Magiſtrates, called <hi>Cadi,</hi> which are to underſtand the Laws, and to Judge, and to pronounce Sentence after they have examin'd the Witneſſes. If it be for Debt, they are immediately caſt into Priſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48499:34"/>
they pay, or find out any other means, to make up the Debt. But if it be for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Laws, they are ſeverely fined, or elſe puniſhed with blows. Wherefore alſo their <hi>Cadi</hi> keep ſeveral Men and Spies, which they daily ſend out, to find out any, that tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Laws in drinking of Wine, in not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prayers frequently, in not ſtrictly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Faſts, or in tranſgreſſing the Laws any other ways. If they find any, they ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them before their <hi>Cadi,</hi> who puniſhes them according to the default, with a pecuniary Mulct, or if they have no Money to give, he Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences them to receive a certain number of Blows upon the Soals of their Feet, and beſides pay half a Penny for each blow. Being that a great many of ſuch Tranſgreſſors are daily brought before him, whereof the greateſt part receive Blows, it cauſeth ſo miſerable a howling and crying, that we might plainly hear it in the <hi>French Fondique,</hi> which is juſt over againſt it: and although the <hi>Cadi</hi> is very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſuch Tranſgreſſors, yet Matrimonial Cauſes take him up a great deal more time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that will Marry muſt come to him, and make their Agreements and Contracts, which are conſigned into his Books, partly that they may have them to ſhew if any Differences ſhould ariſe between them (ſeeing that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> have ſeveral Wives, and are divorced again for a ſmall matter) and partly that they may give them Copies of their Contracts upon their Marriages, which they write for ordinary People upon ſmooth and plain Paper, but for others that are rich upon a piece of white Sattin, about a Yard long. Theſe their Contracts they comprehend in a few Words, and draw them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48499:35"/>
up ſo ſhort, that they ſcarce contain above eight or ten Lines apiece, at leaſt two Inches diſtant from one another. For this purpoſe they keep ſeveral Clerks, which oftener write upon their Knees then upon Desks or Tables. Theſe <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giachs, Soubaſhaws</hi> and <hi>Cadis,</hi> of which I have made mention before, and alſo their Wives go very richly cloathed with rich flower'd Silks, artificially made and mix'd of ſeveral colours. But theſe Cloaths are commonly given them by thoſe that have Cauſes depending before them (for they do not love to part with their own Money) to promote their Cauſe, and to be favourable to them: for they are ſo very covetous, that where there is nothing given them, there they do but little, for the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and <hi>Sangiachi</hi> (which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> rule Kingdoms and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities) know very well that they muſt rule but three Years in the ſame place: For as ſoon as their <hi>Sultan</hi> commands them they muſt go to another place, perhaps far diſtant from that place. Wherefore they always ſtrive after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Riches, that they may either by Gift or Favour be by the Court promoted, to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority and Office, or elſe if that cannot be obtained, they may at leaſt lay up in the mean time ſuch Riches, that they may be able to maintain themſelves after the ſame Greatneſs, as they did before.</p>
                  <p>When I lived there, a new <hi>Sangiach</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted into the place of the old one, who made his entrance followed by his <hi>Spahis,</hi> and was honourably received by the Town: his Train conſiſted moſt in Horſe, and Archers with Arms and Shields very well ſtored, they alſo had Drums and Kettle-drums, and other Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Sabers or Scyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48499:35"/>
were for the moſt part tipp'd up a great way with ſome gilded Metal, and very ſmooth and ſhining, and ſo were their Stirups, that at a diſtance they made a great gliſtering.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Officers, love to be look'd upon, as if they performed their Office with great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and yet they are ſo addicted to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs (which is the root of all Evil) that, for Gifts or Bribes, they let the falſe Depoſitions of thoſe that out of Spite accuſe the innocent paſs for Good. Therefore it is a very eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for any one that would be revenged of his Enemy (by way of a ſmall preſent) to bring him into great trouble and coſts. The <hi>Souba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws</hi> are of the ſame Stamp, for they do not at all ſtick to puniſh for Lucre-ſake, the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, chiefly if they be Rich and Strangers: their Men are very well skill'd in theſe Affairs, to find one trifle or other againſt them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their time is alſo but ſhort, therefore they make all poſſible ſpeed to grow rich: and this ſo much the bolder and opener as they need not to fear their <hi>Sangiach,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> nor <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> for they wink at it, as being Sharers of the Prey, that receive their Dividend Weekly. In ſhort, let one have committed never ſo much Evil, if he giveth but Money to them all is well, and he is as good again as ever he was before. Seeing that many, chiefly in Law Suits, are wrong'd by them, therefore higher Judges (called <hi>Cadileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi>) are ſet over them, to puniſh them for their Roguery: theſe are eſteemed by the <hi>Turks</hi> to be the principal Teachers of the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Faith and Laws, they are generally grave and underſtanding Men, before whom are brought all intricate Cauſes and Appeals to be decided, and they have Power to puniſh theſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48499:36"/>
and other Officers, but chiefly the <hi>Cadis,</hi> and to put them in and out, according to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, wherefore they often take their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits from Town to Town, to ſee how the <hi>Cadis</hi> execute Juſtice, wherefore they are very much afraid of their coming, and if they know themſelves guilty of any Miſdemeanors, they oftentimes run away. If they are complained of by the People, they are preſently puniſhed, with many blows, put out of their places, and if the Crime be great, they are after behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrangled, burnt, or other ways executed, and this happeneth very often in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But if one or more, that were alſo wronged by the <hi>Cadi,</hi> could not ſtay till the Arrival of the <hi>Cadileſchier,</hi> to make their Complaints to him, they have another way, that is to make their Complaints to the <hi>Port,</hi> or the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s <hi>Court,</hi> or elſe to go themſelves, and make their complaints in Perſon, where they are ſpeedily heard (for ſuch Cauſes as I am inform'd are heard certainly once in fifteen days) and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If any be poor he is maintained by the Court until his Cauſe is ended.</p>
                  <p>Such a Cauſe did formerly happen to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Conſul, who being very well to paſs, a <hi>Soubaſhaw</hi> did ſtrive to make booty of him: but not being able to prove any thing againſt him whereby he could make him puniſhable, he found at length a way, and got one of his Servants to hide a common Whore in the Interpreter's Houſe, unknown to him, that he might have ſufficient cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him. This being done, the Servants of the <hi>Cadi</hi> broke into the Houſe, and ſearched it, and finding this Whore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they put him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Interpreter, notwithſtanding he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48499:36"/>
his innocency, and that he was totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Fact, yet could not ſatisfie the <hi>Cadi</hi> by any means, but was condemned by him in Nine hundred Ducats, which he was forced to pay. This troubling the Interpreter, he could not brook this unjuſt Impoſition (being an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Man, well skill'd in their Laws) wherefore he took Horſe immediately (unknown to the <hi>Cadi</hi>) for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he made his Complaints to the Court himſelf ſo well, and with that Succeſs, that he was declared innocent and not guilty of the Fact. But as this Court uſually doth ſeverely puniſh thoſe that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Injuſtice, ſo this <hi>Cadi</hi> did not eſcape: for within a little while after the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor</hi> ſent to him a <hi>Chiausbaſhaw</hi> (which may be compared to an Executioner) with a little Note, whereof the Contents were to ſend him his Head by the Bearer, which frighted the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man very much, but yet (after by a peculiar Favour he had taken his leave of his Wife) ſubmitted himſelf to it. This is the Reaſon, That many ill Intentions and Deſigns (chiefly if one ſummoned the other to appear at the Court before the Emperor) are ſtopt and drawn back, which elſe would have taken effect and been gone on with all.</p>
                  <p>If a Man appeareth before any <hi>Turk</hi> that is a Perſon of Quality, he muſt have eſpecial care, that chiefly in departing he do not turn his back-ſide towards him, for this is accounted the greateſt Incivility and Affront that can be given throughout all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. Nay if a Servant appears before his Maſter to ask him forgiveneſs of his Faults, he uſeth pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Ceremonies, firſt he ſubmitteth himſelf, and ſheweth his Maſter all reſpect imaginable, then
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48499:37"/>
he taketh with his Knees bended, his Maſter's Hands to kiſs them: if his Maſter lets him have them freely, he is in good hopes that his Maſter will grant him his requeſt, but if not, but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them back, although he maketh ſeveral proffers towards them, he knoweth certainly that he is ſtill out of favour, and that there is but ſmall hopes of obtaining his Intention.</p>
                  <p>They love that one ſhould bear a great deal of Honour and Reſpect towards them, for they know that their Maſters the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Power hath for a long time paſt, not been decreaſing but always increaſing; wherefore they take very much upon themſelves, and are always richly cloathed, and ride delicate Horſes, well adorn'd with ſtately Accoutrements, with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Saddles, and Saddle cloths of Scarlet, Velvet, or other Silks, the Bridles and Stirrups well garniſhed with Silver and Gold.</p>
                  <p>They commonly ſpeak in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (and ſo do all that lie about in Garriſons) which is a very Manly one, and ſounds in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing much like unto our <hi>German</hi> Tongue: but they alſo generally are expert in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, which is the common one there to the whole Country, and goeth through many Provinces: for you meet there with many <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, Syrians, Jacobites,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſtians and Heathens to whom this Speech is common.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have alſo ſome very fine Manners and Cuſtoms, they are affable, they begin their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (chiefly to Relations and Acquaintance) with a friendly Salutation and Kiſſing: but they are alſo lazy, and do not eſteem the liberal Arts and Sciences, love Idleneſs better than Labour, for you ſhall ſee them ſpend a whole Day in the Game of Cheſſe, and other Games, and in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48499:37"/>
playing on their (Quinterns) Guitarhs which have three, five, ſeven, and ſometimes eleven Strings, as I have ſeen them with the Muſicians of the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> ſeveral times: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly play only with their Fore-finger, or a piece of a Quill, they walk about with them in the Streets (chiefly the Souldiers) all day long, and ſo uſe themſelves to Lazineſs and Leachery, and contaminate themſelves with all ſorts of terrible, and chiefly Sodomitical Sins, which by them (becauſe both high and low are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty thereof) are not at all puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>They love to wear good Cloaths (but do not care they ſhould coſt them much) of light co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; their upper Garments which hang down very long before, ſet with Buttons, under which they wear other Coats inſtead of Doublets, which (commonly thoſe of the Souldiers) are made of blew Cloth, ſomewhat ſhorter before then behind, with white Sleeves, and without Collars about the Neck, and ſo are their Shirts, which generally are wrought of Cotten, and cut about the Neck as wide as their Cloaths: inſtead of Bands they wear Neck-cloths, which they wrap about their naked Necks to defend them from the violent Heat of the Sun. They alſo, chiefly in the Summer wear white and wide Cotten Drawers, which reach to their Ancles, and are much narrower below; to them they have no Cod-pieces (which they do not ſuffer others to wear) that they may waſh themſelves without hinderance, their Private parts, Feet, Arms, Necks or any other parts, to cleanſe themſelves as often as their Laws ſhall direct them. Theſe Drawers they tie about their middle with ſome Strings or Bands about their naked Body, and let their Shirts hang down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48499:38"/>
them. When they have occaſion to make Water, they untie their Drawers again, ſit down, and caſt their Cloaths round about them like Women, turn themſelves from the South, to which they turn when they are going to pray. If they ſee a Man make his water ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they immediately conclude him to be a Chriſtian, and none of their Faith. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſit with their Legs laid one over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which they do every where in the Eaſt) wherefore they have neither Chair nor Table, but inſtead thereof, they have a paved place two or three ſteps high, which is arched over head, which they keep very clean, and cover it with Tapeſtry, or Serge, or Mats finely twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeveral colours, according to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: wherefore to ſave them, the <hi>Turks</hi> pull of their Shoes and leave them at the Chamber-door. Their Shoes are like unto thoſe our Lacques uſe to wear, and like Slippers eaſie to be put on and off, they commonly are of a white or blew colour, painted before, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath defended with Nails before, and with Horſe-ſhoes behind; theſe are worn by young and old, Men and Women, rich and poor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe they alſo wear ſometimes wooden Shoes, which are to be ſold every where, they are about three Inches high, and in the middle underneath carved out, to diſtinguiſh the Soals from the Heels, painted with ſeveral colours: the ſame wear the Women, which have almoſt the ſame Garments with the Men, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Drawers, which ſometimes are ſo long that they hang out before their Coats: they are commonly made of fine Cotton of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and laced at the ſides. You very ſeldom ſee any <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women either in the Streets or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48499:38"/>
in the Markets to buy Proviſion, or in their Churches, where only the chiefeſt of them come, (and that but ſeldom) where they have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar place ſeparated from the Men. They have alſo in their Houſes ſecret places and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, where they hide themſelves immediately, if any body ſhould come to ſee their Houſholds. When they go abroad, which is very ſeldom, you ſee three or four of them together with their Children, which are all one Man's, for according to their Law they are allowed to take as many as they can maintain. Their Faces are all covered with black Vails, whereof ſome are of fine Silk, and ſome of Horſe-hair, which the poorer ſort wear: and over their Head they put ſome white Scarfs made of Cotton, which are ſo broad that they cover not only their Heads but their Arms and Shoulders, they look in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like our Maids, when to keep themſelves from the Wet, they put a Table-cloth or Sheets over their Heads. But becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> are very Jealous, therefore their Wives ſeldom meet in the Streets or Markets, but only in the Hot-houſes, or when they go to viſit the Tombs of their deceaſed Parents or Relations, which generally are out of the Town near the High-ways. When they go thither they take along with them Bread, Cheeſe, Eggs, and the like to eat there (which was called <hi>Parentalia</hi> by the Latins) juſt as the Heathens uſed to do in former Ages: and ſometimes they leave ſome of their Chear behind them, that the Beaſts and Birds may eat it after they are gone, for they believe, that ſuch good beſtowed upon the Beaſts is as accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, as if it were beſtowed on Men. Their Graves are commonly hollow covered at the top with great Stones, which are like unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48499:39"/>
Childrens Bed-ſteads in our Country, which are high at the head and feet, but hollowed in the middle; they fill them up with Earth, wherein they commonly plant fine Herbs, but chiefly Flags, they alſo put ſome green Myrtles in little Air-holes that are round the Tombs, and they are of opinion that their Relations are the happier the longer theſe remain green, and retain their colour, And for the ſake of this Superſtition, there are in ſeveral places of the Town Myrtles to be ſold that ſtand in Water, that they may remain freſh, which the Women buy to ſtick up at the Graves of their Relations. Their Burying-places are always out of Town near the High-ways, that any body that goeth by may be put in mind of them, and pray to God for them, which is the reaſon that ſo many Chappels are built about their Burying-places, that People that go by (chiefly the Relations of the deceaſed) may go into them to pray to God on their behalf. When any of them dieth they waſh him, and put on his beſt Cloaths, then they lay him on a Bar or Board, and ſtrow him with Sweet-ſmelling Herbs and Flowers, leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Face bare, that every body may look upon him that knoweth him, as he is carried out. If it be a <hi>Tſchelebii,</hi> that is a Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they put his Helmet and his other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at his Head, his Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which go before and follow the Corps, keep no order, but hang upon one another, as if they were fudled, and go merrily, and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along to the Grave: as alſo do the Women, who come behind and hollow ſo loud, that you may hear them a great way off.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Deſcription of the Plants I gathered at</hi> Tripoli.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>COnſidering that I undertook this Journey into the Eaſtern Countries, not only to ſee theſe People, and to obſerve their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo, and that principally, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to enquire, and to ſearch out the Plants that were growing there. I cannot but ſhortly deſcribe thoſe I found about <hi>Tripoli</hi> during my ſtay there, and will begin with ſuch as grew on the Sea-ſhores, which were: <hi>Medica marina, Gnaphalium marinum, Leucoium marinum, Juncus maritimus, Peplis, Scammonium Monſpelienſe,</hi> which the Natives call <hi>Meudheuds</hi>; but <hi>Rhaſis</hi> in his Book <hi>ad Almanſ.</hi> calleth it <hi>Coriziala, Braſſica marina,</hi> which ſpreads its Roots above the Sand for ſome Cubits round, and has inſtead of round Leaves rather ſquare ones. A kind of wild white Lillies by the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hemerocallis,</hi> which did not only grow on the Sea-ſhore, but alſo in Iſlands thereabout in great plenty; with a great many others, which I forbear to mention here, being common: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Cuſtom-houſe, near the Harbour, I found in the Ruines of the old Wall that are left of that City, <hi>Hyoſcyamus,</hi> and hard by it in the Sand an Herb not unlike unto <hi>Cantabrica ſecunda Caroli Cluſii,</hi> ſaving only the Stalks and Leaves which are woolly. But the <hi>Ricinus</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48499:40"/>
there above all in ſo great plenty, that you can hardly make your way through it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants call it ſtill by its old <hi>Arabian</hi> Name <hi>Kerva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you turn from thence to the High-way towards your Right-hand, you ſee the <hi>Tythimalus Paralius,</hi> and alſo a kind of <hi>Conyza Dioſc.</hi> out of one Root there ſpring up ſeveral Stalks, whereof ſome grow upright, but the greater part of them lie down upon the ground, and ſo ſhoot new Roots, which afterwards ſprout out into new Stalks: it beareth long Olive-leaves, which are thick, fattiſh, and ſomewhat woolly, and have a ſtrong, and equally ſweet ſmell: for the reſt, as the Flowers, it is very like unto the great one. You find there alſo the leſſer and greater <hi>Medica,</hi> which the <hi>Moors</hi> to this day ſtill call <hi>Faſa.</hi> Likewiſe ſo great and many <hi>Squills,</hi> that the Inhabitants weed them up, chiefly thoſe that grow near their Gardens, and fling them up in high heaps like Stones. There alſo groweth <hi>Securidaca minor, Tribulus terreſtris,</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Haſeck,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Echium,</hi> which groweth by the way as you go to St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Church, which from thence is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon an aſcent at a Mile's diſtance. Hereabout, and in other adjacent places, groweth a great quantity of Sugar-canes, ſo that there is year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold a great many Sugar-loaves that are made thereof. Theſe are as high and big as our Canes, and not much differing from them, but within, and down towards the Root, where they are beſt, they are full of this pleaſant Juice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> buy a great many of them, being very pleaſant to them to chew and eat, for they are mightily pleaſed with Sweet-meats (whereof they have variety.) Before
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48499:40"/>
they begin to eat or chew them, they ſtript off the long Leaves and cut away what is taſteleſs, ſo that only the juicy and good remaineth, which is hardly two Foot. Of the thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Canes they carry many along with them through the Streets, and cut off one piece after another, skale them, and ſo chew and eat them openly every where in the Street without ſhame; for they are, principally near the Root, very tender and feel as mellow between your Teeth as if it were Sugar it ſelf. So the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe themſelves to Gluttony, and are no more ſo free and couragious to go againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to fight as they have been in former Ages. The Sugar Canes do not grow there from Seeds, neither are they propagated by the Root, but by the Canes themſelves, whereof they lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ground, ſome green pieces of two or three Joints long, and that they may grow the ſooner, they bore prety large holes in between the Joints; when they begin to grow they ſprout out in the Joints, and grow up into great Canes, and ſo bring in good profit.</p>
                  <p>There alſo by the Rivers are found <hi>Anthillis marina, Viſnaga,</hi> the firſt <hi>Apocymum,</hi> and <hi>Olean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with Purple Flowers, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Defle,</hi> and a delicate kind of <hi>Scabioſa Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſra Maluca,</hi> and if you go to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, you ſee <hi>Heliotropium majus, Convolvulus folio acuto, Vitis nigra, Phaſeolus Turcicus,</hi> with yellow Flowers, which ſtill retain the ancient Name of <hi>Lubie, Lyſimachia lutea,</hi> and wild Vines called <hi>Labruſcae,</hi> whereon nothing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but only the Flowers called <hi>Ocnanthe</hi>: and alſo a Shrub like unto the <hi>Polygonus of Carol Cluſius</hi>; which climbs up into high Trees, and hang down again from the Twigs,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48499:41"/>
and I very believe they are the ſame with <hi>Ephedra,</hi> whereof <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh mention in the 7<hi>th</hi> Chapter of his 26<hi>th</hi> Book.</p>
                  <p>When I went farther, with an intention to conſider the Plants that grew in the Country, firſt came before me ſome <hi>Sycomors,</hi> whereof chiefly <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tell us of two ſorts, and when I called theſe things to mind, I light of one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort of <hi>Sycomors,</hi> whereof abundance grow in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> wherefore theſe wild Figg-Trees might be called the one the <hi>Cypriſh Sycomore</hi>-Tree, and the other the <hi>Aegyptian Sycomore</hi>-Tree, according to the places where they are moſt frequent and fruitful. I found a great many of them, the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> call them <hi>Mumeitz,</hi> they are as great and as high as the white <hi>Mulberry</hi>-Trees, and have almoſt the ſame Leaves, but they are only ſomewhat rounder, and are alſo whole at or about the ſides, they bear Fruit not unlike to our Figg-Trees, only they are ſweeter, and have no little Seeds within, and are not ſo good, wherefore they are not eſteemed, and are commonly ſold only to the poorer ſort of People, they grow in all Fields and Grounds, as you may ſee by the Words of the ſecond Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> in the 9<hi>th.</hi> Chap. Verſ. 27<hi>th. And the King made Silver in Jeruſalem as Stones, and Cedar-Trees made he as the Sycomore-Trees that are in the low Plains in abundance. Zacheus</hi> did climb upon ſuch a one when he had a great mind to ſee our Saviour, <hi>Eſſaias</hi> alſo maketh mention of them in his 9<hi>th. Chap. Verſ.</hi> 10. and <hi>Amos</hi> in his 7<hi>th. Chap. Verſ.</hi> 14. where he ſaith of himſelf: <hi>I was a Herds-man, and a Gatherer of Sycomore-Fruit.</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48499:41"/>
Theſe two ſorts are very like one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Stem, Leaves, and Fruit, only as the Fruit of the one comes more out of the great Stem and great Twigs, ſo that of the other does the ſame, but not out of the Stems and Twigs immediately, but out of Twigs or Sprouts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Leaves of the length of five or ſix Inches, whereon they grow ſometimes very thick, and in a bunch together. Theſe Trees bear Fruit three or four times yearly, which are ſmall, of an Aſh colour, oblong round, like Prunes, and are found upon the Trees almoſt all the Year long. Hereabout alſo grow many Thorns, whereof is made mention in the Scriptures, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Hauſeit,</hi> and by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians Hauſegi,</hi> but the <hi>Latins</hi> call them <hi>Ahamnus,</hi> and alſo white Poplars, ſtill to this day called <hi>Haur</hi> by the <hi>Arabians.</hi> There alſo groweth a great and high Tree which beareth delicate Leaves and Flowers pleaſant to look upon (by the Inhabitants called <hi>Zenſetacht,</hi> but by <hi>Rhazes</hi> and <hi>Avicenna, Aſtirgar, &amp; Aſtergir,</hi> and <hi>Azada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racht</hi>) whereof you ſee here and there ſeveral planted in the Streets, to make a pleaſant Shade in the Summer, the Fruit thereof remaineth upon them all the Year long, until they put out again a new, for they are hurtful, and kill the Dogs if they eat thereof.</p>
                  <p>Near the Town upon the Highlands (where you ſee abundance of Corn-fields, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of pleaſant Olive-Trees, that reach quite up to Mount <hi>Libanus</hi>) are found <hi>Polium monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Pecten veneris, ferrum equinum, Chamaeleon niger,</hi> with its ſharp pointed and black Roots and Leaves, very like unto the Leaves of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> whereof the Stalks are of a reddiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a Span long, and of the thickneſs of a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48499:42"/>
Finger: whereon are ſmall prickly Heads, of a blewiſh colour, not unlike to theſe of the little <hi>Eryngium.</hi> Another fine Plant grows therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, called <hi>Sathar</hi> in their Language, but when I conſider its beautiful Purple-coloured Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and its ſmall Leaves which are ſomething long withall, I rather judge it to be the <hi>Haſce</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> or the true <hi>Thyme</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> which we call <hi>Serpillum Romanum.</hi> It hath ſo pleaſant an Acrimony, as any Spice can have, wherefore the Inhabitants uſe it very much, whole or in pouder, at home and abroad, with and without their Meat, chiefly for to correct an ill digeſtion of their Stomach. This Herb is never found in our Apothecaries Shops, they take another in its room, which hath leſſer and greener Heads, and is rather the firſt <hi>Satureia</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> brought from <hi>Candia.</hi> There are alſo two ſorts of <hi>Clinopodium,</hi> whereof the leſſer and tenderer (conſidering its long Stalks, Leaves and Flowers, which grow in good order, and at equal diſtances one over the other) may very well be taken for the true one of the <hi>Dioſc.</hi> There are alſo <hi>Ilex minor, Sabina baccifera, Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binthus</hi> and many more.</p>
                  <p>In the Town are found ſeveral ſtrange Plants, one called <hi>Muſa,</hi> whereof the Stalks are from nine to twelve Foot high, which are ſmooth, and without (they are incloſed in their Leaves, and often quite ſurrounded like our Reeds) of a fine ſhining Green; at the top thereof the Leaves ſpread themſelves out, and look like a great buſh of Feathers, for they are very long, and ſo broad that the biggeſt Perſon may lie upon them with his whole Body very well. Theſe Leaves have a rib in the middle, which keepeth them up ſtreight, and ſo ſtrongly, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48499:42"/>
although the Wind breaketh them at the ſides in ſeveral places, yet notwithſtanding they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upright. Theſe Trees bear their Fruit no more but once, wherefore they are cut down, and ſo the Root ſhoots out ſeveral other Stalks about a Foot diſtant from the old one, which grow up again, and bring forth Fruit, which groweth on a thick Stalk in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; they are almoſt ſhaped like the <hi>Citruls,</hi> round and bended, only they are leſs, ſmooth without, environed with a thick rind, which is firſt yellow, but when they are kept a few days it grows black, it is eaſily ſeparated when they are new, within they are whitiſh, full of Seeds; ſweet and good to eat; but they fill mightily, and are apt to gripe: wherefore (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> mentioneth in the 5th. Chapter of his 4th. Book) <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, forbid his Army to eat them, when he went into the <hi>Indies.</hi> There groweth but very little of this Fruit about <hi>Tripoli,</hi> but it is brought from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places plentifully. We alſo find there another Tree, not unlike unto our <hi>Privett,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Alcanna,</hi> or <hi>Henne,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> in their vulgar Tongue <hi>Schenna,</hi> which they have from <hi>Egypt,</hi> where (but above all in <hi>Cayro</hi>) they grow in abundance. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> nurſe theſe up with great care and diligence, becauſe of their ſweet-ſmelling Flowers, and put them into earthen Pots, or wooden Caſes or Boxes, to keep them in the Winter in Vaults from the Froſt, which they cannot endure. And becauſe they hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſprout before <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they water them with Soapſuds, but others lay Lime about the Root, to make it put forth the earlier, that it may flower the ſooner, becauſe of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48499:43"/>
of the Smell of the Flowers, which is ſomewhat like Musk: They are of a pale yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour, and ſtand in Spikes of the length of a Span, but not very cloſe, ſo that Leaves appear between them; Their Twigs are alſo of the ſame colour, whereof many ſent to us, to cleanſe the Teeth with them, as it were with a Bruſh, when they are bruiſed a little at the ends. They alſo (as I am informed) keep their Leaves all Winter, which Leaves they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and mix with the Juice of Citrons, and ſtain therewith, againſt great Holydays, their Hair and Nails of their Children of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Which colour perhaps may be ſeen with us on the Mains and Tails of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſes. The Powder is greeniſh, and ſo common with them, that you ſee in their <hi>Batzars</hi> whole Bags full thereof ſtanding before their Shops, which come from <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> from whence whole Ship-loads are ſent through <hi>Turky,</hi> as I have ſeen my ſelf in this Harbour ſeveral, from whence the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor hath yearly a great Revenue.

                  <p>Thereabout is alſo found within and without the Gardens a peculiar ſort of Mallows, by them called <hi>Chethince,</hi> which is very large, and high, and like other Trees, ſpreads its woody Twigs and ſoft Boughs, that are covered with a browniſh Bark; amongſt the reſt I ſaw one as big as a Man's middle, the Leaves thereof
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48499:43"/>
are of a dark Green, long, and at the ſides to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the point crenated, its Flowers are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bigger than other Mallows, of a blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, their Seeds I did never ſee. Hard by I found another Outlandiſh <hi>Doſchet</hi> Flower, which was almoſt decay'd, ſo that it had neither Leaves, Flowers nor Seeds: It was about three Foot high, the Stem and Twigs were hairy, hollow within as other Stalks, of a green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour inclining ſomewhat to yellow, which had at top many other ſhoots, each of them had behind like unto other Tree-ſtems its proper Joint. This is ſo juicy quite through, that it drops almoſt with Milk, which is ſharper than any Spurge. I made great inquiry of them about it, but could have no certain accompt thereof, but as it ſeemed to me, it is very like unto <hi>Xabra</hi> and <hi>Camarronus</hi> of <hi>Rhazes</hi> by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> called <hi>Tanaghut</hi> and <hi>Sabeam,</hi> and may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to that Author's deſcription for it.</p>
                  <p>Further hereabout, chiefly in the Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ciſterns and Conduits I found <hi>Adian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> by the Apothecaries called <hi>Capillus Veneris,</hi> and in old Walls the <hi>Apollinaris.</hi> I alſo found in the Shops in their <hi>Batzare</hi> two ſorts of Roots, whereof one was rounder, which may be the <hi>Bulcigeni</hi> of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which are called <hi>Thraſi</hi> at <hi>Verona,</hi> where they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not unlike to our <hi>Doronicum,</hi> there is alſo a great many of them to be ſold, they are hard, of a ſweetiſh Taſte, with a piercing bitterneſs, and in their bigneſs, and white Nerves (which ſpread themſelves under ground in the Gardens round about like unto the wild <hi>Angelica</hi> of <hi>Tragus</hi>) ſo like to the <hi>Haronigi Serapionis,</hi> and to the <hi>Durungi</hi> and <hi>Durunegi</hi> of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Deſcription, and ſo uniform, that they muſt be taken for the ſame.

                        <hi>Which way I travelled from</hi> Tripolis <hi>further to the two Famous Cities of</hi> Damant <hi>and</hi> Halepo.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter I had reſted for ſeveral Weeks in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and had obſerved that City, its Building, and pleaſant Situation, and moreover the Manners, Cuſtoms, and Habits, as well of the low as high ones, I propounded to my ſelf to Travel to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which is almoſt the biggeſt, and the moſt Famous, Trading City of <hi>Syria,</hi> which lies five or ſix days Journey towards the North-eaſt of <hi>Tripolis.</hi> And when I met with ſome Companions to Travel with me, we ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our ſelves with Proviſions, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread, Cheeſe, Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for our Journey, and ſo ſet out of <hi>Tripolis</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 73.</p>
                  <p>By the way we met with a great deal of Rain, which commonly begins at that time of the Year, and continueth almoſt all the Winter long: This kept us ſo much back, that we reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>Damant,</hi> which is in the mid-way from <hi>Tripolis</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> before the fourth day. There we lodged in one of their great <hi>Champs,</hi> called <hi>Carvatſcharas,</hi> where we had a Chamber aſſigned us, in which we found neither Table, nor Chairs, nor Bench, nor Bed, only upon the Floor was laid a <hi>Stromatzo</hi> twiſted, of Canes, which was to ſerve us inſtead of them all. There we bought in their <hi>Bazar</hi> ſome Victuals according to our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48499:45"/>
pleaſure, and ſtaid there all Night long. The Town, which ſome take to be the Old <hi>Apamia,</hi> is pretty big, and pretty well built; it lies in a Valley between Hills, ſo that you can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it (the Caſtle only excepted, which lyeth on the Hill, and guardeth it very well) before you are juſt come to it. Round about it there is many Orchards and Kitchen-Gardens, which they Water out of the River <hi>Haſce,</hi> which is pretty large, and runs through the Town. The Water they lift up with Wheels for that purpoſe fixed in the River, that pour it into Channels that carry it into the Gardens, and ſo Water them in the great heat of the Sun, to refreſh them. Theſe Gardens had been worth my ſeeing, but my Fellow-Travellers were in haſt, and ſo we put on the next Morning for <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the way we ſaw very good Corn-Fields, Vineyards, and Fields planted with Cotton, which is brought from thence, and ſold to us under the Name of the place where it grew, and alſo Silks and other Goods that are bought there at the firſt hand. In theſe Countries are a great many Wild Aſſes called <hi>Onagri,</hi> the Skins of them are very ſtrong to wear, and as they prepare them, finely frockt on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as Strawberries are, or like the Skin of the <hi>Sepia,</hi> or Cuttle-Fiſh, wherefore they commonly make their Scabbards for their Scymitars, and Sheaths of their Knives thereof. Their Blades are watered on both ſides very ſubtilly; they are made of good Metal, well hardened, and ſo ſharp (chiefly theſe that are made in <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>) that you may cut with them a very ſtrong Nail in pieces, without any hurt to the Blade. They wear rather Knives than Daggers, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48499:45"/>
they tye to their Girdles with finely wrought Tapes, by their backs.</p>
                  <p>When we went on and came to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> we ſaw abundance of Villages by the way, which for the moſt part are inhabited by Chriſtians, <hi>viz. Syrians, Maronites, &amp;c.</hi> with whom we did Lodge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-night; theſe entertained us very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and gave us ſuch Wine to drink, as grew on the Mountains, than which I hardly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ever drank better. Amongſt the reſt of the Villages we came to one called <hi>Hanal,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high in a Fruitful Country, where, as I am informed, in former days a very fine City ſtood, which is ſo deſolated, and in proceſs of time decayed to that degree, that in our days there is almoſt nothing of it left but a ſmall Village, and here and there in the Fields ſome ſmall Ruins of Old Houſes.</p>
                  <p>We went on further between the Mountains, where we ſpied a little Town upon the Hills, and above it a ſtrong Caſtle, which it's ſaid the <hi>French</hi> did formerly build, that lyeth in a very convenient place between the Mountains, ſo that you muſt go juſt by it; but becauſe it is haunted with Evil Spirits and Hobgoblins, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth unrepaired, and uninhabited. We left it on our left hand, and came out into a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corn-Field well tilled, where on our left we ſaw the Town <hi>Sermin</hi> at a great diſtance, and near to it and about it, great Woods of <hi>Piſtacio</hi>-Trees, which are gathered there, and ſent to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and ſo by the Merchants to us: Some of them grow alſo near the High-ways, chiefly in the Village of <hi>Baſilo,</hi> where we ſtayed all Night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48499:46"/>In our way we found nine or ten <hi>Champs</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caravatſcharas,</hi> theſe are open Inns, where the <hi>Caravans</hi> and Travellers go in, commonly towards Evening, to ſtay there all Night; they are free to any body, but you find neither Meat nor Drink there, if you will have it you muſt bring it along with you, and muſt be contented to lye upon Straw (if you can have it) upon the lower Wall, which goes round about the ſides, on purpoſe to give to Horſes, Aſſes, and Camels their Food upon it. They are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three Miles diſtant from one another; they are large and ſtately, and as ſtrong in Walls as Caſtles, commonly built four-ſquare, and have within a large Yard, and round about it are Stables which are quite open, juſt like Cloiſters. Some of them have a Garriſon of Nine or Twelve <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> to keep the Roads clean, and to protect the Travellers from Aſſaults of the Inhabitants and <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we had travelled over ſeveral rough Mountains, and came almoſt near to <hi>Halepo,</hi> we ſaw at laſt the City juſt like <hi>Damand,</hi> of the bigneſs of <hi>Strasbourg</hi>; at the Gates we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, becauſe in <hi>Turky</hi> no Outlandiſh Man hath liberty to Ride through a City; and ſo we went into it, and I went into the <hi>French Fundique</hi> to take my Lodgings, as all <hi>Germans</hi> uſe to do.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Situation of the Potent City of</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepo, <hi>of the Buildings thereof, and alſo of the delicate Fruits, and fine Plants, that grow there within and without Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Town of <hi>Halepo</hi> (which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Potent in <hi>Syria,</hi> anciently called <hi>Nerea</hi>) is in ſome places well Fortified with Ditches and Walls, only they are not quite round it, ſo that one may (the ſame it is with <hi>Tripolis</hi>) at any time of Night go in and out: Neither are the Gates, as uſed in our Country, chiefly in Cities of Account, beſet with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but you will only ſee two or three wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Head-Gates, where the High-ways go through, which are rather there to take Cuſtom, than to keep the Gates, neither have they any Arms. But in the middle of the City there is a Caſtle on a high Hill, which is ſtrong, large, ſurrounded with Walls and Ditches, and well beſet with a good Guard. Concerning their other Buildings (which are flat at the top, and covered with a ſort of Pavement, that one may walk on the tops of them) they are like unto them of <hi>Tripolis.</hi> Amongſt the reſt there is a very Magnificent Building, which they ſay hath coſt a great deal of Money, which hath for its Entrance a very low and ſmall Door, ſo that one muſt bend himſelf very low that will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48499:47"/>
go into it, but when you come in, you find there delicate large Halls, high open Arches, (very pleaſant and cool to ſit underneath in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) Water-works, Orchards, and Kitchen-Gardens, where among the reſt was one of theſe <hi>Ketmy's:</hi> Beſides theſe there was alſo ſome fine Moſques with Steeples, which were round and ſmall, but very high; ſome of them had a Balcony at the top, like unto a Garland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Waits are, and their Prieſts go about at the time of Prayers, to call People in. But for other ſtately Buildings, that might be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the Memory of ſome Potent King or Prince, there is none.</p>
                  <p>Without the City they have here and there ſome Country-Houſes, among the reſt one built for the <hi>Turkiſh Emperour,</hi> at four Miles diſtance from the City, where he uſed to be ſometimes, chiefly when he is at War with the <hi>Sophy,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that he may preſently aſſiſt his Army, in caſe of Neceſſity: This is very large, but not built ſo ſtately as ſo great a Monarch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth. In the great Garden is a Chappel built by the River that runs through it, upon Pillars, where the <hi>Great Sultan</hi> uſed to hold Conferences with his Privy-Councellors and Viſier-Baſhaws. It happened in the Reign of <hi>Solyman the Great,</hi> (as the Gardiner did relate to us) that when they were aſſembled, to conſult whether it was more profitable to him, to ſuffer the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Provinces, or to root them quite out: After every one had given his Opinion, and the moſt of them were of the Opinion, that they ought not to be tolerated, becauſe of their inſufferable Uſury, wherewith they oppreſſed his Subjects: And after the Emperour had heard every ones Sentiment, he gave them alſo to underſtand his,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48499:47"/>
and that in this inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> He bad them look upon a Flower-Pot, that held a quantity of fine Flowers of divers colours, that was then in the Room, and bid them conſider whether each of them in their colour, did not ſet out the other the better; and that if any of them ſhould decay, or be taken away, whether it would not ſomewhat ſpoil the Beauty of the reſt. After every one had heard the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Opinion, and did allow of it to be true; the Emperour did begin to explain this, and ſaid, The more ſorts of Nations I have in my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions under me, as <hi>Turks, Moors, Grecians, &amp;c.</hi> the greater Authority they bring to my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and make them more famous. And that nothing may fall off from my Greatneſs, I think it convenient, that all that have been together ſo long hitherto, may be kept and tolerated ſo ſtill for the future; which pleaſed his Council ſo well, that they all unanimouſly agreed to it, and ſo let it remain as it was. Without the City of <hi>Halepo,</hi> are abundance of Quarries, where they dig great Free-ſtones of a vaſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, almoſt as white and ſoft as Chalk, very proper for Building: There are alſo about the Town ſome Walks or Grotto's under Ground, which are above an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile long, which have the Light let into them by holes made near the High-way, ſo that a Man muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful, (chiefly at Night) that he may not fall into them, or that he may not be trapan'd by the <hi>Moors</hi> that live in them in great numbers. The Ground about it being very Chalky, it cauſeth to the ſoles of our Feet, chiefly at Night, although one be very well provided with ſtrong ſhooes, a very conſiderable dryneſs and heat, as one may alſo ſee by the <hi>Moors,</hi> that, for the moſt part, go bare-foot, which cauſeth the ſoles
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48499:48"/>
of their Feet to be ſo ſhrifled, that into ſome of their creviſes you may almoſt put your little Finger. Yet notwithſtanding that, <hi>Halepo</hi> is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Rocky Hills, and the Valleys thereof are Chalky; they have no want of Corn, as Barley, Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but rather it is very Fruitful, and their Harveſt beginneth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May:</hi> But they have but few Oats, and leſs Graſs or Hay; for the dryneſs is ſo great, and it is ſo Sandy, and the Hills are ſo rough and full of Buſhes, that they make but very little Hay. Wherefore they feed their Cattel with Barley, and with Straw, which is broken in pieces by threſhing Waggons, that are drawn by Oxen. The Valley is alſo full of Olive-Trees, ſo that Yearly they make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Thouſand Hundred Weight of Oyl for to make Soap. There is alſo a great quantity of Tame and Wild Almond-Trees, of Figgs, of Quince, and white Mulberry-Trees, which are very high and big: <hi>Piſtacies</hi>-Trees, which they call <hi>Fiſtuc,</hi> are hereabout very common; they have underneath very ſtrong ſtems, which have outwardly an Aſhen-colour'd Bark, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with handſome Leaves of a ſad green colour, like unto their <hi>Charnubis,</hi> and behind them grow many ſmall Nuts like Grapes in Cluſters together. In the Spring when they firſt put out, they ſend forth long ſhoots, which the <hi>Moors</hi> gather in great quantity for their Sallad, and dreſs them as we do Aſparagus. There are alſo abundance of delicate Orchards, that are filled with <hi>Oranges, Citrons, Lemons, Adams-Apples, Sebeſten, Peaches, Morelloes,</hi> and <hi>Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats,</hi> &amp;c. and amongſt them you find ſometimes Apples and Pears, but very few, nor ſo many ſorts, nor ſo big, nor ſo well coloured as ours.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48499:48"/>
There grow many Mirtles, which bear roundiſh Berries of the bigneſs of our <hi>Sorbus</hi> or Services, of a blewiſh Grey colour, very good to eat, which have white Seeds of the ſhape of our jumping Cheeſe-magots, they propagate them diligently, becauſe they are beautiful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long green, to put about their Graves. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there are many <hi>Sumach</hi>-Trees, which they plant for their Seeds ſake, which is much uſed by them: But <hi>Cherries, Amelanchier</hi> and <hi>Spenleny</hi> I have not ſeen there, and very few Gooſeber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Currans: <hi>Weychſeln</hi> they have, but very few, wherefore they eſteem them, and keep them choice, as a Foreign Plant, to ſhew them to others, and to preſent great Perſons with them. This may ſuffice of Trees. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Garden Plants, thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are Endives, Lettice, Kel or Coleworts, Colliflowers, <hi>Caulorapa Rauckelen Apium, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> whereof <hi>Rhaſes</hi> deſcribeth two ſorts, one with long ſmall Leaves, by us called Taragon, and the other with broad Leaves, which I reckon to be our <hi>Lepidium,</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Cozirihan. Ravos Serap:</hi> or our Hartichokes. But beyond all they plant <hi>Colocaſia</hi> in ſuch plenty, as we do Turneps, whereof they have alſo great plenty. They are alſo very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Horſe-raddiſhes, Garlick and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Inhabitants ſtill call <hi>Baſſal.</hi> Of <hi>Pumpions, Citruls,</hi> and <hi>Cucumis anguinus</hi> (which they call <hi>Gette</hi>) they plant as many as they have occaſion for; but many more <hi>Angurien</hi> an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Muskmillion,</hi> (Water-mellons) which they call <hi>Batiechas,</hi> but <hi>Serap. Dullaha,</hi> they are large, of greeniſh colour, ſweet and pleaſant to eat, and very cooling, wherefore they eſteem them to be their beſt Fruits: but chiefly thoſe, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48499:49"/>
have more red than white within, they are very innocent and harmleſs, and keep ſo long good, that they ſell them in their <hi>Batzars</hi> all the Winter long. Moreover, there are three ſorts of thoſe Plants which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanzana, Melongena,</hi> and <hi>Beudengian,</hi> as Aſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, Yellow and Fleſh coloured, which are very like one another in their Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Length, and like unto the long Gourds. There are two other ſorts, which are called <hi>Bathleſchain, viz.</hi> oblong and round ones, which are much bigger, of a black colour, and ſo ſmooth and glazed, that they give a Reflection. They eat theſe oftener, boiled (chiefly after the way which <hi>Averrhöes</hi> mentioned) than raw. Without their Gardens are two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange Plants, which alſo (being they eat them commonly with others) may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Kitchin-Herbs: whereof one is called by them <hi>Secacul,</hi> which I found about the Town in ſhady places, and among Trees, and in the Corn, its Roots are of an Aſhen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour without, and white within, ſmooth, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or tender, of one Inch thick, and one and a half long, it hath inſtead of Fibers, little knobs like unto Warts, and a ſweet taſte, not unlike to our Carrots in Stalk, Herb or Head, ſaving only the Flowers which are yellow; the Herb-women carry them ſtrung upon Strings about the Streets to ſell them. The other ſort is alſo very plentiful, and is found in dry and rough places, which the Inhabitants to this day with <hi>Serapio</hi> called <hi>Hacub,</hi> whereof he maketh mention in his 295 Chapter, under the Name of <hi>Hacub Alcardeg,</hi> whereof they cut in the Spring, the young Shoots or Sprouts that grow round about it, boil and eat it as we do <hi>Sparagus,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48499:49"/>
corruptly called Sparrowgraſs, the whole Plant is very like to our <hi>Carlina,</hi> only this hath bigger, higher and more prickly Heads, whereon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Fleſh-coloured Flowers. It being that it is every way like it, and that alſo the Root hath the ſame Vertue, for if you ſteep it in Water, and drink of it, it maketh you vomit and fling up; therefore I am of opinion, that without doubt it muſt be, the true <hi>Silybum Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoridis</hi>: Beſides this there grow alſo in the Road, and on old Walls, ſuch plenty of <hi>Capers,</hi> that they are not at all eſteemed; they take theſe Flowers before they open, and pickle them, and eat them for Sauce with their Meat. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot another Herb, which I found in their Gardens, that beareth roundiſh ſmooth Stalks about two Foot high, the Leaves are two and two equally diſtant from one another, and one above the other, they are long, crenated at the ſides, like unto our <hi>Mercurialis</hi>; between them ſprout out in harveſt time yellow Flowers, which produce long aculeated Cods, which open themſelves when they are ripe, within them are ſix diſtinctions, and in each of them little black Seeds placed in very good order: the Herb is of a ſower taſte, like Sorrel, wherefore it is to every body (chiefly the <hi>Jews</hi>) known, which boil the Leaves thereof with their Meat to eat them: Wherefore ſome take it to be <hi>Olus Judaicum Avicennae,</hi> and others take it for <hi>Corchorum Plinii,</hi> whether it be or no I ſuſpend my Judgment.</p>
                  <p>They have abundance of Pulſes in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which they feed upon, ſo that you ſee ſeveral in their <hi>Batzars</hi> which ſell nothing elſe but them.

which they call <hi>Cotane,</hi> and with <hi>Avicenna Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</hi> Whereof they have as many as we have Peaſe in our Country, and boil them for their daily Food, and oftentimes they eat them raw, chiefly if they be roaſted till the outward Shell falls off, they often call for them thus dreſſed, when they are a drinking in their Coffee-houſes, and have them brought to Table with Cheeſe after their Meals inſtead of Preſerves, or Fruit, as <hi>Cibebs,</hi> Haſel-nuts and the like, for they eat very mellow, and have a fine ſaltiſh Taſte. They dreſs the <hi>Orobus</hi> after the ſame manner, which they call now <hi>Ades</hi> and <hi>Hades,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or no I leave to the Learned, they are ſomewhat leſs and rounder, and not unlike the <hi>Cicers</hi> in their colour, only that theſe are reddiſh and white, and the other white and yellow. Theſe put me ſtill in mind of another ſtrange Plant, by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Mas,</hi> whoſe Leaves and Cods are prety like our <hi>Phaſeolus,</hi> and the Cods contain little round Seeds ſomething leſs than our Peaſe, of a dark green colour, and are ſo ſmooth and ſhining that they reflect again. <hi>Serapio</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in his 116 Chapter under the Name of <hi>Mes.</hi> And <hi>Avicennas</hi> in his 488 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the Name <hi>Meiſce</hi>; and the very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and experienced Botaniſt <hi>Carolus Cluſius</hi> calleth it in his <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Indian</hi> Plants by the Name of <hi>Mungo.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> love theſe Pulſes very well, chiefly to eat them among their Rice.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE City of <hi>Halepo</hi> (which ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Name and Situation believe to be the Town <hi>Chalibon</hi> of <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> ſituated in <hi>Chalibonitis</hi>) is ſubject unto the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor,</hi> together with all the adjacent places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he keepeth a <hi>Baſhaw</hi> in it, which is to rule it, and the whole Province according to his Will and Pleaſure. Now as the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> are almoſt the chiefeſt and higheſt under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, ſo they keep according to their Station and Dignity, their Courts as great as the Princes do in our Country (according as they have great or ſmall Provinces. So they have under them their chief Commanders, as <hi>Sangiacks, Bolucſ-baſhaws</hi> and others, which are continually with them go with them to their Temples, or any other place where-ever they have a mind to go, in great
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48499:51"/>
flocks, both on Foot, and on Horſe-back, which by their ſeveral Habits are to be diſtinguiſhed, but chiefly the <hi>Bolucsbaſhaw,</hi> which as Captains have an Hundred Janiſaries under them, which in coſtly Cloaths, and high Heads with Feathers, run on Foot like Lacqueys by their Maſter. They have alſo beſides their Court, as well as the Emperour himſelf, peculiar Lodgings for their Concubines, which they either have pick'd up here and there out of Towns and Countries, or elſe taken in time of War by Sea and Land from Chriſtians and other Nations; wherefore they keep many Eunuchs to attend them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. They take great delight in Hunting, and go often ſeveral Days Journeys after it: If they take Wild Boars, they give them (becauſe they are by their Laws forbid to eat them) to the Chriſtians, which maketh the <hi>Turks</hi> often to mock them in the Streets, crying out and calling them <hi>Chanſir quibir,</hi> that is, great Boars or Hog-eaters. Although the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> are great Perſons, that Command over Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yet they are rckoned to be, like others, but Slaves to their Maſter, that have nothing of their own, that they can bequeath to their Heirs or Poſterity after their deceaſe, as our Princes can, becauſe the Emperour after their deceaſe taketh Poſſeſſion of all their viſible Eſtates, and allows only to their Children an Annuity: Nay, if their <hi>Sultan</hi> Commands them to go from one place to an Inferiour one, or to leave their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity quite and clean, they muſt obey immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, if they will not run themſelves into greater Inconveniencies or Dangers. This is the Reaſon that ſuch Perſons, although Rich, ſeldom build great Buildings, ſo that you ſee none in all the Country, except it be a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48499:51"/>
or a <hi>Champ,</hi> which they build to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by: They rather keep their Riches in Gold and Silver, which can be hid, and ſo ſecretly given to their Poſterity. They beſtow but very little upon Jacks, for they are too Covetous, neither have they many Work-men that are able to ſet them. Theſe <hi>Baſhaws</hi> being altogether for their own Advantage, that ſtrive to get Wealth, their Subjects muſt needs ſuffer very much under them, but chiefly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that live there to Traffick, as <hi>Italians, French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c.</hi> whereby between them and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws</hi> (that mind their own and not the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good) ariſe often great Differences, and they muſt have ſuffered great damage, if their Soveraigns, to prevent theſe things, and that their Subjects may deal ſecurely, had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to ſend them diſcreet and prudent Men, which are called <hi>Conſuls,</hi> endued with great Priviledges from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to hear their Complaints, and to protect them againſt any Aſſaulters. It happened in my time, while I ſtaid there, that great Differences aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the new <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> who was ſent thither, inſtead of the deceaſed one, in the Year 75. the 6<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> who came in to take Poſſeſſion with a great number of Horſe and Foot. At his Arrival the <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> went (accompanied with a great number of Merchants in great State) to meet him, to bid him Welcom, and preſented him with Fourteen Cloaths Richly wrought of Silk, deſiring him to take his Country-men into his Protection, that they might Trade and deal ſafely under him. The <hi>Baſhaw</hi> looking upon the Cloaths, behaved himſelf very unkindly, and looking upon them to be very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48499:52"/>
he not only refuſed them, but anſwered the Conſul very ſcornfully. So it often happens that theſe great Perſons come to differ, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their Differences ſo far, that at laſt it muſt be brought before the <hi>Emperour</hi> and his Court. If they find that the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is in the wrong, he is immediately puniſhed (not regarding his great Authority) according to the default, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Money, or elſe, if it be a great Crime, he muſt loſe his Life for it; which is the oftner done, becauſe they depend very much upon Traffick, which bringeth the Emperour in year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very great Revenue. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are puniſhed ſo ſeverely ſometimes, the Pride and Ambition of the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> is ſo great, that to uphold their Greatneſs, they will not ceaſe to ſtrive by any means after Riches and great Wealth, which their Subjects (not to ſpeak of Strangers) find daily, whom they ſqueeze and preſs, chiefly if they find them Rich, to that degree, that they cannot come to any thing, nor thrive under them: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they draw, after the deceaſe of their Rich Subjects, for the moſt part, the greateſt ſhare of what they leave, into their own Purſes; ſo that ſuch Perſons do not take Pains, nor beſtow any great Coſt to build their Houſes, or to till their Grounds, as we do in our Country. They have commonly in Market-Towns and Villages, low Houſes or Halls, whereof many are ſo covered with Hills, that you cannot ſee them, before you are quite at them. When you come into them, you find neither Chairs, nor Stools, nor Tables, only a couple of pieces of Tapeſtry ſpread, whereon they ſit after their faſhion; and inſtead of Feather-Beds (whereof they make no uſe at all) they have Mats and Quilts,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48499:52"/>
which they fold together in the Day, and hang them up in a corner, at Night they ſpread them out again to ſleep on them: They have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Sheets, to cover themſelves as we do, nor for any Towels neither, for inſtead of them they uſe long pieces of Rags, which they hang about their naked Necks, or hang them at their Girdles. We ſee ſometimes in their Houſes, above all in the Country, ſeveral ſtrange-ſhaped Earthen Veſſels, which cover whole ſides of the Wall in their Rooms, which their Relations uſe to Preſent them with at their Wedding, which to pleaſe them, they uſe to put up, and to keep there, rather for their Remembrance, than to make any other uſe of them. In their Kitchen they have very few Utenſils, perhaps a few Pipkins, Pans, and Trenchers, for they boyl all their Victuals in one Pot together, that their Maids may not have many to cleanſe, or to put up.</p>
                  <p>Concerning their Cloaths, they beſtow not very much upon them, although they be well to paſs, for they love Money ſo well, that they will rather ſpend a whole day in contending for a Penny, than pay it willingly: Wherefore a Man that will Travel through theſe Countries, muſt have his Purſe well ſtored, and keep it very cloſe, that no body may know its worth, but chiefly he muſt have a care of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are not to be truſted, if you will eſcape great danger: They will not only do nothing for you without Reward, but if they ſuſpect you to have any Money, they will endeavour to get it from you. Wherefore thoſe that take a Pilgrimage into the Holy Land, and go in pitiful Cloaths, are not much troubled by them. The Courtiers of the <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> and amongſt the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48499:53"/>
reſt chiefly the Eunuchs and Dwarfs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have ſeveral, go in their Taffety and Sattin Cloaths, which are long, and very well trimmed, wherewith their Maſter furniſheth them, being Gifts from others, which he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth among them. The Souldiers, <hi>Spahees, Janiſaries, &amp;c.</hi> commonly have blew woollen Cloaths from the Court, and they live of their Pay, that is, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 <hi>Medins,</hi> (which are abut three Farthings apiece) more or leſs (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their Places are) which are paid them daily, as well in Peace as in War-time: If they can get any thing elſe, by Excurſions and Fighting, from their Enemies, it is well for them. The Souldiers commonly wear white Turbants on their Heads, and ſo do all <hi>Turks,</hi> and put painted Paper underneath them, chiefly when they go into the War, believing if they wear them they cannot be hurt nor wounded. On their Turbants they commonly wear Cranes Feathers, that others may believe them to be Valiant Souldiers, and that by their Number People may gueſs that either they have been in ſo many Campagnes, or elſe killed ſo many Chriſtians. Beſides theſe Turbants the <hi>Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> have alſo Hats with high Crowns, called <hi>Zarcellas,</hi> made of white Felt, which they wear inſtead of Helmets, when they are in waiting, or go out to the War, theſe have before on the fore-head a gilded Sheath, ſet without with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats Rubies, <hi>Turkey</hi>-ſtones, and other Jewels, (yet of no great value) wherein they put their Feathers. They (and alſo other <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi>) let no Hair grow upon their Heads, but as ſoon as it grows they ſhave it again, only behind they keep a lock, which hangs down a pretty way: They let their Beards grow now,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48499:53"/>
which they uſed formerly to cut off, ſo that now for ſome Years they have worn huge great Muſtachies. In War time they carry Muſquets, and in Peace (chiefly when they are in waiting) their long Poles. They are alſo allowed to Marry, and beſides their Wives, to keep any they take Priſoners in the War, or elſe to ſell them to any body. When they are at home they are great lovers of Wine, and when they can come at it, that no body ſees them, they will drink more without mixture than any other Nation: But in time of War, when they are in Expedition, they can live very ſparingly, and will March all day long before they will Refreſh themſelves. Yet to ſpeak the truth, theſe, and almoſt all Souldiers (becauſe they are as well paid in Peace as in War) are no more ſo ready to take the Field, and to change a quiet Life for a troubleſome one, or a ſecure one for a dangerous, as they they have been in former Ages, being uſed to Lazineſs for a great while together. Beſides the Power and Strength of the <hi>Turks</hi> is reckoned much inferiour to that of the Chriſtians, for we are better armed with Muſquets and Pikes, to keep them off at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that they may not be able to come in with us to Club-Law, and ſo over-power us; for if their Enemy doth not give way at the firſt On-ſet, they turn their backs and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But that notwithſtanding all this, we gain nothing from the <hi>Turks,</hi> but they rather from us; the reaſon is (not to mention our manifold Tranſgreſſions) rather our great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Contentions, which hinder us from going out with ſuch an Army as is neceſſary, and we might otherways do. Wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> come out the bolder, to frighten and to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48499:54"/>
plague us, and make uſe of all ſorts of Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, to amuſe us, or to draw us into an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, by purſuing them, and when they think we are almoſt tired, they fall upon us with a multitude of freſh Men, to ſurround and to beat us. Nor do they value it, if they loſe one Regiment or another, becauſe there is enough of them, and they know how to have in the room of the Slain others again that will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad (becauſe of their Pay that they receive daily of their Prince out of his Provinces) to accept of it. It being then ſo that he doth not only maintain his own Provinces, but rather gains others, and enlarges his Dominions daily, we ought to be very careful; for the more he increaſeth, the more we are in danger. Thus he taketh one Town, Country, or Kingdom after another with his Sword, as we have ſeen hitherto in <hi>Europe</hi> (not to mention any thing of <hi>Aſia</hi>) not without great detriment and damage to all Chriſtians. So he cometh daily the longer the nearer to us, that at length we muſt expect no better Succeſs than <hi>Greece, Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Servia, Boſnia, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Wallachia, &amp;c.</hi> which are brought into Slavery, under which ſome Perſons of Quality ſtill groan to this day. So I found at <hi>Aleppo</hi> an Ancient Queen of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia</hi> with her Sons, whereof the Youngeſt was born after the King his Father's Death, who is maintained by a very ſmall Allowance from the <hi>Turkiſh Emperour.</hi> She is a very diſcreet Woman, and well skill'd in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Her Subjects ſtill hope for her, that God Almighty will reſtore her to them again, that ſo their Slavery may have an end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48499:54"/>After the <hi>Turks</hi> have obtained a great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they lift up their Hands, thank and praiſe God, and the Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> God Almighty's dearly beloved Meſſenger, and pray further, that God may ſend Differences and Quarrels among us (that are againſt the Book <hi>Jugilis,</hi> as they call it, that is, the Book of the Goſpel) that the Magiſtrates may quarrel with the Subjects, and the Clergy with the Seculars, that from thence may ariſe ſuch Diſorders, that we may go on to tranſgreſs the Laws of God ſtill more and more; that our Belief in <hi>Meſſias</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and that all good Orders and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be diſſolved: So that God may take from thence occaſion to make them further our Puniſhers to afflict us. And when they ſee that the Rich Men Oppreſs the Poor, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates do not Protect the Juſt and Innocent, but that the Chief and Heads do ſtrive to ruin one another, then they rejoyce at our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Miſery, and do not fear us in the leaſt to do them any Miſchief (which might eaſily be done if we were unanimous) but rather threaten what Miſchief they will do us.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Turks</hi> have taken a ſtrong Town, or a whole Country by the Sword, that they may keep them the eaſier in Subjection without a great Garriſon, Pains, or Danger, they Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the places that are not very ſtrong, and ſend away the Nobility and Chief Perſons, which otherwiſe might do them a great deal of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and in the room of theſe they bring in <hi>Sangiacks,</hi> with their Souldiers, to keep the ſtrong places, and to take care of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Revenue. So that in theſe places there is no Nobility, that come from any Ancient Races, and have their own Eſtates Hereditary and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48499:55"/>
from Heir to Heir: Which one may alſo ſuppoſe when he conſidereth that the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> alloweth to thoſe that adhere to it, to have four Wives at a time, beſides Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, or Slaves as many as they pleaſe: I will ſay nothing of the Liberty they have to Divorce them upon any ſmall Occaſion, and to take others in their room; from whence flow ſuch Diſorders and Uncertainties, that very few Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren know who are their Parents, and ſo there is but little Love ſhewn between them as one may eaſily ſuppoſe. And this is no Diſgrace to them, but rather reputed to be an Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conclude from thence that thoſe that keep many Wives, behave themſelves diligently according to their Laws: Wherefore they ſooner truſt them, prefer them before others, in Places and Salaries, and eſteem them to be true <hi>Tſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebiis,</hi> that is, Noble-men. Although theſe and other <hi>Turks</hi> have ſeveral Wives, that are not all equal in their Birth and Extraction, yet they all have in Family Affairs their equal ſhare and power, and they all are equally provided for, with Meat, Drink, Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they have alſo their Work and Buſineſs equally among them: And that becauſe they bring their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band no Portion, but he muſt rather buy them from their Parents, ſometimes for a conſiderable Sum of ready Money, and give them Cloaths and other Neceſſaries to boot: Wherefore the Matrimonial tye (which they call <hi>Chebia</hi>) is more in the power of the Husband than the Wife, ſo that he may Marry one three times and reject her again; but further he muſt not go, except he will be accounted a ſcandalous baſe Fellow: As you may perceive by the words of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour <hi>Bajazet,</hi> which he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48499:55"/>
did ſend to <hi>Temyry,</hi> who is alſo called <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> ſaying, that he had better to take a Wife again after he was three times divorced from her, than to go to War with him; which ſcornful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he might well have forborn: For <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> did not only beat him in a cruel and bloody Battle, but took him Priſoner, and carried him about in an Iron Cage like a Wild Beaſt of the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>But that I may return from whence I digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Marriages of the <hi>Turks</hi> are never look'd upon to be ratified before they are married by one of their Prieſts. Their Wives muſt agree together, and live peaceably and amicably, and muſt not reſiſt their Husbands, except he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth inequality among them: If any ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (which happens very often) they do not forbear to complain of their Husband to the <hi>Cadi</hi> or Judge. So that daily very ſtrange Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions (which are not ſtrange to him) come before him: If ſo be that the Husband is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and the Wife abſolved, they are divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced immediately in the ſame hour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women are pretty handſom, and well ſhaped, very Civil in their Diſcourſes, and other Behaviour: When any of them is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and carried to her Bridegroom's Houſe, their Relations go along with her, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, to the Wedding, and begin to make a noiſe immediately in the Streets, and extol their Voices more and more as they go along, that you may hear them a great way off.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> that are of ſome Condition, and rich and able Men, have at their Weddings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diverting Shews; in the Day-time they have Dancing, Running, Actings, Singing; Jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Leaping, and Dancing on the Ropes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48499:56"/>
After Sun-ſet, and at Night, they let off Rockets, and Fire-works of ſeveral ſorts, made artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Theſe are let off in publick and open places, that every one may ſee them, and they laſt often till break of Day. The Rope-dancers have three Ropes one above the other, whereof the uppermoſt is the longeſt; upon every one of them they have their peculiar Leſſons, which they perform exactly and dexterouſly, with Dancing, Jumping, Running, Geſticulating, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Stilts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is pleaſant to look upon. Their Children when they are married, ſoon forget their Parents, they dare not ſee them again in a great while, nor do they deſire to do it.</p>
                  <p>When they have Children born, they do not juſtly Circumciſe them on the Eighth Day, but let them be 8, 9, or 10 Years old, until they can make their Confeſſion: There are ſome, chiefly among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that imitate their Patriarch <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who was not circumciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Thirteenth Year of his Age. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly performed in the Houſe of their Parents. If Rich Mens Sons are circumciſed, they make a Feaſt, and roaſt a whole entire Bullock, into his Belly they put a Wether, and into his Belly a Pullet, into the Pullet's Belly an Egg, and ſo they roaſt them all together, what remaineth they give to the Poor. When the Children grow up, and begin to go, they cloath them in looſe flying Coats, of fine Stuff, woven of ſeveral colours, which are pleaſant to look upon; and they put upon the Heads of thoſe that are not yet circumciſed, coloured Caps, which are wrought with Flowers, and very common to be ſold in their <hi>Batzars.</hi> After they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, they begin to wear white Turbants, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48499:56"/>
are made of Cotton, and rolled about their Caps after a peculiar manner, and are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Twenty Yards long.</p>
                  <p>They have ſtill another ſtrange Cuſtom, which Young and Old, Men and Women uſe in theſe Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> They make a thin Paſte of Galls and calcined Copperas, (to beautifie themſelves, and to keep their Eyes from Rheums) with it they blacken their Lips, and make a Ring round about their Eyes, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as our Ring-doves have about their Necks. Theſe Paintings they have had Anciently, and ſome of them they have prepared of <hi>Stibium</hi> or Antimony: Of theſe Paintings of the Eye we read in ſeveral places, chiefly (that I may not mention others) in the 23<hi>d.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the 40 Verſe, where the Lord ſays, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>And lo, they came, for whom thou didst waſh thy ſelf, paintedst thy Eyes, and deckedst thy ſelf with Ornaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the Education of their Youth, they only learn in Schools to Read, and to write the <hi>Arabian</hi> Alphabet, the Characters or Letters whereof are common both to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> although their Languages are very differing: Beſides theſe, there are other Schools, wherein the Young Men are Inſtructed in the Emperour's Laws, and thoſe that go on in their Learning, and take it well, are ſoon called to high Offices, (as <hi>Cadi's</hi> and <hi>Cadileſchiers.</hi>) But in Liberal Arts and Sciences, ſuch as we teach in our Countries, they are not Inſtructed, for they have not only none of theſe Learned Men, but eſteem learning of theſe Sciences a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, and loſs of Time; they rather love old Rhimes, and Ballads that ſpeak of and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Mighty Deeds of their Ancient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,

and other Champions; or other Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that make Foreign Nations, or any of their Enemies ridiculous: And ſuch things they put either themſelves into Rhimes, or elſe hear thoſe that have been put into Rhimes by others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which they ſay daily with peculiar Actions, out of Town in pleaſant Greens, (where alſo other Divertiſements are performed with Singing, Dancing, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So that they are rather pleaſed with the Reading of theſe frivolous ſilly Writings, than to learn Arts and Sciences: Which you may evidently ſee, in that they do not eſteem, nor will admit of that Noble Art of Printing Books, that might inform them in any thing: Which the Clerks, whereof there is a great number up and down in the Cities, like very well, becauſe they daily take a great deal of Money for the Writings of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Mahomet</hi> and others, which maketh them generally very Rich, and wear greater Turbants than the reſt, that they may be diſtinguiſhed from others. Their Paper is generally ſmoothed and glazed, and they comprehend their Letters in very few Words: When they will make them up, they fold them up until they come to be no broader than an Inch, the outward creviſe of the Paper they fill all along with Wax with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo glue it as it were to the other, or elſe they take any other Paſte made for that purpoſe, and ſo imprint their Name upon it with their Seal that is done over with Ink, ſo that nothing remaineth white but the Letters: Theſe Seals are generally made at <hi>Damaſco,</hi> where the beſt Artiſts live that cut in Steel, and they put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in it but their Name. They do not make any uſe of Paper that is writ on, although they have great quantity thereof, neither to put
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48499:57"/>
things up in, nor for any other uſe, and yet if they find any of it in the Street, they do not let it lye, but take it up carefully, fold it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put it into the next creviſe they meet with, for they are afraid that the Name of God may be written on it: Inſtead thereof the Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers make uſe of great Leaves of <hi>Colocaſia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have great ſtore.</p>

                        <hi>Of the great Trading and Dealing of the City of</hi> Halepo; <hi>as alſo of ſeveral ſorts of their Meats and Drinks, of their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and their peculiar way of ſitting down at Meals.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving heretofore treated of the Buildings and Situation of that Excellent Town of <hi>Halepo</hi>; and of the Cuſtoms, Manners, and Offices of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as much as I could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of it, I cannot but ſpeak, before I leave it, of the Dealings and Merchandiſings that are daily exerciſed there, which are admirably great. For great Caravans of Pack-Horſes and Aſſes, but more Camels arrive there daily, from all Foreign Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Natolia, Armenia, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>India, &amp;c.</hi> with Convoys, ſo that the Streets are ſo crouded, that it is hard to paſs by one another. Each of theſe Nations have their peculiar <hi>Champ</hi> to themſelves, commonly named after their Maſter that built it, <hi>viz. Champ Agemi, Champ Waywoda, Champ Abrac, Sibeli,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48499:58"/>
Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> and which are kept for them, that they may make them their Inns, and live in them, and to keep or ſell their Merchandiſes according to their pleaſure. So among the reſt of the Nations there are <hi>French-men</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> &amp;c. which have alſo there their peculiar Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (which, as is before ſaid, are called <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diques</hi>) wherein ſome live together, and others (chiefly the <hi>Italians</hi> that are married) live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in Lodgings; they have very ſmall Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and live ſparingly like the <hi>Turks.</hi> In theſe <hi>Champs</hi> you meet with ſeveral ſorts of ſtrange Merchandiſes, before all in <hi>Champ Agami,</hi> where you have all ſorts of Cotton-works, <hi>viz.</hi> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, long Fillets, Girdles, which they roll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Loins and Heads, and other ſorts, by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Moſſellini</hi> (after the Country <hi>Muſſoli,</hi> from whence they are brought, which is ſituated in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi>) by us <hi>Muſlin</hi>; with theſe do the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gentlemen Cloath themſelves in Summer. There is delicate Tapeſtry, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially wrought with all manner of colours, ſuch as are ſometimes brought over by us. From <hi>Perſia</hi> they bring great quantity of an unknown <hi>Manna</hi> in Skins, by the name of <hi>Trunſchibil,</hi> which is gathered from a prickly Shrub, called by the <hi>Arabians, Agul</hi> and <hi>Albagi,</hi> which is the reaſon that it is mixt with ſmall Thorns and reddiſh Chaff. This <hi>Manna</hi> hath Grains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bigger than our <hi>Coriander</hi>-ſeeds, ſo that, to all appearance, it is very like unto our <hi>Manna,</hi> which we gather from the <hi>Larix.</hi> It might alſo very well be taken to be the ſame that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did eat, had not God the Almighty fed his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and maintained them Miraculouſly and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally. But that it falls upon Thorns, is alſo atteſted by <hi>Serapio</hi> and <hi>Avicen,</hi> in thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48499:58"/>
where they treat of <hi>Manna,</hi> which they call <hi>Theceriabin</hi> and <hi>Trangibin,</hi> and that very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and experienced Botaniſt <hi>Carolus Cluſius</hi> ſaith the ſame in his Epitome of <hi>Indian</hi> Plants. I found ſome of theſe Shrubs that grew about <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> which were about a Cubit high, which ſhout out into ſeveral roundiſh Stalks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and ſpread themſelves from the Stem into ſeveral Sprigs like unto a Flower (part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were quite over-grown with <hi>Epithymum,</hi> as <hi>Thymus</hi> uſed to be) and had abundance of long thin and ſoft Prickles, from whence grew out fleſh-coloured reddiſh Flowers, that bore ſmall red Cods, very like, and of the ſame ſhape with the Cods of our <hi>Scorpioides,</hi> (whereof I have found many at <hi>Montpelier</hi>) wherein are Seeds of the ſame colour. The Root thereof is pretty long, of a brown colour, its leaves long, like unto thoſe of <hi>Polygonum,</hi> of an Aſh colour; thoſe that grow at the bottom of the Thorns are of a warm and dry Quality. The People uſe the Herb for a Purge, they take a handful thereof and boyl it in Water. Beſides this they have another <hi>Manna</hi> like unto that, that cometh to us from <hi>Calabria</hi> by the way of <hi>Venice, and is the concreted Saccarine Exudation of the</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</p>
                  <p>Among the reſt they alſo ſhew coſtly Stones, by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Bazaor,</hi> which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and roundiſh, and ſmooth without, and of a dark green Colour. The <hi>Perſians</hi> take theſe from a peculiar ſort of Bucks, and uſe the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt mortal and poiſonous Diſtempers. There are ſome that are very like unto theſe in Form and Figure, but not to be compared for Goodneſs: Wherefore a Man muſt have great care that he be not cheated. But there are ſome
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48499:59"/>
Proofs to know whether they are good or no, which a Merchant communicated to me as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Take Quicklime and mix it in Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a little of this Stone, and with Water make them up into a Paſte, when that is dry grind it, if it then remaineth white it is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe, but if it turns yellow it is good, and brought from <hi>Perſia.</hi> They alſo bring hither <hi>Turkey</hi> Stones, that grow almoſt only in their Country, and their King the <hi>Sophy</hi> has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Treaſure of them together: Lately ſo many of them were brought to us that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fell very much; but when the King heard of this, he immediately forbid that any ſhould be Exported in ſeven years time, that ſo they might come to their former Price again, which ſeven years as I am informed are now expired. There are alſo put to Sale many Chains of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Oriental Pearls, which are for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part taken or found in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Seas, near to the Iſland called <hi>Bahare,</hi> ſcituated not far from that great trading City of the <hi>Turkiſh Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zora,</hi> or <hi>Balſara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>India</hi> they bring hither many delicate Spices, <hi>Cinnamon, Spicnard, Long Pepper, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, Cardamoms, Nutmegs, Mace,</hi> and <hi>China Roots,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> make more uſe of then of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> and delicate <hi>China</hi> Cups and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, <hi>Indico:</hi> and in very great quantity they bring that noble Root called <hi>Rhubarb.</hi> And moreover, they ſell ſeveral ſorts of precious Stones, <hi>viz. Garnats, Rubies, Balaſios, Saphirs, Diamonds,</hi> and the beſt ſincereſt <hi>Musk</hi> in little Gods. Theſe precious Stones are hid by the Merchants in the great Caravans that come from <hi>India,</hi> and they bring them ſecretly, becauſe they dare not pay Cuſtom for them, that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48499:59"/>
                     <hi>Baſhaws, Sangiachs</hi> and others, may not rob them of them on the High-ways, for they uſe to do ſo if they find any. I will ceaſe to diſcourſe any longer of theſe and other Drugs, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Merchandiſes, which the Merchants convey thither from forreign Places daily, and from thence to other places again, becauſe it is none of my Buſineſs to deal in them. With the Spices are ſometimes by the Merchants brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> delicate Canes, which are very long, ſolid, or full within, flexible and bright without, of a yellowiſh Colour, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every-where alike thick, only a little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering; but few Joynts, far diſtant from one another, and are hardly ſeen in them. There are two ſorts of them, great and ſmall ones; the great and ſtronger ones are uſed by old and lame People inſtead of Crutches to walk with, but the leſſer (which are very like the former) are made into Arrows and Darts, for which they are very fit, the <hi>Turks</hi> wind them about with Silk of many ſorts of Colours, which they are very proud of when they make their entries. You find alſo in the Shops another ſort of Canes to be Sold, which are ſmall and hollow within, and ſmooth without, a browniſh red Colour, wherewith <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple write, for to write with Gooſe-Quills is not in uſe with them; wherefore theſe may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to be the true <hi>Syringas</hi> or <hi>Fiſtularis</hi> of <hi>Dioſcor:</hi> Beſides theſe there is another bigger ſort of Canes, almoſt of the ſame Colour, but full of Joynts; the Pilgrims that go to ſee their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> bring theſe with them from <hi>Mecha,</hi> and the People of that Country carry them along with them on Horſeback inſtead of ſhort Pikes, chiefly the <hi>Arabians,</hi> for they are long, ſtrong,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48499:60"/>
and light, and yet ſolid or full within, with theſe they come running on upon their Enemies, or elſe they (lifting it up above the middle in one of their Hands) fling it at them, with ſuch force, that they penetrate deeper with their ſharp Iron, (wherewith they are tipt before and behind) then their Arrows. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> maketh peculiar mention of them in his fourth Book and the 11<hi>th.</hi> Chapter, and <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Sixteenth Book and the 36<hi>th.</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>We ſee very few of theſe in our Country, for the Chriſtians are forbidden under great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to carry any of them (the ſame it is with any other Arms that they make uſe of in their Wars) out of the Country, if any doth and is found out, he expoſes himſelf to infinite Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Dangers, as did happen to one in my time, which after a Scimiter was found about him, was very highly accuſed, and fined Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ducats to be paid in two days time, and if he had not paid it they would certainly have circumciſed him and made him a <hi>Turk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe above-mentioned <hi>Champs,</hi> there are a great many more without and within the City, where alſo all ſorts of Merchandiſes are Sold, <hi>viz. Quibir</hi> the Great, <hi>Sougier</hi> the Little, <hi>Gidith</hi> the New, <hi>Atich,</hi> Old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beſides all theſe they have a great Exchange called <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> by the Inhabitants, which is in the middle of the Town, and is bigger then <hi>Friberg</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in it there is many Alleys, and each of them divided for ſeveral Wares and handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft Trades; firſt the Grocers and Mercers, then thoſe that ſell Tapeſtry and other ſoft Woollen Cloaths, and alſo <hi>Turkiſh Machyer, Camlet, Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety,</hi> and other Silks and Cottons delicately wrought. There are alſo good <hi>Cardavon,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48499:60"/>
Furrs of <hi>Martins,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Wild Cats,</hi> whereof abundance runs about in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Jewellers that ſell all manner of Jewels, precious Stones, Pearls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſorts of Handy-craft Tradeſmen, as Shoe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Taylors, Sadlers, Needle and Pin-makers, Painters, Goldſmiths, Braſiers, Lockſmiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have their Shops in the <hi>Batzars</hi> where they work, but their work is chiefly that of the Goldſmiths, Painters, and Lockſmiths, is ſo ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is by no means to be compared with ours. There are alſo Turners, Fletchers that make Arrows and Darts, and Bow-makers, that have beſides their Shops ſmall Butts, that any body that goes by may exerciſe himſelf, or try his Bow before he buyeth it. Theſe Bows are ſometimes plain Work, and ſome inlaid with Ivory, Buflers Horns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which maketh them of a differing Price. The Archers wear a Ring upon their right Thumbs, as our Merchants wear their Seals wherewith they draw the String on when they are going to ſhoot, theſe are made of Wood, Horn, or Silver, and ſome are ſet with Precious Stones. Beſides theſe you find in great <hi>Batzars</hi> ſome Barbar-Surgeons, which, (when they have no body to trim) uſe to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Streets with their Inſtruments and a Flask of Lather to look out for Work; if they find any that will be trimed they do not come back to their Shops but go to Work in the Streets, or in the next <hi>Champ</hi> if any be near, and there begin to Lather him, and ſhave all the Hair of his Head, ſave only one long Lock which he leaves to hang down his Back. There are alſo places where they ſell Slaves of both Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, old and young, which are ſold dearer or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48499:61"/>
cheaper, according to their Strength or Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in all theſe Countries I ſaw neither Wheel-wright nor Cart-wright, becauſe neither Waggons nor Carts are in uſe with them: Neither could I find (for all it is ſo great a City) a Gunſmith that underſtood how to mend the leaſt fault in a Gun-lock, becauſe there is a great Trade daily driven in theſe <hi>Batzars,</hi> you ſhall find there at all times of the day a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People of ſeveral Nations walking up and down, which makes a Crowd as if you were in a Fair. Amongſt them you will often ſee drunken <hi>Turks,</hi> which uſe to puſh People that do not give them the way immediately, chiefly if they be Chriſtians; but the Chriſtians are not afraid of them for all that, but prepare themſelves (when they perceive ſome of them to approach among the People) and ſtand upon their Guard to be even with them, and when the <hi>Turks</hi> come and puſh them, they make them rebound again to one ſide, or to one of the Shop-boards. Sometimes alſo the <hi>Turks</hi> will lean themſelves backwards againſt the Shops, and when they ſee a Chriſtian go by they let him fall over their Legs, and ſo laugh at them, but then the Chriſtians again when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, they kick up the other Leg of the <hi>Turk</hi> whereon he reſts and ſo make him fall down himſelf. For it is uſual with the <hi>Turks</hi> to try the Chriſtians what Metal they are made of, whether they have Courage or no, wherefore they oftentimes before they are aware of them, aſſault the Chriſtians with rough Words, and if they find them to be affraid they laugh at them to boot, but if they reſiſt them they give over immediately as ſoon as they find them in earneſt (juſt like ſome Dogs that ſooner bark then bite)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48499:61"/>
and eſteem him afterwards the more for it, and call them brave People that are fit for the War.</p>
                  <p>You find alſo in this Crowd ſeveral that are in Orders, called <hi>Sacquatz,</hi> (which commonly are Pilgrims that have been at <hi>Mecha</hi>) that go about with Skins full of Water, and for Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty give to any, nay, even to the Chriſtians that deſire it: (becauſe the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to drink Wine in their <hi>Alcoran</hi>) Wherefore you ſee many in their peculiar Habits (moved thereunto by Devotion) that go all day long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People to exerciſe a Work of Love and Charity to thoſe that are thirſty. They have in one hand a fine gilded Cup whereinto they power the Water out of their Skins, wherein they have commonly laid Chalcedonicks, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes alſo delicate taſted Fruit, to keep the Water freſh, and to recreate the People. When they give you to Drink out of it they reach you alſo a Looking-glaſs with this Admonition, That you ſhall look your ſelf in it, and remember that you are Mortal and muſt die. For this Service they deſire nothing of you, but if you give them any thing they take it and thank you, and ſpout into your Face and Beard (to ſhew their thankfulneſs) ſome fragrant Water which they have in Glaſſes, in a great Pouch tip'd with many Braſs Claſps. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo eſteem it to be a great Charity and Love, if they let their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Troughs or great Pots that ſtand everywhere about their Doors be filled up with freſh Water every day, that Travellers or any that are dry may quench their Thirſt as they paſs by; in it hang little Kettles to drink out of: If one goes to it, others that ſee him go alſo, and drink ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48499:62"/>
for Companies ſake then to quench their Thirſt: So you find often a whole Multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Pot. If you have a mind to eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or to drink other Liquors, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly an open Shop near it, where you ſit down upon the Ground or Carpets and drink together. Among the reſt they have a very good Drink, by them called <hi>Chaube,</hi> (Coffee) that is almoſt as black as Ink, and very good in illneſs, chiefly that of the Stomach; of this they drink in the Morning early in open places before every body, without any fear or regard out of <hi>China</hi> Cups, as hot as they can, they put it often to their Lips but drink but little at a time, and let it go round as they ſit. In this ſame Water they take a Fruit called <hi>Bunru,</hi> which in its Bigneſs, Shape, and Colour, is almoſt like unto a Bay-berry, with two thin Shells ſurrounded, which as they informed me are brought from the <hi>Indies</hi>; but as theſe in themſelves are, and have within them, two yellowiſh Grains in two diſtinct Cells, and beſides, being they agree in their Virtue, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Looks, and Name, with the <hi>Buncho</hi> of <hi>Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Bancha</hi> of <hi>Raſis ad Almans</hi> exactly; therefore I take them to be the ſame, until I am better informed by the Learned. This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is very common among them, wherefore there are a great many of them that ſell it, and others that ſell the Berries, everywhere in their <hi>Batzars</hi>: They eſteem it as highly as we do in our Country Wormwood Wine, or that that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſeveral Herbs and Drugs: yet they love Wine better if their Law would allow them to drink it, as we have ſeen in the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Selymo,</hi> when he gave them leave to drink it, that they met together daily in Drinking-houſes, and drunk to one another,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48499:62"/>
not only two or three Glaſſes of ſtrong Wine not mixed with Water, but four or five of ſuch as came from <hi>Venice</hi> to them ſo quickly one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another with ſuch eagerneſs, (as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen it) that they would not allow themſelves to eat a Morcel or two between it; and ſo as you may eaſily gueſs, they become to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did preſently, and ſo Hoggiſh, that they excel all other Nations in it. But after <hi>Selymus</hi> was dead, and his Son <hi>Amurath</hi> ſucceeded him in his right, he immediately forbad them to drink Wine in the very beginning of his Reign, and looked after it with ſuch ſeverity, that any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that did but ſmell of Wine was Impriſoned immediately, put out of his place, and a great Fine put upon him according to his capacity, or for want of it, puniſhed ſeverely with many Blows under his Soals. During this Prohibition it happened, that when the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Halepo</hi> had a mind to go abroad and met in the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard one of his men that was Drunk, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by his ſtaggering, he drew his Scime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cut off his Head, and ſo left him dead upon the place. But yet notwithſtanding all this Severity, and be it never ſo peremptorily forbid, they do not only not mind ſuch Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, chiefly the Renegadoes, (being very much uſed to it) but long and linger the ſooner after it with that eagerneſs, that in the Summer time they uſe to carry in privately (juſt like the Ants) great quantities of Wine, and lay up good Stores that they may meet at Night and drink together until they have their Bellies full, and ſo reſt after it all Night that they might not ſmell of Wine the next Day. In that time when they were prohibited to drink Wine we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fared very well and bought our Wine very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48499:63"/>
cheap, until afterwards they had leave to drink it again: Their Wines are generally red, very good and pleaſant, they keep it in Skins; they are brought to <hi>Halepo</hi> from ſeveral places, but chiefly from a famous Town called <hi>Niſis,</hi> which lieth two days Journey diſtant from it upon the Borders of <hi>Armenia:</hi> The uſe of Skins is ſtill ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great with them as it was in former Ages, as we may ſee by the ſimilitude of Chriſt, when in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> Chap. 9. Verſ. 17. he ſays, <hi>No man put new wine into,</hi> &amp;c. Seeing that the Chriſtians have leave to drink Wine, therefore they ſell and buy moſt of it, they alſo plant it, and have whole Villages in their Poſſeſſions, with abundance of Vineyards. But the <hi>Turks</hi> not being allowed to drink Wine by their Laws do not keep or cultivate many Vineyards, and if they do they preſs the Grapes after ſeveral ways, for ſome they make into <hi>Cibebs,</hi> chiefly theſe People that live in and about <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where indeed the beſt groweth; others boyl the Juice of the Grapes up to the conſiſtence of Honey which they call <hi>Pachmatz,</hi> chiefly theſe that live at <hi>Andeb,</hi> a Town between <hi>Bir</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſib.</hi> They have two ſorts of this rob, one very thick, and the other ſomewhat thinner, the former is the beſt, wherefore they put it up into little Barrels to ſend into other Countries, the latter they uſe themſelves, mix it ſometimes with Water and give it to drink (inſtead of a Julep) to their Servants, ſometimes they put it into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cups, to dip their Bread in it, as if it were Honey, and ſo eat it. Beſides theſe they have other ſweet Drinks which they prepare out of red Berries called <hi>Jujubes</hi> (or of <hi>Cibebs,</hi> which when boiled in Water with a little Honey the Inhabitants call <hi>Haſſap</hi>) and others called ſtill

by the old name of <hi>Berberis,</hi> of which they bring great quantities down from Mount <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Among other Liquors they have a ſpecial one called <hi>Tſcherbeth,</hi> which boiled of Honey taſteth like unto our Mead; they have another made of Barley or Wheat, by the Ancients called <hi>Zychus</hi> and <hi>Curmi:</hi> theſe two laſt make the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo merry and elevated, that as our Clowns do when they drink Beer, they ſing and play on their Hautboys, Cornets, and Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Drums (which their Muſicians make uſe of every Morning when the Guards are relieved): All theſe Liquors are ſold in their great <hi>Batzars,</hi> where they have Baskets full of Ice and Snow all the Summer long, whereof they put ſo much into the Drink that it maketh their Teeth chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and quake again. Thus much I thought convenient to mention of their Liquors or Drinks.</p>
                  <p>Concerning their Food, their Bread is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and good, and ſo white, chiefly at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepo,</hi> that none is like it in all <hi>Turkey:</hi> ſo they have ſeveral ſorts of it, of ſeveral ſhapes and mixtures, whereof ſome are done with Yolks of Eggs, ſome mixt with ſeveral ſorts of Seeds, as of Seſamum, <hi>Romiſh</hi> Coriander, and wild Garden Saffron, which is alſo ſtrowed upon it; Meat is cheap with them and very good, by reaſon of the precious Herbs that grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, chiefly upon Mount <hi>Tauri,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth itſelf very far Eaſtwards, from whence they have abundance of Cattel, as Rams, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Sheep with broad and fat Tails, whereof one weigheth ſeveral Pounds. They have alſo great ſtore of Goats which they drive daily in great Numbers through that City to ſell their Milk, which every one that hath a mind
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48499:64"/>
to it drinks warm in the open Streets; among them there are ſome that are not very big, but have Ears two foot long, ſo that they hang down to the Ground and hinder them from feeding, when one of them is cut off which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, they turn themſelves always upon that ſide that the other Ear may not hinder them from feeding. They have no want of Beefes and Bufles, for they are very common there, and the Butchers kill the Beaſts in the Fields without Town, where they have their Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſes; thereabout are a great many Dogs that live of the Offels, and have their young ones in Holes and Cliffs where they bring them up, and theſe become ſo Ravenous and Wild, that they run about in the Night after their Prey (as I am informed) like Wolffs in our Country: And this may very well be, for the <hi>Turks</hi> do not only not kill any Dogs but rather carry them home when they are young, and there feed them till they are grown up and able to ſhift for themſelves, and they believe that they do a deed of Charity that is very acceptable to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: like unto the Divines in the <hi>Indies,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Banians,</hi> which ſerve the Birds in the ſame manner as theſe do the Dogs and Cats. Theſe Wolves are more like to our Dogs both in Shape and Bigneſs; and ſo ſays <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the Wolves in <hi>Aegypt</hi> are leſs and laſier then theſe towards the North; being there are no Inns in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where, as with us, Travellers may Lodge and have their Diet, therefore there is a great many Cake-ſhops kept in the <hi>Batzars,</hi> where all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Victuals are cleanly dreſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Meat, Fouls, and all ſorts of Sauces, and Broths, and Soups, where every body buys what he hath a mind to, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48499:64"/>
of his Purſe. Among the reſt nothing is ſo common as Rice, which they boyl up to ſuch a ſtiffneſs, that it crumbleth. A great many other ſorts you ſhall ſee in Copper Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon their Shop-boards, prepared after the ſame way, amongſt the reſt peculiarly a very common one, called <hi>Bnuhourt,</hi> made of Barley and Wheat, which were firſt broke on a Mill, and perhaps dryed, and ſo boyled with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Milk, into a thick Pap. <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in the 83d Chapter of his Second Book, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this by the name of <hi>Crimnon</hi>; and alſo <hi>Avicen.</hi> and <hi>Rhaſas ad Almanſ. in Synonymis,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>Sanguick</hi> and <hi>Savick.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> provide themſelves with good ſtore of this, chiefly in War-time, by Water and by Land, that when they want Proviſion, they may make uſe of it inſtead of Bread. Beſides theſe, they have more Diſhes amongſt them: I remember one called <hi>Trachan</hi>; when it is dreſſed, it is ſo tough, that you may draw it out like Glue; this they make up into little pieces, which being dryed, will keep good a great while, and is very good and pleaſant Food after it is boyled; wherefore they lay up great Stores of this in their ſtrong Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as we do of Corn, that in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they may eat it inſtead of Biſquets, or other Food. That ſuch ſorts of Foods (by the Latiniſts called <hi>Pùls</hi>) have been very well known to the Ancients, and that in caſe of neceſſity they uſe to make a ſhift with it, <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth in his Eighteenth Book, and the Eighth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo all manner of Poultry in great plenty, <hi>viz.</hi> Pullen, Snipes, Partridges with red Bills, Woodcocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but very few Fiſhes, becauſe they have only a ſmall Rivolet,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48499:65"/>
(which is full of Turtles) ſo that at <hi>Halepo</hi> they are very ſcarce: Neither do they eſteem them much, becauſe moſt of them drink Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Wine (which is prohibited by their Law) wherefore there are but very few brought thither from foreign places, as <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and the great River <hi>Euphrates, &amp;c.</hi> diſtant from thence two or three miles. Beſides this, they have little By-diſhes, as Kal, Colliflowers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Turneps, French-Beans, Beſides Trees and Codded Fruits, and many more; but yet they are not ſo well skilled in the dreſſing of them, as we are in our Country.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They put alſo up with their <hi>Cheeſe, Cibebs, Almonds, dryed Cicers, Piſtachio's,</hi> and crack'd <hi>Haſel-nuts,</hi> which (although they are carried thither from our Country) are better taſted, and pleaſanter than ours. They have many ſorts of Preſerves, very well done with Sugar and Hony; very artificially (chiefly thoſe they carry about to ſell upon Plates very well garniſh'd) made up and ſet out with ſeveral Colours and Shapes very beautiful to behold. For the reſt, they live very ſparingly, and bring the Year round with ſmall and little Expences, for they do not make ſo great Feaſts, nor have ſo many Diſhes, nor beſtow ſo great Coſt as we do in our Country.</p>
                  <p>In theſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries they eat upon the plain Ground, and when it is Dinner-time they ſpread a round piece of Leather, and lay about it Tapeſtry, and ſometimes Cuſhions, whereupon they ſit croſs-leg'd: Before they begin to eat, they ſay Grace firſt, then they eat and drink haſtily, and every one taketh what he has a mind to, and do not talk much. The Rich have fine Cotton-Linnen about their Necks, hanging
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48499:65"/>
downwards, or elſe hanging at their Silk-gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, which they uſe inſtead of Napkins: Their Wives or Women do not eat with them, but keep themſelves in their peculiar Apartments. After they have done, they riſe altogether with a Jerk, ſwinging themſelves about, which our Countrymen cannot eaſily imitate, till after they have been there a long while, for the Limbs are numbed in ſitting croſs-legg'd, ſo that one hath a great deal to do to bring them to themſelves again. At laſt they take up the Leathern Table, with Bread and all, which therefore ſerveth them alſo inſtead of a Table-Cloth and Bread-basket, they draw it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a String, like a Purſe, and hang it up in the next corner.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Short and Plain Relation of Plants, which I gathered during my stay at</hi> Halepo, <hi>in and round about it, not without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and trouble, which I glued upon Paper very carefully.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEing I undertook this long Journey, chiefly on purpoſe to ſee my ſelf thoſe fine Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh Plants, whereof Authors ſo often make mention, growing in their native Soil, and ſo gain a more clear and perfect Knowledge of them. I was very glad to have an opportunity to ſtay longer than I intended, that I might the oftner go out with my Friends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades into the Fields, among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> (not without great pain and danger of being knock'd on the Head) to fetch in more and greater variety of Plants: Wherein my Comrade <hi>Hans Ulrich Krafft,</hi> who came into theſe parts along with me, very often hath faithfully and honeſtly aſſiſted me. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heretofore made mention of the Garden-Herbs and Fruits, I will only in this place write of them which grow abroad without the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and that with all poſſible ſhortneſs, and begin with the <hi>Poplar-Tree,</hi> as the commoneſt of all, which the Inhabitants ſtill call by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Arabian</hi> Name <hi>Haur</hi>; they grow very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48499:66"/>
high in theſe Countries, and abundance of them grow about the Rivolet near <hi>Halepo,</hi> which make very ſhady Walks underneath in the heat of Summer. There is alſo a peculiar ſort of Willow-Trees, called <hi>Safcaf, &amp;c.</hi> theſe are not all alike in bigneſs and heighth, and in their Stems and Twigs they are not very unlike unto Birch-Trees, (which are long, thin, weak, and of a pale-yellow colour) they have ſoft Aſh-colour'd Leaves, or rather like unto the Leaves of the Poplar-Tree, and on their Twigs here and there are Shoots of a ſpan long, like unto thoſe of the <hi>Cypriotiſh wild Fig-trees,</hi> which put forth in the Spring tender and woolly Flowers, like unto the Bloſſoms of the Poplar-Tree, only they are of a more drying quality, of a pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and a fragrant ſmell. The Inhabitants pull of theſe (becauſe they bear no Fruits) great quantities, and diſtil a very precious and ſweet Water out of them, very comfortable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating to the Heart. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call theſe Trees <hi>Zacneb</hi> and <hi>Zacnabum; Rhaſes</hi> in 353<hi>d,</hi> and <hi>Avicenna</hi> in his 749<hi>th</hi> Chapt. And after the ſame manner maketh <hi>Serapio</hi> mention of them in his 261<hi>ſt</hi> Chapt. by the common Name of <hi>Zucumbeth</hi>; and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Fourth Book, and Eleventh Chapter, where he treats of <hi>Elae-agnus,</hi> which this is very like unto, and may be taken for the ſame, although they differ in bigneſs, which often and eaſily happens according to the ſoyl and place where they grow. Hereabout are other ſmall Trees, which I rather take to be thorny Shrubs; they are very like in leaves unto the others, and are called by the <hi>Moors Sciſeſun.</hi> They love to grow in moiſt places, and in Hedges; from the Root ſhoot ſeveral Stems, cloathed with a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48499:67"/>
ſmooth brown-colour'd Bark; they bear at top pretty long and ſtrong Twigs, which here and there are beſet with a few Prickles, whereon grow ſmall Flowers, white without and yellow within, whereof three and three ſprout out between the Leaves. I did not ſee any of their Fruit, but yet I do believe that they are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Olives of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Olive-Tree, to which this Plant is very like, which is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally delineated in the Herbal of the learned <hi>Matthiolus.</hi> Theſe Trees caſt forth ſuch an odour in the Spring, that any body that goes by muſt needs be ſenſible of it preſently. Wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> cut many of their Branches, and ſtick them up in their Shops.</p>
                  <p>On the Banks of the above-mentioned Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volet, chiefly about the Stone-Bridge, as you travel to <hi>Tripoly,</hi> grow many <hi>Agnus Caſtus's,</hi> of the leſſer ſort, and on the other ſide, in the Fields, many <hi>Pistachia</hi> Nut-trees.</p>
                  <p>Within and without the City grow alſo many ſorts of Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> that which <hi>Avicen.</hi> calleth <hi>Azedarack,</hi> but <hi>Rhaſes, Astergio</hi>; white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-Trees, Date-Trees, and Cypreſſes, by the Natives called <hi>Sacub</hi> (which hereabout grow very big and high) Turpentine-Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the Fences and Hedges you will find wild Pomgranate-Trees, with fine double Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wild Almond-Trees, the Fruit whereof the <hi>Moors</hi> carry about in great plenty to ſell to the Poor; and near it, in old decay'd Brick-walls, and Stony places, you ſhall ſee Caper-buſhes: Among the reſt there groweth a very ſtrange Buſh, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Morgſani,</hi> which is very green and thick, hath a long Woody Coat, whereout ſprout ſeveral Stalks, with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48499:67"/>
round Leaves, like unto <hi>Caper-leaves,</hi> only with this difference, that four of them ſtand together all oppoſite to one another, like unto our Beans; between them there appear ſmall Flowers, red within and white without, whereout grow long Pods, like unto theſe of the <hi>Seſamum.</hi> This Plant hath a very unpleaſant ſcent, wherefore the Inhabitants uſe it frequently to deſtroy Worms: But what the Ancients formerly called it, I know not, but really am of this opinion, it muſt be according to the deſcription the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difrigi</hi> of <hi>Avicen.</hi> and <hi>Aadician</hi> of <hi>Rhaſis</hi>; he that pleaſeth may read more thereof in the quoted places. In theſe places is alſo found the thorny <hi>Acacia,</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Shack,</hi> and by the <hi>Arabians Schamuth,</hi> which are very ſmall and low, chiefly theſe that ſtand in the Fields, which give as much trouble to the Plowmen as the Ferns and Reſt-harrow do here; the Twigs are of an Aſhen-colour, crooked, full of Prickles, like unto thoſe of a Roſe-buſh, and have very ſmall-feather'd Leaves, like unto <hi>Tragacantha,</hi> which are almoſt divided like unto our female Fern, the Flowers of them I have not ſeen, but the Cods that grow out of them are without browniſh, in their ſhape thicker and rounder than our Beans, ſpongy within, and containing two or three reddiſh Seeds.</p>
                  <p>I have, beſides theſe, ſeen in Shops Pods of a Cheſtnut-brown colour, ſold under the name of <hi>Cardem,</hi> which have two or three little diſtinct Cells or Baggs, in each whereof is a reddiſh Seed, in the Figure of our male <hi>Balſam</hi>; theſe are brought from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by ſome thought to be the true <hi>Acacia Dioſc.</hi> whether it be ſo or no I cannot well tell, becauſe I never ſaw the Plant. Very near it, in untilled places, groweth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48499:68"/>
                     <hi>Galega; Siſynrichium Theophraſti,</hi> which is very curiouſly delineated in the Book of <hi>Rempert. Dodon. de herbis &amp; floribus coron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo found another fine Plant, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Tharaſalis,</hi> which hath ſeven or eight waved Leaves, which ſtand about a round Stalk, almoſt as it is to be ſeen in <hi>Siſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richium,</hi> only they are a great deal broader, and not ſo long, when the Stalk thereof (which is not above a cubit long) is grown, through and above them; it gets at top a white Flower, not very unlike unto the low blew Flower de Luce which blow early in the Spring; it has a roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Root, like unto that of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and alſo has many long white Fibres. Not far from thence, when you get upon the Hill, there groweth in the rough places others, <hi>viz. Biſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> ſtill by the Inhabitants called <hi>Zuph,</hi> a fine ſort of <hi>Verbacum; Scorzonera</hi> with purple Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Saffron with ſmall little Leaves, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate yellow Flower; alſo <hi>Ariſarum, Homaid.</hi> and <hi>Arum,</hi> called by them <hi>Carſaami,</hi> whereof there are four ſorts, among the reſt a ſtrange one, with long Ears, wherefore they call it in their Language <hi>Ovidne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There alſo are about the Rivers ſome <hi>Anemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, and of ſeveral colours, very beautiful, as red, purple colour, yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which they call with a common name <hi>Sakaick,</hi> and give an additional Name accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the colour to it, <hi>viz. Schackaick ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Sakaik aſſar, Aſerack, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, red-yellow, of a Violet colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would be too long and tedious, to deſcribe all here: Chiefly if I ſhould at length relate the common ones, as, <hi>Wild Rue, Aſphodelus albus; Rheſeda Plin. Flos ſolis foliis minoribus ſerpilli,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48499:68"/>
Wild Onions,</hi> and other innumerable more. As you come down by another way back again, nearer to the Corn-Fields, you find other fine Herbs, as the wild new <hi>Harmala,</hi> a delicate ſort of <hi>Aſtragalus foliis hedyſari minoris,</hi> and by it another which is very like unto <hi>Aſtragalus</hi> of <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> ſo that I really believe it to be the ſame. There appear a great many of them upon the the heighth; it is a low Herb, with a long browniſh Root, as big and long as the Roots of Horſe-radiſh, which puts out at the ſides ſome ſtrong Fibres, which are almoſt blacker and harder to cut than the Root it ſelf: Some of them go downwards, and others the greater part upwards, and bended like unto Horns. Theſe contain, together with their ſweetneſs, alſo a dryneſs; they ſhoot out at the top into ſeveral Branches of the ſame colour, yet not above the length of a Finger, which encline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earth, where out grow nine or ten ſmall Leaves, like <hi>Lentil-leaves,</hi> not very unlike to thoſe of <hi>Orobus,</hi> and diſtributed after the ſame manner. Between them ſprout out pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-brown Flowers, after them come long and thick and full Bladders, whereof ſome are as big as thoſe of the <hi>Colutea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe, and ſeveral other Herbs, have I preſerved and glued to ſome Paper with great and peculiar care, ſo that they are to be ſeen in their natural colours, ſo exact as if they were green.</p>
                  <p>About the River, up a Hill, I found a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and fragrant Herb, with long and white Roots, of a pretty acrimonious taſte, its Leaves were like unto our Coriander, only ſomewhat rounder, and not ſo much cut, but only a little about the edges; I found no Stalks nor Flowers,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48499:69"/>
for it was early in the year, and about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which is the time of their firſt ſpringing, theſe they called <hi>Zarneb Melchi,</hi> and the Inhabitants dig ſo many of theſe Roots, that they ſend yearly ſeveral Cheſts-full into <hi>Perſia,</hi> where they uſe them (as I am informed) very frequently in Pains of their Backs, and all other accidental Pains. As far as I can ſee, when I look upon the Leaves, I reckon it to be the third ſort of <hi>Daucus</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> A little lower, as you come to the plow'd Fields, I found alſo the ſecond kind of <hi>Chondrilla</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> with round Roots of a ſmooth and dark-yellowiſh colour, perhaps at the top half an inch thick, and five or eight long, whereon at the end where it is thinneſt, hangs another round Root of the bigneſs of a Cheſtnut, which are ſo full of Milk, that they are ready to crack; at top, where it is divided into three parts, ſprout out many long and ſmall Graſs Leaves together, which lye flat upon the Ground; between them come out yellow Flowers like unto theſe of <hi>auricula muris,</hi> each whereof hath its peculiar Stalk.</p>
                  <p>Not far from it, yet in rougher and ſtonier Ground, groweth another <hi>Chondrilla,</hi> which is like unto that former in all parts, only the Leaves thereof are broader, and more woolly, and of an Aſh-colour, very like unto the <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium</hi> of <hi>Montpellier.</hi> As you go to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Garden, (about a ſmall mile from the Town) at the Road, I found a good many Plants, <hi>viz. Draba Dioſc.</hi> call'd <hi>Orobanche Halinu, Spina ſolſtitialis,</hi> a kind of <hi>Carduus Mariae</hi>; Wild Cucumbers, by them called <hi>Adiural hamar; Xyphium, Peplium, Heliotropium tri coccum Caroli Cluſii,</hi> and alſo his <hi>Paronychia Hiſpanica,</hi> and his third <hi>Lichnis,</hi> with pale and red purple-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48499:69"/>
Flowers; <hi>Coris Mathi.</hi> with yellow Flowers; two delicate ſorts of <hi>Geraniums</hi>; and upon old Walls I found a little <hi>Rauckel,</hi> with pale-colour'd Flowers, <hi>Umbilicus Veneris,</hi> and a great many more. I cannot leave unmentioned thoſe that are growing round about in the Fields, and chiefly amongſt them a <hi>Medica,</hi> with diſſected trifoliated Leaves; and many more, whereof ſome have long and ſtraight, and others many bended Pods, in a cluſter together. I alſo found one with many white and hoary Heads, which looked almoſt like unto <hi>Lagopodium,</hi> and another little one with green-colour'd Pods preſſed together, ſo long and broad as thoſe of <hi>Senna,</hi> which were a great Ornament to the whole Plant. And alſo thereabout are found many ſorts of Corn-flowers, quite differing from ours: <hi>Papaver erratic,</hi> in their Language called <hi>Schuck,</hi> of which they make a Conſerve with Sugar, and uſe it in Coughs; <hi>Papaver cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculatum</hi> with ſtately purple Flowers. I found alſo there <hi>Eryngium,</hi> with blewiſh Tops and ſtarred Heads: Two ſorts of <hi>Henbane,</hi> whereof one that groweth in the Fields hath red and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-colour'd Flowers, the other which I found in the Town upon the old Walls had white ones, by the Latines call'd <hi>Apollinaris.</hi> Much thereabout, in the Corn, grew the leſs <hi>Melam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrum,</hi> by them called <hi>Paponeſck,</hi> which at the top beareth thick yellow flowers, very like unto the <hi>Melampyrum Tragi; Item</hi> the ſecond kind of <hi>Wild Cumin,</hi> with yellow flowers, and long ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded pods: <hi>Poterion Math.</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Megaſac,</hi> which they ſtick up in their Chambers, to keep them from being bewitch'd. A delicate ſort of <hi>Horminum,</hi> with ſmall woolly and diſſected leaves, a Garden-Cypreſs with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48499:70"/>
gold-colour'd flowers: <hi>Seabioſa, Anchuſa,</hi> and a <hi>Salvia,</hi> which hath many roundiſh leaves, and about their ſquare ſtalks grow purple-colour'd Bells, wherein is its black Seed, like unto that of <hi>Meliſſa Molucca,</hi> whereof I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above. In the Corn alſo groweth <hi>Leontope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talon,</hi> in their Language <hi>Aſlab,</hi> with its brown-colour'd round Root, and large Leaves, which are roundiſh, and very near divided like unto theſe of our <hi>Paeonia</hi>; the Stalk hath at the top, which is about a foot high, and hollow, more Twiggs, whereof the point of each of them bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſeveral ſmall purple and yellow Flowers, which make roundiſh Bladders, that contain one, two, and ſometimes three Seeds, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren uſe to play their Tricks with them as they do with the Flowers of <hi>Papaver erraticum</hi> in our Country. The great Roots they bruiſe, and rub with it Spots in Cloaths, which they (as they ſay) draw out immediately.</p>
                  <p>By theſe in the Corn groweth alſo the true <hi>Chryſogonum</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> which is as high as the former, and alſo in Flowers, Stalks, and roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Root (which is redder within) very like it, only the Stalk is ſlenderer, and hath more and longer by-ſhoots, or <hi>germina,</hi> at the end whereof you ſee ſtately yellow Flowers, ſo that it is thicker, and more ſpriggy than the other: Its pennated Leaves (whereof there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly four that come from the Root with long foot-ſtalks almoſt as ſlender as a Thread) lye cloſe to the Ground, as you may eaſily imagin, and have every one their Ribs, two and two Leaves growing together on each ſide, one after another, ſo that four of them ſtand together in a croſs; they are darkiſh green, and at the out ſide, where they are broader, very like unto

Oaken leaves. Now, as theſe and others, that grow in theſe Countries, are as yet very little known, ſo may alſo the following, that groweth in plowed Fields, be reckoned among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, which is very like unto the <hi>Lycopſis</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi> for which, in my opinion, it ought to be taken.</p>
                  <p>This Plant hath a red Coat, and a ſtraight Stalk about two foot high, from whence round about below ſpread themſelves many ſtrong and rough Leaves, in a circle, as if it were from one center; not unlike the wild Bugloſs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a little by degrees, as they grow higher and higher: Out of each of them, cloſe to the Stalk, ſprouts out many Twigs, with their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſmall Leaves, as you ſee in <hi>Echium</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them ſhoot out very tender purple-colour'd Flowers, which are whole within, and divided into ſix ſmall or longiſh Leaves, almoſt like unto theſe of the <hi>Caryophillus montanus.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>February</hi> I have ſeen ſeveral Sorts of <hi>Hyacinths,</hi> and the <hi>Oriental</hi> one in the greateſt quantity, which they call <hi>Zumbel</hi> in their Language. In <hi>April</hi> I ſaw another very delicate one, known to them by the name <hi>Ayur,</hi> with long and very ſmall Leaves of our <hi>Philangium</hi>; it groweth pretty high, and beareth at the top four Stalky Flowers; the Leaves thereof are very like in ſhape and colour unto the three Leaves that ſtand up in our <hi>Flower de luce</hi>; the Root is very like to that of a <hi>Tulip,</hi> whereof I have alſo ſeen a great number in theſe Grounds of all ſorts of colours. I have alſo found ſome Daiſies like unto our own, and alſo another ſort of them with nine or ten white Saffron-flowers, which ſprout ſooner in the Spring in the Corn, not ſo bare as ours, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48499:71"/>
the Leaves. The Leaves are pretty thick, but narrower, longer, and narrower pointed than the before-mentioned: They alſo ſpread more about upon the Ground, and come from a white Coat with a brown-red Skin, ſurrounded and divided in the middle, it is called <hi>Kuſan</hi> in their Tongue, but by ſome others it is ſtill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Surugen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe and a great many more ſtrange Herbs have I found, but becauſe they were unknown to me, I forbear to mention any more of them. But yet I cannot but deſcribe to you one more, for the taking of which I and my two Comrades fell into great danger, as we often did, both of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> which needs not all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated here: This is called by the Inhabitants <hi>Rhaſut,</hi> and alſo <hi>Rumigi</hi>; it hath a ſtrong, yet unpleaſant ſavour, and about four ſtalks of a whitiſh colour, and ſo tender towards the Root, and ſo ſmall as a Packthread, whereon at each ſide grow ſeven or eight tender aſh-colour'd Leaves one againſt the other, diſtributed like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of <hi>Oſmond-Royal,</hi> only they have round Ears towards the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lk, like unto the ſmall <hi>Sage,</hi> and between the lowermoſt, which are a little more diſtant, Flowers like unto our <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> yet a great deal bigger, of a more browniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and hanging on longer Stalks. The Root ſtriketh very deep, and is very like unto our <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litory,</hi> of a drying quality, and ſomewhat hot, as the bitter taſte intimates. When I was buſie about this tender Plant, and ſtrove to get it out whole, which took me up the more time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had no proper Tools by me, a <hi>Turk</hi> well armed came galloping upon us, to ſee what we were doing; but when we perceived him to be fuddled, and that he earneſtly ſet upon us, to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48499:71"/>
make booty of us, each of us gave him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own deſire (ſeeing that he would not leave us without it) ſomething, that ſo we might get rid of him, ſo he rode away very well pleaſed out of our ſight, ſo that we took no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care of him. But before I could get the Root quite out, he came back again with full ſpeed upon us, ſo I bid my Comrades to run to the next Olive-Trees, and I would follow them preſently; but when I ſaw him come pretty near me, and found I could not get the Plant whole, I pulled it up as well as I could, and ſo ran to my Companions. But when I came to the Olive-trees, I found they were ran ſeveral Olive-trees further, which ſtand row by row, and found my ſelf quite alone and deſtitute, and that I muſt defend my ſelf behind the Tree; ſo he came down upon me with his Cymeter drawn, and fetch'd one blow after the other at me, which I ſtill declined running from one ſide of the Tree to the other, ſo that they went into the Tree and mangled it mightily. In the mean time defending my ſelf thus unarmed againſt him, I took a Reſolution, that if he ſhould take hold of his Bow and Arrow to ſhoot at me, which he could not do except he left his Cyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to run in upon him, and ſtruggle with him: But this Fight during very long, and perhaps his Anger did not give him leave to think of it, I found out another way (knowing them to be very covetous) to make my ſelf free again with a piece of <hi>Money,</hi> and to give him a ſmall Silver piece, (which in their Language they call <hi>Saict,</hi> worth about three-pence or a Groat) ſo <hi>pulled</hi> it out, and ſhew'd it him <hi>ſtill</hi> ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Tree: As ſoon as he ſaw it he gave
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48499:72"/>
over, and beckened to me to give it him, ſo I ſtepp'd to him, and when I reached it to him, he took it. But my Table-book fell out of my Pocket when I pulled out the Money, upon the Ground, wherein I had recorded many things, which when he ſaw, he would have it alſo, but I refuſing it, he grew mad, and began to renew the ſame Game again; then I repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I did not diſmount him when I gave him the Money; yet I conſider'd, that if I ſhould have done him a Miſchief, as he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet although I had never ſo good a Cauſe, I was ſure I muſt be caſt, and perhaps come to a greater miſchief and hurt; ſo I gave him it, and after he had received it, he was pacified and rode away.</p>
                  <p>But to come to my former purpoſe again, I found about the River the other <hi>Tragium Dioſc.</hi> in the ploughed Grounds, and afterwards alſo in abundance upon the Hill, but generally in moiſt places, near to the Spring that runs down the Hill: Its Root is whitiſh, pretty long and ſlender, from thence ſpread themſelves ſome woody Stalks not above a little finger long, whereon grew towards the top many Leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which were long, and had of each ſide of their rib ſmall Leaves, one oppoſite to the other, which were (juſt like the <hi>Tricho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>) divided, only ſomewhat longer, about the bigneſs of theſe of <hi>Aſplenium,</hi> and are (as they) delicately green within, but without, and againſt the Ground, of an Aſh-colour, and woolly, chiefly the ſmall ones, that are juſt ſprouting out between the others. Out of theſe firſt-mentioned Stems come firſt naked long Stalks, upon which grow, at the top,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48499:72"/>
Violet-brown Flowers cloſe together, as if it was an Ear of Corn: The Inhabitants call it <hi>Secudes,</hi> and ſo did the ancient <hi>Arabians,</hi> chiefly <hi>Avicen.</hi> in the 679th Chapter, where he alſo attributeth this Vertue, that it is very proper in the Bloody-flux.</p>
                  <p>In their Gardens the <hi>Turks</hi> love to raiſe all ſorts of Flowers, wherein they take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and uſe to put them on their Turbant, ſo I could ſee the fine Plants that blow one after another, daily, without trouble. In <hi>December</hi> I ſaw our Violets, with dark-brown and white Flowers, whereof they gave me in that Seaſon ſeveral Noſegays. Then came the <hi>Tulips, Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, Narciſſies,</hi> which they ſtill name by the old name <hi>Nergis.</hi> Before all other, I ſaw a rare kind with a double yellow Flower, called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daph,</hi> and a ſtrange <hi>Convolvulus hederae foliis,</hi> with great purple Flowers, whereout grew Seed-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as you ſee in the new <hi>Harmala,</hi> with three diſtinct <hi>Capſula</hi>'s, wherein is kept its black Seed, to which they attribute the vertue of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating tough Slime. This is found ſometimes in Gardens, and by the Inhabitants called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſniſca,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians Acafra,</hi> and <hi>Serapio,</hi> Chapt. 273. <hi>Habalnil;</hi> the <hi>Latines, Granum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum,</hi> and <hi>Carthamus Indicus</hi>; and he that hath a mind to know more of it, let him look into the Author himſelf, in the above-mentioned place, in the 306th Chapter of <hi>Avicen.</hi> and the 208th of <hi>Rhaſes.</hi> I alſo found in their Gardens <hi>Balm, Baſil,</hi> and a fine ſort of <hi>Amaranthus,</hi> which for his colour-ſake may be called <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonia Plinii,</hi> and therefore called Parrots Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48499:73"/>I cannot forbear, before I conclude, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome which I found here and there in the <hi>Batzars,</hi> and among them a ſtrange ſort of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which as I am told grow in ſunny, moory, moſſy, and moiſt places; whereon groweth a long Stalk of the ſame colour and thickneſs of ours, only a great deal broader, but broadeſt of all at top, where it is about three fingers broad, ſo that it is like unto a Spatula that is painted at one end: On this Stalk grow at each ſide ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tender Leaves, which are pretty long, but very ſmall and pointed, and at the top thereof ſome white Flowers like unto ours. When I was thinking of this at ſeveral times, what they were called by the Ancients, it came into my mind, that I had read of them in <hi>Theophraſtus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and I really believe it to be the ſame. But whereas <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> writes in the quoted place, that they do not touch the Ground, I can ſay nothing to it, for I never ſaw any of them growing. They have alſo ſome ſmall Roots to ſell, called <hi>Mamirani tchini,</hi> good for Eyes, as they ſay; they are yellowiſh like <hi>Curcuma,</hi> but a good deal longer, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and knotted, and very like unto our <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligonatum,</hi> and may be eſteemed to be the true <hi>Mamican,</hi> whereof <hi>Rhaſes</hi> maketh mention in ſeveral places. There is alſo among others brought a great quantity of the Juice of <hi>Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> that is ſtill very ſoft, it cometh in Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Bags from out of the Country, and ſo it's ſold to our Merchants in their <hi>Fondiques</hi>; but thoſe that buy it muſt have a great care (becauſe it is often adulterated) that they be not cheated. There is alſo a good deal of the Juice, by the Apothecaries called <hi>Opium,</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48499:73"/>
by the Inhabitants <hi>Ofinn,</hi> which the <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and other Nations take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, not only in War, at the time when they go to fight their Enemies, to make them couragious and valiant, but alſo in time of Peace, to drive away Melancholy and Care, or at leaſt to eaſe it. Their religious People make alſo uſe of it, but above all the reſt the <hi>Deruis,</hi> and take ſo much of it, that it maketh them preſently drowſie, and without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when, after their barbarous and ſilly way, they cut, ſlaſh, or burn themſelves, they may feel leſs ſmart or pain. If any one hath ſo begun to make uſe of it, (they take about the quantity of a large Pea at a time) they cannot well leave it off again, except they have a mind to throw themſelves into a Sickneſs or other Inconveniencies: For, as they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if they omit taking of it, they find themſelves very ill in their Bodies. <hi>Opium</hi> is commonly taken from the white Poppy-heads, in their Language called <hi>Caſcaſch,</hi> wherein they cut (when they are young and tender) a ſpiral or winding-circle round about it from top to bottom, one under the other; out of thoſe runs ſome Milk, which they let be there until it groweth thick, then they gather it and make it into Balls, like unto our perfumed Soap-balls. Being that the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe this <hi>Opium</hi> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, it happens ſometimes that they take ſo much of it, that it is very dangerous; wherefore they have an Antidote (as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) that is the Root <hi>Aſlab</hi> (whereof I have made mention before) which they give to bring them to rights again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48499:74"/>I found alſo in the great <hi>Batzars</hi> a ſort of <hi>Alga</hi> ſold in their Shops, which was dark-red, and therefore very uſeful for Dyers; it had Stalks of the thickneſs of a Finger, and was ſurrounded with ſeveral thin Scales, or rather Leaves, and round: Wherefore it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a <hi>Saderva</hi> Serap. and Herb <hi>Alargi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> of <hi>Andreas Bellunenſis,</hi> whereof he maketh mention in his <hi>Index,</hi> where he interpreteth the <hi>Arabian</hi> words. For a kind of this may alſo be taken (becauſe it affords a delicate purple colour) that <hi>Alga</hi> that is found in the Seas near <hi>Candia,</hi> and is deſcribed by <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Fourth Book and Seventh Chapter. Laſtly, Among the reſt, I did alſo enquire after the <hi>Amomum,</hi> and thought, becauſe they were near unto the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that therefore they might eaſily have it by the <hi>Caravans,</hi> which come daily from thoſe parts; yet I was forced to run a great while after it, till at length I got a little Stalk thereof in one Shop: They call it by the name of <hi>Hamama.</hi> But of the other, ſo called by <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> which is like unto it, and therefore may eaſily be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the right one, they had a great deal. Theſe two ſmall Shrubs, although they are very like to one another, yet for all that they may be diſtinguiſh'd by their Stalks and different colours. Wherefore <hi>Dioſcorid.</hi> bids us (if we will not be impoſed upon) to pick out the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſmoother, with its noble Seed, and to leave the ſmall. This Stalk, which I found about the length of a Finger, is almoſt of the colour of the Bark of the Cinnamon-tree, and alſo in its acrimony and good odour (although it was old) ſtill very ſtrong. At the top had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48499:74"/>
been ſeveral woody Stalks, cloſe to one another, whereon I believe had been the Flowers and Seeds. But the Twigs of the other ſort, which are crack'd and bended, are of a brown colour, which at the top divide themſelves into other leſs ones, like a Tree, whereon grow ſeveral Stalks, with little Heads like unto the <hi>Maſaron,</hi> or <hi>Marum Syriacum</hi> from <hi>Crete,</hi> wherein is no great ſtrength nor odour.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I thought convenient to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrange Plants, chiefly of theſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients make mention of, and ſo I conclude the firſt part of my TRAVELS.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter I had ſtay'd a good while in <hi>Halepo,</hi> and had ſeen and underſtood the Trade and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Inhabitants, together with that of all the other Nations, <hi>viz. Grecians, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Georgians, Arabians, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> which come and go daily with their Caravans, and very well
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48499:77"/>
obſerved and underſtood their Manners and Cuſtoms, and had alſo Collected a fine parcel of foreign and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Plants; I reſolved to go farther Eaſtward into <hi>Meſopotamia, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi> &amp;c. as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt and moſt fruitful Countries that ever were, where the ancienteſt People, and the moſt Potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs did inhabit. But theſe Countries lying far off, and the Way that leadeth thither, paſſing through vaſt Deſarts and Wilderneſſes, and therefore the Voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much the more difficult and dangerous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and accompliſh; I firſt look'd out for a truſty Companion, to take as my Aſſiſtant, and met pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with an experienced <hi>Dutchman,</hi> that had lived a great while in <hi>Halepo,</hi> who granted my requeſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as deſirous to go this Voyage as my ſelf) to go along with me. We agreed preſently, and began to conſider, which was our beſt Way to take. But that we being Strangers, might not be taken to be Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds or Spies (they being very ſuſpicious) from whence they might preſently take occaſion (as the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe to do) to lay great <hi>Avarias,</hi> or unjuſt Taxes, upon us, which the Chriſtians that deal to theſe Parts, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their great Loſs and Damage experienced; we did conſider, and found, that the Trading here was very great, ſo that they did not only deal from hence, into <hi>Armenia, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (for from thence come the Caravans through <hi>Natolia,</hi> in about a Months time) but alſo very much into <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>India:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we thought beſt to profeſs our ſelves Merchants, that ſo we might Travel the more ſafely with other Merchants, in order thereto, to buy ſome Merchandices, that would Sell in thoſe Places, and to carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us. That we might put this in execution, my formerly mentioned Friend <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Raft,</hi> from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> took great Pains to furniſh me at my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Requeſt, with ſeveral fit Commodities for thoſe Places, upon account of my Patron, Mr. <hi>Melchior Manlich,</hi> which I got pack'd up immediately, to go with them to the Famous City <hi>Bagdet,</hi> ſituated upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> where is a great Staple and Depoſition of Merchandices that are to go farther for <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48499:77"/>
But ſeeing that ſeldom any Merchants go from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepo</hi> further into theſe Countries, ſo that our Habits are very rarely ſeen there; we cloathed our ſelves as is uſual, in the common <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit (that every body might not preſently look upon us as Strangers); firſt, we had long blue <hi>Cabans,</hi> which are button'd before quite down, and cut out about the Neck, not unlike to thoſe of the <hi>Armenians</hi>; and white <hi>Drawers</hi> made of Cotton, that hung down to our Ankles, and were drawn in, and tied about our Bodies, and alſo Shirts after the ſame Faſhion, and without Collars. We alſo fitted our ſelves with white Turbants with a blue Brim, ſuch as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſually wear, and put on yellow Shooes which were painted, before guarded with Nails, and with Horſe Shooes behind. Beſides this we put on a kind of a Frock, made of a certain courſe Stuff called <hi>Meska</hi> in their Language, which is common among the <hi>Moors.</hi> They are generally made of Goats and Aſſes Hair, pretty nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, without Sleeves, and ſhort, reaching only to our Knees. But theſe Stuffs being not all alike, the fineſt thereof (chiefly that which is ſtriped white and black) is taken for Cloaths; and the courſer for Tents and Portmantles, wherein they carry their Proviſion through the Deſarts, and alſo keep their Camels and Mules meat, hanging it about their Necks. This puts me in mind of the plain cloathing which the ancient Inhabitants of theſe Countries, (chiefly the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they mourned for their deceaſed Relations, or when they repented of their committed Iniquities, and turned from them, and prayed God to forgive them their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated Tranſgreſſions) uſed to put on, as we read in the 37th. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where <hi>Jacob</hi> lamented the Death of his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi>; and in the Book of the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> who believing the Prophet's Words, denouncing their Deſtruction within Forty Days, and repenting of their Sins, put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and prayed to God for forgiveneſs. The like we read of the King and Prophet <hi>David,</hi> after he had numbred his People. <hi>Item,</hi> in the 10th. Chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> and other places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they put on Sackcloth and did repent in Aſhes. It is therefore very probable,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48499:78"/>
that thoſe were very like unto them that are ſtill in uſe.</p>
                  <p>When we had thus accoutred our ſelves for the Voyage, and provided us with all Neceſſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> Cloths, Merchandices, Proviſion of Biskets and Drink, and did ſtay only for ſome Fellow-travellers, we were ſtill doubtful whether it were more convenient for us to go by Land with <hi>Caravans,</hi> which go from hence and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> very ſtrong to <hi>Bagdet,</hi> through great Sands and Deſarts in Fifty Days, more or leſs, according as the Weather proveth: Or, whether we ſhould go by Water, either upon the <hi>Tigris</hi> or the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> there being good Opportunity to go in Company with others. But it happening that we met with ſome <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants Servants that did live at <hi>Halepo,</hi> who were alſo provided with Goods, and had a mind to go into the ſame Countries, we did readily embrace this Opportunity, partly becauſe they underſtood the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, which two are chiefly ſpoken in <hi>Syria,</hi> and partly becauſe ſome of them had been four times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the <hi>Indies</hi>; wherefore we put our Goods to theirs, and loaded a great many Camels together, to deliver them to us at <hi>Bir,</hi> to ſhip them there upon the <hi>Euphrates</hi>; And that we might paſs every where in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, we took a Paſs from the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and <hi>Cadi,</hi> and ſo we began our Travels to <hi>Bir,</hi> diſtant Three Days Journey, the 13th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Anno 74. By the way we were ſo ſtrange to one another, that in our new Faſhioned Cloaths we did hardly know one another among them all. After we had the firſt Day a rough Road, and travelled through many Deſarts and uninhabited Places, we reached at Night a little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where we encamped and pitched our Tents. We put all our Packs in a circle round about us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them our Beaſts (as it is uſual in great <hi>Caravans</hi>) to defend us from the Aſſaults of the <hi>Moors</hi> in the Night. A little after Midnight we heard a great <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan</hi> of many Camels and Aſſes to go by, very near to us, which after it was paſſed, we broke alſo up and followed them; when the Day Light appeared, we ſaw ſeveral plow'd Fields more than the Day before, and

alſo here and there in ſome pleaſant Places many Tents of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which were fixed together as it were in a Camp; ranged very orderly into Streets. After we had that Morning travelled very hard, ſo that our Beaſts under their heavy Loads began to be tired in the great Heat, we reſted behind a little Chapel, to refreſh our ſelves, and to feed our Camels; in the mean time ſome poor Women came down from the High-lands to us to gather the Dung of our Camels to burn it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Wood, whereof they were in great want. When the great Heat was over, and we had ſtaid there for two Hours, we went on again, and came before it was Night, to a little Village lying in a Valley, near which upon the Height, the <hi>Arabians</hi> had formed a great Camp: We went up to them, and pitched our Tents in the Plain by them, and kept as aboveſaid a good Watch. They came quickly to us, ſpoke kindly to us, and their Wives brought us Water and good Milk; but after we ſaw that they were very naked and hungry, and in their ſhape like to our <hi>Gypſies,</hi> we did not truſt them at all, but kept a very good Watch all that Night. Theſe are Vagabond People, that are uſed to Idleneſs from their Infancy, and will rather endure Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Heat and Cold, than get any thing by their Handy-work, or Till the Fields, or Plant Garden-herbs for their Maintenance, although they might do it in ſeveral fruitful Places in their own poſſeſſion. So you find here a great Number of them by the ſides of theſe ſandy Deſarts, that have no where any Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but live in their Tents like as the Beaſts do in Caves, and go like unto the <hi>Gypſies</hi> from place to place, until they light on one, where they may live a great while with their Cattle, and when all is eat up, want dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them from thence, to look out for another.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th. early before break of Day, we were up in the cool of the Day, with an intention to reach to <hi>Bir</hi> that Night, but our Camels were grown ſo faint by reaſon of the exceſſive Heat and the great Burthens, that they fell down ſeveral times, wherefore we look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for a convenient place where we might ſtay all Night, and found at laſt a Village near which we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48499:79"/>
pitched our Tents, eat ſome Gourds and Biskets, and ſo went to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Two Hours before break of the Day, we began our Journey again, and came early in the Morning to the great River called <hi>Euphrates,</hi> we went over with our Goods and Chattel, and fixed our Tents before the Town near the River, on the other ſide, to ſtay for a Barge that was to come from <hi>Armenia,</hi> to go from thence to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is now called <hi>Felugo.</hi> By the way I ſaw no Herbs of any worth, except the <hi>Galega,</hi> in our Language called Goats-rue, which grew plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the dry Heaths; and near to the Road, the firſt ſort of <hi>Apocynum,</hi> by us called Dogs-bane, very like unto the great Celandine in its Leaves and Pods: I alſo ſaw whole acres of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Corn called <hi>Seſamo,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all ſown with Cotton, and alſo a kind of <hi>Eſula,</hi> very full of Milk, wherewith the fallow Grounds were ſo filled up, that at a diſtance, you would have taken it for good Corn. Seeing that the <hi>Scammony</hi> that uſes to be brought to <hi>Halepo,</hi> is wont ſometime to be very ſharp, therefore it may very well be, that they adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate it with this <hi>Eſula.</hi> Near the Town grew abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Acacia,</hi> called <hi>Schack</hi> and <hi>Schamuck,</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, which are here in Stem and Fruit, greater and larger than ever I ſaw any any where. The Town <hi>Bir</hi> is ſituated on the other ſide of the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> near the high Hill <hi>Taurus,</hi> juſt like <hi>Tripolis</hi> near the <hi>Libanus,</hi> or our <hi>Loſanna</hi> on our <hi>Alps</hi>: It is neither big nor ſtrong, but pretty well defended by a Caſtle that lyeth on a high Rock above the River, not eaſily to be taken. There is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Country round about it, and very fruitful, which (chiefly on this ſide of the River where it is plain) is very well Tilled and Sown with Corn (which they did juſt thraſh out when we came, with little Waggons drawn by Oxen) and here and there are very good Villages. But beyond the River it is more hilly, which kind of Ground extends it ſelf a great way towards the Eaſt, and divideth <hi>Armenia</hi> from <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> It is at the top very rough and bare; nothing but Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and Herbs to be ſeen there; wherefore abundance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48499:79"/>
of Beaſts, chiefly Lambs and Goats, are daily brought down, which are carried over the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſo driven to <hi>Halepo</hi> and other adjacent places. This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver where it runs by the Town is about a Mile broad, and ſo deep that it is not eaſy to make a Bridge over it: Yet becauſe it hath not a ſwift Current in that place, it is not very dangerous to Sail on it, except where it enlargeth it ſelf (as it doth in great Deſarts) or elſe where it divideth it ſelf into ſeveral Branches, ſo that the Water-men do not know, which is the beſt way for them to take; wherefore the Merchants that have a mind to come quicker and with leſs Pains to <hi>Bagdet</hi> with their Merchandices, carry them by Land to <hi>Orpha,</hi> to the Famous Town of <hi>Carahmet,</hi> which lyeth Six Days further towards the Eaſt, on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> upon the rapid River <hi>Tigris,</hi> where is a great Depoſition of Merchandices, that are ſent from thence to <hi>Ormutz</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> The <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> is continually muddy, and therefore almoſt not fit to be drunk, except you let it ſtand Two or Three Hours, until the Sand and Mud is ſunk down to the bottom, which ſometimes is of the thickneſs of an Inch: So that in every Houſe where they have no Wells, all along the River in Towns and Villages, they have ſeveral great Pots which they fill out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and let them ſtand until it be ſetled, but if they have occaſion to drink of it before, they drink through their Towels.</p>
                  <p>During the time of our ſtaying there they brought us ſeveral ſorts of Fiſhes they had caught in the River to Sell, and among the reſt one ſort called <hi>Geirigi,</hi> which in their Shape and Scales were very like unto <hi>Carps,</hi> only they were not ſo thick in the Belly, but a great deal longer and bigger, ſo that ſometimes one of them did weigh three Rotula's of their Weight, which is about Seventeen or Eighteen of our Pounds. They are very delicate and good to eat, and ſo cheap, that we could buy one for one <hi>Medin,</hi> in our Money worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Pence. To catch theſe, our Ship's Crew flung out oftentimes ſome Pellets made up with <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus Indic</hi>; (which Fruit is named by them <hi>Deam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mec</hi>)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48499:80"/>
and preſently after ſome of the Fiſh flung them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up at the top of the Water, whereupon they jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the Ship, to catch them, and to carry them a-ſhoar. I ſaw alſo a peculiar ſort of Vultures, which were ſo tame, that they did not only ſit very thick upon the Houſes, but they ſat down in the Street be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the People without any fear, they are more of an Aſhen Colour than ours, but for bigneſs, height and the reſt, exactly like unto them. Beſides theſe there was another ſort of them, that were ſomething bigger, and of a lighter Colour than the former, and had ſome black at the Ends of their Wings like unto our <hi>Storks.</hi> They eat alſo Carrion, and Meat, and are ſomewhat wilder, wherefore they may be affirmed to be the very ſame that <hi>Rhaſis</hi> called <hi>Gyuni,</hi> and <hi>Avicenn, Rachame.</hi> During the time that we ſtaid there, a <hi>Baſhaw</hi> was ſent hither by the <hi>Turkiſh Sultan,</hi> with ſome hundred <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi's,</hi> pretty well armed, for his Maſter did intend to make War with the <hi>Truſci,</hi> that ſo he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Confines of <hi>Syria, Meſopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> &amp;c. from being aſſaulted by them, and to keep every thing ſecure. The <hi>Truſci</hi> live on the Mountain of <hi>Libanus,</hi> and pretend to be the Off ſpring of thoſe People that under <hi>Godfrey de Bouillon</hi> did poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again of the Land of Promiſe. They are ſince ſo much encreaſed, that they are able to bring into the Field Sixty Thouſand (moſt of which are very good Gunners) which if occaſion be, they can bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſhort time. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſeeing that they encreaſed daily, ſo that he did fear they would be in time too great for him, to prevent this (as then the common Diſcourſe went) and to ſubdue them, and bring them under his Yoke, did ſummon ſome <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws</hi> and <hi>Sangiacs,</hi> chiefly him of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to bring together a great Army, to fall upon them. But which way he did beat them, and how he encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, I ſhall (becauſe I did for this time, during my Travels, hear no more of it) relate more largely after my return. The <hi>Spahi's</hi> which came with the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> took (becauſe they would not be Idle) their Diverſion in Running, Shooting with Arrows,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48499:80"/>
and in Fencing, or Cudgel-playing, and ſometimes the Country People came in with them, and played with them, but not in ſo many ſorts of Arms as the Fencing-Maſters do in our Country, <hi>viz.</hi> with Daggers, Swords or Halbarts, for theſe are not in faſhion in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. They take inſtead thereof only Cudgels, with them they approach towards one another three times, yet not with ſuch flouriſhes and neatneſs as our Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do before they begin, for their long Cloaths hinder them. In their left hand they have a Buckler which is about a Foot Diameter round, covered with Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtuffed out with Hair; in their right Hand they have a Cudgel, wherewith they ſtrike ſtrait at one another in the firſt bout, as the Boys do in our Country, but in the ſecond and third bout, they ſtrike croſs-ways, chiefly in the third which is the laſt, which they take off cleaverly with their Bucklers; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they ſtrike at one anothers Legs, but never to hurt one another; when this is done, they turn back and march off. This manner of Fencing is very common in theſe Countries.</p>
                  <p>At length after we had ſtaid a great while, ſeveral Ships did arrive from above, and ours, for which we did ſtay, among them. So our Patron begun to load, and to fit himſelf for our departure: And ſo did two more that had a mind to go in Company with us. One among them belonging to a <hi>Turk</hi> was laden only with Corn, to carry during the Scarcity (which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the great Heat, and for want of Rain) to <hi>Bagdet.</hi> We alſo bought ſeveral ſorts of Fruits, viz. <hi>Cibebs, Anguria's,</hi> Garlick and Onions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and took alſo along with us ſome Ground Corn, as is uſual to do in ſuch Voyages, which with Rice Flower is fit to make Puddings, or to bake Bread of; Honey and other things to ſerve as Proviſion for our Ship; for we were to travel a great way through many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts and Places not inhabited, where nothing was to be had. For there are no Inns upon this River, as upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> or <hi>Danube,</hi> where they dreſs Victuals for Travellers againſt they come. And that we might have ſometimes ſomething Hot to eat, we provided our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48499:81"/>
with ſeveral Cooking Veſſels (as is uſual in theſe caſes) to dreſs our Meat in. But the Maſter of our Ship ſtill wanting both Men and Merchandices to load his Ship withal, we were forced to ſtay ſomewhat longer, for other Merchants which came in a little time from <hi>Halepo</hi> (whereof ſome were <hi>Armenians,</hi> ſome <hi>Perſians,</hi> others from <hi>Bagdet</hi> and <hi>Balſora</hi>) to us; with theſe alſo came into the Ship Four Souldiers that were liſted by the <hi>Turks</hi> to go to <hi>Bagdet,</hi> to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Confines of <hi>Perſia:</hi> Our Maſter alſo took in ſome of their <hi>Jews,</hi> which are worſe than ours, and ſo we were warned to have a care of them. Beſides all theſe we were forced to take in ſome of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Men, which had long before begged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, for they commonly live by begging, and deſire you to give them ſomething <hi>Alla hitſi,</hi> that is, for God's ſake, and yet if they find an Opportunity they will fall upon you and Rob you. They are very ill-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, idle, and yet very hardy Men, that run about all Countries, and often do a great deal of hurt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one muſt have eſpecial Care of them, chiefly upon the Road. Yet for all this they have in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries very great Privileges; they pretend to great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Devotion, and pray often, and perſwade the Vulgar ſort of People, that God doth hear their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before any others, and grants their deſires, but People do not believe them ſo readily now, as their Anceſtors have done formerly, wherefore they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long in one place, that their Roguery may not ſo much appear.</p>

                        <hi>Which way we went into the Ship, and ſailed to</hi> Racka; <hi>and how the Son of the King of</hi> Arabia <hi>with his Retinue came to our Ship to demand his Cuſtoms: What elſe we ſaw by the way, and what we did ſuffer from the</hi> Arabians <hi>and their Mendicants.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter our Ship as well as the others was ſufficiently loaden, and with all Neceſſaries provided, we went aboard, and began our Voyage in the Name of God, the 30th. Day of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 74. (having ſtay'd there and loſt Seventeen Days) in the Evening, with an intention to go that Night three Leagues further. But two of our Ships got into a branch of the River, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are ſeveral in the very beginning: Our Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took great pains to bring them into the right way again, and ſtayed for them, which retarded us ſo long, that we were forced to ſtay all Night, at a Market-Town, called <hi>Caffra,</hi> which lieth a good League below, on the top of a Hill, where we landed.</p>
                  <p>The next morning at break of Day, we got in again and in the beginning we went on very fortunately, and began to leave by degrees on our left Hand, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which extendeth its ſelf Eaſtward, and went more to the right, through the great Deſarts and Sandy Places of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where that River divideth it ſelf into ſeveral broad Branches, that the Skippers knew hardly how to ſteer the right way. When we went on ſo, thinking of no danger, for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ship was got already very ſafe through one of them, the ſecond (which we followed) ſtuck upon the Sand, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of their Pilot towards the right, ſo that it did not only ſtick there, but took away the Stream from us, which turned their Ship croſs very violently, after ſuch a manner, that we were forced (becauſe we were too
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48499:82"/>
nigh, and our Ship was in her full running, ſo that we could turn no way) to fall foul upon it. So ours drove with the Stream upon theirs with that force, that we broke the two uppermoſt Boards of their ſide; ſo the Water ran in, and the Ship ſank deeper. Our Ship, although it had received no hurt, yet did it not go on, but ſtuck by the other. Whereupon we began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hard, removed the Sand below, and made a way to get it clear; after we had half drawn it before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Stream, the Stream drove it ſo hard againſt the other that alſo a row and a half of our ſide-board were broken, and if it had broken the ſecond row quite, we had incurred the ſame Miſchief and Damage as they. When we were in this Condition, and could not otherwiſe think but that we muſt periſh all together, yet our merciful God and Lord did order it ſo, that we did not only ſecure the breach, but came into the right River free and quit before the other Ship, where we did land immediately. After we had recovered our ſelves a little, we did not delay to aſſiſt the other, but unloaded our Ship, to load theirs into it, and ſo to land them, which we did with all ſpeed: In the mean time appeared behind the Trees and Tamarisks at each ſide a good many <hi>Arabians,</hi> both on Horſe-back and foot, and came ſo near, that they were not afraid to attack our Guards we had left with our Goods, and to attempt to rob us. But when they found reſiſtance, and heard ſeveral of our Guns diſcharged on our ſide, they were frighted (for Guns were unknown to them) to that Degree, that they turned their Backs and run away as hard as they could drive. At laſt we attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to draw out the Ship together with ſome ſmall Goods that were ſtill left in it, which ſucceeded very well, for when we hoiſted our Sails and drew them on, and wrought with all our might and ſtrength, it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Degrees, ſo that at length we got it quite off, and brought it a-ſhoar. The loſs of their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, although it was but ſmall in quantity, yet it was very great in their Silk, Stuffs of <hi>Damaſco,</hi> Soap, Sugar, Roots of <hi>Zarneb Melchi,</hi> which is good for the Pain in the Back, as is here before mentioned,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48499:82"/>
Figs and Corn, which ſuffered very much; wherefore they begged of us, that we would be pleaſed to ſtay with them, until they had dried their Goods and mended their Ship, ſo that they might go along with us more ſafely through theſe Deſarts, which we granted them readily. During this our Stay, when we were helping them, it fell out that I and one of my Comrades were falſly accuſed by ſome Jews, before ſome of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Men, that we were often fudling with the Maſter of the Ship, which the Jew did on purpoſe, to make us Out-landiſh Men hated among them (for they do according to their Law not eaſily admit of drinking of Wine) and to diſparage us; and this his Intention did ſucceed ſo well that when their Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did underſtand it, they became very angry with us, took our Veſſel of Wine, flung it into the River, and drew it upon the Land where they let it run out, which did not well pleaſe the Souldiers and others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took our part, and did give the Jew for it a very ſevere Reprimand. But as no good Deed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unrewarded, and no ill one unpuniſhed, ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened here; for the chiefeſt of them (which was a <hi>Moor</hi> and of the Order of the <hi>Dervis</hi>) was the next Day puniſhed ſeverely, for a frivolous Cauſe, whereof I unadviſedly was the occaſion. While our Goods were yet on ſhoar I got towards Night upon the Balls to ſtand Centinel, it being my turn; ſo when I ſaw one with a Mug full of Water, I deſired him to give me ſome to drink, which he was willing to do, and reached me the Mug, I going to take it, trod by chance upon a Fiddle of one of the <hi>Turks</hi> and broke it: Although he had had great occaſion to be angry with me for this, yet (underſtanding that I had Giue enough to mend it) he was preſently quieted and well contented. The next Morning we ſat together and mended the Fiddle as well as we could; when the <hi>Dervis</hi> ſaw us buſy about the Fiddle, he was very angry that we did not help to ſpread out the Merchandices, which we had done already before we began; ſo he took the Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, broke it and flung it into the River; then he came back, and pretended to bang us, thinking to have the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48499:83"/>
ſame Succeſs with this as he had with the Wine. But the <hi>Turk</hi> ſeeing this, took up a good Cudgel that was thrown up by the River, and ſtruck him ſeveral times over his Head and Limbs, that the Blood ran down his Ears and Face, and at length he grew ſo angry that he went to draw his Scymeter, but before he could, we ſtept in between them, got them aſunder, mitigated the buſineſs and appeaſed them. So this Saint of theirs looked very diſmal in his long and lank black Hair, and had beſides on his Body here and there ſeveral Scars, <hi>viz.</hi> on his Head and Breaſt, and above all upon his Arms, which he had cut or burnt himſelf, which is uſual to that Order, and other <hi>Turks</hi> to do; which ſet often on their Fleſh burning and red glowing Spangs, or inſtead of them Linen Rags, about an Inch thick twiſted very hard together, broad below, and pointed on the top, tapering juſt like unto a Pyramid, which they ſet on Fire, and let it burn out with a great deal of Patience upon their bare Skin, ſo long until it is quite conſumed and brought to Aſhes, then they tie it up with Cotton; they alſo do the ſame ſometimes in Rheums of the Head and Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to dry them up, or to turn them, and to draw them into another place. So I have ſeen ſeveral which have had at leaſt Twenty Scars about them, but chiefly on their Arms, (whereof-ſome were of the bigneſs of a Shilling) beſides Wounds and Scratches they had. But from whence they received this inhumane way (to wound and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves) I do not know, except they had it anciently from the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> which uſed to wound themſelves with Knives and Lances (as we read in the 18th. Chapter of the 3d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Kings</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Blood followed. Theſe Holy Scars and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Zeal, I could ſoon ſee and obſerve on this <hi>Moor,</hi> for according to his Order (which is a very great one) he was to wear no Cloths upon his Body neither Winter nor Summer, only a little Scarf to cover his Privy Members withal: Inſtead of them they put Sheep Skins about them, whereon they lie alſo at Night, and ſo they ſerve them for Cloaths, Bed and Cover. And ſo they pretend by their exteriour Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48499:83"/>
and Behaviour, to great Vertue and Patience, as if they were dead to the World; and to a peculiar Holineſs, in praying, faſting, watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas they are full of Roguery and Knavery, ſo that you ſhall hardly find any like them. With this came alſo ſeveral other Religious Men of ſeveral Orders, which were all in ſeveral diſtinct Habits, as they are in our Country; among them was a very ſtrong, well ſet young Man, of the Order of the <hi>Geomaliers</hi> as they call it, which are rather Secular than Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they are generally <hi>Tſchelebys,</hi> that is Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and rich Perſons, which take great delight in travelling in their young Days, under pretence of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, like Pilgrims, at other Peoples Coſts, through ſeveral Countries and Kingdoms, to ſee and learn, and to get Experience. This had only a blue Coat on that covered his Body, tied about with a Saſh and Shooes of Sheeps Skins, ſuch as the <hi>Arabians</hi> in the Deſarts uſe to wear. There went along with us Two more; whereof one had a great Ring in each Ear, about the thickneſs of a Finger, and ſo heavy that it ſtretched down his ear-laps to his very Shoulders. Theſe are of the Order called the <hi>Calendriers,</hi> which lead a ſober, and abſtemious Life before People, wherefore they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the People, and walk about like Hermits into Deſarts where-ever they can, to pray there ardently, and to cry out the hours (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have Five every Day) as the Prieſts do from the Steeples, wherefore this Man did ſeparate himſelf as often as he had an Opportunity far from us, that the Beaſts could rather ſee and hear him, than we that were in the Ship. When he had done this, he came to us again, and looked ſo devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if he had been in a Rapture or Ecſtaſie. The other was a <hi>Dervis,</hi> whereof I have made mention before, which alſo kept to a very ſtrict Order, for he prayed devoutly and ardently, chiefly at Night after Sun ſet, at what time two or three more uſed to come to him, and among them ſometimes ſome of our Merchants; they did ſtand together in a circle, and ſo began to pray (as I heard often) firſt very lowly,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48499:84"/>
then by degrees louder, but when they came to the <hi>Leila Hillalla,</hi> &amp;c. they were ſo loud, that you might hear them afar of, and then they repeated only theſe Words very often; and every time they repeated them, they turned their Head from one ſide to the other, as if they looked upon one another by turns, to ſhew their great Love one to another, ſo they repeat theſe words very often, and every time quicker and quicker, until they abbreviate them at laſt, and ſay only, <hi>Lahu Huhu.</hi> By this pratling or jabbering and moving of their Heads, they became at length ſo giddy and weary, that the cold Sweat ran down them. But this their Saint did not pronounce the words of their Prayers with the reſt, but ſtruck on his Breaſt with his Fiſt, upon his Heart, which gave inſtead thereof ſo ſtrange a Tune, as if he had been hallow within, much like unto the Noiſe that a Turky-Cock uſes to make when he is very angry, ſo that it would have frighted any Man, chiefly if he had been alone with him; and he would (with his terrible Face) rather have taken him to be an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition than a Man. Theſe above-mentioned Words he repeateth ſo often, and ſo long, until he fainteth away, and falls down, and there he lieth as if he were dead. Then the others cover him, let him lie and go their ways. After he hath lain thus a good while as if he had been raviſhed in his Prayers, or had ſeen a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Viſion, he cometh to himſelf, riſeth and appeareth again. All theſe Saints, although they practiſe their Religion after a peculiar manner, which according to their Opinion, is quite ſurpaſſing that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in their Law, to move the People the ſooner (regarding their ſeverity in living, their great Patience and frequent Ecſtaſies) to believe them, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Piety, may go on in their hoggiſhneſs, uncleanneſs, and robberies (as they do) without any controuling: Yet becauſe their idle Hypocriſie, and great Rogueries do daily appear more plainly, (not without great Damage to the Country) therefore they are no more in ſo great eſteem, nor have ſo much given them as formerly. Concerning their ſtrange way of Praying, (chiefly that of the <hi>Moors</hi>) their own
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48499:84"/>
People have often told me, that becauſe ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votee changed his natural Voice given by him God, into an unnatural one, therefore he ought rather to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Beaſt than a Man, and conſequently much leſs ought to be eſteemed a Divine. Thus much I thought convenient to relate here of their Mendicants that travelled with us, and now I come to my former purpoſe again.</p>
                  <p>After we had ſpent four Days in drying our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandices, and in mending our Ships, we did load them again, and ſo ſet out the next <hi>Friday,</hi> being the 3d. of <hi>September,</hi> about Noon. All that Day we ſaw nothing but Buſhes on both ſides of the River, wherein were ſeveral wild Beaſts, but above all wild Boars, till Night, when we came in ſight of a little Village about two or three Miles diſtant, upon the aſcent, on our left Hand, where we landed and ſtayed all Night. In that place I found nothing but a baſtard Camel's Hay, which was like unto the true one, but without any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it.</p>
                  <p>The next Day our Navigation proceeded very well, and at Noon we came to a ſtrong Cittadel call'd <hi>Galant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> which is ſituated at this ſide of the River, on a Hill belonging to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> with whom the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Emperor (as I was informed, and could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that did not know their Language well) had long and heavy Wars; and could have done him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not follow him through the Deſarts for want of Water and Proviſions) no great hurt, if the King's Eldeſt Son had not put himſelf into this Caſtle, believing that he might be ſecure there from any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault from without, wherein he was mightily miſtaken. For after the <hi>Sultan</hi> did underſtand that he was there, he was reſolved to take it notwithſtanding all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And therefore he ſummoned all his Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Year 1570. and did Aſſault it in three Places at the ſame time, ſo long and ſo often, until at length he took it by Storm, and ſo he made the King's Son his Priſoner, and carried him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he had (as they ſay) his Head cut off the following Year. This Caſtle (being ſurrounded with ſtrong Walls,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48499:85"/>
and having within a very high and large Tower) is ſtill, according to my Apprehenſion, very ſtrong, but yet it lieth in ruins, and the three open places remain unrepaired. At Night we landed in a ſmall Iſland, which was not inhabited, and in the middle of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we did not queſtion but we were there very well ſecured from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as ſoon as we had ſupp'd and began to go to reſt, ſome of them came creeping along to us, about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, rather to viſit our Goods than us. But becauſe they durſt not venture to go to our Ships, without great danger of being diſcovered by our Watch, they did viſit them that reſted on ſhoar, and had taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable from them, if they had not been diſcovered immediately by them, and had retaken from them again, that which they could not ſo readily carry over the River.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Day of <hi>September,</hi> ſome <hi>Arabians</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſhoar early in the Morning; by and by we ſaw more at a great Diſtance upon the height, and ſome Squadrons of Horſe of Forty or Fifty ſtrong, ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, from whence we concluded that the King's Camp was not far off, which proved to be true. For about Noon, after we landed, the King's Youngeſt Son came riding to us, on a high black Horſe, with a Retinue of about Hundred Men, moſt of which had Bows, and long Pikes made of Reed. He was but young, about Twenty Four or Twenty Five Years old, of a brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Colour, and had a white Turbant on his Head made of Cotton, one end whereof hung down behind about a Span long, according to their uſual Cuſtom. He had on a long Gown made of ordinary Sheeps Skins with the Wooll on them, which hung down to his Ankles, and ſo had all his Courtiers, which were in their common Dreſs ſo like unto one another, that one could not have diſcerned them, if his had not been edged with ſome Gold Liſts (as we uſe to edge Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Coats in our Country) about the Neck and Sleeves, and had not had long Sleeves, whereon were ſome Eſcutcheons to be ſeen. Becauſe Cuſtom is due to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48499:85"/>
therefore this Young Prince came to demand and take it; ſo he went into the River, and rode firſt to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ship, to ſee what Goods they carried, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Corn therein he did not ſtay long there, but came to ours, his Servants that were on purpoſe ordered for that, helped him ſoon up into it, and placed him in the middle of it on a Bale, but they themſelves went about from one Merchant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to viſit their Goods, and did open now and then a Cheſt or a Bale, and took ſome out of them more or leſs, according as they liked them, ſo that it was a great while before they came about from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to Merchant. In the mean while, they brought alſo into the Ship a Young Prince, perhaps two Years old, which one carried before him on Horſe-back after his Father. He had nothing on but only a Cotton Shirt, and Rings about his Neck, Wriſts and Legs, made of fine <hi>Arabian</hi> Gold. At length his Servants came to me and my Comrades into the Poop of the Ship; but before we began to ſhew them any of our Goods, they ſaw my Gun that was in-laid with Ivory, which they took immediately, to ſhew it to their Maſter, with a great deal of Admiration, being ſuch a one as they had never ſeen in their Life before. The King took it preſently into his Hands, and was mighty well pleaſed with it, and ſaid that it was Outlandiſh-Work made by the <hi>Franks</hi> (by which Name they call Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh-Men, <hi>French, German, Italian,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they know no Diviſions or Diſtinctions of our Country) ſo we went both to him, and acquainted him that we were lately come from thoſe Countries, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to go into the <hi>Indies.</hi> After the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this, he ſpoke very kindly to us, and bid his Man to leave off and to ſearch no more our Goods, and enquired after ſeveral other things, and at length he told my Comrade that he thought he had ſeen him before: Which was very true; for when my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade lived at <hi>Halepo,</hi> where he had drove the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's</hi> Trade for a great while, he and others were ſent to the King (who was then at a little diſtance from <hi>Halepo</hi>) by the Conſul of <hi>Venice,</hi> to preſent him in his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48499:86"/>
Name, with ſeveral Preſents (whereof ſome were coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rich wrought Cloths) when they came to him, and preſented them to him, he took them with a great deal of Kindneſs, and treated them very honourably, and ſhewed them ſeveral ſorts of Sport, as Jumping, Running, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they might ſee that he had a great many brave and handy Souldiers; and did diſpatch them very generouſly again, and promiſed them (as my Friend told me) all Kindneſſes, chiefly to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſaying, That if they ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of him againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> he would faithfully aſſiſt them, and that he did not doubt at all, if they ſhould agree together, but they might go a great way with him in theſe Countries; nay, advance further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turk</hi> in a ſhort time, even to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf. After the before-mentioned Diſcourſe, the King went to his Tents, that were pitched on a Plain by a Hill, within two Miles of us, and took ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany along with him, to diſcourſe his Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Concerns. I would willingly have preſented the King with my Gun (altho' we had to travel through many Deſarts) and perhaps he would have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it, but durſt not do it before the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldiers, Mendicants and Jews, for I feared, that they would betray it, and accuſe me before the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and <hi>Cadi's,</hi> which ſoon would have made me pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, altho' innocent, as they uſe to do to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; nay, ſometimes thoſe of their own Nation; and beſides, I did remember, that when the King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near <hi>Halepo,</hi> and ſome of his Men did daily come into the Town, to buy Proviſion, Cloaths and other Things, that then it was ſtrictly forbidden to Sell them any Arms, Bows or Pikes, to take along with them into the Deſarts. After we had ſtaid for our Friends a great while, they came ſo late to us, that we were hindred from going any farther that Day, for it began to be late, and ſo we ſtay'd there all Night. They told us, that the King, after they had told him that we came from <hi>Halepo,</hi> would not believe them, but thought rather we came from <hi>Saphet</hi> (which Town is within a Day's Journey of <hi>Sidon,</hi> which the <hi>Sultan</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48499:86"/>
had taken from him a little while before) that he might have a Pretence to arreſt us and our Goods; and that he did ſo obſtinately perſiſt in this Opinion, that they did really fear, he would have ſent ſome of his Men with one of us to <hi>Halepo,</hi> to know the certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, until they plainly demonſtrated to him by their Letters from whence they came; whereupon he gave them Liberty to go on in their Journey. But I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood afterwards, that it was only to preſs ſomething more out of them, as he really did, for they were forced to give him ſome Knives tip'd with Silver that came from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and alſo ſome Damasks.</p>
                  <p>On the Sixth of <hi>September,</hi> we were up early, and paſſed between great Wilderneſſes, wherein were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Wild Boars, that appeared ſometimes in great Herds: Theſe Wilderneſſes continued ſo long, that we ſaw nothing elſe the whole Day but Woods, till in the Evening we came to <hi>Cala,</hi> a Village and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on this ſide of the River, which is no more but two Days Journey from <hi>Halepo,</hi> ſituated in a Plain; from whence you may conjecture how crooked the River is hitherto. This Caſtle belongeth to a great <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> called <hi>John Rolandt,</hi> and alſo the fine Houſe at <hi>Halepo,</hi> as is before mentioned. He hath very great Revenues and Sixty Sons: Six or Seven of them are <hi>Sangiacks,</hi> whereof ſome live at the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Court. Beyond this Caſtle on the other ſide of the River, we lodged all Night in the Wilderneſs, which continued ſo far, that we ſaw nothing all the next Day long, but only here and there a little Cottage of the <hi>Moors,</hi> which generally are built upon Four Sticks, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Buſhes: Within them there are ſo many Children, that I have often admired at the Number of them. They run in their firſt Infancy to the River, and learn to ſwim ſo well, that they undertake without any fear to ſwim over the broad River. When we went by, the <hi>Moors</hi> ſaluted us very often, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance did not hinder them, and that chiefly to learn of us where about their King was in the Country. For they have ſo great a Reſpect for their King (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are an Idle and Vagabond People) and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48499:87"/>
ſhew him ſuch Obedience, as no other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth to their Superiours; which alſo you may gueſs by this, that if any Outlandiſh Man hath a mind to get ſafely through the Wilderneſs, or to ſee their King, let him but cloath himſelf in their Habit, and take a <hi>Moor</hi> along with him, to ſhew him the way, and to be his Interpreter, they will readily tell him the way to go to him; or when they ſee that he hath one of their own Nation with him, they let him paſs without any Moleſtation or Examination. So that thoſe that are Slaves on the Confines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> might eaſily free themſelves without any trouble or danger. Their Wives did alſo often come to us, and brought us Milk in great flat Diſhes, which they ſhewed us at a diſtance to ſell; wherefore we did land ſometimes, and received it, and gave them Biskets for it, for they have great want of Corn, ſo that this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing pleaſed us both. We uſed to break Biskets into this Milk, and ſo to eat it for Dinner or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſometimes if it was too thick (or rather too little of it, that it might go the farther) we uſed to temper or mix it with Water. They have alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put it into oblong Linen-Sacks, which it did hardly penetrate, and let it hang in the Ship for two or three Days, until it did curdle, and came to be in Curds, and ſo it uſed to ſerve us with Biskets and Onions for Breakfaſt or for Supper. When we did land and had time to ſpare, I uſed to look about me for ſome ſtrange Plants, and among the reſt, I found a peculiar <hi>Schoenanthum,</hi> which was very like in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure unto the true one, but had not its Virtues, and the firſt kind of <hi>Rhannus</hi> of <hi>Carolus Cluſius,</hi> with fat Leaves like unto Houſleeke. I found alſo Goats Rue, and a ſtrange ſort of Willows, which ſtill are called by the Inhabitants by their old Name <hi>Garb.</hi> There alſo were abundance of Tamarisks; they were as big and high as our Cherry or Plum Trees, wherefore theſe Trees are diſcerned ſoon at a diſtance by their height; they have very tender Leaves, and long purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured tops, as you ſee in the ſecond kind of our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marisks, ſo that between them and ours, there is no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48499:87"/>
great Matter of Difference, but only in Bigneſs, and Fruit, whereof I found none at that time. The <hi>Moors</hi> feed their Cattle, for the moſt part, with thoſe Buſhes that grow at the River ſide, for in the Wilderneſs and Deſarts (where the Ground is very ſandy, lean and barren) there is but little Graſs or tilled Ground, which occaſioneth the great Scarcity of Bread among them, ſo that often they ſee none in a great while, and are forced to eat their other food, as Fiſh, Fleſh, Cheeſe and Milk (which they take from Goats, Sheep, Camels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without Bread; ſo that theſe poor People make a ſhift with a mean Diet, and yet they are ſtrong and in good Health, and live to a good Age. At Night before it was dark, I ſaw another Fortification, at the other ſide in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> on a high Hill called <hi>Jabar,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which is very large, and hath ſeveral Towers in the Wall, ſo that as far as I could ſee, it was very like to that of <hi>Halepo.</hi> We ſtay'd all Night on this ſide of it, in an Iſland, where we had been robb'd again, If we had not kept a good Watch, ſo as to perceive the Thieves, and to let off ſeveral Guns: Yet this we did not to hurt, but only to frighten them; for if we ſhould have kill'd or wounded any of them, they would have fetch'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, ſome (according as they are in ſtrength) it may be, Thouſand together, to revenge their Friend, to fall upon us, to beat us, and to plunder us (whereof they are very eager) and to take all we had. The ſame happened to us the next Day in another uninhabited Iſland of the River, where we would dreſs no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals that Night, that they might not ſpy us by our Fire, to find us out and to fall upon us. For when we expected to keep our ſelves thus quiet, and to reſt in good Tranquility, they did not miſs us, but came to us in a greater Body than before, and that ſo near, that we could not only hear them, but they began to talk with us. But when we ſaw that they were in earneſt, we rouzed up our ſelves, and got into Order, and ſpoke big to them, and bid them to offer no Violence to us, for if they did, they would find greater Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than they expected. But when we ſaw that this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48499:88"/>
our Exhortation would do no good, we were forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to have recourſe to our Guns, whereof we had but three, which we let go off, which frightened them in ſuch a manner (for they are not uſed to them) that they ran away, and left us in quietneſs. But it is no wonder that the <hi>Arabians</hi> are ſo reſtleſs, for they are full of Want and Nakedneſs, have not to fill their Belly, nor to cover their Body withal; beſides; they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, and are uſed to idleneſs from their very Infancy, and then becauſe they hate to Work, they are forced to wander like Vagabonds from one place to another. And (if they will maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs) to ſeek their livelihood from thoſe that travel through their Country. So ſeveral times there came two, three, or four together, ſwimming through the River, were it never ſo broad or deep, to our Ship, whereof ſome were black, and ſome brown, which came as naked into our Ship as ever they were born into the World, to beg a piece of Bread; to each of them we gave as much as would content them, ſo they went ſometimes for a whole League along with us; and when they had eaten the Bread, and thanked us, they jumped into the River again and ſwam away. Beſides theſe we ſaw daily as we went along many more, ſwim over the River, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly had ſome Bucks Skins blown up, whereon they tried to get over the eaſier (for the River is ſo broad, that it is not eaſy to make a Bridge over it, neither did I find any.) They take their Shirts (for beſides them they wear no other Cloaths) tie them with their leathern Girdles about their Heads, and therein ſtick their Daggers (which are pretty broad and bended like unto a Scythe) which hang down by their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>The Ninth Day our Voyage went on again chearily, and we came pretty near to the Town <hi>Racka,</hi> (which belongeth to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour) but it did not continue ſo long, for before we had Dined and eaten a few Fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Cibels, Anguries and <hi>Indian</hi> Musk-Melons, to refreſh our ſelves in the great Heat, we incurred greater Danger again than that we were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48499:88"/>
for our Ship (which was a great deal bigger than either of the other two) did ſtrike upon the Sand ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, that we could not bring her off again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of others, (as we had done ſeveral times before) nor bring her into the right way again. So we were forced to deſire the <hi>Arabians</hi> our Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, which ſtood and looked upon us, rather rejoicing in our Misfortunes, than pitying us, to aſſiſt us, which at length we did obtain, and ſo they came to help us: But becauſe they had their Daggers, and great Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which they uſe to wear with them, we durſt not truſt them, but were forced to leave a ſmall Guard in the Ship, but the reſt of us helped them with all our Force and Strength, but we could not ſtir her, ſo that they went away twice and left us. At laſt we concluded, that we had no better way, than to unload our Ships, yet we durſt not do it for fear of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> nor venture our Merchandices; ſo we reſolved to draw her out another way, wherefore we deſired the <hi>Arabians</hi> a third time, to aſſiſt us, and if they were in earneſt to help us, we begged of them to lay down their Arms, which at length, upon our promiſing them a good Reward, they did. When they came we took alſo our Guard to our Aſſiſtance, ſet all hands at work, and with hard Labour we brought it at length into the right Stream again, ſo we paid the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and went on, and came that ſame Night to <hi>Racka.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RAcka,</hi> a Town of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> is ſituated in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> upon the great River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> between two aſcents, ſo that you cannot ſee any thing of it before you come near it. There is a Caſtle by it, which is given to a <hi>Sangiack</hi> by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to keep it with 1200 <hi>Spahi's.</hi> This Town is pitifully Built, and not well Guarded with Walls, it having been built after the Deſolation of the Old Town, which was ſituated on the Height, as one may ſee ſtill by the Old Wall, and other Arches and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Among the reſt there is yet ſtanding a very ancient high Building, which is ſtill very ſtrong, and looketh very great (although it is much decayed and run to ruin) and ſuch as one ſhall rarely ſee, ſo that one may conjecture, that it hath perhaps been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Seat and Habitation of their Kings or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. Between the New and Old City lieth a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which is alſo Old and pretty ſtrong, where is kept a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon, it being on the Confines or Limits of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp;c. to defend them and all the Country from Danger and Incurſions. The Old Town is beſides this quite demoliſhed, and even with the Ground, ſo that here is no convenient place where the <hi>Turks</hi> can exerciſe themſelves in Running, Cudgel-playing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this, where I have often ſate upon the ruined Walls and looked upon them when they were a Playing. To the Deſolation of this Town, have very much contributed the <hi>Tartars,</hi> under their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48499:89"/>
King <hi>Haalono,</hi> who took it in the Year of our Lord, 1260, and not long after the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Halepo,</hi> with the help of <hi>Ayton</hi> King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> Some will have this to be the Town of <hi>Rhages,</hi> which is alſo called <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> whither the Ancient and Pious <hi>Tobias,</hi> did ſend his Son from <hi>Nineve,</hi> to his Friend <hi>Gabel,</hi> to fetch the Money from him which he had lent him: But becauſe this lies a Day's Journey further from the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> therefore it cannot be the ſame.</p>
                  <p>After we had landed there, the Receiver of the Cuſtom came on Horſe-back to the ſhoar, and deſired the Maſter of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ship, to deliver his Arms, Lances and Bows, who abſolutely denied it, ſeeing that it never had been a Cuſtom before; whereupon they fell about this into ſuch a hot Diſpute, that they began to draw upon one another, and had not we time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in between them, it would have cauſed a great Tumult. The reaſon why this Man behaved himſelf ſo ſtrangely, was becauſe we did not go with our Goods to <hi>Carahemit</hi> (which Town is diſtant four Days Journey, and ſituated on the rapid River <hi>Tigris</hi>) to have laid there upon that River, where he would have received a great deal more Cuſtom, that alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him. But the <hi>Turk</hi> not mattering him, having nothing in but Corn, which he would not carry, he let him alone, and came to us as Strangers, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make up his Loſs from us, and to frighten us out of it. He ſtaid all Night in the Ship, and lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us (fearing that we ſhould hide ſome Goods from him;) and ſometimes he came upon us with big Words, ſaying, <hi>Seeing that it was not allowed to us Out-landiſh Men to travel in theſe Parts, therefore he could not but take us to be Spies, that came to diſcover, rather than for any thing elſe, wherefore he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to take our Goods in Arreſt, and to ſend us two as Spies to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>to make us Slaves to his Maſter, the Great</hi> Sultan. After we had heard this his unreaſonable Diſcourſe, and were alſo ſenſible of his Intention to cheat us, we were not preſently frightned, but drew out our Paſs we had from the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Halepo,</hi> and ſhewed it to him.

He looked it over, and after he underſtood that he durſt not very well act againſt it, he went away from us with a deal of Indignation, and immediately he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to quarrel with all the Merchants of the two Ships, and deſired of them an unreaſonable Sum to pay him as Toll, whereof they complained heavily; but he went on and would accept of no reaſonable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but took away our Rowers from our Ships, to hinder us from going away, to ſqueeze us the more. But the Merchants although they ſaw his earneſtneſs, they did not matter it, but ſent on the 11th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> one of them with a <hi>Moor</hi> to <hi>Carahemit,</hi> to the Great <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> which was the Son of <hi>Mahomet Baſſa,</hi> to complain to him of theſe Impoſitions and Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When the Toll-keeper did underſtand this, he followed them with his Son immediately. But becauſe he did not find the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> (which was then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place called <hi>Giſelet,</hi> whither our Friend was forced to follow him three Days Journey from thence) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again immediately. Although he did not ſpeak with the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> yet he falſly told us, that it was the <hi>Baſhaw</hi>'s Order that we ſhould pay him Ten Ducats <hi>per cent.</hi> Notwithſtanding that, ours did not know any thing, yet they would not truſt him, but had carried the beſt and greateſt Part of their Goods out, before he came into the Ships to ſearch, and alſo ſome thereof they buried in the Sand by Night, where the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> went over by Day Light, and yet they could find none of theſe hidden Goods. The next morning early the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can came with his Crue, and ſearched every thing with a great deal of Care, as if he had a peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it, but did not find any thing near (as you may think) what he expected. When he was thus very buſy in exerciſing his Office, our Friend came in at laſt, and told us, that the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> was very much diſpleaſed, that the Publican did deal ſo unjuſtly with us, contrary to the Orders and Law of his Maſter the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and did keep us ſo long, and hinder us in our Navigation. Wherefore he had writ to the <hi>Sangiack</hi> in our behalf, and ordered him on pain of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48499:90"/>
Death, to take all Care that we might not be detained any longer, but to take the Publican Priſoner, and to ſend him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to have him tried at the Court kept for that purpoſe every 15th. Day, and that he feared very much, that he would pay for this his Miſdemeanour with his Life.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we were thus detained Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners on the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> expecting with a deal of Patience the time of our Deliverance, it happened, that the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> broke up with his Retinue from here-about on the 21ſt. Day of <hi>September,</hi> and travelled towards the South in great Numbers, to find better Paſtures for his Beaſts, as Horſes, Aſſes, and Camels, that they might the better ſubſiſt; for in theſe Places there are not ſo many Villages, Towns and Market-Towns, where they might have their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual abode. Neither do they love Farming nor Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but are contented, if they have a great Stock of Cattle, and good ſtore of Graſs for them, that they may keep them. So if they come to a Rivolet, where a little Herbage or Graſs groweth, they immediately erect their Tents there, to ſtay there till want forceth them to remove, and to look out for another Place. When they break up, they take along with them Man, Maid, Beaſts and all their whole Subſtance, as I did ſee them remove at this very time, and come towards this Town in great Numbers, ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> kept their Gates ſhut up for four Days, until they were all paſs'd by. On Horſe-back they are armed with Darts and Bows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo if they ride on Camels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have a very great Number, chiefly when the King is moving from one place to another, as ſome of them did relate to me, where generally are imployed 150000. I my own ſelf have once ſeen at one time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about the number of 3 or 4000 Camels. They are ſtrong and hardy Creatures, fit to carry heavy Burthens, and alſo to ſubſiſt without Drinking in the greateſt Heats for Three Days together. They ſtale out between their hind Legs, ſo that thoſe that go in Caravans behind them muſt have a great Care, that they be not hit by them, and ſo become all bedaubed.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48499:91"/>
Their Horſes are very Noble, Neat, and fit for buſineſs; they ſeldom feed them more than once a Day, altho' they ride them very hard all Day long through the Wilderneſſes. They commonly cut off all the Hair from their Mains and Tail, ſo that their Tails remain very naked, and look ſomething like the Tail of a Lion. They put their Wives on little Aſſes, and alſo upon high Camels with their Children, three or four of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Boxes, as it is the faſhion in theſe Countries. They are of a brown Colour like unto our <hi>Gypſies,</hi> and almoſt the fourth Part of them black, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Colour proceedeth from that in travelling up and down, to places where Blacks are. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leave their own there, and take Blacks in the room of them. The King of <hi>Arabia</hi> is always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the Fields, and never cometh into a place that is ſhut up or encloſed; and this the leſs now, after the Miſchance of loſing his Son that retired into one, happened; ſo he goeth from place to place like unto the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ſo that often it is not known where he is. In the Summer time he goeth further to the North, and in the Winter to the South, to avoid both the Heat and Cold, and to have better Subſiſtance and Proviſion for himſelf, his Men and Cattle. So it hath happened ſeveral times, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> in their march have come too near to the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, and the <hi>Turks</hi> again to his, from whence aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two great Princes ſuch Differences, that they are come to great and bloody Wars. And yet for all this (as I am credibly informed) they have now both made a peculiar League and Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, wherein it is agreed that if the <hi>Grand Turk</hi> ſhould go to a War with his Neighbours, then the <hi>Arabian</hi> King will Aſſiſt and Defend him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> writes to him as his Couſin and good Friend, and is to pay him the ſum of 60000 Ducats yearly as his certain Salary or retaining Fee. And beſides all this, the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſends to the New King of <hi>Arabia</hi> after the Deceaſe of the Old one, a Standard with his Coat of Arms in it, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other Preſents he ſends him, with uſual
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48499:91"/>
Ceremonies, to congratulate him on his happy coming to the Throne, and to renew and confirm their Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Their Religion doth contribute not a ſmall matter to this, which (together with all their Ceremonies, and all other Points) is the ſame almoſt they profeſs in both Nations: And they take as many Wives as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, neither do they extol or magnifie one before the other, becauſe they come from better Parents, being they buy them all from them. And therefore none of them is excuſed, becauſe ſhe cometh from a greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, from doing the Family-buſineſs, nor hath a poor one more put upon her, becauſe ſhe came from mean Extraction. So one of the King of <hi>Arabia</hi>'s Wives is a Daughter of a Man that keepeth a Sawing-Mill at <hi>Racka,</hi> which by him (although of a mean Extraction) is as much reſpected as any of the reſt. Her Father and Brothers are very good People; they came very often to us, and ſhewed great Compaſſion, for that we were ſo abuſed by the Publican. His Milk is not drawn by Horſes as ours are, nor by Water, (for they know nothing of that) but two of them cut the Wood with great hand-labour. During our ſtaying there, a Young <hi>Arabian</hi> Gentleman, nearly related to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> came very often to us to the Water-ſide, who was always accompanied with Twenty Servants with Bows and Darts; he had a delicate white Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant on, and a long Violet, coloured Caban made of Wooll, but his Servants went pretty bare, for ſome of them wore black Caps and long <hi>Indigo</hi> coloured Shirts with wide Sleeves, which they girt up with broad Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Girdles, wherein ſtuck bended Daggers or Bago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, as it is their uſual Cuſtom. It once happened, that ſome of us being upon the High-Town Walls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, from whence we had a pleaſant Proſpect down into the Valley to the great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> this ſame Gentleman came to us again, and ſeated himſelf with his Retinue over againſt us, and preſented us with ſome dried Cicer Peaſe (whereof I have made mention before) and ſome Cibebs mixt together, which we thankfully received; and to ſhew our thankfulneſs, we preſented him again with ſome Almonds, Figs, Nuts,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48499:92"/>
and ſome very good Sweet-meats we had brought with us from <hi>Halepo,</hi> which he alſo received very kindly. So we all began to eat each of us part of his Preſent, and drunk with it ſome Water of the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> After we had eat them all, and we thought the time to be long, he beckon'd to one of his Muſicians, and bid him to divert us with his Inſtrument, which he pulled out preſently (which about the Neck looked very like unto a Cittern) and we expected to hear ſome rarity, but when I looked upon it, and ſaw it had but one String that was as big as a Cord of their Bows, he began to play ſome of their Tunes, but with what Art and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity you may eaſily fanſie. He did this for almoſt two Hours, and according to his Opinion very harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but we thought the time ſo long, that we were very glad when he had done.</p>
                  <p>About the River I found that ſort of <hi>Acacia</hi> that beareth roundiſh and brown-coloured Pods, called <hi>Schock</hi> and <hi>Schamuth</hi> by the <hi>Arabians:</hi> Some Thorns called <hi>Algul,</hi> whereon the <hi>Manna</hi> falleth, chiefly in the County of <hi>Coraſcen,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> tells us. <hi>Chameſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> ſome ſtrange kinds of Moſſes, which are very much differing in bigneſs: Among the reſt I ſaw the low prickly Herb, by ſome eſteemed to be the <hi>Tragun</hi> of <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi> Below, cloſe to the River, I found the <hi>Herba Sacra</hi> of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> which the Learned <hi>Carolus Cluſius</hi> hath accurately deſcribed in his Second <hi>Book</hi> and the 45th. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Out-landiſh Plants; and juſt by theſe, more ſtrange ones, chiefly a delicate one growing plentifully there in the Sand, which had from Five to Eight tender Stalks, which ſpread themſelves into others, that were very full of Joints, ſo that it crept rather on the Ground than grew up; by each of them ſtood three or four roundiſh Marjoram or <hi>Origa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> Leaves together, and above between them ſome Star like white Flowers, with ſix pointed Leaves like unto our <hi>Ornithogalum,</hi> each of them on a peculiar Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalk, the Seeds thereof I have not ſeen, but the Roots are ſmall and fibrous, which together with their ſmall bitterneſs, have a pretty exſiccating quality; and ſo in this reſpect are very like unto the <hi>Polycnemon</hi> of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48499:92"/>
                     <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> but whether it be the ſame or no, I leave the learned to decide. Beſides thoſe before as we came down the River, I ſaw a great many large <hi>Tamarisk</hi> Trees, and abundance of a certain kind of <hi>Agnus Caſtus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like unto the other, only a great deal leſs, and it had no more but three ſtrong claver Leaves; but above all the <hi>Galega,</hi> called <hi>Goats-Rue</hi> in our Language, which in theſe Parts groweth very high, and in ſo great plenty, that on the River ſide I could ſee nothing but this for ſeveral Miles together.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Inhabitants of the Mountains, and the great Wilderneſs we came through to</hi> Deer: <hi>Of their ancient Origination, and miſerable and laborious Livelihood.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>UPon this good and ſevere Command of the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> Son of <hi>Mahomet Baſhaw,</hi> we were acquitted of our long Arreſt, and went away about Noon on the 27th. of <hi>September</hi>; we went again from thence through ſuch great Deſarts, that for ſome Days we ſaw nothing worth relating, but here and there little Huts made of ſome erected Boughs, and covered with ſome Buſhes, wherein the <hi>Moors</hi> with their Families live, to ſecure themſelves from the great Heat, Rain and Dews that are in theſe Parts moſt violent, ſo that I admired how theſe miſerable People could maintain themſelves and ſo many Children in theſe dry and ſandy Places where nothing was to be had. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe poor People are very naked, and ſo hungry that many of them if they ſaw us afar off, would fling themſelves into the great River, and ſwim to us to fetch a piece of Bread. And when we flung at
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48499:93"/>
them whole handfulls, they would ſnap at it juſt like hungry Fiſh or Ducks, and eat it: Others did gather it and put it into the Crown which they make neatly of their Sheets on the top of their Heads, and ſo ſwim away with it. After theſe ſandy Deſarts had continued a great while, we came at length out of them between high, rough and bare Hills, which were ſo barren, that there was to be ſeen neither Plough-Lands nor Meadows, neither Houſe nor Stick, neither High-way nor Foot-path, wherefore thoſe People that live there, have no Houſes, but Caves and Tents, as they have in the great Deſarts, where becauſe of the great Heat and Drineſs, the Soil is ſo barren, that they cannot ſubſiſt in a place for any conſiderable time, nor have Villages or certain Habitations: Wherefore they wander up and down, fall upon the Caravans and plunder them, and make what ſhift they can to get a livelihood. Theſe Mountains, as I am informed, reach to the River <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> the <hi>Dead</hi> and the <hi>Red-Seas,</hi> &amp;c. wherein are ſituated Mount <hi>Sinai, Horeb,</hi> &amp;c. and the Town <hi>Petra,</hi> which by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is called <hi>Petra</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> that live in theſe Deſarts, and round about them, are extraordinary Marks-men for Bows and Arrows, and to fling Darts which are made of Canes: They are a very numerous People, and go out in great Parties every where almoſt: they are a very ancient Nation, and come from the Sons of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but chiefly from his Eldeſt Son <hi>Nebajoth,</hi> and were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called the War-like <hi>Nabathees,</hi> and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Land or Province of the <hi>Nabathees,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth in <hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. where he ſays, that the Twelve Sons of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> which he had by an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Wife, (his Mother <hi>Agar,</hi> from whom they were called <hi>Agarens,</hi> as you may ſee in the firſt of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and the ſixth Verſe, being alſo of the ſame Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) were poſſeſſed of all the Country between the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the <hi>Red-Seas,</hi> and called it the Province of the <hi>Nabathees.</hi> The <hi>Midianites</hi> that bought <hi>Joſeph</hi> of his Brethren, and carried him into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> may alſo be reckoned among theſe. This ſame Country is alſo chiefly by <hi>Pliny</hi> (becauſe thereabout
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48499:93"/>
are no other Habitations, but Tents, wherein the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants live) called <hi>Scenitis.</hi> From this we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his 60th. Chapter, and <hi>David</hi> in his 120th. <hi>Pſalm</hi> did ſpeak of them, when chiefly the latter maketh mention of the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> whereby he underſtands a Country that is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by ſuch a Nation as liveth in Tents, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Kedar</hi> the Son of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> whom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> as a ſtrange Child, born by his Maid <hi>Agar,</hi> did thruſt out together with his Mother into the Deſarts; his words are theſe, <hi>Wo is me, that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſheck, <hi>that I dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar. In our times theſe and other Nations are called the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> which have very much encreaſed under <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> (which by his Mother was an <hi>Iſhmaelite</hi>) and did ſpread very much; and ſo they were in <hi>David</hi>'s time a very ſtrong Nation, wherefore he prayeth very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in his 83 <hi>Pſalm</hi>) that God would puniſh and ſlay and diſperſe them, as Enemies of his Holy Church. But that I may come to our former Intention again, here the <hi>Arabians</hi> asked us very often again, where their King was at that time, ſo that our Maſter had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs enough to anſwer them; whereby you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what great Reſpect and Love they have for their King. But that they might not altogether look upon us as Outlandiſh Men, nor preſently diſcern us to be Strangers, we did ſometimes when there was occaſion for it, change our Turbants, and let one end thereof according to their Faſhion hang down, which they do to make themſelves a Shade againſt the Heat, that is very cruel in theſe Countries. But yet if any body, be he who he will, doth enquire after their King, and wants to come before him, to preſent him with a Suit of Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to deſire a Paſs from him, or if one ſhould go about to hire one of them, to ſhew him the way to a certain place, or through their Country, (which he may do for a very ſmall price,) he would ſoon find one or other that would be ready to do it; but among the <hi>Turks</hi> there is no ſuch Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for if you ſhould deſire any thing of them to do, in the Name of their <hi>Sultan,</hi> they are not willing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48499:94"/>
to do it, except it would redound to their great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Wherefore a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Guide to conduct you would coſt you a great deal more than one of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they alſo remember their Maſter daily, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak of any thing but of him, his great riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with ſuch Pride and Greatneſs, chiefly when they ſpeak of his powerfulneſs, and enlarging of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as if ſome ſhare of theſe were belonging to them, and that they muſt be reſpected for it. In this Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation through the great Deſarts, we two did not ſpend much, becauſe the Towns were at ſo great a diſtance from one another that we could not reach them, to provide our ſelves daily with Neceſſaries (as we do in our Country on the <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Rhine</hi>) or Lodgings. We were neceſſitated to be contented with ſome ſlight Food or other, and make a ſhift with Curds, Cheeſe, Fruits, Honey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to take any of theſe with ſome Bread for a good Entertainment. The Honey in theſe Parts is very good, and of a whitiſh colour, whereof they take in their Caravans and Navigations, great Leathern Bottles-full along with them; this they bring you in ſmall Cups, and put a little Butter to it, and ſo you eat it with Biskets. By this Diſh I often remembred St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> the fore-runner of our Lord, how he alſo did eat Honey in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, together with other Food. Beſides this when we had a mind to Feaſt our ſelves, ſome ran, as ſoon as our Maſter had landed at Night, to fetch ſome Wood, and others in the mean time made a hole in the Ground on the Shoar, in the nature of a Furnace, to boil our Meat. So every Company dreſſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly what they had a mind to, or what they had laid up in Store; ſome boil'd Rice, others ground Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when they had a mind to eat New Bread inſtead, or for want of Biskets, they made a paſte of Flower and Water, and wrought it into broad Cakes about the thickneſs of a Finger, and put them in a hot place on the ground, heated on purpoſe by Fire, and covered it with Aſhes and Coals, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſeveral times until it was enough. Theſe Cakes were very ſavory and good to eat. Some of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48499:94"/>
                     <hi>Arabians</hi> have in their Tents, Stones or Copper-Plates made on purpoſe to bake them. On the 4th. Day, being the laſt of <hi>September,</hi> about Noon, we came to the end of the Mountains, before which without, on this ſide, lieth a very ſtrong Citadel, on a high Hill, built three ſquare, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Seleby,</hi> whereof two Points go downwards towards the River, and the third upward a great way on the Mountain, ſo that in its ſituation it is very like unto <hi>Baden</hi> in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Although it is demoliſhed, yet it is ſtill very ſtrong in its Walls, that are to be ſeen at the top and on the ſides, chiefly towards the Hills, and the River ſide, to hinder the Paſſage both by Water and Land. There are alſo ſtill ſtanding ſome Watch-houſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as you come towards it near the Mountains, which may hold three or four Souldiers: yet it lieth ſtill to this Day in ruins, and ſo deſolated, that nothing but Birds and Beaſts inhabit it; whereof a great many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the Rivers ſide, as <hi>Herns, Ducks,</hi> that were very large and of a delicate Colour, and others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were ſome of a white Colour, called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Onocrotali</hi> by others, which are as big as <hi>Swans</hi>; the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> maketh alſo mention of them in his ſecond Chapter, when he prognoſticated the puniſhment that was to come to the <hi>Ninevites, Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi>; there alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſome quite black, with long Necks; whereof I did ſee abundance in my Travels into the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and eſpecially near <hi>Acon,</hi> among the Rocks and Crags of the Sea; as far as I could diſcern them at a diſtance, they ſeemed to be a kind of a <note n="*" rend="inter">I gueſs them rather to have been <hi>Cormorants</hi>; no <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> having long Necks.</note> 
                     <hi>Sea-Eagle,</hi> that feed more upon Fiſh than any thing elſe. Six Miles lower, and at the other ſide of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> lieth ſtill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortification which is called <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Seleby,</hi> that is lower <hi>Seleby,</hi> on a very high Bank, and ſeeing that we ſailed very near it, I could not well diſcover it. Of theſe two which way they were beſieged and taken; and alſo of the way of Government, or ruling of the Kings of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48499:95"/>
&amp;c. I ſhould have been very glad to have been a little better informed, but the Language wherewith I was not well acquainted, did hinder me. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhould have underſtood it very well, or enough to have made an enquiry after thoſe Particulars, yet I could not have done it without great Danger, to have been taken for a Spy; for they ſoon ſuſpect Outlandiſh Men on every little occaſion, which thoſe that Trade in theſe Parts have often experienced not without great Loſs and Danger. Beyond the Mountains in the low Country we ſaw more tilled Grounds, and Habitations of the <hi>Arabians</hi> than we had done before, wherefore our Maſter landed ſooner than he uſed to do, near a Village, to take in Proviſion for our further Journey, where the People brought Fleſh and <hi>Indian Melons</hi> to us to ſell. Here it happened, that about Midnight, one of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldiers went out to eaſe himſelf to the River ſide; and when he was buſy about it, a <hi>Moor</hi> came creeping along to him, and thruſt him into the River before he was aware of it, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The <hi>Turk</hi> finding himſelf in the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> fell a crying out for help; I hearing him, ſtanding Sentinel that Night, did not fail him, but made what haſte I could, with my Scymeter in my Hand, followed his Voice, and came to the place, although it was very dark, drew him out, and brought him into the Ship, which was ſo kindly taken by the reſt of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that I got mightily into their Favour, and received many Kindneſſes of them all the way until we came to <hi>Bagdet,</hi> the Garriſon which they went to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>October</hi> when our Voyage went on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there came early in the Morning a Poſt of ſix <hi>Arabians</hi> on Horſe back to the River ſide, to enquire of us whither their King was gone, or where we thought they might find him, they had received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for him from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> wherefore they muſt follow him until they found him. The Maſter of our Ship told 'em (and ſo he did to every body that asked him) that we had ſeen him in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> which Province he called <hi>Amanachar,</hi> that he was broken up with his Men to

go back into <hi>Arabia,</hi> where they would find him. After this relation they departed, and we went on our way, and ſoon ſaw below a Town to our right at a diſtance, called <hi>Seccard,</hi> very well ſituated on an aſcent, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> wherefore ſome of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſaid, that none but <hi>Haramiquiber,</hi> that is great Thieves lived in it, which they do out of ſpite to all them, that are ſubject to any other Maſter, than their <hi>Sultan.</hi> This Town we paſſed by, and went directly towards <hi>Deer</hi> another Town, whence we were then three Leagues diſtant, yet they do not accompt their diſtances by Leagues, for they know little or nothing of it, but rather reckon by Days Journeys, for their Towns are ſo ſituated, at ſuch a diſtance, that they have ſometimes to go through divers Wilderneſſes, ſeveral Days, more or leſs, before they arrive there. Before we came thither, one of the Ships in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany did go too much toward one ſide, toward a Branch of the River, that runs by the Town, (for it divideth it ſelf into ſeveral Branches) where it got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mud and ſtuck. Our Maſter ſeeing this, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately, and did ſend his Men to help them. So I got time to look after the ſtrange Plants, and found there about the River many great <hi>Tamarisk</hi>-Trees, and alſo a peculiar ſort of <hi>Willow,</hi> which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſtill call by its ancient <hi>Arabian</hi> Name <hi>Garb.</hi> Theſe Trees do not grow high, but ſpread very much; the Twigs thereof are ſtronger and not ſo tough, as to make Bands or Withs as ours will; the Bark is of a pale yellow Colour, and ſo are the Leaves, which are long and about two Fingers broad, and at the edges round about crenated, ſo that they are very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the reſt of this kind. I found them to be of a pretty drying and aſtringent quality. Of their Flowers and Fruit (whereof <hi>Avicen</hi> maketh mention in his 126 and 686 <hi>Chap.</hi>) I can ſay nothing, becauſe I ſaw none. Hereabout the <hi>Turk</hi> (that would not ſtay until we were cleared, but went away before us) did ſuffer Shipwrack, and ſo loſt a great deal of his Corn, that he intended to carry to <hi>Bagdet</hi> (called <hi>Baldac</hi>) to ſell it in the great Scarcity, which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48499:96"/>
for want of Rain, for there fell none in the ſpace of two Years and a half. And yet, as they ſay, if it raineth but twice or thrice a Year, they have enough to ſupply themſelves. After our Men had wrought longer than an hour together with theirs, until they had emptied the Ships, they came to us again to go that Night to <hi>Deer.</hi> But there being ſeveral Rocks before it, which were very dangerous to paſs, ſome of their Pilots, that underſtood the depths, came out to meet and did help us, ſo that we got ſafe there. The Town of <hi>Deer,</hi> which is not very big, and belongs to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> is ſituated on this ſide of the River, on an aſcent, and is pretty well built with Houſes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtood great Numbers of People when we went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to ſee us) but as for the Walls and Ditches, they are but very ſlight. At our firſt arrival, we thought we ſhould ſoon get clear for the Cuſtom with the <hi>Armin,</hi> and ſo Ship off again, but he was not in Town, ſo that we were forced to ſtay three Days for his coming. In the mean time we got acquaintance with the Inhabitants, which were handſome, luſty and well-ſet, and white, and more mannerly than the reſt; they viſited us frequently, and ſpoke kindly to us, ſo that we found a vaſt Difference between thoſe and the former. The <hi>Armin</hi> alſo (who was no leſs civil) we preſented at his return, with a great diſh fill'd up with <hi>Cibebs,</hi> and ſeveral ſorts of Confectures, and laid round about with Soap balls (as is the Faſhion in theſe Countries) but to them that were with him and of his Family, we gave ſome Sheets of white Paper, which they willingly received, and were ſo well pleaſed with it, that ſome of them (as the Children do in our Country when we give them ſomething that is ſtrange or pleaſing to them) ſmiled at it as often as they looked on it. The Country there about is pretty fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and plentiful of Corn, <hi>Indian</hi> Millet, Cotton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they have alſo between the Rivers very good Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens for the Kitchin, with all ſorts of Plants and Fruits in them, viz. <hi>Colliflowers, Citruls, Pumpions, Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Anguriens,</hi> or Water-Melons, which they call <hi>Bathiecae,</hi> whereof they have ſo many, that you may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48499:96"/>
buy forty great ones for one <hi>Aſper</hi> (whereof three make a <hi>Medin</hi>) much about the value of our Penny. There were alſo ſome Date Trees, Limon and Citron, and other Trees, which I could not diſtinguiſh at a diſtance.</p>

                        <hi>Of our Voyage to the Famous Town</hi> Ana, <hi>in which we paſſed again through great ſandy Wilderneſſes; for the performance whereof we muſt provide our ſelves with Victuals, and be very careful in our Navigation: Some relation of the Inhabitants, of their Cloaths, and other things we did obſerve and ſee by the way, and what elſe did happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter we had paid the Cuſtom to the <hi>Armin</hi> (who was a great deal more civil than he at <hi>Racka</hi>) and provided our ſelves with all Neceſſaries, we did but half load our Ships, to draw them out of the branch again, into the River, and then we carried the reſt to them by Boats and ſmall Ships, for the Water was very low and full of Mud, ſo that we went from thence on the 4th. Day of <hi>October</hi> in the Evening, and ſo ſtaid all Night, a little below <hi>Deer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning our Navigation proceeded very well till Noon, when we came to a very broad and ſhallow place of the River, that our Maſter did not know which way to get through. When he was thus troubled and conſidering, there appeared on the Height, on the Shoar, ſome <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ſhewed us the Courſe we muſt take, but we durſt not truſt them, for we had
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48499:97"/>
heard before, that they had ſunk ſome great Stones there, and that a Month before they had perſwaded a Ship to go that way, which did not diſcover their Cheat, until their Ship after ſeveral hard knocks did ſplit in pieces and ſink. The ſame they would have ſerved others, which, although they did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Counſel, yet they came into ſuch Danger, that they could not deliver themſelves out of it in a whole Days-time. We (Thanks be to God) got ſooner through than in an Hour, after we had drawn our Ship a little back into the deep Stream, to the great Admiration of the <hi>Arabians</hi>: But the other, in our Company, did not ſtick much longer, yet we had more to do to get her off, becauſe ſhe was ſhorter, with a hollow Bottom, wherefore ſhe was ſooner turned, but could not be got out ſo well as ours which was flat-bottom'd. In the Evening very early we ſaw at a great diſtance on the other ſide in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> a Caſtle in the Plain, called <hi>Sere,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> (as they ſay) have many Years ago demoliſhed, which the River <hi>Chabu,</hi> which is pretty large, runs by, which beginneth not much above the Caſtle (which one may gueſs by its Freſh-Water like unto Fountain-Water) and runs a little way below into the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> From thence we thought to have reached <hi>Errachaby,</hi> a Town belonging to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> but being hindred in our Navigation, as is above-mentioned, we landed a little above this before the Night befell us, and went the next Morning early to the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Town, which was pretty large, and lay about half a League from the River in a very fruitful Country, where we ſtayed until the next Day, to ſell ſome Goods there. Wherefore two of ours went into the Town to call out ſome of their Merchants to trade with them.</p>
                  <p>After they had ſpent that whole Day with them, we went off the next Morning early toward <hi>Schara,</hi> a little Village which lieth on the Right-Hand half a League diſtant from the River, belonging to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where we landed to pay the uſual Cuſtom. All about the Sides and the River I ſaw a great many Buſhes and Trees. I would fain have been at them
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48499:97"/>
to diſcern what they were, that I might have viewed them exactly, but I was forced to ſtay in the Ship and ſo I miſſed them. From <hi>Schara</hi> our Navigation went on for ſeveral Days very well, but chiefly through ſandy Deſarts which were as large as any we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſed; for they extended ſometimes ſo far, that we could not ſee the end of them; and they were ſo dry, that you could ſee neither Plough-land nor Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Tree nor Buſh, Leaf nor Graſs, nor Path to go in; wherefore theſe may very well be called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, which are alſo called the ſandy Seas. Firſt you muſt expect there great Storms, as well as in the Seas, which cauſe Waves in the Sand as well as at Sea; then thoſe that go in great Caravans through them, muſt have their Leader or Pilot (by them called <hi>Caliphi</hi>) as well as thoſe at Sea, which knows how to direct their way by the Compaſs, as Pilots do on Ship-board. Then they provide themſelves (becauſe the way is very long through them) with Victuals for a long time, as well as thoſe that go by Sea, wherefore they load generally the third Part of their Camels with Proviſions, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Water, to refreſh themſelves, and their Beaſts, in the great heat of the Sun, for throughout all the Deſarts there is never a Spring to be found, except one ſhould light by chance on a Ciſtern, which yet are alſo generally dry, for nothing but the Rain filleth them. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours have ordered 30000 of theſe Ciſterns to be dug in the Ground in theſe Deſarts (as I was informed when I was at <hi>Aleppo</hi>) and to be provided with Water, that their Armies when they marched from place to place in thoſe times when they had War with the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> or <hi>Arabia, &amp;c.</hi> might not want for Water, and if one ſhould be empty they might perhaps find ſome in the others. In theſe Wilderneſſes I ſaw nothing worth ſpeaking of, but on the 9th. of <hi>October,</hi> ſome ancient Turrets that ſtood upon the high Banks on a Point, called <hi>Euſy,</hi> where, as ſome ſay, hath been formerly a Famous Town. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the River taketh ſo large a Circumference, that we went longer than half a Day, before we could paſs it. By the ſame River below us, we ſaw on the other
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48499:98"/>
Side of it ſeveral <hi>Arabians</hi> on Horſe-back: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe remarkable, but as I have told you before, ſome ſmall Hutts of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who came to ſee us often, but chiefly at Night-time, to pilfer ſomething, which they are uſed to from their Infancy. Wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved us to have great Care, and to keep a good Watch, as I did find it the ſame Night: For when it was come to my Turn to ſtand Sentinel again, which I commonly did in the hindermoſt part of the Ship on high, that I might eſpy the Thieves the ſooner if any ſhould come, I laid down by me a good Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel (as we all uſed to do every time) ſo I lay down and wrap'd my ſelf up in a Frize Coat with hanging Sleeves to it, to keep my ſelf from the Froſt and Dew, which are very frequent and violent there. After long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I began to be drowſy and fell aſleep, a Thief came through the Water to the Ship, where I was laid down very ſilently, and took hold of one of my Sleeves that hung down, in hopes to draw out the Coat gently, not knowing that I was in it: So I was ſenſible that Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body was there that would ſteal the Coat, and got up, and ſeeing the Head of the Rogue, I took hold of my long Cudgel, to have a Blow at him; but he was too nimble for me, ſwam back and ran away: The reſt that lay by me were awakened at this, and did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I had ſeen Some-body, but did not know the Particulars, ſo they were very glad that I had frightned away the Thief, and gave me Thanks for my great Care and diligent watching. As the <hi>Moors</hi> by Night follow their Robbery, ſo they came by Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light often with their Wives to trade with us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Maſter ſometimes to pleaſe ſome Merchants, did ſooner land, who took all ſorts of Goods out with them; as Soap-balls, Beads of Chryſtal, and yellow Agates, Glaſs-Rings of ſeveral Colours, which they wear on their Hands and Feet; and ſeveral other Toys made of Red, Yellow, Green and Blew Glaſs; and ſet in Tin Braſs or Lead, high Shooes, which are tied with Leathern Straps at the Top, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe Goods they trucked with the <hi>Moors</hi> for Sheep's Skins, Buck-skins, Cheeſe-Curds, and ſeveral other Things, and ſometimes for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48499:98"/>
Money. Theſe <hi>Moors</hi> do not differ much in their Form from our Gypſies, only that theſe are a good deal Browner. They are very nimble in their Actions, but they do not much care to work; they rather ſpend their time in idle Diſcourſes, or begin to quarrel with one another, with loud and big Words, and a great Clamour, but ſeldom are ſo much in earneſt as to come to Blows. Their Heads are ſhaved ſaving only the Crown, where they let generally a long Lock grow, like unto the <hi>Turks,</hi> that hangeth down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. As to their Cloathing they wore Coats, made of Courſe Stuff, whole before, and without Sleeves; they are pretty long before, and reach to their Knees, ſuch an one I wore on my Journey, ſtriped with White and Black; underneath they have long Shirts, which are cut out about the Necks, and reach down to their Ankles, they are commonly Blew, and have wide Sleeves, which they let fly about, chiefly in their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they fling their Arms about to ſhew their Pride. Theſe Shirts they gird up with broad Leathern Girdles ſo high, that you cannot ſee the Girdle, but only their bended Dagger that ſticks or hangs in them, as we wear our Swords. The Archers put ſometimes one of their Arms out of their Shirts, and ſo leave their Breaſt bare at the ſame time, that they may ſhoot and fight the freer without being hindred; thoſe that are not able to buy Shooes, take inſtead of them Necks of undreſſed Skins, and put them about their Feet with the Hair outwards, and ſo tye or lace them up. The Men wear no Breeches, but the Women do, and they come down to their Ankles: Their Faces are not veiled, as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Womens, but elſe they cover themſelves with broad Scarfs, which more incline to Blew than to White, and let them (chiefly thoſe that wear nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ones) hang behind in a great knot. When they have a mind to be fine, they put on their precious things (as are Marbles, Amber Beads, Glaſſes of ſeveral Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) fixed to Laces and hang them down their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which come down about a Span long, and fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from Face to Neck, ſo that in bending or moving their Head they often hurt their Face, and do not a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48499:99"/>
little hinder them in their Actions. Thoſe that are of greater Subſtance, and have a mind to be richer and finer in their Dreſs, wear Silver and Gold-Rings in one of their Noſtrils (as ſome do in one of their Ears in our Country) wherein are ſet Garnets, Turquois, Rubies and Pearls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They alſo wear Rings about their Legs and Hands, and ſometimes a good many together, which in their ſtepping and working, ſlip up and down about their Hands and Feet, and ſo make a great noiſe. So much I thought convenient to relate of the Inhabitants of theſe Countries and Deſarts, as I have ſeen and found it.</p>
                  <p>After we had paſſed through the great Deſarts, and began to come prety near unto <hi>Ana,</hi> our Maſter land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed early in the Evening in a very pleaſant Place which was about a League and a half on this Side of the Town, where we ſtayed all Night: For the River is very dangerous to navigate becauſe of its ſwift Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſome Rocks that lie between the Mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Place was ſo pleaſant by Reaſon of its fruitful Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> Olive-Trees, Orange, Citron, Limon, Pomgranate, and chiefly Date-Trees, that the like I had not ſeen before in my Travels, and hard by it was a very thick Wood of Date-Trees, whereinto I went with ſome of our Company, and found ſo great a Quantity of Fruit that they did not eſteem them at all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them we found two new Sorts different from them that uſe to be brought to us in our Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> quite Red, and Yellow ones, by <hi>Serapio</hi> called <hi>Hayron,</hi> in his 69th <hi>Chapter</hi>; which although ſomething leſs than ours, yet are very good, and of a delicate Taſte.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning we recommended the Ship to the Maſter, and walked (the Ship being pretty well laden) to the Town. By the way we found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fruitfulneſs ſo great a Difference, that we could really ſay, we were come from the barren and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Arabia</hi> (which hitherto had continued from <hi>Dir,</hi> nay very near from <hi>Aleppo</hi>) into the well cultivated and fruitful one. For juſt in the very Entrance there appeared Fields ſown with Cotton, which was as tender and woolly as one could any where find: Then delicate
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48499:99"/>
Fields of Corn which grew very high, and was full ripe, and fit to be cut down: Then Trees that ſtood round about, full of Fruit, ſo that we had a very pleaſant Walk to the Town. In this way I ſaw no ſtrange Plants at all, onely in the Corn the <hi>Moluchi</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> whereof I have made mention before, which is eſteemed to be the <hi>Corchorum Plinii</hi>; and alſo another, which becauſe of its Height is eaſily ſeen; this is very like unto the <hi>Seſamum,</hi> onely that the Stalk is longer and fatter, the Leaves are rougher, and the uppermoſt ones are cut into three different ones, which is not to be ſeen in the uppermoſt Leaves of the <hi>Seſamum,</hi> the Leaves whereof are more like unto Willow-Leaves both in Length and Colour: Between the Leaves that ſtand ſingly about the Stalk one above the other, ſprout out ſtately Flowers, which are Yellow without, and intermixt with Red Veins, and of a purple brown Colour within, and have a long Style or Pointel in the middle thereof; when theſe are fall'n off, there grow long Pods out of them, about a Finger long and thick, which are hairy without, pointed towards the Top, and have Five Diſtinctions within, wherein the ſeeds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (which are very like unto the ſort of Malva that is called <hi>Abutilon</hi>) and are placed in good Order one above the other. I did very much enquire after this plant, but they know no other Name for it, but <hi>Lubie Endigi,</hi> that is <hi>Indian</hi> Kidney-Beans: But according to my Knowledge, I rather take it to be the <hi>Trio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> whereof <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> maketh mention in ſeveral Places.</p>
                  <p>The Town <hi>Ana</hi> is by the <hi>Euphrates</hi> divided into Two Parts, or rather into Two Towns, whereof the One is not very big, and ſubject to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and is very well guarded with old Walls, and ſo ſurrounded by the River, that you cannot go into it but by Boats, but the other that lieth on this Side, belongeth to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> is very great, and very ill-provided with Walls and Ditches, ſo that you may go in and out by Night, as in all other Towns belonging to him. This, and alſo the whole Province, is called <hi>Gimel,</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48499:100"/>
is fifteen Days Journey diſtant from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and goeth down a great way the River, ſo that we had a good Hour to go, before we came to the Houſe of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which was near the Harbour, where our Ship did lie. The Houſes are built with Brick and Stone Walls, and very well done; and we could hardly ſee one on either ſide but what had a Garden to it, planted with <hi>Dates, Limon, Citron,</hi> and <hi>Pomgranate</hi> Trees, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Fruit in it. At the other ſide on the left in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> I ſaw nothing but ſome Summer-houſes ſtanding about the Hills. By the way before we came to <hi>Ana,</hi> I obſerved very well, that ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (to whom I was of an Outlandiſh Man recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended) left me, and began to contrive with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who was born in that Town, to accuſe me by a ſecond Hand, that they might not be ſeen in it, as a Spy, before the Magiſtrates, pretending that I obſerved all Towns and Places accurately, and had a mind to betray them at my Opportunity, which they chiefly did to frighten me, and ſo to get the ſooner ſome good Booty out of me. In Order whereunto, ſome of them went to the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw,</hi> and obtained preſently of him to ſend one of his Servants with them, which came to me in the long Street, having ſome Iron Chains and Fetters in his Hands, which he let hang down upon the Ground, and led me along; ſo that I preſently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they had an ill Intention againſt me, which they intended to execute. So I went along with him, to ſee what they would do with me; when they came to the Harbour, they gave me leave to go into the Ship, and to ſtay there until I heard more of them. So they ſoon aggreed together, and told me, chiefly one of them that was on Horſe-back in a long Furr'd Coat, that if I would be at Liberty, I muſt pay to the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw</hi> 500 Ducats. When I was conſidering theſe things, and ſaw my ſelf alſo left quite alone, and their Demands ſo extraordinary unreaſonable, and found my ſelf in this great Neceſſity and Danger, it came into my mind, that there was another Magiſtrate in the other Town <hi>Ana,</hi> at the other ſide of the River, which was a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> one, to whom I would make my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48499:100"/>
Complaint of their unjuſt and unreaſonable Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to ſee whether I might not find help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of them, wherefore I provided my ſelf with my Paſs, and fitted my ſelf ſo in Cloaths that I might be able to ſwim, ſo that if they ſhould Aſſault me to take hold of me, I might ſoon make my eſcape over the River without any oppoſition or hindering. At length, when they expected my Anſwer, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I told them my Intention plainly and clearly, which put them into greater Fright and Fear, than they had put me in before. Wherefore they gave over their unjuſt Demands, and deſired of the 500 Ducats, no more but a ſingle one, which they were forc'd to give to the Servant of the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw,</hi> for the Pains he had taken.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48499:101"/>
and many others, which I could not diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too far off; ſo that we found a great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and our Wilderneſs (wherein, chiefly at a Diſtance from the River, we hardly ſaw a Tree in a whole day) changed at the lower end of the Town in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fertile Soil: Wherefore our Voyage was very pleaſant to us, for we had alſo leſs danger to fear from the <hi>Arabians.</hi> But our Maſter was very much troubled, becauſe the River was often ſtop'd up at the Sides with great Stones that made the River ſwell, for there was a great Number of large and high Water-Engines or Wheels, therefore theſe Stones were laid to lead the Stream to them, to make them work, for it often happen'd that Two of them ſtood cloſe together, which took up ſo much of the River, that we had hardly room to paſs by them in the middle of the Stream, wherefore he was forced to have great Care, to find the right way where he might paſs without Danger. The Reaſon why theſe Water-Wheels are ſo much in Uſe is, becauſe this River doth not overflow (as the River <hi>Nilus</hi>) to water the Grounds, neither doth it rain enough here ſufficiently to moiſten the Seeds and Garden-Plants, that they be not burnt by the great Heat of the Sun, wherefore they muſt look out for ſuch Means, as will ſupply this Want. To do this they erect Water-Wheels (whereof Three or Four ſtand behind one another) in the River, which go Night and Day, and dip up Water out of the River, which is emptied into peculiar Chanals, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared on purpoſe, to water all the Ground. But if the Places lie not conveniently, or the Shore be too high to erect ſuch Wheels, they make inſtead of them Bridges and peculiar Engines, that are turned by a Couple of Bullocks, to bring the Water up, with great Leathern Buckets, which are wide at Top and narrow at Bottom. This Land being ſo fruitful, we ſoon found, to our great Pleaſure, great Quantities of delicate Fruit, ſold for a ſmall Matter of Money, and among the reſt chiefly <hi>Indian</hi> Musk-Melons, that were very well taſted.</p>

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48499:101"/>When we came further we had generally even ground at both Sides, and not a few Fields, the moſt Part whereof, were ſown with <hi>Indian-Millet,</hi> for they ſow more of this than of Wheat or Barley, for the Sand is pretty deep, wherein the Corn would not grow ſo well. This <hi>Millet</hi> was juſt fit to be cut down, and in ſome Places they had it in already. It ſhoots up into a high Stalk about Six, Seven, or Eight Cubits high, the Leaves thereof are like unto the <hi>Indian</hi>-Corn, or Sugar-Reeds, which I took it for at Firſt, and that becauſe the Inhabitants did chaw it as well as the Sugar-Canes, becauſe of the ſweet and pleaſant Juice (which is more in the upper Part of the Cane, whereas that of the Sugar-Canes is more in the lower) which they draw out of it, untill I ſaw at length their white hairy Tops ſprout out, which are large and not unlike to the <hi>Italian-Millet.</hi> Theſe are full of whitiſh Grains, each of which ſticks between Two broad flying Leaves, of the Bigneſs of thoſe of the <hi>Orabus,</hi> yet ſomewhat more compreſſed at the Sides. Hereof they bake very well-taſted Bread and Cakes, and ſome of them are rowled very thin, and laid together like unto a Letter, ſo that they are about Four Inches broad, Six long, and Two thick; they are of an Aſhen Colour. The Inhabitants call it ſtill at this Day by its ancient <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Name <hi>Dora,</hi> whereof <hi>Rhaſes</hi> maketh mention, he that will may read more of it in Authors.</p>
                  <p>Our Voyage went on very well, wherefore the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants began ſeveral Paſtimes, ſome did play at a Play called the Eighteenth, and others played at Cheſs, in which Two Games they were very well verſed; others ſpent their time in Reading and Singing. Among the reſt there was a Merchant from <hi>Balſara,</hi> that ſung out of his <hi>Alcoran</hi> (which was put into Rhymes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Arabick</hi>) ſeveral times with a loud and delicate Voice; ſo that I took great Delight in hearing him. Yet they were not ſo hot in their Gaming or Jeſting, that they ſhould therefore forget the Hour of their Prayers, chiefly their Divines that were in Orders, which uſed to call them out with a loud Voice, at the uſual Hour, either in the Ship, or without in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48499:102"/>
if they could have convenient Time and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But among the <hi>Perſians</hi> I found a greater Zeal and Earneſtneſs, than among the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> all which Nation have notwithſtanding the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their Prayers. For as they have chiefly Five Hours of Praying, whereof Three are in the Day-time; <hi>viz.</hi> the Firſt about Noon, the Second about Three, and the Third when the Sun begins to ſet, the two others in the Night, one in the Morning an Hour and half before the Sun riſeth, and the Second after Sun ſet when the Firmament begins to look white and the Stars to appear: So the <hi>Perſians</hi> would not be hindered, by the Darkneſs of the Night, Danger of the Place, Inconveniency of the Time, to go out, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were aſleep, on the Ground in the Iſland where we were landed, and ſay their Prayers with ſuch an Earneſtneſs and Devotion, as I have often ſeen it, that the Tears run out of their Eyes: I muſt alſo needs ſay that they keep cloſer and ſtricter to their Laws than almoſt any other Nation, which forbid them to drink Wine, and command them to live in Poverty, and to watch and pray continually.</p>
                  <p>The Eighteenth Day of <hi>October</hi> we came early to <hi>Hadidt,</hi> a pretty large, yet anciently built Town, belonging to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which is alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Towns by the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> like unto <hi>Ana,</hi> whereof the greater part lieth on this Side of the River. Here the Maſter payed for his Ship two <hi>Sayet,</hi> (one whereof is about Three-Pence in our Country) to the Cuſtomers, and ſo ſet Sail again, to try whether he could reach that Night to <hi>Juppe</hi>: And he did oftner than ever before, ſpeak to his Men to pull on (chiefly where the River in its Breadth and Depth was almoſt like unto the Sea) ſo that at Night pretty late we arrived at <hi>Juppe,</hi> a pleaſant and well built Town belonging to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and it is alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Parts, whereof one lieth in the middle of the River on a high Ground, at the Top whereof is a Fortreſs, ſo the Town is pretty well defended: The other (which is rather bigger) lieth on the leſt in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> wherein are many fine Orchards belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48499:102"/>
to the Houſes, full of high Date-Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Merchants ſpent half a Day there to buy Dates, Almonds, and Figs to carry with them into the Inns; the ſame they did at <hi>Idt</hi> another great Town of the <hi>Turks,</hi> on the Right-hand of the <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſituate on a high Ground, where we arrived on the 20th of <hi>October</hi> at Night in very good Time, and gave them inſtead thereof Soap-balls, Knives, and Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which goods they have often enquired of us; and we have given them ſometimes ſome Sheets of white Paper, which they received with great Joy, and returned us many thanks for them.</p>
                  <p>After our Merchants had ſufficiently ſtored them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe Goods, and our Maſter had pay'd the Duty for his two Ships, he put off about Noon on the 21ſt of <hi>October</hi> and went away. About the Evening we ſaw at this Side of the River a Mill, and alſo the next Day another, whereby were ſeveral old Walls Doors and Arches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby I conjecture that formerly there ſtood a Town. Theſe two Mills (as I was informed were two Powder-Mills that make Gun-powder for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, and ſend it to him in Caravans, together with other Merchandizes through the Dominions of the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> wherefore he muſt as well as other Merchants, pay Duty (for that Liberty) and Toll or Cuſtom. The Gun-powder is not made from Salt-Peter, as ours is, but out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juice, which they take from a Tree that is reckon'd to be a kind of Willow; known to the <hi>Perſians</hi> by the Name of <hi>Fer,</hi> and to the <hi>Arabians</hi> by <hi>Garb,</hi> as I have mentioned above. Beſides this they take the ſmall Twigs of theſe Trees together with the Leaves, and burn them to Powder, which they put into Water to ſeparate the Salt from it, and ſo make Gun-powder thereof, yet this is nothing near ſo ſtrong as ours. <hi>Pliny</hi> chiefly teſtifieth this in his 31ſt Book and 10th Chapter, where he ſaith that in former Days they have made Niter of Oak-Trees, (which certainly he hath taken theſe to be, for they are pretty like Oaks) but that it hath been given over long before now. Which is very probable, chiefly becauſe the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48499:103"/>
thereof was not ſo great, before they found out Guns, as it is now ſince they have been found out.</p>
                  <p>Further on the Water-ſide, on the high Banks, I ſaw an innumerable many Coloquints grow and hang down, which at a diſtance I could not well know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they called them by their ancient <hi>Arabick</hi> Name <hi>Handbel,</hi> whereby they ſtill to this Day are known to the Inhabitants. After we had navigated a great way ſeveral Days one after another, through even Grounds, and in a good Road, we arrived at length on the 24th. Day of <hi>October,</hi> at Night, near to <hi>Felu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> or <hi>Elugo,</hi> a little Village called ſo, and with it the whole Province.</p>

                  <p>THE Village <hi>Elugo</hi> lyeth on the place where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Old <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Chaldee,</hi> did ſtand; the Harbour lyeth a quarter of a League off, whereinto thoſe uſe to go, that intend to travel by Land, to the Famous trading City of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> (which is ſituated further to the Eaſt on the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> at a Day and a half's diſtance). At this Harbour is the place where the Old Town of <hi>Babylon</hi> did ſtand, but at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is not a Houſe to be ſeen, whereinto we could go with our Goods and ſtay till our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48499:103"/>
midſt of the Deſarts, and to pay Toll under the open Sky, which belongeth to the <hi>Turks.</hi> This Country is ſo dry and barren, that it cannot be tilled, and ſo bare, that I ſhould have doubted very much, whether this Potent and Powerful City (which once was the moſt Stately and Famous one of the World, ſituated in the pleaſant and fruitful Country of <hi>Sinar</hi>) did ſtand there, if I ſhould not have known it by its Situation, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ancient and Delicate Antiquities that ſtill are ſtanding hereabout in great Deſolation. Firſt by the Old Bridge, which was laid over the <hi>Euphrates</hi> (which alſo is called <hi>Sud</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Baruch</hi> in his firſt Chapter) whereof there are ſome Pieces and Arches ſtill remaining, and to be ſeen at this very Day a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove where we landed. Theſe Arches are built of burnt Brick, and ſo ſtrong, that it is admirable; and that ſo much the more, becauſe all along the River as we came from <hi>Bir,</hi> where the River is a great deal ſmaller, we ſaw never a Bridge, wherefore I ſay it is admirable, which way they could build a Bridge here, where the River is at leaſt half a League broad, and very deep beſides. Near the Bridge are ſeveral heaps of <hi>Babylonian</hi> Pitch, to pitch Ships withal, which is in ſome places grown ſo hard, that you may walk over it, but in others that which hath been lately brought thither is ſo ſoft, that you may ſee every ſtep you make in it. Something farther, juſt before the Village <hi>Elugo</hi> is the Hill whereon the Caſtle did ſtand in a Plain, whereon you may ſtill ſee ſome Ruines of the Fortification, which is quite demoliſhed and uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: behind it pretty near to it, did ſtand the Tower of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which the Children of <hi>Noah</hi> (who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited theſe Countries after the Deluge) began to build up unto Heaven; this we ſee ſtill, and it is half a League in Diameter, but it is ſo mightily ruined, and low, and ſo full of Vermin that have bored holes through it, that one may not come near it within half a Mile, but only in two Months in the Winter, when they come not out of their holes. Among theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, there are chiefly ſome in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language called <hi>Eglo,</hi> by the Inhabitants, that are very poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48499:104"/>
they are (as others told me) bigger than our Lizards, and have <note n="*" rend="inter">

                  </p>
                  <p>From this Tower, at two Leagues diſtance Eaſtward, lieth the ſtrong Town <hi>Traxt,</hi> which was formerly called <hi>Apamia,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>Book</hi> VI. 26 and 27 <hi>Chap.</hi> between the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> thoſe two great Rivers of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> whereof is made mention in the Second Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi>; which two Rivers not far below it meet together, and are there united. The Town <hi>Traxt</hi> is ſurrounded with Ditches, and very well defended by two ſtrong Citadels, that lie on each ſide thereof, ſo that it is (as it were a Key and Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to which it doth alſo belong, as others not far from thence, viz, <hi>Orthox, Laigen,</hi> which lie on the Road toward <hi>Media</hi>; and alſo <hi>Goa</hi> (which lieth a League and a half at the other ſide of the <hi>Tigris,</hi>) and <hi>Axt</hi> (two Leagues further ſtill) in the way to <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Day, the 25th. of <hi>October,</hi> we ſpent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking of Camels and Aſſes to load our Goods upon, and after we were quite ready, we broke up the Day following early in the Morning with the whole <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan,</hi> to travel to <hi>Bagdet.</hi> In the beginning the ways were very rough of the Stones and Ruines that lie ſtill from thence diſperſed. But after we were paſſed the Caſtle and alſo the Town of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the dry Deſarts began again, where nothing was to be ſeen but Thorns, neither Men nor Beaſts, neither Caves nor Tents, ſo that a Man that knoweth the ways never ſo well, hath enough to do to find them through it, which I did often obſerve in our Guide or <hi>Caliphi,</hi> who did ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48499:104"/>
times (becauſe there was neither way nor mark nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Men nor Beaſts to be found) very much doubt which way to turn himſelf, and ſo he did more than once turn ſometimes towards one, then toward the other ſide the whole Caravan. By the way we ſaw in the Plain many large, ancient, high and ſtately Buildings, Arches and Turrets ſtanding in the Sand (which is very fine, and lieth cloſe together, as you find it in the Vallies) here and there, whereof many were decayed and lay like Ruines; ſome to look upon, were pretty entire, very ſtrong, adorned with Artificial Works, ſo that they were very well worth to have been narrowlier looked into. Thus they ſtand ſolitary and deſolated, ſave only the Steeple of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is entire, built of black Stones, and is inhabited ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Day; this is in height and building ſomething like unto our Steeple of the <hi>Holy-Croſs</hi> Church, or of St. <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>Augsburg</hi>; on which as it ſtands by it ſelf, you may ſee all the Ruines of the Old <hi>Babylonian</hi> Tower, the Caſtle-Hill, together with the ſtately Buildings, and the whole Situation of the Old Town very exactly.</p>
                  <p>After we had travelled for Twelve Hours through deſolate places, very hard, ſo that our Camels and Aſſes began to be tired under their heavy Burdens, we reſted and lodged our ſelves near to an aſcent, we and our Beaſts, to refreſh our ſelves, and ſo to ſtay there till Night, and to break up again in the middle thereof, that we might come to <hi>Bagdet</hi> before Sun riſing. The mean while, when we were lodged there, I conſidered and viewed this aſcent, and found that there was two behind one another, diſtinguiſhed by a Ditch, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves like unto two parallel Walls a great way about, and that they were open in ſome Places, where one might go through, like Gates; wherefore I believe, that they were the Wall of the Old Town (whereof <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays that they were 200 Foot high, and 50 broad) that went about there, and that the places where they were open, have been anciently the Gates (whereof there were a Hundred Iron ones) of that Town; and this the rather, becauſe I ſaw in ſome places under the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48499:105"/>
Sand (wherewith the two aſcents were almoſt covered) the Old Wall plainly appear. So we found our ſelves to be juſt lodged without the Walls of that formerly ſo Famous Kingly City, which now with its Magnificent and Glorious Buildings, is quite deſolated and lieth in the Duſt, ſo that every one that paſſeth through it, in regard of them, hath great reaſon to admire with aſtoniſhment, when he conſiders, that this which hath been ſo Glorious an one; and in which the Greateſt Monarchs and Kings that ever were, <hi>Nimrod, Belus,</hi> and after him King <hi>Merodach</hi> and his Poſterity to <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſar</hi> the laſt, have had their Seats and Habitations, is now reduced to ſuch a Deſolation and Wilderneſs, that the very Shepherds cannot abide to fix their Tents there to inhabit it. So that here is a moſt terrible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to all impious and haughty Tyrants, ſhewn in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which may be ſure, that if they do not give over in time, and leave their Tyranny, ceaſing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Innocents with War, Sword, Priſon, and all other cruel and inhumane Plagues (as theſe did the People of God the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>) that God the Almighty will alſo come upon them, and for their Tranſgreſſions puniſh them in his Anger, for God is a jealous God, that at long run, will not endure the Pride of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, nor leave unpuniſhed the Potentates that afflict his People; wherefore be ſure, he will alſo in them verifie the Prophecies, which he hath uttered by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his 12th. Chapter, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the 51ſt. againſt thoſe inſolent and haughty <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I paſſed by, I found ſome Thorns growing in the Sand, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Acacia,</hi> called <hi>Agul,</hi> whereon (chiefly in <hi>Perſia</hi>) the <hi>Manna</hi> falls, whereof I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before; above all I found in great Plenty ſome ſtrange kinds of <hi>Cali</hi> of <hi>Serap.,</hi> of Coloquints, and when Evening fell in, and the Night did approach, our Mockeries that drove the Aſſes, made themſelves ready again for our Journey, which kept every thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in good Order, and were ſo quick in loading and unloading, that they were ready in leſs than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour. By the way I ſaw again ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48499:105"/>
but the Night falling in I loſt them; ſo we went on a-pace in darkneſs, ſo that we did arrive at <hi>Bagdet,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Baldac,</hi> two Hours before Day. In the Morning, which was the 27th. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> I and one of my Comrades took our Lodging at an Eminent Merchant's Houſe, that belonged to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> and was lately come from the <hi>Indies</hi>; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us kindly, and very readily, and kept us for four Days, when we took a Shop in the great Camp of the <hi>Turkiſh Baſhaw,</hi> in the other Town, on the other ſide of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> which we went into.</p>

                  <p>THE Town <hi>Bagdet,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, is ſituated on the moſt Eaſterly part of his Dominions, on the rapid River <hi>Tigris,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in a large Plain, almoſt like unto <hi>Baſle</hi> on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> it is divided into Two Parts, which are rather bigger than <hi>Baſle,</hi> but nothing near ſo pleaſant, nor ſo well built, for the Streets thereof are pretty narrow, and many Houſes ſo miſerably built, that ſome of them are down to the firſt Story, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lie quite in Ruines: The caſe is the ſame with the Churches, which for age look black, and are ſo much decayed, that you ſhall hardly find a whole one; whereon are ſtill ſeveral Old <hi>Arabian,</hi> or rather <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48499:106"/>
Inſcriptions to be ſeen, cut out in Stone, by the means whereof many Antiquities of the Town might have been truly explained, but I could not only not read them, but could get no body that could interpet them to me. There are ſome Buildings that are worth ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh Baſhaw,</hi> and the great <hi>Batzar</hi> or <hi>Exchange</hi> beyond the River in the other Town, and the <hi>Baths</hi> which are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> for they are at the bottom and on the Walls done over with Pitch, which maketh them ſo black and dark, that even in the Day time, you have but little Light. There being two Towns, one of them which lieth on this ſide is quite open, ſo that you may go in and out by Night without any moleſtation; wherefore it ſhould rather be called a great Village than a Town; but the other that lieth towards <hi>Perſia</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> is very well Fortified with Walls and Ditches, chiefly towards the <hi>Tigris,</hi> where there are alſo ſome Towers, two whereof are within by the Gates that lead towards the Water-ſide, to guard them, and between them are the old high Walls of the Town, whereon on the top are ſtately Writings, with Golden Letters, each whereof is about a Foot long, to be ſeen; the true meaning thereof, I would fain have learned, but for want of Underſtanding and Interpreters, I could not obtain it, but was forced to go without it. Near unto it there is a Bridge made of Boats that reacheth over the <hi>Tigris</hi> into the other Town, which in that place is about as broad, as the <hi>Rhine</hi> is at <hi>Straſburg,</hi> and becauſe of its rapid Stream ſo dark and dull, that it is a diſmal ſight to look upon it, and may eaſily turn a Man's Head and make him giddy. This River runneth not much below the Town into the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſo they run mixt together into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, by the Town <hi>Balſara,</hi> which is ſix Days Journey diſtant from thence Eaſtward. Theſe two Towns as is ſaid, at the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> were many Years agon, built out of the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereof the one on the other ſide of the River is accompted to be the Town of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that on this ſide, which is more
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48499:106"/>
like unto an open Village, is believed to be the Town <hi>Cteſiphonta. Strabo</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> XV. doth teſtifie this, when he writes thus of them; That <hi>Babylon</hi> hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been the Metropolis of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and that after its devaſtation, the Town of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> ſituated upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> near which was a great Village, wherein the King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> did keep his Reſidence for the Winter. <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh alſo mention thereof in his Sixth Book, and in the 26th. and 27th. Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that the two Towns of <hi>Seleucia</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonta</hi> were built out of the Ruines of the Old City, and that the River <hi>Tigris</hi> runs between them. In the Town <hi>Seleucia,</hi> ſtands in a large place, the Caſtle, which is without guarded neither with Walls nor Ditches, nor is quite finiſhed within. Before it lie ſome Pieces of Ordnance in the Road, which are ſo daubed with Dirt, that they are almoſt quite covered. In it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Turkiſh Baſhaw,</hi> who (when he underſtood that two Strangers were come into his Camp) ſent for us, and had us before him by his Men; along with us went freely an <hi>Armenian,</hi> whom we had known for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to aſſiſt us, and to be our Interpreter, to give the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> a good and ſufficient account of us.</p>
                  <p>When we came into the Room of the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> (which was but very ordinary, yet ſpread with delicate Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and well adorned) and appeared with accuſtomed Reverences, he asked us (ſitting in his Coſtly yellow-coloured long Gown) by one of his Servants in <hi>French,</hi> which he did not underſtand very well, from what places we came, what Merchandiſes we had brought with us, and whither we intended to go. After we had punctually anſwered him to each Queſtion, yet he was not ſatisfied, but bid us to withdraw, and ſtay until we heard his Anſwer. We underſtood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well, that it was only to ſcrue a Preſent out of us, yet we would not underſtand it, but ſhewed him our Paſs, ſubſcribed both by the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and the <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to try whether that would give him Content. So he took it and read it over, and looked very diligently upon their Seals, as they uſe to ſeal
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48499:107"/>
(after they have dipped it firſt into Ink) ſo that all but the Letters is black. When he found them right, and did not know any more to ſay to us, he let us go, then we made him his Reverence again, and ſo we went backwards out of his Lodgings, for if you turn your Back to any one (although it be a far meaner Perſon) they take it as a great uncivility, rudeneſs, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. This <hi>Baſhaw</hi> keeps a great Garriſon in the Town of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> becauſe it lieth on the Confines of <hi>Suſiana, Media,</hi> &amp;c. which are Provinces belonging to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more towards the Eaſt of it to command. His greateſt Dominions are the Wilderneſſes of the Deſart <hi>Arabia,</hi> whereof the <hi>Turk</hi> hath one Part, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the bigeſt belongs to the King of <hi>Arabia.</hi> After the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> had given us leave to go, we went to our Lodgings again, and bought by the way in the <hi>Batzar</hi> ſome Proviſion to eat, and to boil for Supper, for in theſe Countries are no Inns to be found, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into one may go, and find a Dinner ready prepared for Chance-Cuſtomers, as in our Country is done, except one would go into a Cook's Shop, whereof there are a great many in the <hi>Batzars</hi>; but every one boileth for himſelf what he hath a mind to, without Doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lodgings, where there is a Chimny for that purpoſe, ſo that in the Morning, and at Night when it is time to eat, you ſee every where in the Allies of the Camp ſeveral Fires. When we went to eat we were forced (becauſe in theſe Chambers is neither Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor Stools, nor Bench) to ſit down on the Ground, and alſo lie upon it all Night, ſo that our Cloaks were very uſeful to us, to ſerve us inſtead of a Bed, chiefly in the Winter, to keep us warm, yet the Winter is not very ſevere in thoſe Countries; which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, for that our <hi>March</hi>-Flowers, <hi>Narciſſus's, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acinths, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. were here full in Flowers in the Month of <hi>December</hi>; and that the Farmers went to Plough at that time; wherefore I judge that their Winter is like unto our Spring. When we lived at <hi>Bagdet,</hi> I found by our Catering, that the Scarcity was ſtill very conſiderable, and it would have been
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48499:107"/>
more, and have encreaſed, if the Towns that lie above it on the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Moſſel,</hi> which formerly went by the Name of <hi>Nineve,</hi> had not ſent them great Supplies, as did alſo thoſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahemit,</hi> &amp;c. which Supply they have alſo almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, at any other time, occaſion for, for their cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Grounds are chiefly in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where they have almoſt none at all, ſo that there groweth not enough to maintain themſelves; wherefore the two Rivers are very neceſſary to them, not only to provide them with Victuals, as Corn, Wine, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo to bring to them all ſorts of Merchandices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many Ship-loads are brought in daily. So that in this Town there is a great Depoſition of Merchandices (by reaſon of its commodious Situation) which are brought thither by Sea as well as by Land from ſeveral Parts, chiefly from <hi>Natolia, Syria, Armenia, Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Haleppo, Damaſcus,</hi> &amp;c. to carry them further into the <hi>Indies, Perſia,</hi> &amp;c. So it happened that during the time I was there, on the 2d. Day of <hi>December,</hi> in 74. there arrived 25 Ships with Spice and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Drugs here, which came over Sea from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the way of <hi>Ormutz,</hi> to <hi>Balſara,</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>Grand Turk,</hi> ſituated on the Frontiers, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt that he hath South-Eaſtwards, within Six Days Journey from hence, where they load their Goods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall Veſſels, and ſo bring them to <hi>Bagdet,</hi> which Journey, as ſome ſay, taketh them up Forty Days. Seeing that the Paſſage both by Water and Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth both to the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> (which alſo have their Towns and Forts on their Confines) which might eaſily be ſtopt up by them, yet that notwithſtanding all this they may keep good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with one another, they keep Pigeons (chiefly at <hi>Balſara</hi>) which in caſe of neceſſity might ſoon be ſent back again with Letters to <hi>Bagdet.</hi> When loaden Ships arrive at <hi>Bagdet,</hi> the Merchants (chiefly thoſe that bring Spice, to carry through the Deſarts into <hi>Turky</hi>) have their peculiar places in the open Fields without the Town <hi>Creſiphon,</hi> where each of them fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Tents, to put his Spices underneath in Sacks, to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48499:108"/>
keep them there ſafe, until they have a mind to break up in whole Caravans; ſo that at a diſtance, one would rather believe that Soldiers were lodged in them, than Merchants; and rather look for Arms than Merchants Goods: And ſo I thought my ſelf, before I came ſo near that I could ſmell them.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe Merchants that came with the ſame Ships, came directly to our <hi>Camp,</hi> and among the reſt a Jeweller, which brought with him ſeveral precious Stones, <hi>viz. Diamonds, Chalcedonies,</hi> which make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Hafts to Daggers, <hi>Rubies, Topazes, Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs,</hi> &amp;c. the two firſt whereof he had procured in <hi>Camboya,</hi> and moſt of the reſt in the Iſland of <hi>Zeylan,</hi> whereof he ſhew'd us ſeveral very fine ones. The Merchants bring theſe along with them in great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans, and keep them very cloſe and private, that they may not be found out at the Cuſtom-Houſes and be taken away from them, which the <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endeavour with all their Might and Power. For the <hi>Turks</hi> do not love that Precious Stones ſhould coſt them Money, for they are extraordinarily covetous, wherefore you find but a few among them, but if they can have them without coſt, after the aforeſaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they love them dearly; and keep them in great Eſteem. In the room of them other Stones are ſent into the <hi>Indies</hi> again, Corals, Emralds (which are bought beſt in <hi>Aegypt</hi>) Saffron, Chermes-berries, and ſeveral Sorts of Fruit, as Cibebs, Dates, (which are there ſo pliable and Soft that you may pack them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in great lumps as they do Tamarinds) Figs, Almonds and many others which I cannot now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and alſo ſeveral Sorts of Silks; and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs: But above all, fine Horſes, whereof they ſend Abundance into the <hi>Indies</hi> by the way of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but more by the way of <hi>Ormutz,</hi> wherefore the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> received yearly a good Sum of Money for Cuſtom, <hi>viz.</hi> Forty Ducats for each, which the Merchants pay very freely, becauſe that thoſe that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Horſes (as I am informed) pay but half Duty for their other Goods at the Cuſtom-Houſes, and ſell them beſides with good Profit. Some of theſe Horſes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48499:108"/>
are alſo ſent (becauſe of their Beauty and Goodneſs) into <hi>Syria, Natolia,</hi> and to us into <hi>Europe,</hi> where they are ſold or preſented to Princes, and other great Perſons of Quality. They feed there Horſes in theſe Countries chiefly with Barly and Straw, ſo as it is broke by their Threſhing-Waggons, which they hang about their Heads in Sacks, as they do alſo about Aſſes, rather than give it them in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as we do. For want of Straw they ſometimes litter them with a fine looſe Earth, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward throw by in heaps to make it clean again to ſerve another time. When among other Merchants, Chriſtians arrive from our Countries at <hi>Ormutz,</hi> which happeneth very ſeldom, all thoſe of them that have been any ways afflicted by <hi>Turks, Arabians,</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> muſt appear, before ſome certain Officers of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> appointed for that purpoſe, and make their Complaints to them, of what hath happened to them, or what Damage they have ſuffered or received; and in Caſe they ſhould omit any thing, they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeverely puniſhed. If then it appeareth, that one of them hath been cheated of his Money, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſome Merchants of the ſame Nation although innocent, and knowing nothing of it, are flung into Priſon, where they muſt remain until they have made Satisfaction to the utmoſt Farthing, and are beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed, for an Example to others that they may take warning. But if a Chriſtian ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and they come to know of it, then Three or Four of them, more or leſs, according to the Manner of the Fact, muſt ſuffer and loſe their Lives for every Chriſtian. From thence it cometh, when Merchants of many Nations are going into a Ship in order to go to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the Way of <hi>Ormutz</hi> (where they muſt land upon Penalty of Confiſcation of all their Goods) that, when firſt they put off, they look ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon one another, and take great notice of, or mind one another much, and ſay very little or nothing, not making themſelves known, fearing that ſomething may be had againſt them; and this endureth ſo long, untill they are gone half the way, then they begin to be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48499:109"/>
acquainted. Further I underſtood, that the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>'s Governour in the <hi>Indies</hi> hath already (to make himſelf ſtrong and the more able for a War) made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the chiefeſt and powerfulleſt <hi>Indians</hi> Knights or Noblemen, to the Number of 5000; and hath ſent many Jeſuits to reform theſe Countries, to propagate their Religion and to inſtitute there the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The <hi>Indians</hi> are lank in Body, brown in their Colour, well ſhaped, and of a very good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Wherefore Perſons of Quality, and Merchants love to buy them, and chuſe them for their Servants, being in their Buſineſs very faithful, diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as I have known many of them. Theſe and many more Nations, as <hi>Turks, Moors, Armenians, Curters, Medians,</hi> &amp;c. which every one of them have their peculiar Language, are at <hi>Bagdet</hi> in great Numbers, but chiefly the <hi>Perſians</hi>; ſo when I was there, there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived a Caravan of Three Hundred, with Camels and Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with an Intention to go to <hi>Mecha,</hi> to give <hi>Mahomet</hi> a Viſit, which they think, after <hi>Hali</hi> and <hi>Omar</hi> (who were his Companions and did live in that City) to be a very great Man. Theſe <hi>Perſians</hi> have a peculiar Language, ſo much differing, That neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Arabians,</hi> nor other Oriental Nations can underſtand them, and ſo they are forced to make them underſtand their meaning by Signs or an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as I and other Strangers. They alſo have their peculiar Characters. They ſit well on Horſe-back, and have on long and wide Drawers, which ſerve them alſo for Boots, and are very well furniſhed with Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters, Bows and Darts: inſtead of Spurs, they have, as it is the Faſhion in thoſe Parts, pointed Irons which are about an Inch and a half long, and are ſowed to the hind part of their Shooes. They are alſo called <hi>Red Turks,</hi> which I believe is, becauſe they have behind on their Turbants, Red Marks, as Cotton-Ribbands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Red Brims, whereby they are ſooner diſcerned from other Nations. They may alſo be diſtinguiſhed, by their grey woollen Coats, which have commonly Three Plaits behind, and come hardly down to their Knees. They are a ſtrong and valiant People, of a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48499:109"/>
noble Countenance, and Mind, very Civil, and in their Dealings upright. They are very wary in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which you may ſee by this, that before they conclude a Bargain, they take up more time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider than others to two or three, which I have ſeveral times obſerved. Among other Merchandices they have delicate Tapeſtry of ſeveral colours, and ſeveral ſorts of Cotton-Work, in which they are great Artiſts, and well skilled, but as for others, as Gold and Silver working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they underſtand little, and a great deal leſs of Gilding, wherefore they take any thing that is gloſſy for Gold. They love the Chriſtians that are Artiſts and Ingenious in theſe ſorts of Works, and ſhew them all Civilities. But as for the <hi>Turks,</hi> becauſe great and bloody Wars ariſe often between them, they hate them very much, and call them Hereticks; 1. Becauſe they will not eſteem nor receive <hi>Hali</hi> and <hi>Omar</hi> (which they denominate <hi>Caliphi</hi>) as the greateſt and higheſt Prophets or Legates of God, that have, after <hi>Mahomet,</hi> given more certain and better Laws. Wherefore they eſteem them a great deal higher; nay, worſhip them like Gods. 2. Becauſe that they as circumciſed Men, eſteem their Women to be unclean, and reckon them to be Members that are not to be ſaved, and therefore exclude them out of their Churches, ſo that they may not appear there publickly, which by the <hi>Perſians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Laws and Ordinances, after they have ſpoke ſome Words after them, are received as bleſſed Ones, and admitted to come to their Churches. From whence ariſe between theſe two Nations great Quarrels and Differences ſometimes, but yet they do not fall upon one another, nor make Incurſions in time of Peace, ſo violently on the Frontiers, as they do in <hi>Hungary</hi>; probably that one may (becauſe Negotiation goeth further into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and bringeth in great Cuſtom to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>) trade the ſafer into theſe Parts. It is cheap and very good travelling through theſe Countries into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Cuſtoms and Duties are very eaſy.</p>
                  <p>Further I underſtood from others, that here and there in <hi>Perſia</hi> live ſeveral Chriſtians, and that moſt of them are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48499:110"/>
of the perſwaſion of <hi>Preſter-John,</hi> whom they call <hi>Amma</hi>; and which way they are brought to it, I am thus informed, That formerly about Twelve Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, it did happen that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> made a League with <hi>Preſter-John</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> which came then very hard upon him, and gave him his hands ſo full, that he was forced to ſeek for help by Strangers. Now when <hi>Preſter-John</hi> thought it very inconvenient for him to make a League with a King that was not of his Religion, he ſent him a Meſſage again, that he could make no League with him, except the chiefeſt of the Articles were, that he and his Subjects would receive his Religion, then he would not only do him all Friendſhip that in him lay, but alſo aſſiſt him with all his Might and Power, which at length was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereupon he did ſend him one of his Patriarchs and ſome of his Prieſts, which in proceſs of time had this Effect, that now even at this Day, there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty Towns in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where the moſt of the Inhabitants are addicted to the Religion of <hi>Preſter-John.</hi> They have alſo as I was told, ſeveral Books of the Holy Scripture, and chiefly among the reſt, ſome of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which they call <hi>Aertiſch.</hi> And beſides that, their Patriarch hath brought it to that paſs, that they are no more ſo zealous in their Superſtitions; and are of Opinion that Circumciſion is not neceſſary, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe their Enemies the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> have it. And, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they do not abhorr the forbidden Beaſts, but eat Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor refuſe to drink Wine, and that as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, becauſe their Adverſaries are forbid it by their Law. So that the Chriſtian Faith doth in <hi>Perſia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily more and more, and they begin to be Chriſtened with Fire, according to their Faſhion, and in the Name of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, whom they notwithſtanding (according to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) rather believe to be a Creature, than the Third Perſon of the Trinity, and that he doth only proceed from the Father and not from the Son. But that thoſe that are Chriſtians may be diſcerned, they wear a blue Croſs on the inſide of their left Leg a little above the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48499:110"/>
Knee. They alſo adminiſter the Sacrament of the Holy Supper or Communion, and give it as well to the Young as to the Old ones in both kinds; but before they go to it, they muſt have their Feet waſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are little Rivolets led through the Churches, where they ſit down, and ſome of the chiefeſt of the Town come to them and waſh their Feet, and when that is done they give unto one another a Kiſs of Love; then they read the Words of Chriſt's Inſtitution, and ſo go to receive it; they do not come to Confeſſion before: And they endure no Images in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but inſtead of them they make uſe of Harps, Pipes and other Inſtruments, wherewith they make Muſick, but chiefly at the King's Court, at <hi>Samarcand</hi> (where his beſt Muſicians are) which Town, as they ſay, was built by <hi>Sem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and called after his Name. What elſe is to be ſaid concerning the Points of their Religion, ſhall be hereafter mentioned in the Chapter of the <hi>Abiſſines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further I was informed at my return, that after the Deceaſe of <hi>Gamach</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that had three Sons and one Daughter (who was ſoon married to one of the chiefeſt of the Council at Court) whereof the Eldeſt called <hi>Alſchi</hi> was beheaded, becauſe he did endeavour to take away his Father's Crown, the other two are ſtill in being; the youngeſt of them <hi>Balthaſar</hi> liveth in <hi>Parſid,</hi> a peculiar Province and Town in <hi>Perſia,</hi> which lieth on the Borders of the <hi>Indies</hi>; and the middlemoſt, called <hi>Iſmael,</hi> was lately after his Father's Deceaſe, elected King, almoſt at the ſame time, when the now reigning <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour <hi>Amura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> came to the Crown. This is ſtill young, and of a tall and ſlim Body, but very manly, and full of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and well skill'd in all Warlike Exerciſes, ſo that he dare before any of his Courtiers ride wild and unbroken Horſes (by them called <hi>Aecaik</hi>) which are not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maſtered. They are brought to him a great way off out of the Eaſtern Parts; they are as I am informed of an Aſhen colour, only ſome have white Legs; in theſe and other Exerciſes he hath ſhown his Manlineſs from his Infancy. But when he did encreaſe in Age
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48499:111"/>
and in Strength, the Anger and Diſpleaſure he bore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks</hi> did increaſe alſo, and to that Degree that he reſolved, during his Father's Life, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of them, for the wrong they had done to his Anceſtors. Wherefore, a little while agone he brought together a great many Men in the frontier Places, to ſurprize the Town of <hi>Bagdet</hi> unawares, being one of the Chiefeſt, that formerly had belonged to his Anceſtors, together with the whole Country, wherein the new Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> when they firſt come to the Government are uſed to be crowned. When he was thus prepared for the Onſet, and nothing was wanting, ſome Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ran away from his Troops and acquainted the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Bagdet</hi> with his Deſign, ſo the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> was forced to arm himſelf with all Speed as well as he could, that he might be able to oppoſe him in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. But when the King's Son would have put his Intention into Execution, the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> fell upon him unawares with ſuch a Number and Strength, that he could not only attempt nothing but was beaten, and he himſelf taken Priſoner. Beſides this the Grand <hi>Turk</hi> would have had him to be beheaded, if his Father had not with great earneſtneſs taken his part, and given him for his Ranſom the Town <hi>Orbs</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the old King had enough to do, to keep his Son in ſafe Cuſtody, that he might not begin new Alarms and Wars againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I began my Voyage in <hi>March,</hi> in the Year 74; certain News came to <hi>Aleppo</hi> that 25000 <hi>Turks</hi> were killed on the Confines of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi>; but in what Place this Battel was fought, and which way it was done, I could not learn (for if they ſuffer any Damage they always keep it very cloſe and ſecret) nor any ways hear: Wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> at that time were a great deal harder towards the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that many ſuffered for their Misfortunes Sake: But if they had obtained the Victory (as well as not) they would not have been ſo ſilent, but would have ſpread it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and have related it to others, that did not ask them, with high and big Words. So great an Opinion have the <hi>Turks</hi> of themſelves, that they really believe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48499:111"/>
there is no other Nation, that can conquer the World ſo as they, although they are not to be compared with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> neither for Strength, Manlineſs, nor Shape; ſo therefore they could effect but very little againſt others, if it were not for their great Number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they over-power them. And to ſpeak only of the Inhabitants of this Town, there are ſo many ſick and lame People in it, that you would admire to ſee ſo many lame and limping ones in the Streets; yet the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> cannot hold out the War at length, nor keep a War at a great Diſtance, for his Revenue is not ſo great as to make ſufficient Proviſion for his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pay them as well in time of Peace as of War: For his Subjects are freed from all Taxes and Impoſitions, according to their ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Cuſtoms. They never arm themſelves for a Defence, but when they are called together by their King, to defend and protect their Country, Houſe or Land, Wife and Children, againſt the Aſſault of an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>When I was thus enquiring from one or other, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to inform my ſelf and learn whether it were more commodious for us two, to go by Water to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutz,</hi> or by Land through <hi>Perſia</hi> into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and we thought of nothing elſe but to begin our Voyage daily to go further; I was call'd on a ſudden by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come away for <hi>Aleppo</hi> immediately, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me very much, and that the more when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that I was paſſed the Wilderneſs and come into the fruitful Eaſtern Countries, which would have been very well worth ſeeing. So after I had conſidered a while, I agreed with my Comerade, that he ſhould go on with the Voyage in hand, and that I (becauſe beſides the Letter, I had others no ſmaller Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances) would go back again. So I fitted him out for his Voyage with all Neceſſaries, ſo that two Days after he went with other Merchants into the Ship for <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſara.</hi> Not long after I had of him, a very mournful Meſſage or Account that the Ship (wherein he went from <hi>Balſara</hi> to <hi>Ormutz</hi>) was periſhed in a great Storm, near the Iſland <hi>Baccharis</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea (where
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48499:112"/>
they find good ſtore of Oriental Pearls) and that he and ſeveral other Merchants, and rich Merchants Sons from <hi>Aleppo</hi> were drowned. At the ſame time I might have returned back again with a great Caravan to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> but becauſe they took the ſtraighteſt way through great and ſandy Deſarts, which laſted for Fifty Days Journeys or thereabout, where we had but two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to pay Cuſtom in, where we could buy Proviſion, as Water and other Neceſſaries, I reſolved within my ſelf to go by more Fruitful Places, and Famous Towns (although I went about) where I might ſee and learn ſomething more; ſo I did ſtay in the great <hi>Camp</hi> longer until I met with ſome Companions. In the mean time, while I ſtayed there, I made my ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with an eminent Merchant, that lived in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> and had been ſeveral times in the <hi>Indies</hi>; who told me, that the Jeſuits had begun to ſet up a very ſevere Inquiſition in the <hi>Indies,</hi> chiefly in <hi>God,</hi> where they obſerved diligently, thoſe that did not take of their Hats to the Images (which were ſet up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Streets of the Town) that they might put them into Priſon, which he did very much diſlike, believing it to be very great Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>After he had ſaid this, he began to talk further to me concerning Religion, and chiefly of the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith; and made me immediately (when he began to be ſenſible that I was of the ſame) ſo fine a Confeſſion of his Chriſtian Faith, ſo plainly and with ſuch Grounds of Scripture, that I was aſtoniſhed, for I could never have believed, I could have met with the Fellow of him in theſe Countries. So he began to have a great Love for me, and deſired me to go along with him, and to ſtay with him in his Houſe, until I had an Opportunity to go further, or that I might make him a Companion in his Voyage into the <hi>Indies,</hi> that during thoſe Travels, he would ſhew me all Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he could; nay, be as careful of me, as if I were his own Son. And after he underſtood that I was a Phyſician, he proferred of his own accord to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> who was then ſick, and his very good Friend, to be his Phyſician. But I having
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48499:112"/>
underſtood before, that others that had done the ſame, had been but very ill rewarded for their Pains and Care they had taken, and chiefly by thoſe they did Cure; I would not undertake it, fearing I ſhould have the ſame meaſure, and inſtead of a Reward have my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty taken away from me, wherefore I thanked him for his Kindneſs. Had it not been for this, I ſhould have accepted of it, notwithſtanding that they have no Apothecaries Shops that are any thing provided, but I muſt have bought the Ingredients from one Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper or other, and ſo collected them from ſeveral places, for I could hardly find any thing by them, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome ſtrange ſort of Turpentine Nuts, whereof they have abundance, and they are as good, as <hi>Piſtachia</hi>'s, wherefore the Inhabitants keep them by them, and eat them as we eat ſmall Nuts in our Country. I have eaten ſeveral of them, and found them of a ſaltiſh taſte and of a drying quality. Theſe are called by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, Botn,</hi> and by the <hi>Perſians, Terbaick.</hi> I have chiefly ſeen two kinds of them, the greater and the leſs, and ſo the <hi>Arabians</hi> diſtinguiſh them into <hi>Botn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quibir</hi> and <hi>Sougier.</hi> The bigger is in ſhape pretty like unto the Piſtach Nut, only it is a little rounder and ſo ſhorter; the leſſer is with its hard ſhell of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Pea, and are ſhaped like unto an Hart, or the <hi>Dora,</hi> that is, the <hi>Indian-Hart.</hi> A great many of them grow in <hi>Agemia, Perſia, Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> &amp;c. and grow together in cluſters like Grapes as the <hi>Piſtachies</hi> do, or rather the Berries of our <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine-Trees,</hi> for which they ought to be taken; chiefly, becauſe the Trees wherein they grow, are in their long Leaves pretty like unto the <hi>Turpentine-Tree,</hi> whereby they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Piſtachia-Tree,</hi> which hath roundiſh ones. This being ſo, I take the little one for the <hi>Bell,</hi> and the great one for the <hi>Fael</hi> of <hi>Serapio, Avicen</hi> and <hi>Rhaſes,</hi> which (as Authors ſay) grow chiefly in the <hi>Indies:</hi> And this the rather, becauſe Authors attribute the ſame Virtue and Operation to them. So may according to this, chiefly the great Nuts <hi>Fael,</hi> be taken for the Fruit of the <hi>Indian Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine-Tree,</hi> whereof <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Fourth Book
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48499:113"/>
and Chapter Five, maketh mention, all which would be too tedious to be related here at large. Beſides theſe Nuts, the before-mentioned Authors (chiefly <hi>Serapio</hi> in his 251ſt. Chapter) makes ſtill mention of another ſort of Fruit, called by him <hi>Sel,</hi> and by <hi>Avicen, Scel,</hi> which are not in hard ſhells, but as I ſaw them, quite bare, of the bigneſs of a <hi>Piſtachia</hi>-Nut, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Kernel of our <hi>Wall-nut</hi>; they have a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bitteriſh taſte, and ſenſibly Sharp. I did find none of them in theſe Parts by the Shop-keepers, but had it only after that in the Monaſtery of the <hi>Minorites</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of one of their Order, who told me alſo that they did grow in theſe Countries. Of Coloquints, or white gourd Apples, ſtill known to the People by the old Name <hi>Handhal,</hi> there grow ſo many hereabout, that they ſend them to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and from thence into our Countries; and alſo the delicate round <hi>Cyperus</hi> Root, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Soëdt,</hi> whereof one may find great quantities growing in moſſy and wet Grounds. I did alſo find by the Shop-keepers, the white Seed of <hi>Machaleb,</hi> which are in hard ſhells, which are long and pointed, and covered without with a tender skin, like unto the <hi>Piſtachia</hi>-Nut. A great quantity of them are carried from thence into <hi>Syria,</hi> and uſed to perfume Soap-Balls. The Trees whereon they grow I did not ſee, yet, as I am informed, they grow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, but chiefly on the Mountains that are by the way to <hi>Perſia.</hi> They are ſtill to this Day by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as by <hi>Serapio,</hi> called <hi>Nahandt.</hi> But although there are ſeveral ſorts of them, yet they all boil them (after they have been ſteep'd for ſome hours in Water, to get off the thin ſhells, as we do with Almonds) in Milk or Wine into a Pap, and put Sugar or Honey to it, chiefly to the white ones to take away their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I found farther a ſtrange Gum in great pieces, ſomewhat like unto Frankincenſe, or <hi>Ammoniacum,</hi> which the Inhabitants chew all Day long inſtead of <hi>Maſtich,</hi> and they attribute the ſame Virtues to it. Wherefore great quantities thereof are brought thither (chiefly from <hi>Perſia</hi>) which they call <hi>Taxa,</hi> as I am informed from the Tree <hi>Tax,</hi> which are very like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48499:113"/>
                     <hi>Cypreſſes</hi> in ſhew and bigneſs, only their Roots are not ſo long, wherefore they are the eaſier over-turned by the Wind. According to this, I remember of the Trees <hi>Thuja,</hi> whereof <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> maketh mention in <hi>Book</hi> V. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and of <hi>Thya</hi> of <hi>Pliny.</hi> I alſo ſaw without the <hi>Batzers</hi> or Exchanges, very high and big <hi>Caper-Trees</hi>; and here and there in the Fields a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſort of Red-graſs, like unto that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſcription of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and hath ſtill retained his ancient <hi>Arabian</hi> Name <hi>Negil</hi> among the Inhabitants. This hath long fibrous and yellowiſh Roots, with many Joynts, and puts out by them year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeveral Buds, which grow into hard Leaves, which are long and pointed, and at each ſide very ſharp and cutting, like unto them of the Red-graſs; between them come out ſmall Stalks or Holms, each whereof hath a peculiar Ear at the top coming out of its Graſs-ſheath, which is long, thin, and its Seeds grow in two rows, between ſmall Leaves, like unto the wild <hi>Galen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> This doth not only grow hereabout, but alſo in ſeveral other Places and Provinces, where the Ground is ſandy, as <hi>Suſiana, Perſia,</hi> &amp;c. in great quantity, and becauſe it is by reaſon of its ſharpneſs and cutting, very pernicious to Beaſts, as to Bullocks, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that they die of it, therefore they have or keep the fewer of them, but inſtead thereof they keep Buffles (which can feed upon it eaſier than other Beaſts) to eat this Graſs, which maketh the Buffle very cheap in theſe Countries, for I have ſeen one buy three of them for eight Ducats (<hi>which is in our Money about</hi> 48 <hi>Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>) that was bigger than an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Bullock. Thus much I had to relate of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> its Situation, Trade, and ſtrange Plants, ſo much as I could find and ſee at that improper time.</p>
                  <p>Being that I expected daily Company to go with me to <hi>Aleppo</hi> again, by the way of ſeveral Towns, and not ſtraight through the ſandy Wilderneſſes, a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> that I got acquainted withal in the mean while did inform me, that the <hi>Sophi</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Unicorns at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> which he kept there; and alſo in two Iſlands <hi>Alc</hi> and <hi>Tylos,</hi> which lay from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48499:114"/>
                     <hi>Samarcand</hi> nine Days Journey, further towards the Eaſt, near <hi>Spaam,</hi> ſome <hi>Griffins</hi> (by them called <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>) which were ſent him out of <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>Preſter-John.</hi> They are a great deal bigger and higher, have a red coloured Head, a bearded Bill, and a Neck over-grown with Feathers, a thick Body, black Wings like unto an Eagle, and a long Tail like a Lion, and Feet like a Dragon, they are very eager for Fleſh; while they are yet young, the King taketh them along with him, and goeth often thither for Sport and Pleaſures ſake; but as they grow up and ſtrong, he hath them chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their Necks very ſtrongly. I did believe this the ſooner <note n="*" rend="inter">Too ſoon, for that there are no ſuch Creatures in the World as either <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> or <hi>Griffin,</hi> I am as ſure as I can be of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Nay, Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> hath well demonſtrated, that there cannot be ſuch a Creature as the common Pictures of him repreſent the <hi>Unicorn.</hi> I cannot again but wonder as the credulity of ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inquiſitive a Man as <hi>Rauwolff,</hi> in believing the idle Stories of ſuch a vain and lying Fellow.</note>, becauſe he could alſo tell me what Trees and Fruit grow there, and chiefly thoſe whereof <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> maketh mention, and out of him <hi>Pliny.</hi> He alſo gave me an Account beſides theſe of others that grow out of <hi>Perſia</hi> in ſeveral places, as of the Tree <hi>Palla,</hi> which <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> mention, which the Wiſe men did eat in the Eaſtern Countries, and of the <hi>Muſa</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former bear delicate ſweet-taſted, and very wholeſome Fruit, by them called <hi>Wac,</hi> which are round, reddiſh, and as big as the <hi>Indian</hi> Melons. But whether this be the noble Fruit <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> (whereof <hi>Cluſius</hi> maketh mention in his Hiſtory of <hi>Indian</hi> Plants, which for Goodneſs ſake is carried over Sea into <hi>Perſia</hi>) I leave to the learned to decide. But the <hi>Muſa</hi> (which is as aforeſaid, alſo common in <hi>Syria</hi>) beareth a great deal ſmaller Fruit, which is ſmooth, yellowiſh, and bended, almoſt like unto Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truls in ſhape. Theſe are alſo of a ſweetiſh taſte, and therefore the pleaſanter to eat; but are very unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſo that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, was forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his Souldiers to eat of them. The ſame <hi>Perſian,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48499:114"/>
did alſo inform me of the Poyſonous Fruit <hi>Perſea,</hi> which is ſtill known to them by the Name of <hi>Sepha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which they eſteem very little; and alſo the <hi>Peaches</hi> (called <hi>Het</hi>) which are not ſo poyſonous (as ſome ſay) as the above-mentioned; for they eſteem the Kernels thereof to be good, wholeſome Phyſick. But yet that they are not eſteemed by them, the chief Reaſon is, that they perſwade themſelves, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> (who was a great Magician or Necromancer) poyſoned them by his Black-Art, and that ſince that time, they could not be eaten; wherefore they have not been eſteemed ever ſince: This I thought convenient to mention, rather for the ſake of thoſe, that have a mind to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that if one or more of them ſhould go into theſe Countries, they might have occaſion to make a more accurate enquiry after theſe things.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen hindered in my Travels, for ſeveral weighty Reaſons, I was forced to go back again; I looked up my Goods, as I was adviſed by my good Friend, the Chriſtian, (whereof I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here before) and fitted my ſelf for my Journey. I got for my Companions three <hi>Jews,</hi> one whereof came down the <hi>Euphrates</hi> with me, the others came
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48499:115"/>
from <hi>Ormutz,</hi> (for I could get no others) to travel with me to <hi>Aleppo.</hi> We ſet out on the 16th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> of the 74th. Year, for <hi>Carcuch</hi> diſtant Six Days Journey, in the Confines of <hi>Media,</hi> on the other ſide of the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> which is ſtill called by them in their Language <hi>Hidekel.</hi> By the way we firſt ſaw ſome well-tilled Fields, and above us on the River <hi>Tigris</hi> ſome Villages, ſo that I could not but think I ſhould meet with a Country that had plenty of Corn, Muſt and Honey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it was commended by the the Arch-koob bearer of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared even with the Land of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but the further we went, the greater grew the Wilderneſſes, ſo that we were forced to lodge all Night in the Fields.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning there appeared a great way off more little Villages belonging to the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> But we went on through the Deſarts (and my Fellow Travellers told me that they extend themſelves to <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Media</hi>) where we loſt our way, and came in the Evening into a Bog which hindered us ſo much, that I (becauſe their Sabbath began, whereon according to their Laws they muſt not travel) was forced to ſtay there, with them, all Night long in it, and alſo the next Day, in great Showers of Rain, not without great Inconveniency and Trouble. During our ſtaying there I look'd about me for ſome Plants; but found none becauſe they did but firſt begin to ſprout, but in the moiſt Places ſome wild <hi>Galengal</hi> with great round Roots by the Inhabitants called <hi>Soedt,</hi> and by both <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> and <hi>Grecians, Cyperus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 19th Day, after we were, not without trouble, got out of the Mire, our way extended its ſelf ſtill further through deſolate Places and Deſarts. I thought of <hi>Julian</hi> that impious <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and of his Army, which when it went againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and was very numerous, over the River <hi>Tigris</hi> near to <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> he was by an Ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> that was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, decoyed into theſe Deſarts, where he was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and routed by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> In this great Fight when the Emperour himſelf was mortally wounded, he took up (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſay) a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48499:115"/>
of Blood and flung into the Air, yielded the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and ſaid, Then <hi>Galilean</hi> (ſo he called <hi>Chriſt</hi> in whom he at firſt believed, and afterwards denied and perſecuted) thou haſt beaten and conquered me. After we had lived for ſeveral Days very hardly in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, and ſpent our time in Miſery, we came on the 20th by <hi>Scherb</hi> a Village, over an Aſcent, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more fruitful and well tilled Country, ſituated on the Confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and for the moſt part inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by them, which we could conjecture by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Language. Now though travelling through the Confines, uſes commonly to be very dangerous, yet (I thank God) we met with none, ſo that we without any Stop or Hinderance, reached that Night, the 21ſt. of <hi>December,</hi> to <hi>Schilb,</hi> a curious Village, where we reſted all Night and refreſhed our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went on through large and fruitful Valleys, but I found nothing (for it was but juſt at the beginning of plowing time) that was worthy to be mentioned, for the Plants did but juſt begin to ſprout; we had by the way ſeveral Villages, and ſo we had better opportunity to buy Proviſion. The Three and Twentieth at Night we came to one where we could buy near one hundred Eggs for Two pence.</p>
                  <p>The next Day we got up early again, and ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the high Mountain <hi>Tauri</hi> all covered with Snow (which extendeth its ſelf a great way from North and Weſt to the Eaſtward) at a great Diſtance. We went on apace, and advanced to <hi>Tauk</hi> early in good time, and before their Sabbath began again. This Town is not very ſtrong and lieth on a Plain. We went into a <hi>Camp</hi> without it, and reſted there all the Sabbath. After Sun-ſet, when it began to grow dark, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of me to light a Candle. I remembred then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that they could not do it themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by Law, as you may find in the 35th Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where you may ſee that they muſt kindle no Fire in any of their Habitations, wherefore they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves the Day before with all ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Neceſſaries, that they may not need to do any Labour on the Sabbath, and yet may not want.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48499:116"/>
When theſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſay their Prayers, they uſe the ſame Ceremonies as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Parts do: For firſt they lift up their Hands, then they bow down forwards with their whole Body, and at laſt they kneel down and kiſs the Ground. Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> bragg'd continually of their Patriarchs, and made mention of the Laws; but of the Ten Commandments they knew nothing, wherefore I took an Occaſion to repeat them before them in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language (which is very much ſpoke in the <hi>Indies</hi>) as well as I could, and they did admire when they heard them, how I came to know them. But when I began to ſpeak of Chriſt and his Office, they burſted out into ſuch Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, that I was glad to ſay no more, but hold my Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Not far off from <hi>Tauk,</hi> we ſaw a very ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, near unto a Wood, that is guarded by a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon: This is ſituated in the Province of the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which beginneth there, and lieth between <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> all along the River <hi>Tigris</hi> and reacheth to <hi>Armenia.</hi> Theſe <hi>Curters,</hi> which are almoſt all <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> ſpeak a peculiar Language, which was unknown to my Fellow Travellers, wherefore they could not ſpeak to them in the <hi>Perſian</hi> nor <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, which is ſpoke all along from <hi>Bagdet</hi> through <hi>Aſſyria</hi> (in the Confines of two potent Monarchs) to that place. We were therefore forced to deſire others that underſtood both Languages, to be our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through the Country of the <hi>Curters.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Language did run upon that of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Medians</hi> or no, I could not certainly learn; but yet I was informed that the <hi>Parthians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> as peculiar Nations, had their peculiar Languages, as Hiſtories tell us, and we may alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſee in the Acts of the Apoſtles the 2d Chapter and the 8th Verſe, where it is thus written: <hi>And how hear we every Man in our own Tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites and the Dwellers in Meſopotamia,</hi> &amp;c. all which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple almoſt are Subject unto the <hi>Sophi,</hi> the mighty King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The before mentioned <hi>Curters</hi> were formerly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48499:116"/>
called <hi>Carduchi,</hi> and afterwards alſo <hi>Cardueni</hi> (as chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Xenophon</hi> teſtifieth) have had their peculiar Policy and Government. But after many Changes and Wars, they are at length ſubdued and brought under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, to whom they are ſtill ſubject to this Day, and he hath every where his Garriſons in oppoſition to the <hi>Sophi.</hi> But what is further to be ſaid of them, chiefly concerning their Religion, ſhall be hereafter mentioned, when I ſhall give you an account among other Chriſtians, of thoſe that live in the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvaria</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Sabbath of the <hi>Jews,</hi> my Companions, was over, we went on again, and came the 26th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> to <hi>Carcuck,</hi> a glorious fine City lying in a Plain, in a very fertile Country; at four Miles diſtance, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that lieth on an aſcent, whither we alſo travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, my Companions having Buſineſs in both of them, and ſo we ſpent two Days in them, before we were ready to go on again.</p>
                  <p>The 29th. we travelled through large and dry Heaths, and came at Night to ſome Tents, which were made of Hair or Hair-cloth, wrought out of Goats and Aſſes Hair, and fixed in ſuch an Order, that they made Streets and Allies like unto a Market-Town. In one of theſe we went to lodge with theſe poor People (that are white <hi>Moors,</hi> and like unto the <hi>Gypſuns</hi> in their ſhape and figure) and to ſtay there all night long. But whether theſe People are ſubject to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, or to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or any other, I could not find out by their Cloths, becauſe they all wear the ſame hereabout, nor could I diſcern any thing by their Language. To us came a little after ſome more Travellers, ſo that we had hardly room to lie down in. Theſe People were very diligent and buſy to get us ſome Meat and Drink, for the Husband went ſoon out of Doors to gather dry Boughs and Stalks of Herbs (which I could not at that time diſcern what they were) and brought them to us to boil or dreſs ſome Meat with them. The Woman was not idle neither, but brought us Milk and Eggs to eat, ſo that we wanted for nothing; ſhe made alſo ſome Dough for Cakes (which were about a Finger
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48499:117"/>
thick, and about the bigneſs of a Trencher, as is uſual to do in the Wilderneſſes, and ſometimes in Towns alſo) ſhe laid them on hot Stones, and kept them a turning, and at length ſhe flung the Aſhes and Embers over them, and ſo baked them thoroughly. They were very good to eat, and very ſavory. This way of baking Cakes is not new, but hath been very uſual among the ancients, ſo we find in Scripture mention made of Bread baked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Aſhes; the <hi>Romans</hi> called it, <hi>Panes Subcineri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tios</hi>; and ſo we read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 18th. Chapter, of Cakes made upon the Hearth, which <hi>Sarah</hi> made in haſte when the three Men came to ſee <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 30th. we went from thence, and about Noon we came to a Town called <hi>Preſta,</hi> which is chiefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River whereon it lieth, very well fortified, but what the Inhabitants call that River, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, but according to its Situation it muſt be that which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calleth <hi>Gorgus,</hi> which runs below into the <hi>Tiger.</hi> In this place they make Floats, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not very big, nor have much Wood in them, yet they have abundance of Bucks and Goats Skins blown up, hung or fixt underneath the bottom, without doubt, by reaſon that they may load the more upon them, and alſo becauſe the River is rapid, that they may have the leſs fear or danger. On theſe Floats they carry ſeveral ſorts of Merchandices, but chiefly Fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Figs, Almonds, Cibebs, Nuts, Corn, Wine, Soap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a great part whereof goeth further into the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Day of <hi>December</hi> we travelled on, and came through well tilled Fields about Night into the Town <hi>Harpel,</hi> which is pretty large, but very pitifully built, and miſerably ſurrounded with Walls, ſo that it might eaſily be taken without any great Strength or Loſs; there we reſted again the next Day being the Sabbath (and on the ſame Day fell <hi>New-Years-Day.</hi>) In the mean time I underſtood that the <hi>Turkiſh Sangiack</hi> did a few Days ago condemn and put to execution eight great Malefactors, which made it their Buſineſs to Rob and to commit Murder up and down on the High-way, (for there are a great many of theſe Rogues in this Province)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48499:117"/>
chiefly on the borders of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which are very Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, which maketh travelling very dangerous. The Relations and Friends of theſe Murderers and Robbers did take this very ill, that the <hi>Sangiack</hi> ſhould execute them, and were reſolved to be revenged of him one way or other. In order thereunto they combined and agreed all together, and had every thing ready, and only ſtaid for the word to fall upon him, which would have been done accordingly, if he had not had good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of this their Intention, wherefore he went away <hi>incognito</hi> for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to complain to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour of this their unjuſt Proceedings, and what they muſt expect for this, they will know in a ſhort time. This <hi>Sangiack,</hi> when he found neceſſity of making his eſcape, and found that he wanted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (which is very ſeldom) he took up from an <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Merchant (that was very rich, and was arrived there to buy ſeveral Merchandices, chiefly Gauls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of grow many in theſe Parts) 300 Duckets, which put the Merchant into great danger: for when theſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People came to underſtand it, they took it very ill of him, and threatned him very much, ſo that he was forced to ſtay ſome Days longer for more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that ſo he might go the ſafer.</p>
                  <p>After we had joined him, we went from thence on the 5th. of <hi>January</hi> in a very handſome Number, for the Merchant alone had about Fifty Camels and Aſſes, which were only loaden with Gauls, with him, to carry to <hi>Carahemit</hi> (where he lived) and to ſend from thence to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where they are bought by our Merchants, to be ſent into our Country. So we travelled all Day long and alſo half the Night, without eating or drinking, very faſt, and began to reſt about Midnight. After we had for the remaining part of the Night hardly refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Beaſts and our ſelves with eating and drinking a little, we broke up again before Day-light, to go on in our way. When we were gone a good way through fruitful and pleaſant Vallies, we came betimes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther River by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Caprus,</hi> which although it is not very broad, yet it is very deep, ſo that we had much to do to get through, which I found not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48499:118"/>
without a great detriment to my Plants, which I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on Horſe-back before me.</p>
                  <p>Soon after Noon a great way off before us, appeared a great Market-Town, <hi>Carcuſchey,</hi> where we arrived by Night, and fixed our Camp without and pretty near to it. This is quite inhabited by <hi>Armenians,</hi> which we could preſently find by the alteration of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and their Habit. They received us very willingly, and let us want for nothing. After we had ſtaid with them till Night, and refreſhed our ſelves and our Beaſts, we broke up again immediately and travelled all Night, which was ſo dark, that we heard ſeveral Caravans that met us, but we could not ſee them, much leſs know how ſtrong they were, or from whence they came. At break of Day we came to another much larger Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Kling</hi> (if I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take) and by <hi>Ptolomy, Licus,</hi> which hindered us very much in our Day's Journey; for the River being very broad, at leaſt a long Mile, it was very hard to hit exactly the right Ford, and not without great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which the <hi>Curters</hi> knew very well, ſo that we were alſo in great fear of them. But after ſome were found in our Company that had often forded that River formerly, we ventured it, went in, and got over (thanks be to God) very ſafe, only one Aſs which went over below us, where the Stream went ſtronger, was drowned, ſo that we arrived very early on the 7th. of <hi>January</hi> to the <hi>Tigris</hi> again, and went into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City <hi>Moſſel,</hi> that lieth on this ſide of the River, over a Bridge made of Boats. This is ſituated in the Country of the <hi>Curters,</hi> and ſo we were forced ſtill to keep our Interpreter. It belongeth to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as all the reſt hereabout. There are ſome very good Buildings and Streets in it, and it is pretty large; but very ill provided with Walls and Ditches, as I did obſerve from the top of our Camp which extended to it. Beſides this, I alſo ſaw juſt without the Town a little Hill, that was almoſt quite dug through, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by poor People, where I ſaw them ſeveral times creep in and out as Piſmires do in Ant-hills. In this place and thereabout, ſtood formerly the Potent Town
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48499:118"/>
of <hi>Nineve</hi> (built by <hi>Aſhur</hi>) which was the Metropolis of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> under the Monarch of the firſt Monarchy, to the time of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and his Sons, and was about three Days Journey in length. So we read that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jonas,</hi> when at the Command of God, he preached Repentance to them, did go into it one Day's Journey, which the People did hearken willingly unto, and did amend their Lives, but they did not long remain peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but turned to their former Iniquity again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Deſtruction and Ruine, was prognoſticated to them by the Prophets <hi>Nahum</hi> and <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> and alſo by the pious <hi>Tobias,</hi> that did live there again, which did alſo not long after follow. Yet was it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built again afterwards, and did ſuffer very much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changes of Governments, until at length <hi>Tamerlan</hi> came and took it by Storm, burnt it, and reduced it into Aſhes to that degree, that afterwards in the ſame place grew Beans and <hi>Colocaſia, &amp;c.</hi> So that at this time there is nothing of any Antiquities to be ſeen as in Old <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſave only the Fort that lieth upon the Hill, and ſome few Villages, which as the Inhabitants ſay, did alſo belong to it in former Days. This Town lieth on the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in a large Plain, where they ſow the greateſt part of their Corn, on the other ſide of the River; for on this ſide in <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> it is ſo ſandy and dry, that you would think you were in the middle of the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Yet there is a very large Depoſition of Merchandices, becauſe of the River, wherefore ſeveral Goods and Fruits, are brought thither from the adjacent Countries, both by Land and Water, to Ship them for <hi>Bagdet.</hi> Among the reſt I ſaw abundance of ſmall and great <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>-Nuts, by the Inhabitants called (as above-ſaid) <hi>Bont-quiber</hi> and <hi>Sougier</hi>; and alſo another ſort of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> as big as a double Fiſt, which is very common here, and is brought from <hi>Armenia,</hi> as they told me. It is of a brown colour, a great deal bigger and firmer, and not ſo ſweet as that of <hi>Calabria,</hi> yet very good and pleaſant to eat. Within it are ſeveral red Grains, ſo ſmall that one taketh no notice of them when one eats it. It looſeneth the Body very well, but not ſo much
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48499:119"/>
as ours, wherefore the Inhabitants eat great pieces thereof in the Morning, as the Country-men on the Mountains of <hi>Algaw</hi> eat Cheeſe. But whether the <hi>Arabians</hi> make mention thereof, if it be not the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Alhagiezi,</hi> whereof <hi>Avicen</hi> in his Second Book the Second Treatiſe, and the 758th. Chapter maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I know not neither what it is to be reputed. The Town <hi>Moſſel</hi> is as above-ſaid, for the greateſt part inhabited by <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> which pretend to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but in reality they are worſe than any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever, for they do almoſt nothing elſe, but rob on the High-ways, and fall upon Travellers and kill them: Therefore being that the Roads chiefly to <hi>Zibin</hi> (to which we had Five Days Journey, and for the moſt part through ſandy Wilderneſſes) are very dangerous, we ſtaid ſome Days longer expecting more Company that we might go the ſurer.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter our Journey had been deferred for four Days, we broke up on the 11th. of <hi>January</hi> ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtrong, and went on for the whole Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating, with all ſpeed until the Sun ſet at Night, when we encamped on an aſcent near a ſmall Village, to keep our Beaſts and Goods ſafe, and to refreſh our ſelves and them. We watched all Night long, and went continually three and three together, round about our Camp by turns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48499:119"/>The next Day we proceeded on again in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with all ſpeed, rather for a good Fountain or Spring's ſake, (as they do in theſe Countries, in the vaſt Deſarts) than to reach a good Inn, where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived late at Night, and encamped near it, to ſtay all Night to reſt. A little after when we were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſome of the <hi>Curters</hi> came to us into our Camp, ſpoke to us kindly, and asked us whether we did want any thing that they could help us to, but we ſoon perceived them to be Spies, that were ſent by their Companions, to ſee what Strength we were of. But when they perceived that we were not pleaſed with them, they did not ſtay but went away, and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed our ſelves to reſt, but kept a good Guard as we had done the Night before. About Midnight when we were in our firſt Sleep, our Watch-men perceived a great Number of the <hi>Curters</hi> to approach, wherefore they awaked us with a great ſhouting to alarm us the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to bring us into good Order, and to frighten our Enemies and to drive them away. But they did not only not mind us, but made all haſte they could up to us, and that ſo near, that we could ſee them, although it was dark, before our Camp, by their Heads. But when they found us in a good Order and Condition to oppoſe them, and did hear that our Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Archers (which were ready to let fly at them) called with a loud Voice to them, <hi>tahal, tahal Harami,</hi> that is, Come hither, come hither you Thiefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they halted for a little while, and were ſo afraid of us, that they turned their Backs and run away. Afterwards when we feared nor expected their Aſſaults any more, they came quickly again a ſecond time, in a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Number than before. They led before them one Camel, and ſeveral Horſes (which in the dark we could only diſcern by their Heads looking againſt the Sky) in their Hands, without doubt, that we might look upon them to be Travellers, or elſe that we might not be able to diſcern their Number. But notwithſtanding all this their firſt Aſſault was ſtill in freſh Memory, wherefore we did not tarry, but drew ſoon up in our former Order again (wherein I was the left-hand Man
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48499:120"/>
in the firſt Rank again, with my Scymeter drawn, and had before armed my Breaſt with ſeveral ſheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that I had brought with me to dry my Plants in) expecting their aſſault every Moment. But when they made a halt again, (fearing their Skin as much as we did ours) and did neither ſhout nor move up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, one of ours provok'd them, and did ſhoot at the Camel, and did hit it ſo that it gave a Sign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but the reſt forbore to fire. So they Staid a little while, and then went off a Second time.</p>
                  <p>So we kept awake all the Reſt of the Night, and kept a good Watch, and went on our Journey again early the next Morning about break of the Day; and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to wide and dry Heaths, where we ſaw neither Men nor Beaſts, and ſo we went on till Noon, where we encamped in a large Place, which was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Walls and Ditches pretty well, juſt like unto a Fortreſs, whereof there are ſeveral in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Places to be ſeen. When we ſtayed there, two <hi>Curters</hi> came again to us into our Camp, and ſpoke to us, pretending that they came to demand the Toll that was due there, it being their Place: but our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſoon perceived, that they were not in a right Cauſe, wherefore they would allow them nothing, which put theſe two into ſuch a Paſſion, that they drew their Swords, and would have at us; but our Friends did not ſtay idle neither, but took their ſwords away, and laid on with dry Blows at them, and ſo flung them out of our Camp. After this Hubbub was over, we dined, and that the rather that we might not be too much weakned by our hard travelling, and ſo be the leſs able to reſiſt theſe Robbers, for want of Strength if they ſhould fall upon us, which we were not wont to do before Night, chiefly in great Deſarts, for there we uſed to get up preſently after Mid night, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel all Day long with all Speed, without eating, which I had often experimented before; wherefore I uſed to provide my ſelf always with Bread, and when I had a mind to eat it, I did either ſtay behind or go before: for no body eats openly by the way in the ſight of others, except he has a mind to run a Hazard, becauſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48499:120"/>
that moſt of them are very hungry, and ſo eager at it, that they will aſſault one another for it, and take it away from their very Mouths. After we had refreſhed our ſelves, and fed our Beaſts (which uſeth to be done alſo but once aday) we broke up with our Caravan, and went on again. We quickly ſaw ſome Mountains before us, where, when we approached them towards the Evening, there appeared ſometimes, on a high one that before the reſt lieth nearer to the Plain, ſome of them, ſo that we might very well preſume, that there was more of them behind in <hi>Ambuſcado,</hi> which alſo proved very true: For no ſooner were we paſs'd it, but before we went up the Hill, they came out from behind the Mountain, in great Troops on Horſe-back, which immediately drew up into order in the Fields, in Two Squadrons, Three and Three in a Rank, to the Number of about 300, almoſt as many as we were. They exerciſed their Horſes (which were very lank) very ſwiftly, turn'd ſometimes on one, and then on the other hand, and came at length to us within a Bows Shoot. They had moſt of them Darts, which they plaid withal in their full Speed, ſometimes holding it down-wards as if they would run through a Deer, which was a pleaſant but very dangerous Sight to us. When they ſhewed themſelves ſo as if they would fall upon us inſtantly, we drew our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan cloſe together, in order to reſiſt them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtood ſtill, and tied our Beaſts together and bound the Fore foot of each of them, that they could not ſtir: behind them ſtood our <hi>Mockeri,</hi> with their Bows and all thoſe that were not well provided with Arms, and Horſes, either to ſhoot at the Enemy, or elſe in Caſe of Neceſſity, if they ſhould come too near us, to ſally out, and cut off their Horſes with our Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters. Near unto us our Horſes were drawn up into a Troop, ready for their Aſſault, to venture their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. After a whole Hour's delay we ſent at length two of our Company to them, and they ſent alſo Two of theirs to meet them to parley together: But which way they made up an Agreement I know not, but they prevailed ſo much with them, that ſoon after they left
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48499:121"/>
us, and rode away, and we went on in our Journey. After this we kept our Caravan (that is ſo much to ſay as a great many People, with loaden Camels, Aſſes, and Horſes) in far better Order than we had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and came that ſame Day a good Way, to a ſmall Village, where we encamped and ſtayed all Night. We found no Wood thereabout, wherefore we made ſhift with Bread, inſtead of other Victuals, and were very glad we had it. In the mean time the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants came to us, to gather the Dung of our Beaſts (as they do in ſeveral other Places, chiefly in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>) to burn it inſtead of Wood, which they do after the following Manner.</p>
                  <p>They make in their Tents or Houſes a Hole about a Foot and half deep, wherein they put their earthen Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins or Pots, with the Meat in them cloſed up, ſo that they are in the half above the middle, Three Fourth Parts thereof they lay about with Stones, and the Fourth Part is left open, through which they fling in their dried Dung (and alſo ſometimes ſmall Twigs and Straws, when they can have them) which burn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and give ſo great a Heat, that the Pot groweth ſo hot as if it ſtood in the middle of a lighted Coal-heap, ſo that they boil their Meat with a little Fire quicker than we do ours with a great one on our Hearths; ſo that theſe poor People, muſt make very hard Shift, and do ſometimes as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they alſo in their greateſt Neceſſity did boil their Meat with Dung of Men and Beaſts, as you may read in the 4th Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> This Night and ſeveral others before, we paſſed more with watching than with ſleeping, ſo that ſometimes we contemplated the Conſtellations of the Skies, which are very much obſerved by theſe Nations, but chiefly by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which lodge always in the open Air and have no Shelter, ſo that by the Stars they know the Hour of the Night, and when it is time for them to break up. They care not for Beds, but rather have Cloaks or Tapeſtry wherein they wrap themſelves up and keep themſelves warm, ſo that no Froſt, nor Rain, nor Dew can hurt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:48499:121"/>The next Morning we broke up (that we might not expoſe our ſelves any further) only after Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and travelled all Day long without any Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Hinderance a long way after ſeveral rough Mountains: and alſo the next Day through ſandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, which were deep and hindred our going on very much. When it began to be Night, our Beaſts were almoſt ready to lie down under their Burthens in the Sand, which was very tireſome to us, and that the rather, becauſe we ſaw the Town <hi>Zibin</hi> far off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, at Four Miles diſtance, but at length we got out of this bad Road, into green Meadows, to very clear Springs, which run over in ſeveral Places to water them: So that we began to make more ſpeed, and came the ſame Night yet very late into the Town. It is a fine Place ſubject unto the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour, not very big, lying on Aſcent, very well ſurrounded and fortified with Walls and Ditches. It is full of Conduits or Springs, but chiefly in the great <hi>Camp,</hi> where we reſted for five Days to ſtay for more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. There live Abundance of <hi>Armenians</hi> in it, for it lieth in the Confines of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſo we were no more in ſo great danger as we were in the Country of the <hi>Curters.</hi> During my ſtaying there, the abovementioned rich <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant, and alſo an eminent <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gentleman (which were very kind to me upon the Road) deſired me ſeveral times (having heard from the <hi>Jews</hi> that I was a Phyſician) that I would be pleaſed to go along with them to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahemit,</hi> which Town was Four Days diſtant at the other ſide of the <hi>Tigris</hi>) to cure ſome of their Relations that were not well, they proffered me good Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to recommend me to the young <hi>Baſhaw</hi> Son of <hi>Mahomet Baſhaw</hi> (which was alſo ſick at that time) and to bring me into good Buſineſs; which I would have done with all my Heart, and nothing could have pleaſed me better, than to have ſerved the <hi>Armenian</hi> for his Kindneſs. Yet becauſe I was ſent for to come to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and could not but be as good as my Word, wherein I had alſo no ſmall Intereſt, I was obliged to leave that Journey, and to ſtrive with all Speed and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48499:122"/>
Diligence to get thither. Now as this <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is among the reſt (except the <hi>Viſir-Baſhaws,</hi> whereof there are four or five, which are always at Court about the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Emperour, as being his Privy Council) the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in <hi>Turky,</hi> ſo he hath larger and more fruitful Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories than he of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> or any other, to govern, viz. <hi>Aſſyria, Meſopotamia,</hi> and a large part of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of the Province of the <hi>Curters, &amp;c.</hi> all which border upon the Dominions of the <hi>Sophi</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had refreſhed our ſelves during this time, very well, and other Companies had joined us, we broke up on the 20th. towards Night, and went away. By the way we ſaw ſeveral plough'd Fields and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and we could ſpeak better with the People, for they underſtood the <hi>Armenian, Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, which are generally uſed in theſe Countries. So our Travels went on with great ſpeed, ſo that we reached on the 21ſt. late, the Town of <hi>Hochan,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> reſted and kept their Sabbath. Here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the News that <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour was Deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>The 23d. we got up early again, and went the next way to <hi>Orpha,</hi> another Town, to which we had Five Days Journey. From thence the nearer we came to the Mount <hi>Tauri</hi> (which ſeparateth <hi>Armenia</hi> from <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> towards the South) the worſe grew the Roads, which we found very ſufficiently the next Day, for when we came further into the Mountains, the ways were ſo full of Stones that we were hindered very much. Going thus on, after it had ſnowed a little (which I have never ſeen but twice in theſe Countries) it happened, that one of the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Horſes which was empty was frightened at ſomething, and flung it ſelf over and over. The <hi>Jew</hi> hearing this noiſe, looked back, and ſeeing me ſtand by it, he grew angry with me, as if I had done it, and began to handle his Bow and Arrows to ſhoot at me, when I found him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and remembred how I loſt my Wine in the Ship, when we went down the River, I did not delay, but went to hinder him, took him by his Leg and flung
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48499:122"/>
him off his Horſe, before he could take his aim at me; ſo we fell a boxing one another ſo long, until at length I tripped up his Heels. When the other two ſaw that we ſpoiled thus the Figure of the Snow, and that I was too hard for him, and had given him ſeveral hard blows, they came immediately to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us, and to make Peace again between us; I ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they did not come to wrong me, and alſo conſidering that we were to Travel together ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, took their Counſel, and was friends with him again, and ſo we went on in our way. At Night we came to another Village again, in a narrow Valley ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the bottom of a great aſcent, near which we found a great Stable wherein we went, this was quite cut into the Hill, and ſo was that wherein we lodged the Night before, ſo that you could ſee nothing of it, but only the entrance, for they are commonly ſo in theſe hilly Countries under Ground, that the Caravans may ſafely reſt there and defend themſelves from Cold in the Winter. This Stable (being 25 Paces long and 20 broad, and all through equally high) was cut out of a Rock. About midnight, when we were in our firſt Sleep, one of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Chiaus,</hi> or Chamber-Meſſengers, knocked at the door of the Stable, who was come back from <hi>Bagdet</hi> in Six Days to this place, to look about for ſome freſh Horſes (becauſe he had tired his own, and could not have others by the way, as in our Country where Poſts are ordered.) So he went in, took away from one Mockeri or Carrier, three Pack-Horſes, and two more from the <hi>Jew</hi> (that I had had Contention with before) for theſe Meſſengers of the Chamber have great Privileges, and in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, where-ever they ſee Horſes in City or Country, they may take them leaving theirs in the room thereof: They value one no more than another, except Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Strangers, which they excuſe before others, to encourage Trade; thoſe that they come to, muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up their Horſes, without any reluctancy, except they have a mind to be ſoundly bang'd (as one of our Friends was that did not open the Gates immediately) or elſe to fare worſe. When this <hi>Chiaus</hi> believed he had got
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48499:123"/>
very good Horſes, he ſoon found his miſtake, for the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Horſes had galled Backs, wherefore he let him have them again for a ſmall recompence, which was a Child's Coat made of delicate <hi>Indian</hi> Stuff. When our Journey was thus ſtopt, chiefly becauſe of the Mockeri or Carrier, until he could procure himſelf other Horſes in the room thereof, at leaſt for that Day, we roſe the earlier the next Day, and traverſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rough Mountains, and went through narrow Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that Day, until at Night we came to a Village in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by <hi>Armenians.</hi> Theſe are good-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which have great Compaſſion on their Fellow-Chriſtians, and love to entertain and to be kind to Strangers, which I have very often experienced, but chiefly in this Village, where one of the <hi>Armenians</hi> took me and the <hi>Jews</hi> into his Houſe, and would fain have kept us alſo the next Day. Being at leiſure, I would fain have conferred and diſcourſed with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Chriſtian Faith, and ſo was he willing, but being that we could not underſtand one another, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were in this caſe by no means proper Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, we were forced to have patience by ſilence, and to look at one another. About that time they kept Lent, which I could perceive by their ſmall ſort of Diet (for they did eat nothing but leguminous Food and Bread and Water.) After he had ſet before us ſome boiled Eggs at Night, and I being hungry fell on them, not imagining that they kept ſuch ſtrictneſs and difference in their Diet, he admired that I did not refuſe to eat the Eggs, and asked me by one of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether I did not know that it was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chiſtians to eat Eggs and the like Victuals in Lent; at this I would fain have anſwered him (that it became Chriſtians to keep Lent rather with Soberneſs and Abſtinency, than with Diſtinctions and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Foods.) But I not underſtanding the Language, only anſwered him briefly, that our Lent was not yet begun, nor would until three Weeks hence begin, which did content him preſently.</p>
                  <p>The 28th. we went on our Journey again, and came right among the high Mountains, which were very
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48499:123"/>
rough, and full of Buſhes; we got out of them before Night, and lodged our ſelves in the next Village, which lieth on an aſcent in the Plain, where we alſo ſtayed the next Day being the Sabbath. By the way, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were in fear of having their Horſes taken away, as was done ſome Days before, they often gave them to me to lead them, as if they were mine, hoping to carry them off the eaſier, ſo that although they were my Guides, yet I was their Safeguard.</p>
                  <p>After we had paſt the great and rough Mountains, and were come into a very fruitful Valley, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf for a ſmall Day's Journey to <hi>Orpha,</hi> there appeared preſently on each ſide ſeveral Villages, and afterwards the Coſtly City againſt us with the Caſtle ſituated on the Hill, very pleaſantly. Into this we got on the 30th. at Night very early, and went to lodge in the large and very well built <hi>Camp,</hi> and ſtayed there for four Days. This Town is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, pretty big and with Fortifications well provided. It was formerly together with the whole Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but now it is as well as the greateſt part of the Country, brought under the ſubjection of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour. <hi>Orpha</hi> is a Town of very good Trade; they deal in Tapeſtry of ſeveral ſorts, ſome whereof are made there, and ſent out to us; there is alſo a great Depoſition of Merchandices, which are brought thither from <hi>Aleppo, Damaſcus, Conſtantinople,</hi> and other places, to go to <hi>Carahemit,</hi> Five Days Journey diſtant from hence, and ſo to be carried further into <hi>Media, Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> &amp;c. yet all theſe Goods are brought thither in Caravans by Land, becauſe there is no Navigable River belonging to it. Some ſay that this Town was anciently called <hi>Haran</hi> and <hi>Charras,</hi> from whence the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with his Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> and his Brother's Son <hi>Lot,</hi> according to the Command of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> Chap. 12. and went forth to go into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which the Lord had promiſed to give him, and there is a plentiful Well ſtill to this Day called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Well, where the Servant of <hi>Abraham</hi> (whom he ſent into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia</hi> to the Town of <hi>Nahor,</hi> to fetch a Wife for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48499:124"/>
his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> from his own Kindred) did firſt ſee <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> when ſhe gave him and his Camels ſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to drink out of this Well. And ſo did afterwards the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he fled from his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> at this ſame Well, make himſelf known to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Laban</hi> his Mother's Brother, when he removed the Stone from the head of the Well, and ſo let her Sheep drink. The Water of this Fountain hath a more whitiſh troubledneſs than others. I have drunk of it ſeveral times out of the Conduit, that runs from thence into the middle of the great <hi>Camp,</hi> and it hath a peculiar Pleaſantneſs and a pleaſant Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its taſte. To the ſame did alſo come the Son of the Pious <hi>Tobias,</hi> conducted by the Angel <hi>Raphael,</hi> whom his Father ſent to <hi>Rages</hi> (now called <hi>Edeſſa</hi>) as is above-mentioned, to call in a Debt from <hi>Gabel,</hi> as you may read in the 11th. Chapter of his Book, when they returned by the way of <hi>Haran,</hi> which is half way to <hi>Nineve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Jews</hi> had done their Buſineſs there with good Succeſs, we went on in our Travels again, and came again into the high and rough Mountains, where we ſpent alſo the next Day with great trouble and hardſhip, until we came again to the great River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> into the Town <hi>Bir,</hi> whereof I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before. And although we had no more but two half Days Journey to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> yet the <hi>Jews</hi> my Fellow-travellers had Buſineſs in the Famous Town <hi>Niſib,</hi> (which is ſituated on this ſide the River on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the leſſer <hi>Armenia</hi>) ſo that we were bound to go thither; ſo we put out again on the 6th. of <hi>February</hi> after their Sabbath, and went through very fruitful and well cultivated Corn-Fields, to <hi>Andeb,</hi> towards Evening. It is a pretty big Town, but not very ſtrong. It lieth on two ſmall Hills very pleaſantly, ſo that you may ſee it plainly and diſtinctly, as ſoon as you come from out of the Valley by the Lake into the Fields. Yet notwithſtanding that it is ſo pleaſantly ſituated and looketh ſo ſtately at a diſtance, it is but pitifully built when you come within it. In former Ages this Town hath been ſeveral times beſieged by the Kings of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48499:124"/>
                     <hi>Perſia,</hi> by whom it was taken at laſt, and kept ſo long, until the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Galienus Odenatus Palmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus,</hi> took it from King <hi>Sapor,</hi> together with the Town <hi>Orpha,</hi> and laid it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire again. But in theſe our Times, to our grief, it is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, together with all the Country, under the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Slavery. The Inhabitants have very little Trade, they live for the moſt part upon their Eſtates, by cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating their Grounds, and chiefly from the Fruits of Vineyards and Orchards, which are planted with Pomgranates and Figs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo thick, (that from the great quantity of Trees they may have the more Fruit) that you would at a diſtance, rather take them to be Woods of wild Trees, than of fruitful ones. So they ſend Yearly many ſorts of Fruits, but chiefly <hi>Cibebs</hi> into the Eaſtern Countries, by great Caravans, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have met many. After we had ſtaid here, and I had loſt a whole Day, for their Buſineſs ſake, we broke up again directly for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and having paſſed for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miles through rough, bad, hilly ways, we came at length into a plain, delicate and fruitful Country, ſo fruitful of Wine and Corn, that on all my Journey, I have ſeen none like unto it. This did almoſt extend it ſelf to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where we arrived early, with the help of the Almighty God, in very good health, on the 10th. Day of <hi>February.</hi> At my arrival, becauſe my Comrade <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft,</hi> with the reſt, were not there then preſent, preſently ſome <hi>French</hi> Merchants (which I had cured of ſeveral Diſtempers before my departure) came to me, and carried me home with them, deſiring me to live with them untill my Buſineſs (which cauſed me to come back) were done, wherein really they did me a very great Kindneſs. For I having very well torn my Cloaths (which never came from my Back in half a Years time) I had there an Opportunity to reſt my ſelf and to procure my ſelf ſome new ones. <hi>I thank the Almighty God, for his many Mercies and Favours beſtowed on me, and the Aſſiſtance he graciouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me in this Voyage, returning him Praiſe, Honour and Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Phyſicians and Apothecaries; Of my Comrade,</hi> Hans Ulrich Krafft <hi>of</hi> Ulm<hi>'s, hard Impriſonment.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AT my return to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where my Buſineſs obliged me to ſtay a while, I came to underſtand, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my abſence, ſeveral <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French-men,</hi> were in their Sickneſs but very ſlightly ſerved by the <hi>Jews</hi> their Phyſicians; wherefore I did not only ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my former Acquaintance and Practice by them, but might have alſo ſtept into great Buſineſs with the <hi>Turks,</hi> for I was preſently ſo well known, that I had much to do to excuſe my ſelf with Diſcretion to get off of them, that I might eſcape their Anger and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, which I muſt have got, if I had ſerved them never ſo faithfully, which I knew ſeveral had before me found by experience. Wherefore at the inſtance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good Friends, I only cured two great Perſons, whereof one was a <hi>Georgian,</hi> and at that time <hi>Sangiack</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which were very well pleaſed with me, and requited me accordingly. The Phyſicians general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe Parts, agree before hand for the Cure with their Patients, for a certainty, according to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Patient, and his Diſtemper, and have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their Money, but yet it is not paid to them, before the Patient is cured. They have a great many Phyſicians, but they are very unskilful, chiefly the <hi>Turks</hi> which know none but their own Language, and ſo cannot read the Authors of Phyſick that have writ in another Language, as the <hi>Jews</hi> can. But ſeeing that the <hi>Jews</hi> are very much addicted to Covetouſneſs, they
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48499:125"/>
endeavour rather to promote their own Intereſt, than that of their Patients; ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> are but ſlightly provided with Phyſicians, and therefore rather die like Flies, than take adviſe of their Phyſicians, chiefly of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are not contented with a ſmall Reward; to this add alſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> never put any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and eſteem their Counſel but little; and beſides, they believe that God hath already pre-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained every one his Death, ſo that he that is born to be drowned cannot be hanged. And beſides all this, the <hi>Jews</hi> do not ſtick cloſe to them in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but fly preſently, and firſt of all in time of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which certainly happens once in Seven Years, if not in Five or ſooner) juſt like Hirelings, as they have ſufficiently experienced in the laſt Plague in the Year 72, with the loſs of ſeveral Perſons of Worth and Quality; chiefly among the reſt a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pay-Maſter, by them called <hi>Daftedar,</hi> and another Eminent <hi>Turk,</hi> and their own Sons, which both of them (although this proferr'd to lay 3000 Duckets, and the other 10000, into the Hands of a third Perſon) yet were neglected and leſt by their Phyſicians and died. It is very much in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that if any body doth find himſelf not well, another puts his Arms croſs before him, and ſo graſpeth him about his Back, and lifteth him up, and ſets him down again, and ſhaketh him ſeveral times, juſt as they uſe to do Sacks with Corn, to make them lie the cloſer and to hold the more. As the Phyſicians are, ſo are alſo the Apothecaries, where you find nothing of any great Compoſitions, nor purging Electuaries, as <hi>Elect. Diacatholicon, Diaphoenicon,</hi> &amp;c. (although they have the beſt Ingredients thereof, for we have them all ſent from them) except they be ſent to them from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp;c. If you have occaſion for any Herbs, Roots or Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt go your ſelf, not without great trouble and loſing of time, and find them either in the Fields, or elſe at the Grocers and other Shop-keepers. Among the reſt of the things they had, I ſoon knew the <hi>Rob Ribes</hi> by its ancient Name and pleaſant ſouriſh Taſte, whereof they make a great quantity in this place, and ſend it further into other Countries, but chiefly to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48499:126"/>
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour; wherefore in the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week they had already gathered ſeveral Sacks full of the Stalks of the true <hi>Ribes</hi> of the <hi>Arabians</hi> (which are hairy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two Foot long, and of the thickneſs of an Inch, of a greeniſh colour, and underneath, as alſo <hi>Serapio</hi> mentioneth, reddiſh,) from the Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and brought it to the <hi>Cadi</hi> to make <hi>Rob</hi> of it for him. I ſaw them lie in his Court-yard, and ſeveral of them were given me to taſte, and to take away with me. What Herbs I found at my return elſe, becauſe there are but a few of them, therefore I have put them among the reſt here-above in a peculiar Chapter. I ſaw there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtrange Birds, and among others ſome of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate green and blue colour, which were about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Nut-crackers, by them called <hi>Sucuruck,</hi> and by others <hi>Alſecrach.</hi> I alſo found their <hi>Alhabari,</hi> which are not unlike our Peacocks, and almoſt as big, and could not fly much. Of four-footed Beaſts, I ſaw ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, and among them ſome Civet-Cats, which were brought thither in Caravans, from remote Parts and the <hi>Indies.</hi> In the <hi>Fundique</hi> of the <hi>Conſul</hi> of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> I ſaw a very ſharp ſighted one like unto a <hi>Lynx,</hi> exactly of the ſhape of a Cat, ſo that it was not eaſily diſtinguiſhed from it, ſave only in its bigneſs (for it is much higher and ſlimmer). This is a very wild and fierce Beaſts, ſo that his Keeper himſelf was afraid of it. It once got looſe, and got through the Yard below into an Apothecaries Shop, wherein he had juſt then put a great many Glaſſes that were ſent him from <hi>Venice,</hi> whereof it broke the greateſt part before it could be taken again. When I was there, a young <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> was carried through the Town to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> It came from the moſt Eaſtern Parts, and had killed above 20 Men before they could take it. They alſo lead daily ſome Lions about the Town in ſmall Chains, which have ſmall Bells before, that every body may take the ſooner Notice of them; they are ſo tame, that their Keepers ſometimes wraſtle with them in open Places, neither do they eaſily grow wild, except they ſhould ſee Sheep, then their Keepers have enough to do to keep them off, and to appeaſe them. Without in the Fields in high
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48499:126"/>
and buſhy Places, are ſometimes found Chamelions, which are ſomewhat bigger than our green Lizards, but a great deal leaner and higher upon their Legs; they walk very ſlowly and lazily, they live a great while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meat like the Serpents, and are a very ugly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If we put it upon a coloured red, yellow, or black Cloth, it hath by degrees changed its natural green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour into the ſame that the Cloth was of.</p>
                  <p>Having ended my Buſineſs I had, and in the mean time received a Letter from my Comrades that were at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> I parted from thence according to their deſire, and came on the 5th. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 75, to them in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli.</hi> After ſome Days arrived alſo with ſome Goods, one of their chiefeſt Carriers, which they call <hi>Mokeri,</hi> which ſwore to me by his Head, that is, he affirmed upon his Faith and Reputation, that the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> when he was departing from thence, had ſent his Bailiffs to my Lodgings to apprehend me, and to fling me into the publick <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gaol, becauſe they were very well aſſured, that when I was on the Hills (where they had ſeen me look for Plants) I had obſerved the Situation of the Town, and all the Country very diligently, that I might, when I ſhould have an opportunity, betray them to their Enemies, and ſhew them the beſt way to take it. But all this was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they might have an opportunity to take an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> on me, as the Merchants call it there in theſe Countries, that is to ſay, they would accuſe me falſly to make me puniſhable, that they might get a ſum of Money out of me. And the Carrier alſo really believed, for as much as he heard of them, that they would not have let me come off for leſs than 200 <hi>Saraffi</hi> or Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, one whereof maketh two of their Gilders. <hi>Thanks be to our Lord God, who hath delivered me from their unjuſt Accuſations and Contrivances, and brought me ſafe to this place.</hi> At my arrival at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> when I expected to live ſecurely and quietly, and thought that I was paſſed all danger, I fell notwithſtanding all this into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; for when my Comrades, and with them alſo <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft</hi> (yet without any tranſgreſſion) were flung into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gaol, by the Contrivances
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48499:127"/>
of ſome <hi>Turks,</hi> the ſame Rogues had alſo a mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſomething againſt me, to bring me in alſo. But the <hi>French</hi> Vice-Conſul, <hi>Andrew Bianchi,</hi> who was my very good Patron, took my Part, in ſo much that he did recover my Liberty by the <hi>Turks,</hi> in ſpite of my Accuſers and not only got me Licence to walk freely without moleſtation in and about the City where-ever I pleaſed, but did alſo procure me a free and ſafe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to my Comrades, to ſee them in Priſon as often as I pleaſed. Into the Priſon wherein they were kept, I muſt always go through three ſmall and low Doors, which the Keepers did always very freely and without any grumbling open unto me, to go in or out, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſtaid there all Night with them. I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in very great hopes that God Almighty would have ordered it ſo, that their Adverſaries might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them, ſo that I and my dear Friend whom I loved as my own Brother, <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft,</hi> might have been returned home again with Joy. But it pleaſed God to order it other ways, for the Differences grew the longer the more difficult, and were ſo long produced, that this Young Gentleman, particularly <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich,</hi> was kept there in this hard Impriſonment very near three Years. To tell all that he ſuffered and endured there, would be too long here; only this I cannot omit to tell you, that he did endure and conquer all theſe Troubles and Adverſities (as I did ſee my ſelf) with ſuch a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Patience and good Conduct, that notwithſtanding all theſe (although he was almoſt left quite Comfortleſs) he was rather fit to comfort others than to be comforted. When I went thus in and out to them, I obſerved very well that the <hi>Turks</hi> have very great Compaſſion on poor diſtreſſed Priſoners, and are very free to give them Alms, and a Man uſed to come in daily with Bread or boiled Meat, as Rice, and other ſorts of boiled Corn, chiefly on Feaſt-Days after the Afternoons Lecture was over, and when he diſtributed them, he did alſo always as he went by, fling in for each of them a little Loaf (very like unto them they Bake in Lent in our Country) into their Apartment before them upon the Ground, wherewith they muſt make ſhift, except they could live
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48499:127"/>
of their own means, or get ſomething by their Hand-labour (whereof there was a good many that did) to maintain themſelves. Theſe Alms the <hi>Turks</hi> give ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freely, without being ask'd for it, for they believe that God is better pleaſed with that which they give freely, than that which is begged of them. Wherefore they have very few or no Beggars in their Towns, which beg Alms as they do in our Country. During my ſtay at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> I did at the requeſt of the Conſul, live in his <hi>Fundique,</hi> who entertained me very honourably, that I might give Attendance, and if any of the Merchants or Sea-men, ſhould happen to be ſick, I might uſe my beſt endeavour to cure them. So I did in the ſpace of three Months, cure, only in our <hi>Fundique,</hi> above Forty Men of all ſorts of Diſtempers, <hi>viz.</hi> malignant Fevers, violent Gripings of the Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which generally befell them that were lately arrived, and were not yet acquainted with the Air and Diet of the Country. There happened in theſe Days, a miſerable cruel Caſe, that ſome (among whom were Five <hi>Italians</hi> and One <hi>French-man</hi>) did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> which made themſelves ſoon ready to go from thence further to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> with their Merchandices to ſell there. Upon the Road they left their Caravan too far behind them, and met with ſome Horſe-men, which ſpoke to them, and deſired them that they would halt at the Command of their Maſter the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw,</hi> and diſmount, and go into the next <hi>Camp</hi> (which I found very deſolate and ruined when I went by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) to ſtay there until he came to them, which would not be long, for he had ſomething to ſay to them; the Merchants obeyed them readily, fearing that if they ſhould not, they would be puniſhed ſeverely by the <hi>Sub-Baſhaw</hi> for their Diſobedience. After they were gone into the Camp, the Murderers immediately fell upon them, Shooting and Striking at them, until they killed them all at laſt, then they buried them in the Ground, mounted their Horſes and rode away. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Murderers thought they were very ſecure, one of theſe Rogues (which were ſaid to be <hi>Arabians</hi>) met one of the <hi>Mockeri</hi> or Carriers of the ſame Caravan, he knew the Horſe immediately, and perceiving it to be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48499:128"/>
bloody, his Heart gave him that it was not right, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made haſte up to him, and thruſt his bended Bagonet into his ſide, and took him Priſoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where he was (as I did hear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) having confeſſed the Fact when he was upon the Torture, executed for it. They did alſo ſeek for the reſt, but did apprehend none of them in the time of my ſtaying. The <hi>Sultan</hi> elſe taketh great Care to keep the Roads ſafe and free from High-way Men, that Trading may go on without hinderance. Yet ſometimes there are ſome of the great ones, and Men of Note, that put others upon it for gain's ſake, ſo that one muſt be very careful in theſe Countries. It is not long ago when we had News, that not far off the Chriſtians had taken ſome Ships from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and carried them off, and alſo formerly in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> of the laſt Year, they loſt ſome more, and as I am informed, among them were Four great ones, Three Fliboats, and Two other, that were taken by Six Gallies of the Chriſtians, which made the <hi>Turks</hi> mightily diſcontented; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour ſends out many Gallies into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, chiefly to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to croſs the Seas up and down to keep them clear from Pirates, and to hinder them from making Incurſions or Deſcents upon him. Theſe come ſometimes into this Port, but our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and the Maſters of our Ships do not care for their arrival, for they are forced to preſent them with Cloths, Woollen Cloaths, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Favour with them.</p>

                  <p>WHen I ſtayed with the Conſul at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and had not a few of his in cure, in his <hi>Fundique,</hi> ſome others of other Nations did ſometimes between
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48499:128"/>
whiles deſire my Aſſiſtance and Advice, and among the reſt, an Eminent <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> which reckon themſelves to be Chriſtians, and are called ſo from the Heretick <hi>Maro</hi> to this Day. This did live in the Mount of <hi>Libanus,</hi> and was carried down (although he had a whole Day's Journey to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with that painful Diſtemper the <hi>Gout</hi> very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely) to be cured by me. After ſome Days when he was pretty well recovered again, ſo that he intended to return home, he ſpoke to ſome of us in our <hi>Fundique,</hi> that we would be pleaſed to conduct him up the Hill home again, which was agreed unto very readily, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this Mountain is the moſt Famous in all the Country of <hi>Syria,</hi> whereof the Holy Scripture maketh ſeveral times mention, ſpeaking of its great Height and Famous Rivers (of which <hi>Jordan</hi> is one) of its ſweet ſmelling Plants, and pleaſantly taſted Fruits; and alſo becauſe there is a great many ſtrange Plants to be found. So we rode along with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> (who had no little reaſon to be afraid of the <hi>Turks</hi> clandeſtine Aſſault) with all poſſible diligence, and came immediately from the Town upon the heights of the Promontories of the Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> which were very Fruitful at the Top, and had many pleaſant plain Fields, which extended themſelves for three Leagues to the high Mount, ſo that this was a very pleaſant Road, where we ſaw ſometimes on one ſide, delicate Vineyards, then on the other, fruitful Fields ſowed with Barley, white <hi>Indian</hi> Millet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this we came to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Woods, where ſweet ſinging Birds let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be heard, and recreated us; ſometimes we ſaw ſome Hares and ſome Deer, ſo that we could not but fanſie that we went through thick and dark Woods. When we came out of them, and were very near unto the Mountain, there lay ſome ſmall Villages before it, and we went to one of them, and very near unto it in a green ſhady Place we ſate down, and refreſhed our ſelves with ſome Victuals, which we had taken along with us, before we began to go up the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Patriarch</hi> was very merry with us, and preſented us with ſome <hi>Venice</hi>-Bottles of his Wine, whereof we
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48499:129"/>
drank a good deal, for it was ſo pleaſant that I muſt confeſs that I never in all my Life drank any like it. Soon after we broke up again, with an Intention to reach his Monaſtery that Night, called our <hi>Ladies,</hi> which lieth on the middle of the Mountain as we ſo travelled towards the Top thereof; in the beginning we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow, and rough Valley, which had on both ſides very ſteep Walls, wherewith it was encloſed, of a vaſt Height, chiefly at our left Hand, and yet towards the Top there were ſeveral Caves within them, wherein <hi>Chriſtians</hi> live, whereof we ſaw a great many that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo near to the edges as they went about, that we that travelled underneath had much to do to keep us from being giddy. In that place (where from the Height one may plainly ſee the whole Neighbourhood to the very Seas, as if it was a <hi>Specula,</hi> ſuch as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients uſed to have) is always a ſtrong Watch kept by the Inhabitants of theſe Mountains (becauſe they are not under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as others are, nor in any League with them) to hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> from making Incurſions upon them. When we went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and got over ſome little Hills, we came out of this narrow Place into wide Meadows, Paſtures, Corn fields, and to ſome fruitful Vineyards: Then again into narrow and deep rocky Roads where we had enough to do to climb over: And afterwards again into pleaſant Groves, by delightful Rivolets that aroſe from Springs that made ſo ſweet a Noiſe, that thoſe Mountains are therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and commended, chiefly by King <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 4th Chapter of his Song, verſe 15th in Compariſon, where he mentioneth the Streams from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which make <hi>Damaſcus</hi> one of the moſt pleaſant and delicious Places in the World.</p>
                  <p>On this Mount grow here and there, beſides ordinary Trees and Buſhes, thick ſhrubby Vines, <hi>Zizipha alba &amp; rutila, Poplars,</hi> two kinds of <hi>Dwarf-Cedars</hi> with point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obtuſe Leaves, <hi>Eupatorium Meſuae, Abſinthium Ponticum, Elaeagni Math.</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſun</hi>; and wild Horn-beams, a peculiar ſort of Willows, <hi>Phyllireas, Styrax</hi>-Trees, the fragrant Gum whereof is to be found in Apothecaries Shops: But chiefly, and in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48499:129"/>
the greateſt Number were the Maple-Trees, which are large, big, high, and expand themſelves very much with their Branches. After we had reſted our ſelves, and were a little refreſhed underneath theſe, our Labour began again, to climb up theſe high and ſteep Steps. When we were thus a climbing, ſome Country-People (that we ſaw up ſo high before) came out of their Caves down to us, with Muggs full of Wine, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented firſt to their Maſter the <hi>Patriarch</hi> that was on Horſe-back, receiving him with a great deal of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (bowing themſelves down to his Feet) and loving Kindneſs, and afterwards they did detain us alſo, and preſented each of us with a Mug of Wine, to bid us welcome, which I and the reſt received very willingly, but having pretty well heated my ſelf with going, I at that time loved ſpring-water with Bread dipt in it very well, I only taſted a little of it. After we were got up theſe Stairs, a great many more came running to preſent their Maſter with Chickens, Pullets and other Poultry, which his Man took and carried it up with them. Then the ways were pretty good, and much ſtraighter ſo that we went on apace, until at length we came to the Monaſtery, which we could not ſee before we came juſt upon it. Juſt before it without is a moſt incomparable copious Spring, that ſloweth with delicate Water, which is worthy to be often viſited.</p>
                  <p>This Monaſtery (which is not extraordinarily built) lieth toward the left, almoſt in the middle of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain under a great Rock, which doth ſo cover and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, that it cannot eaſily receive any harm from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. At our Arrival the <hi>Monks</hi> came immediately, whereof I ſaw no more but Ten, and received us very kindly, and ſhewed us preſently our Lodging, which becauſe they had no Chambers to ſpare, was an arched Chapel, that we might know whither to repair: Yet we kept more upon the Top of the Houſe (which was like others covered with Plaiſter) which was the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſt and pleaſanteſt Place of all the Buildings, where we could ſee the Situation of the ſnowy Hill towards the Eaſt above the Cedars, which was a very pleaſant ſight, and alſo below us ſeveral other Hills, whereon they feed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48499:130"/>
their Cattle, together with the deep and dark Valley: And, the Monaſtery being but ſmall, ſo that they had not much room in it, we alſo ſupp'd there in the open Air, with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> and ſome of his Fraternity, on a long Table. They treated us very well, and gave us ſome white-wine to drink (which was better than that we drunk on the Hill) in <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſſes, the like whereof is not to be found neither in <hi>Candia</hi> nor <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But they fed, according to their Order, onely upon plain Food as Beans and <hi>French</hi>-Beans, and the like leguminous Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At Night when they conducted us to our Chambers to go to reſt, they ſhewed us inſtead of Beds ſome Straw-Mats, and Tapeſtry ſpread upon the Ground in their Church on which we were to lie, and ſo we did and reſted that Night. In the Morning they came very early before break of Day into the Church, when we were ſtill very ſleepy, to do their Office, and began immediately to ring two Bells, which made underneath the Rock ſuch a reſounding Noiſe, that it ſtupified us and made us (chiefly becauſe ſome of us had heard none in two Years time, and were full of Sleep and but half awake) ſo dull, that we did not for a good while know where we were, until we came a little to our ſelves again. Afterwards I heard them with Attention for a good while, and did look into their Books which were written with <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters: But what Religion they were of, I ſhall tell you hereafter, when I ſhall make mention of other <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At break of the Day we made our ſelves ready to go further up the Hill, to the Height thereof where the Cedars ſtand, to ſee them, ſo that we might come to the Monaſtery again. Along with us went two Monks to ſhew us the way; they conducted us back again to the rich Springs of Water, to the Stairs, which were very rough, and ſo ſteep that we were often forced to hold our ſelves by the Buſhes, which we could reach at both Sides; but chiefly when we turned on a ſudden, of which Turnings they had very many. So we got up higher and higher, with a great deal of Labour, until we came to a little Chapel ſtanding juſt at the Top of the Stairs, on the Hill. Near to this Chapel is a ſmall Village,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48499:130"/>
which we went through, and ſaw ſpacious Fields well cultivated, ſo that the Inhabitants of theſe Mountains, could have no want of Corn, Wine, Fleſh or Oil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although their Neighbours ſhould not ſupply them for Years with any thing: And beſides, their Lands are ſo well ſecured on the Height, and ſo locked up, as if they were ſurrounded with high Walls and deep Ditches: And moreover they are very a ſtout and warlike-People, very well provided with Bows and Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that their Neighbours cannot eaſily hurt nor do any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to them; and they are alſo ſoon alarmed, which we found, when theſe two <hi>Monks</hi> did immediately raiſe twelve Men well armed, in the furthermoſt Village to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſnowy Hill, to conduct us ſafe up to the Cedars of the higheſt Mount, that their Neighbours the <hi>Truſci</hi> might not hurt us. But as I underſtood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Truſci</hi> are in Confederacy with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> ſo that they need not to fear any harm from them. But they rather did it to frighten us, to get a good Recompence from us that they might rejoice, and treat us the better (as <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) on our return. So theſe Twelve went before us and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us up to another but very barren and rough Plain, where we found our ſelves to be upon the higheſt point of the Mountain, and ſaw nothing higher but onely a ſmall Hill before us, all covered over with Snow, at the Bottom whereof the high <hi>Cedar</hi>-Trees were ſtanding, ſome whereof King <hi>Solomon</hi> ordered to be cut down to be employed for the uſe of the building of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And although this Hill hath in former Ages been quite covered over with Cedars, yet they are ſince ſo decreaſed, that I could tell no more but Twenty Four that ſtood round about in a Circle and Two others, the Branches whereof are quite decayed for Age. I alſo went about in this place to look out for ſome young ones, but could find none at all. Theſe Trees are green all the Year long, have ſtrong Stems that are ſeveral Fathoms about, and are as high as our Firr-Trees. They have very large Twigs that bend the Tree, and make it lean that way, which ſomewhat ſpoileth their Straightneſs. Branches grow up ſtreight, as alſo do the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48499:131"/>
Cones thereof, which are large and round, and extend themſelves a great length, in ſo delicate and pleaſant, Order and Evenneſs, as if they were trim'd, and made even with a great deal of Diligence, ſo that at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you may ſee the Tops of them very even to one another. So that one may immediately ſee at a great Diſtance, a great Difference between theſe and other Firr-Trees. They are elſe very like unto the Larch-Trees chiefly in their Leaves, which are ſmall, and all cloſe together, but ſtand further aſunder upon ſmall brown Shoots, which in their Length and Bigneſs are like unto them of the <hi>Muſcus terreſtris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had reſted awhile underneath the Cedars, and began to be coldiſh in this windy, ſnowy and cold place, we began to return to the Monaſtery again. By the way I ſaw about the River three ſorts of <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> one whereof I took according to its Shape to be that of the learned <hi>Carolus Cluſius,</hi> which is very like unto the True <hi>Tragacantha.</hi> The Second is ſomewhat lower than the Firſt, elſe it is very like unto it, only it beareth Yellow Flowers, each whereof groweth by its ſelf in round yellowiſh bags, and ſeveral of them ſtand one above the other on long Stalks. The Third is almoſt of the ſame Height, and hath more brown coloured ſtrong Stalks, with white woolly heads of <hi>Poterius,</hi> whereon you ſee purple coloured Flowers. I found alſo by them another Plant, which to be brief, (conſidering its brown coloured flexible Twigs, and longiſh fat Leaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is very like unto the <hi>Chamaelea,</hi> of a very ſharp Taſte) I think to be the firſt kind of <hi>Sanamu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>da</hi> of <hi>Carolus Cluſius.</hi> Beſides theſe I ſaw hereabout two thorny Shrubs, one whereof was with its red coloured Grapes (ſetting the Leaves aſide as far as I remember) very like unto our <hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acantha.</hi> The other which was full of Thorns, and had ſmall red purple coloured Flowers, was like into the firſt kind of <hi>Scorpius</hi> of <hi>Carolus Cluſius.</hi> Among the Buſhes I ſaw the <hi>Scorzonera</hi> with yellow Flowers, and alſo a pretty ſort of <hi>Tulips</hi> with yellow ſtripes, and not far from it the true <hi>Ribes</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which I found in Autumn at an ill time, without Flowers or Seeds, only with two Leaves, as if it was juſt ſprung up. The Leaves
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48499:131"/>
thereof are rough and round, as big very near as thoſe of <hi>Petaſites</hi> (called Butterburn in our Language) which grow upon ſhort yet thick Stalks, which are alſo full of a pleaſant ſowriſh Juice, as well as their Stalks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of chiefly the True <hi>Rob Ribes</hi> is prepared, as I have ſeen it my ſelf, and <hi>Serapio</hi> teſtifieth. This loveth moiſt Grounds, hath a ſtrong brown coloured Root, which is pretty long, wrinkly, bended, and of a very unpleaſant Taſte. On the hight of the Mount I ſaw more Plants, ſome whereof I had not time to mind, and others that are not yet known, wherefore I omit (for ſhortneſs ſake) to ſay more of them.</p>
                  <p>The Mountain is very high, ſo that it may be ſeen in <hi>Cyprus</hi> about 200 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles off; wherefore the Day breaketh later at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and not until the Morning Sun appeareth before it: And moreover you find there Snow all Summer long, which they bring down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, into the <hi>Batzars</hi> or Exchanges to ſell, to cool their Drink with it chiefly in the Dog days, and fling it in by handfuls. Yet when we were at the Top, we could not ſee far about, being hindered by ſome Hills.</p>
                  <p>After we were come down from the Mountains into the little Village again, our Conductors brought us into a pleaſant Garden where their Wives came to us, which brought to us ſeveral yet ſtrange ſorts of Milk-Meats to eat, and very good Wine to drink, ſo we ſat down in the Graſs according to their Faſhion, to eat and drink, and to make merry, and ſpoke to them in the common <hi>Arabian</hi> Country Language, and what we could not ſpeak out, we made them underſtand by Signs. After we had dined, we returned them many thanks, for all their Kindneſs and good Chear, and ſo we went away. By the way we ſaw more Plants, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Alyſſum</hi> of <hi>Dioſc.</hi>; a delicate kind of <hi>Cynogloſſum.</hi> And alſo near the Stairs ſome wild Fir-Trees, <hi>Polium Montanum, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubium Creticum Lobelii,</hi> as I judged according to its ſhape. A delicate yellow <hi>Jacea</hi> with ſcaly Heads, and prickles like unto the <hi>Spina Solſtitialis,</hi> which is low, yet it hath a long and ſtrong Root, covered with a gray and hairy Rind, like unto the <hi>Victorialis,</hi> the Leaves are jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or laciniated, of an Aſhen colour and hairy, as alſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48499:132"/>
the two before mentioned; and another kind of <hi>Jacea,</hi> with purple coloured Flowers, which is very like unto the yellow one of <hi>Lobelius</hi> (which I have alſo found in <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France</hi> near <hi>Aix</hi>) ſaving only the prickles that are about the Heads. Juſt before we came quite down I found two kinds of <hi>Linaria,</hi> one whereof (that is of a pretty bitter Taſte) puts forth long and ſlender Stalks from the Root, cloſely ſurrounded with a great number of <hi>Linaria</hi> Leaves, and hath at top one, two or three long ſcaly Heads, from whence iſſue ſmall purple coloured Flowers; the other groweth alſo in Leaves and Stalks almoſt like unto the firſt, only they are ſmaller and tenderer, and hath quite to the top abundance of light and ſmall purple coloured Flowers round about it (as the blue one of our Gardens). At length after a long travelling and climbing, we came juſt when the Night broke in, down to the Monaſtery again; after Supper we went ſtrait to reſt, that we might be up early again to go for <hi>Tripoli.</hi> After break of the Day when we had taken our leave of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> and his Brethren, and made our ſelves ready for our Journey, we came ſtrait away. By the way we ſaw ſeveral of <hi>Arbores Judae,</hi> with their red coloured Husks; and alſo in the Rock a fine <hi>Gnapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> with Aſh coloured roundiſh, Mouſe-ear Leaves, and Snow-white double Flowers. As we went on, and were almoſt come to the Houſe that ſtood upon the height, whereof we made mention before, theſe Inhabitants came down again, got before us, ſtopt us, and would not let us paſs until we had drunk with them. Then we went on again, and I found in the deep and dark Valley the right <hi>Medium Dioſcoridis,</hi> and <hi>Mindium Rhazis,</hi> which I did ſpie immediately among the Buſhes, by its hight and ſpecious purple coloured Flower. This Plant is very like unto the <hi>Viola Mariana,</hi> of the learned <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Dodonus,</hi> very ſtately, ſo that no great Difference can be found but only in the Leaves, which in this are more carved, like unto thoſe of <hi>Plantain,</hi> and in the Flowers which are more open, and ſpread themſelves with their long and narrow Leaves, (whereof each hath eight) into a round Circle; the Seeds I ſaw not becauſe they were not yet ripe, yet I found a greater Auſterity in the Root
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48499:132"/>
than in the Seed Veſſels. Not far off, I alſo ſaw in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley a ſtrange Plant, which was of the height of a Cubit, and had whitiſh and woolly Leaves, like unto our <hi>Mullein,</hi> only they are leſs, and grow quite to the Stalk, as thoſe of <hi>Tabaco,</hi> or of <hi>Hyoſcyamus Peruvianus,</hi> of <hi>Rempert Dodon,</hi> at the top thereof grow fine purple coloured and white dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flowers which ſtand cloſe together, as thoſe of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Amaranth,</hi> or in the little <hi>Auricula Muris</hi> of <hi>Fuchſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ſo that according to all this, having alſo fragrant Roots, and like unto thoſe of black <hi>Hellebore</hi> (which broke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I pulled it up in haſte) as I judged by that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which ſtill was left to them, I clearly take it to be the true <hi>Baccharis</hi> of <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> In the Valley further down towards the Water, grew alſo the <hi>Oleander,</hi> and the <hi>Apocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Repens,</hi> which climbeth upon the Trees that ſtand nigh it, and covereth them ſo that it hangeth down again at the ſides, like the <hi>Ephedra</hi> of <hi>Pliny.</hi> After we came out before the Mountain, there appeareth the <hi>Italian Sphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylium, Viſnagia, &amp;c.</hi> there we went into the next Village, and looked after the Victuals we had left, to refreſh our ſelves. When we came from thence I found the black <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleon</hi> with its handſome blue coloured Tops; <hi>Origanum, Onites, Lycium</hi> called alſo <hi>Zaroa</hi> by the Inhabitants, the ſecond <hi>Acacia</hi> with trefoil Leaves, and when we came near to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> to the old and high Rivolet, between the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, I found the ſecond <hi>Tragoriganum</hi> of <hi>Carol. Cluſius Ceterach</hi> and low St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Wort,</hi> a fine <hi>Chamaedrys,</hi> &amp;c. but above all, a Thorn-buſh, about the height of a Cubit, very thick of Twigs and Stalks, ſo that ſome of them lie upon the Ground: The Stalks (whereof many grow out of a Root of a drying quality, and ſomewhat bitter) are ſurrounded with a tender gray Rind, underneath which is another reddiſh one to be found. Its long tender Leaves that grow one againſt the other (which are of the colour of Aſhes underneath, and green above) are very like unto the Leaves of our <hi>Sanguiſorba</hi>; between them at the Top or the Crown ſprout out many Thorns, the biggeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of divide themſelves at the Top into other leſs ones in very good order, ſo that ſome point down, and ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and others towards the ſides, and ſome thereof ſprout out further before the reſt, which ſprout our early in the Spring, and bear ſmall greeniſh coloured ſtarry
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48499:133"/>
Flowers; from underneath them grow out ſmall ſoft Berries of a whitiſh Colour, and ſome reddiſh, which are ſo cloſe together, and ſtand in their Ranks, (at the Top whereof the Flower is ſtill plainly to be ſeen) like unto our Currans. The Seeds thereof I have raiſed in the famous Garden of the Generous and eminent <hi>Hans Heinrich Herwarts,</hi> Alderman of this Place, very eaſily and they grew up until they were ready to blow: But as other <hi>Outlandiſh</hi> Plants do ſeldom endure our Climate, ſo did this alſo die the next Winter. It is called by the Inhabitants <hi>Bellen.</hi> But I am of Opinion, according to its ſhape, (for of its Virtue and Uſe, I can ſay nothing becauſe I never tried it) that it is the <hi>Hippophië</hi> of <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> ſo long until others give me a better inſtruction. Not far from hence I found on the Height, near to the Town in a rough place, another fine Plant, not unlike unto our <hi>Gingidium,</hi> only that it hath leſs Fenil Leaves and beareth a roundiſh Seed, with many ſmooth Wings hanging round about it, which cloſe themſelves almoſt into a Knot together, with its tender Leaves, which ſprout out underneath the Crown, like unto the black Coriander: Which induced me to enquire after it, more narrowly what to call it, and being I found that it had a ſmall white Root, tender Leaves, and a bitterer Taſte than our wild <hi>Parſnip,</hi> and alſo in the middle of the Crown a blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Knob, I cannot judge it but to be the true <hi>Gingidium</hi> of <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> From thence we ſoon went down the Stairs again, and came by ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> burying-Places, and ſome wild Figg-Trees, by them called <hi>Mumeitz</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great many are growing in theſe Grounds) into the Town of <hi>Tripoli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after an honeſt and skillful <hi>Botaniſt,</hi> to whom I came to inquire after Plants, told me that a great many more were to be found thereabout. Wherefore I went out again to look for them, and to get them alſo. So I found firſt upon the Height near the Vineyards a <hi>Caſſia Monſpelienſium,</hi> which be called <hi>Mackmudi</hi> and <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſi,</hi> and the Berries thereof <hi>Habel Mickenes.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this is to be taken for the <hi>Avacſium Rhaſis,</hi> or no I cannot certainly affirm. This is ſo common in theſe places that they make Brooms of its Twigs. Moreover I found in the Vineyards another ſtately fine and ſtrange
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48499:133"/>
Plant, which was about two Cubits high, and had whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, woolly, and long, ſharp pointed Leaves, which are ſet round with ſmall prickles about the edges, and had on each ſide towards the Stalk little Ears, as our Sorrel and Spinage have: It is of a bitter Taſte, and at the Top there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on long Stalks grow many ſmooth Hands which in their bigneſs and Flowers are very like unto the yellow <hi>Jacea.</hi>

                  <p>But that I may not be too tedious (it being not my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to treat here of every one at length) I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one more before I conclude, which I found juſt at the Spouts where in Rainy Weather the Water runs down from the Mount of <hi>Libanus</hi>; which is the true white <hi>Behen</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and is ſtill to this Day called <hi>Behmen-ahied,</hi> as the red is called <hi>Behmen-ackmar,</hi> which alſo doth not ſtand far off, as my Friend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Botaniſt hath informed me. But becauſe I was daily ready to go on Ship board, to come home again, I had not time to obtain it; this was at that time almoſt decayed, yet I found ſtill ſome green Leaves about it, ſo that by all appearance, it doth endure the Winter, and ſo ſhoots out a new by degrees, which grow up yearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain inſtead of the old ones, theſe put forth long great and pointed Leaves, as big, ſharp and as thick as a Leafe of a Pear-Tree; they have partly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath on the Stalks four much leſs, which ſtand two and two againſt one another; and one alſo finds out a few of them on round Stalks (many whereof grow out of the ſame Root, about the height of a Cubit) where the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſtick quite cloſe to it, as you may ſee on the <hi>Smyrnium Creticum</hi>; On the Top it puts forth oblong ſcaly yellow Buttons, each of them on their peculiar Stalk, from whence iſſue Flowers of the ſame colour; it hath a very long Root, which at the Top ſhoots out great Branches, that grow ſo thick, that in time they may be ſeparated and tranſplanted; but elſe they have but very few Fibers, ſo that they rather are ſmooth, and alſo almoſt as tough and pliable as Liquoriſh Root, to which it is very like in its bigneſs and colour, only it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what whiter, and not ſo ſtrait. But why <hi>Avicen</hi> maketh mention alſo of its wrinkles, I am of Opinion that he rather ſpeaketh of the greater ſort, which is more wrinkly and rougher, and alſo for above a Span long, ſeem to be
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48499:134"/>
ſhrunk of Age and turned woody, or decayed and dried up, although within they are ſtill juicy, limber, and have kept their natural colour. I was alſo informed of others, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Coſtus Syriacus,</hi> which they ſtill know by the Name of <hi>Chaſt,</hi> and is found about <hi>Antiochia:</hi> And not far off from thence is alſo found the <hi>Nux vomica</hi> as ſome eſteem them, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Cutſchula</hi>; which together with a great many other Famous ones I might have obtained, if I could have had a true, faithful and experienced Guide; but for want of ſuch a one, and alſo becauſe I could ſtay no longer, I was forced to leave them behind, to be hereafter found out by ſuch that ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the like Journies.</p>

                        <hi>Cunning and deceitful Stratagems of the</hi> Grand Turk <hi>againſt the Inhabitants of Mount</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus <hi>the</hi> Truſci, <hi>and</hi> Maronites: <hi>And how he made War with them, and what Damage they ſuſtained by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving here before made mention of the <hi>Maronites</hi> and <hi>Truſci</hi> their Neighbours and Allies, I cannot but muſt alſo go further, and briefly relate, how the <hi>Turk</hi> did make War againſt them (as to whom they are not yet quite ſubjected) during the time of my ſtaying in theſe Countries. But from whence this War did firſt ariſe, and had its beginning, I was thus informed, that it broke out about one of their Governours, which lived then for a little time at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> For when the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> did obſerve that theſe People did daily grow in Number and Strength, he conſidered, that if he ſhould let them go on ſo, and neglect to curb them in time, they might probably after a while grow too Potent for him; wherefore he thought it requiſite, to ſtudy and make it his Buſineſs to find out ways and means to ſubdue them and to reduce them under his Power. In order thereunto,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48499:134"/>
he apprehended the Governour that lived then in <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcus,</hi> and put him into Priſon, and at length took away his Life unjuſtly under pretence as if he had endeavoured to raiſe a Rebellion; not doubting but that when he had removed their Head, he might the eaſier ſubdue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe People. But when the <hi>Truſci</hi> and <hi>Maronites</hi> underſtood this cruel and abominable Fact, not without Grief and Trouble, they were not only not at all diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from reſiſting ſo Great and Formidable an Enemy, but rather took new Courage that was promoted by the great Anger this deteſtable Fact put them into, ſo that they united themſelves the firmer, and did unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to oppoſe him with all their Might and Power, and to ſtand by their ancient Liberty; and accordingly they began immediately to Arm themſelves, to Fortifie their Villages, and chiefly their Paſſes, and to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Guns, Bows and Arrows, and all other things neceſſary for their Defence, ſo that in caſe of Neceſſity they might be ready to reſiſt their Enemies, being ſuch a kind, that kept neither Faith nor Promiſes, which they had often experienced to their great Grief and Loſſes. So that in all probability it was like to be a War, which alſo broke out with great Violence within a little time after. But becauſe I went for <hi>Bagdet</hi> at the ſame time (where in former Years the Potent <hi>Caliphi</hi> did reſide) I did hear no more of it in all my Journey until at my return, when my Comrade <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> then Priſoner in <hi>Tripoli,</hi> did relate it to me, ſo as it was reported to him by Credible Hands; who told me that the <hi>Truſci</hi> are very numerous, that they were divided into ſeveral Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of ſeveral colours, and that thoſe that live in the middle of the high Mountains were the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of them all, that they live in a Country that is very well ſecured and ſurrounded, ſo that they need not, nor will not be ſubject either to the <hi>Turks</hi> or any other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate. They are Warlike People, for the generality good Gunners, that make their own Guns and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have plenty of Corn, Oyl, Wine, good Meat and good Fruit, ſo that they need not any Aſſiſtance of Strangers. They chiefly deal in Silk, whereof they wind (from Silkworms) about 100 Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulas in a Year (which is about 450 Hundred weights)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48499:135"/>
to ſend from thence into other Countries. Theſe have their white Colours, and their Confederates that live on the outward Hill toward the Sea, at <hi>Baruti</hi> near <hi>Tripoli,</hi> have red ones, and have alſo their Colonel which they call <hi>Ermin Mackfur,</hi> which alſo thoſe that belong unto the white Colours acknowledge to be theirs, as well as their own (which was lately murdered.) This becauſe he could not entrench himſelf as well as the other <hi>Truſci</hi> on the Hill, agreed with the Great <hi>Sultan,</hi> and made Peace, upon this account, that if he would let him live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly, he would help him to Protect the Country, and pay unto him yearly the accuſtomed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> would not be pleaſed with this proferr, he would join the reſt and aſſiſt them. The Emperour accepted of this, and did not only make this <hi>Ermin Mackfur</hi> Lord of all <hi>Baruti</hi> and <hi>Seide,</hi> called <hi>Sidon,</hi> but did alſo procure him a great and plentifull Yearly Revenue out of theſe Countries; thinking thus to oblige him, to help him with his <hi>Truſci</hi> to ſubdue the others, not doubting but that he might eaſily overcome theſe, when once the others on the Mountains were killed. But they would not get up the Hill, but did proferr to the <hi>Turks,</hi> that if their Men and the <hi>Moors</hi> would go up, they would be ready in the Valley about <hi>Baruti,</hi> to cut off all that ſhould fall into their hands. This Anſwer they gave to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> only for Faſhion's ſake, for no <hi>Truſcus</hi> killeth the other. When the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſaw that they would not bite one another, and that he was not like to obtain any great matter from the Colonel, he did notwithſtanding ſend up the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> with Six other <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and Seventeen <hi>Sangiacks</hi> about Two Hundred Thouſand ſtrong, both Foot and Horſe well Armed, to ſubdue the before-mentioned <hi>Truſci</hi> which were about Sixty Thouſand ſtrong, to burn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh and deſtroy their Towns, Villages, Houſes and Plantations. After they were come up to the Aſcent Two Days Journey from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> they found the Roads ſo ſteep that no body could paſs them on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, for there was nothing to be ſeen but rough and ſharp-pointed Rocks. So they agreed to diſmount, and to go up to them on Foot, and ſo they took preſently Six or Seven Villages (whereof there is ſaid to be Twenty
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48499:135"/>
Seven in all) but they found nothing in them but ſome Women and Children and very few Men (the reſt were got upon the Hills where they had intrenched themſelves) which were all cut in pieces, and the Villages burnt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> thought themſelves obliged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Emperours Command, to go on further, ſo they endeavoured and got up higher, but could not do any more harm to the <hi>Truſci,</hi> being hindered by the bad ways: But on the contrary the <hi>Truſci</hi> met them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and poured their Shot upon them from all Sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were aware of it, ſo that they were but in an ill Condition. Then when the <hi>Turks</hi> would purſue theſe Men, they were too quick for them, as being born and bred in theſe Mountains; ſo they did only laugh at them, and bid them kiſs their Breeches: So the <hi>Turks</hi> (partly for want of Proviſion, partly being tired by the ſteep Roads) were ſometimes forced, not without great damage and loſs of their Men, to retire again to take better Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Sometimes alſo the <hi>Truſci</hi> would ſtand between the Rocks covered and when they found any of their Enemies appear, chiefly thoſe that endeavoured to climb up the Rocks, they would all of a ſudden ſhoot among them as among a Flock of Pigeons, ſo that many of them did precipitate themſelves and broke their Necks. They would alſo ſometimes decoy the <hi>Turks</hi> into a good Road and after Eight or Ten Thouſand of them were paſſed, they would with Six Thouſand <hi>Truſci</hi> fall in the Rear of them, to drive them up higher, where others ſoon did appear that came down upon them: ſo they ſurrounded them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and received them ſo warmly, that but very few of them came back again to tell what was become of the reſt. After this War had continued for about two Months, the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> at laſt was forced to make a ſhameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with the Remainder of his Forces, and that ſo much the ſooner becauſe the Winter began to approach, ſo that it was impoſſible to endure the Froſt and Snow, which occaſioned many to die, and the chiefeſt of them came home ſick.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Truſci</hi> pretend to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the Poſterity of thoſe that ſome Years ago by Might and Strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Holy Land; ſo that ſtill to this Day, they have a great Affection for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which thoſe that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48499:136"/>
travel among them to buy Silks can teſtifie, whom they treat and entertain very civilly with good Meat and good Wine, yet refuſe to take any Money for it: And ſay, That what God hath given them they are bound to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute among us <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But they hate <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and keep very good Intelligence with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of this Country. Yet they themſelves are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſtians, Turks, Moors</hi> nor <hi>Jews:</hi> For they do not go to Maſs, nor any other publick Worſhip of God: They cry out ſometimes to Heaven that God would be pleaſed to protect them. They alſo believe, according to the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that the Souls of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed according to their Merits, tranſmigrate from one Body into another; That the Soul of a pious Man goeth into a new-born Child, and that of an ill Man into the Body of a Dog or other wild Beaſt; chiefly if he hath lived very ill. As they believe ſo they live alſo. Among them they marry to their neareſt Relations, the Brother to his Siſter, the Son to his Mother, the Father to the Daughter, and they lie all together at Night, but they will not marry into a ſtrange Family. The Father or the Mother ſays, Seeing that God hath given me this Child as a Seed unto me, why ſhould I throw it away upon a Stranger? or elſe, I have a Garden, and God giveth me Flowers in it, is it not reaſonable, that I ſhould enjoy them rather than a Stranger? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they make uſe of a great many of theſe and the like Expreſſions. They alſo keep a Yearly Feaſt with their Wives which then they change one with the other as they pleaſe. Elſe they are not given to ſtealing, killing, or any ſuch like Crimes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want for nothing) but if any be taken that hath thus tranſgreſſed he is executed immediately. So they live in Peace together, and care not for any other Monarch.</p>

                        <hi>A Short Deſcription of his Departure from</hi> Tripoli, <hi>a Town of</hi> Phenicia <hi>in</hi> Syria, <hi>and how he went from thence to</hi> Joppa.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter my Return to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> when I found my ſelf near to the Confines of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promiſe, promiſed and given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the Lord of <hi>Zebaoth,</hi> and conſidered, that, our long before promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Lord and Saviour of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48499:137"/>
Gentiles, was there, according to the Prophecies of the Prophets, born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and by the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuffered the ſhameful Death of Crucifixion at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the Mount of <hi>Calvaria,</hi> and afterwards was laid in the New Tomb of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> that was cut out of a Rock, &amp;c. I found in me a great deſire to ſee theſe and other the like holy Places: Not that I thought ſtill to find there <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, as the two young Men, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the three <hi>Maries</hi> did, but to exerciſe my outward Senſes in the Contemplation thereof, that I might the more fervently conſider with my inward ones his bitter Paſſion, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and to appropriate to my ſelf, and to apprehend the better, and to make my own, by Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and firm Confidence, <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord himſelf together with his Heavenly Gifts and Treaſures, as he has manifeſted himſelf in the Holy Scriptures; wherefore I was fully reſolved to look out for Fellow-Travellers, to accompany me in this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, before I returned home again. I ſtaid not long in queſt of Company, but quickly met with four <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> that came out of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> that had the ſame intention: there alſo came to us a <hi>Grecian</hi> Monk, of the Order of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> whom I knew before when he lived with his Maſter, that I cured of a very dangerous Diſtemper, and deſired to go in company with us. So we agreed together, and beſpoke a ſmall <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſel with eight Oars, by them called <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſala,</hi> whereof there were many in the Harbour, that wait conſtantly for Travellers, Goods and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be carried into the Neighbouring Towns and Provinces, <hi>vix.</hi> to <hi>Antiochia, Caramania,</hi> anciently call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cilicia, Cyprus, Baruthi, Caramania,</hi> or quite into <hi>Egypt.</hi> We bought ſome Biſquets, Cibets, Eggs, Cheeſe, Pompions, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Baticcas, Margeropfel,</hi> Oranges, good Wine, &amp;c. which we had occaſion of, for our Journey, of which as much as would laſt us eight days: for the Ship-Maſters, do not willingly land, chiefly with Pilgrims, becauſe of the great Cuſtoms the Roguiſh <hi>Turks</hi> demand unjuſtly from us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> every where, until we arrive at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Stations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:48499:137"/>After we had thus fitted our ſelves, and got a good Wind, we went aboard the Ship on the Seventh of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year 1575, and put off, and came before Night to the Point <hi>Capugio,</hi> to the Village <hi>Aniffe,</hi> anciently called <hi>Neuphrus,</hi> which was in former Ages very well Fortified, as ſtill appeareth by ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders to this Day. This Village is pretty big, but every where open, that one might eaſily take it with a handful of Men: it is ſituated on the Foot of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> which is very high there, and reacheth unto the Sea. It is chiefly inhabited by <hi>Maronites,</hi> as are alſo many more Villages of this Mountain, chiefly thoſe that lie in Valleys towards <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where I have inned many times, when I went through it, and was very kindly received: they keep very good Wine by them, which the <hi>Turks</hi> know very well, and come there very often for it (altho they are forbidden by the Laws of their <hi>Mahumetan Alcoran</hi>) to ſatisfie their Deſire. Theſe <hi>Maronites</hi> are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſpeak the <hi>Arabian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and have their <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> which are firſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the People, and then confirmed by the <hi>Pope.</hi> After we had went on from thence very well all Night long, all along the ſteep mountainous Shore, and had made the utmoſt Point of the Promontory of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruthi,</hi> we ſaw in the morning a far off that famous Town, lying behind it where formerly great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce has been drove, well fortified with ſtrong Towers towards the Sea, and ſurrounded with fruitful Orchards and Vineyards. In this, and alſo in more adjacent Towns and Villages, live a very War-like People, called <hi>Truſci,</hi> very nimble and expert in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Guns and Bows, and call themſelves the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of the ancient <hi>French</hi> Men, which took and poſſeſſed many years agon under <hi>Godfrid</hi> and <hi>Baldwin, Jeruſalem</hi> and all the Land of Promiſe. They are ſtill a Free People to this Day, and not ſubject unto the Great <hi>Sultan,</hi> as others are; wherefore he hath many times attempted to bring them under his Yoak. And in order thereunto he did ſend in the Year 1574 laſt paſt, a great Army conſiſting of Two hundred thouſand Horſe and Foot, to ſubdue them; but what harm he
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48499:138"/>
did them I have already mentioned in the precedent part of this Journal. They are very willing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and ſerve Outlandiſh <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Germans, French Men</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> whereof they make no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and to take them up into their Habitations, and to ſhew them all Civility and Kindneſs: nay, and what is more, to aſſiſt them according to their utmoſt Power againſt the Common Enemy of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as we have formerly found indeed, before <hi>Cyprus</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Turks</hi>: for after they were informed, that ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Gallies were to arrive to make an Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the adjacent Towns and Places, chiefly to plunder <hi>Tripoli,</hi> they raiſed Seven thouſand Men very well armed to help them, and to come to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſome of which did then appear and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Frontiers: but finding that their Gallies did not arrive, they alſo returned home again, and left their Deſign unaccompliſhed. The <hi>Truſci</hi> have a Head called <hi>Ermin Macksur,</hi> that is a judicious Man, and a very experienced Soldier, whom they acknowledge to be their Supreme Governour, and are obedient to him: he liveth in a Caſtle on the bottom of the Mountain, not far from the Town we went by; he taketh great pains, chiefly now after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War, and maketh great Proviſion to keep the Country in Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. He alſo keepeth good Correſpondence with the Neighbouring People, chiefly the <hi>Maronites,</hi> (that have lived long before in theſe Mountains) with whom he hath lately renewed the old Confederacy again, as I know very well, and their <hi>Patriarch</hi> himſelf was with him, before I was called to cure him of his Diſtemper. He alſo leaveth no Stone unturned to get in with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to make them his Confederates: ſo he hath already ſecured to himſelf the <hi>Syrians</hi> (which are alſo <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet not without groſs Errors) by paying to them a yearly Penſion. Theſe ſpeak alſo <hi>Arabick,</hi> and are very like unto them in Shape, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Faſhion and Cloaths; and I ſound two of them among our Seamen, that confirmed this to me.</p>
                  <p>After we had gone on a great while, and were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Point of the Promontory of <hi>Baruti,</hi> which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48499:138"/>
extendeth it ſelf far into the Sea, our Ship-Maſter (who was a <hi>Turk,</hi> and underſtood the <hi>Arabian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) ſhewed me a Village lying beyond it, called <hi>Burgi,</hi> and told me, that that was alſo inhabited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together by <hi>Harani Quibir,</hi> that is great Robbers and Murtherers, as they always call theſe People. But I being better informed before-hand, I prayed by my ſelf that God would be pleaſed to let the poor Slaves that live in hard Servitude under the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were theſe they call <hi>Harani:</hi> and I do not at all queſtion, but they would ſoon take their Refuge to them, to make themſelves free of their Servitude, as thoſe might eaſily do, that live about theſe Countries in <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſaw alſo upon the Shoar ſome ancient Towers, and among them chiefly two, which are renewed again, wherein the <hi>Truſci</hi> keep Watches to obſerve the Pirates, but the others, whereof there are a great many, not above a League diſtant from one another, are for the greateſt part by Age decayed. Some ſay that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly built by the potent Emperors, that if any Nation ſhould riſe up in Rebellion, they might immediately give notice thereof to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Theſe gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, before Guns were invented, in the Night by a flaming Fire, and by Day-time by a great Smoak. And they ſtill keep to this in many places, altho Guns are now invented.</p>
                  <p>In the Afternoon we were becalmed, and ſo our Journey went on but ſlowly, we ſaw late at Night a ſmall Village called <hi>Carniola</hi> upon the height: and ſoon after at the Foot of the high Mount of <hi>Libanus,</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the City of <hi>Sidon,</hi> by the Inhabitants ſtill called <hi>Scida,</hi> which is not very great, but as far as I could ſee, very well built, and defended by two Caſtles, one whereof is ſituated towards the North on a high Rock, the other on a little Hill Thoſe that are going to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> which is a Days Journey diſtant from it, land there. Before we could reach it, Night befel us, and brought contrary Winds, which hindered us ſo much, that we could hardly reach the glorious and rich Town of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> now by the Inhabitants called <hi>Sur,</hi> which lieth

in a manner cloſe to it, until the next Morning. This is ſtill pretty large, and lieth on a Rock in the Sea, about Five hundred Paces diſtant from the Shoar of <hi>Phenicia.</hi> In former Ages <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it for Seven Months, and during the Siege he filled up the Streight of the Sea, and did join it to the Continent, and after he had taken it, he laid it into Aſhes, ſo that Puniſhment was inflicted on the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants which the Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> denounced againſt them Four hundred years before.</p>
                  <p>On the Confines of <hi>Tirus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> that <hi>Cananean</hi> Woman came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> on behalf of her Daughter, that was poſſeſſed of an unclean Spirit, whereof the Lord, ſeeing her Faith, did deliver her immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                  <p>Juſt before it we heard a great noiſe of large run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Springs, which riſe within the Country with ſo great a vehemency, that they drive ſeveral Mills. Within a large diſtance from thence, we ſaw a very fine new Houſe called <hi>Nacora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two Miles farther near Mount <hi>Saron</hi> within, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we ſaw a large Village called <hi>Sib,</hi> without it in the Sea round about were ſeveral Banks and Rocks, behind which we hid our ſelves, the Wind being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſtaid for a more favourable one; in the mean while, ſome of our Men got out among the Rocks to catch Fiſh, and to find Oiſters, where they alſo gathered ſo much Sea-ſalt, that they filled up a great Sack with it.</p>
                  <p>Between this and Mount <hi>Carmelo,</hi> which are Eight Leagues diſtant, and run out a great way into the Seas, lieth almoſt in the middle thereof, as it were in a Half Moon, the famous Town of <hi>Acon,</hi> anciently called <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> on a high Rocky Shoar, which ſome years ago, when <hi>Baldewin,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Gotefrid,</hi> firſt, and <hi>Guidon</hi> after him, did poſſeſs themſelves of the Holy Land, was not without great Loſs of many Men taken by them, from <hi>Saladine</hi> King of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which had (after ſome obtained Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) ſurrendered it ſelf again a ſecond time, after a long Siege. This Town hath very good Fields of a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48499:139"/>
fertil Soil about it, and is at this time, together with the Land of Promiſe and others, to the great grief of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) ſubjected under the Yoak and Slavery of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor.</p>
                  <p>The next Day, the Wind favouring us, we hoiſted up our Sails, and got out at Sea, with leſs danger to get before the Point of the Mountain: but our Deſign was fruſtrated; for about Noon a contrary Wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, which did not only hinder us in our Courſe, but violently drove us back again, ſo that we were forced to have recourſe to our old Shelter behind the Rocks again. After Midnight, when it began to be calm, and another Wind aroſe, we put out two hours before Break of Day, and went all along the Shoar towards the Town <hi>Hayphe,</hi> formerly called <hi>Caypha,</hi> or <hi>Porphyria,</hi> Four Leagues beyond <hi>Acon,</hi> lying juſt within Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> where on the Evening when we came very near it, ſeveral Frigats came out of all ſides to ſurround us. As ſoon as the Maſter of our Ship perceived them, he did not like it, wherefore he let fall his Sails, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his Men to ply their Oars warmly to get clear of them. When they ſaw they could not reach us, they left their Deſign and went back; but we landed without on that Mount <hi>Carmelo,</hi> to put out again in the Night. This Mountain is very high and famous in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for we read in the Third Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Eighteenth Chapter, that the holy Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> called before him upon the Hill the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Four hundred and Fifty of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, and and the Four hundred of <hi>Hayns,</hi> to chide them for their Idolatry: where alſo God heard him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his Sacrifice by Fire that came down from Heaven; but the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> were not only not heard by their Idols, but kill'd as Idolaters near the River <hi>Kiſon</hi>: and alſo in the Fifth of the Epiſtle of <hi>James:</hi> that after the Heavens had been lock'd up for the ſpace of three years and a half, <hi>Elias</hi> did pray to God on this ſame Mount, and the Lord heard him, and let Rain fall down upon the dry and barren Earth. From this Mountain, the (preſumed) holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> taketh its Name, which was firſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48499:140"/>
there endu'd with ſeveral Priviledges, by Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Third, and <hi>Albert</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Year 1205; and afterwards when they were encreaſed to a great number, under pretence of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Holineſs, confirmed by the Name of the Brothers of our Lady, by Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third, in the Year 1226. Theſe pretend to be Followers of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> wear daily black girded Coats, and over it, when they ſay Maſs, white Monks Habit. Some years ago without doubt, have a great many of this Order lived here about, as ſtill to this day doth appear by their Cloiſters and Churches, which by Age are ſo mightily decay'd, that they are left deſerted, and uninhabited. This Mountain is alſo round about towards the Sea Coaſt very bare and rough, that we may very well ſay with the holy Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> That the Paſtures of the Herdſmen ſhall look miſerably, and the top of the Mountain dry up.</p>
                  <p>The Town <hi>Hayphe</hi> lieth at the bottom of the Mount <hi>Carmelo,</hi> is pretty large, but very ill Built, and the Houſes are ſo decay'd, that half of it is not fit to be Inhabited. <hi>Salidinus</hi> King of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who in his time carried on long and heavy Wars againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and was almoſt hardly able to reſiſt them, cauſed the Walls of it, and alſo that of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and others of leſs ſtrength, to be pull'd down, that his Enemies might not find any place of Reception againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Out of this Port (as we are afterwards informed) was a little time before taken away a pretty large and richly Loaden Ship, by ſome Pirates, which vexed the Inhabitants very much, and being that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> chiefly were ſuſpected by them, they had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to revenge it upon them again; ſo that we, had not our Maſter been very honeſt, ſhould have ſuffer'd for the loſs they had ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>After we had lain there at Anchor till after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, not without danger, as you muſt imagine, our Maſter made haſte to get out to Sea, although it was very calm, in hopes to get good Weather. After they had wrought very hard, a good Wind aroſe behind us
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48499:140"/>
towards the Morning, and drove us along, ſo that we got ſoon about, and paſſed the Point of the Mountain, and ſaw the Country of the other ſide, which was above on the height ſo Pleaſant, Green and Shady, that there in a Village reſides a <hi>Turkiſh Sangiach</hi> for Pleaſure ſake.</p>
                  <p>Not far from thence lieth the Caſtle of the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in the Sea, by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Altlit,</hi> where moſt of them touch that take their way through <hi>Galilaea</hi> and <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This hath been in former Ages ſo well Fortify'd with Walls and Baſtions, that it was thought to be Impregnable; but now it is on two ſides towards the Sea, ſo demoliſh'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, that one may very reaſonably gueſs, that it hath been formerly taken by Storm.</p>
                  <p>The Wind ſtill increaſing more and more, we went on with ſuch a ſwiftneſs, that although two little Ships perſued us towards Morning, yet they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave us, and ſo we ſoon paſſed the Caſtle, and came towards <hi>Dor,</hi> three Leagues diſtance from thence; it lieth near Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> in the Country of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth; and it is ſo decay'd that there is nothing more extant, than a large and high Tower, which the Inhabitants ſtill call <hi>Dortaite.</hi> In this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when the <hi>Jews</hi> took <hi>Canaan</hi> the Land of Promiſe, they let the Inhabitants remain, as you may read in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At a League diſtance from thence, you ſee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Famous Town <hi>Caeſarea</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ſituated on the Sea on a high Bank, which King <hi>Herod</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and call'd it after the Emperor <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which ſtill to this day, among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> retaineth its ancient Name <hi>Kaeſarie.</hi> In this Town did live the Pious Centurion <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who was Baptiz'd there with his whole Family by <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle (who was called thither from the Town <hi>Joppe</hi>): There did alſo live <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> (one of the ſeven <hi>Deacons</hi>) into whoſe Houſe the Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did go, and ſtaid there ſome days; where alſo the Prophet <hi>Agabus</hi> did foretel him, That he was to be made a Priſoner at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now although this Town in thoſe days
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48499:141"/>
was very well built, as one may ſtill ſee by the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portant and ſtately Antiquities that are ſtill remaining there, yet now in our times it is in Walls and Buildings ſo mightily decay'd, that it is hardly fit to be Inhabited, much leſs to be Defended, or to make any Reſiſtance. And for all that it is ſtill pretty large, but ſo loneſom, and depopulated, that we could hardly ſee any body in the large and broad Streets thereof as we paſſed by.</p>
                  <p>For ſome Leagues before, or about it, I ſaw nothing remarkable, only a <hi>Turkiſh Moſque,</hi> or Church, in the height upon a hilly ſhore, where tbey meet to Worſhip their <hi>Mahumet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Evening broke in, we had ſtill 10 Leagues to Sail to the Port or Harbor of <hi>Joppe</hi> (where the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims uſe to go aſhore to Travel by Land to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) yet the Wind drove us on with ſuch a force, that we got into it two hours after Sun-ſet.</p>

                        <hi>A ſhort Relation of my Travels by Land from the Harbor of</hi> Joppe, <hi>to the City of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the Morning early as ſoon as the day did appear, which was the 13th day of <hi>September</hi> 1575, we got on ſhore, and diſpatched immediately ſome to the Town of <hi>Rama,</hi> two Leagues diſtant from thence, to get us a ſafe Conduct, or Paſs, from the <hi>Sangiach,</hi> and to bring along with them ſome <hi>Mockeri,</hi> or Aſs-driving Carriers, to provide us Carriage to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the mean while we ſtay'd upon the high Rocky ſhore, where the Town <hi>Joppe</hi> did ſtand formerly, which at this time was ſo Demoliſh'd, that there was not one Houſe to be found, where the Pilgrims at their arrival could ſhelter themſelves, ſave only three large Vaults, which went very deep into the Hill, and extended
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48499:141"/>
themſelves towards the Sea. Into theſe are ſometimes the Pilgrims let in, but being that at that time, a great deal of Corn was laid up there, whereunto they ſtill daily added, on purpoſe to ſupply <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> during the ſcarcity, it was forbidden that any Body ſhould be let in.</p>
                  <p>The Town <hi>Joppe,</hi> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Japha,</hi> is by its old Name very well known to us, by the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, &amp;c. where we Read. That the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> (when the Lord bid him to Preach to the <hi>Ninevites</hi> Deſolation and Deſtruction) for fear did retire thither, and there took Ship, where he was thrown out into the Seas in the great Storm and Tempeſt, and ſwallow'd up by a great Fiſh; and after he had been there for three Days and Nights he was vomited out again. And we read alſo in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the 9th and 10th Chapter, from <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, That he lay (or tarry'd) for a while at the Houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Tanner, where he raiſed the Siſter <hi>Tabitha</hi> from the Dead, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joppe</hi> at that time was very well Built and Fortify'd, which doth appear, becauſe a good many of the <hi>Jews</hi> did, at the time of the Deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> retire thither, to defend themſelves againſt the Might of the <hi>Romans,</hi> although it was but in vain; for being that the time of the puniſhment, that was to befal them, was at hand, the City therefore was two ſeveral times one after another, beſieged and taken, and demoliſh'd, and as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth, about 12600 <hi>Jews</hi> were killed in it. We alſo read, That after the time of <hi>Gotfrid de Boullion,</hi> when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt again the Land of Promiſe, that then this Town alſo was retaken again by the Infidels, and razed to the Foundations; ſo that now there are no Antiquities at all to be ſeen. And I ſhould have doubted very much whether there did ever ſtand ſuch a Town there, had not I ſeen ſome large pieces of the Ancient Town Walls ſtill remaining, which are ſo near to the Sea, that there is hardly room to go at the outſide of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:48499:142"/>Hard by this I ſuppoſe was the Habitation of <hi>Simon</hi> the Tanner, where <hi>Peter</hi> ſojourned, becauſe the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, That it was near to the Sea ſhore.</p>
                  <p>Above it on the height ſtand two Towers, where ſome Watchmen attend to look after the Vaults and Ships in the Harbor, that they may not be aſſaulted by the Pirates; this Harbor, although it is ſurrounded with Rocks and Banks, yet it is but very ſlightly ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and very narrow and ſhallow, ſo that Ships of any great bulk, or heavy Laden, cannot ride in it.</p>
                  <p>Near to them growth the <hi>Hemerocallis,</hi> which I have alſo found about <hi>Montpelier</hi> and <hi>Aigemort</hi> near to the Sea. And alſo in the adjacent Moiſt and Maſhy Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, I found a delicate kind of <hi>Limonium</hi> which hath about ten or twelve <hi>Aſpleniun</hi> or <hi>Ceterach</hi> Leaves on both ſides; theſe proceed from a long Root of a brown colour without, and red within; between them ſprout out two three-ſquare Stalks, about a Cubit high, with a great many Joints, that have three long ſmall Leaves, and are adorned at the top with beautiful and ſtately blue and purple coloured Flowers; they are of a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nature, and the Inhabitants uſe to eat them in Sallads.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after Dinner our Men returned, and brought along with them the Paſs and the Carriers; our Maſter of the Ship left ſome of the Crew in his <hi>Caramuſala</hi> to look after it in our abſence: We Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and went away, and came ſoon into the plain Fields where <hi>Jonathas</hi> ſlew <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Captain, as is ſaid in the 1ſt of <hi>Maccabees</hi> the 10th Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Soon after we ſaw a pleaſant Village call'd <hi>Jaſura,</hi> and when we came a little nearer, a Camp of a great <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lord, who ſent (as ſoon as he eſpy'd us on the Road, and found that we were Pilgrims) ſome of his Men to us, to call us before him, and alſo to tell us, That he was one of them to whom the Grand <hi>Sultan</hi> had given Charge of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> with ſtrict order to let no Pilgrim in before they had paid a certain ſum of Money. So we went along with them, and appeared before him in his Tent, put
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48499:142"/>
our Right Hand on our Breaſt, bended our ſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and made him (according to their Cuſtom) his Compliments. After he had look'd upon us a great while, he bid his Men to receive the Money of us; ſo each of us paid him Nine Ducats that had their full weight, except the <hi>Grecian</hi> who paid only Five, and at their Requeſt we ſtaid with them all Night, becauſe their Maſter intended to ſend a Janizary with us the next day, to let us into the Temple. This Lord, who was an Eunuch, had a great many Offices; for in theſe Countries they are by the great ones, as <hi>Baſhaws, Sangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achs, Cadees,</hi> &amp;c. ſo much eſteemed, that in their abſence they make them Stewards over all their Goods and Chattels, Wives and Children, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At that time he was there to gather great quantity of Corn from theſe fruitful Countries, it being Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time, and to ſend it from thence to <hi>Joppe,</hi> to go by Sea for <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Midnight we mounted again, and came early in the Morning to the Town <hi>Rama,</hi> and went into the Houſe of the Pilgrims, which <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> bought, and gave it to the Pilgrims as their Inn. This is very large, and hath a great many Arched Chambers within, and a fine Well; within the Inner Court is a pretty large place, all grown over with green Aloes, the Juice whereof is brought over to us in large pieces, from the Eaſtern Countries, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful in many tedious Diſtempers: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did alſo bring with him, (together with) Myrrh to the quantity of 100 pounds, to the Grave of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, to Bury his Body decently according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> faſhion, as you may read in the 19th Chapter of St. <hi>John.</hi> Here we ſtaid almoſt three days, and had all along enough to do to agree with the <hi>Cadi Suba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw Clerks, Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Paityfs,</hi> &amp;c. about our free paſſage; ſo Unjuſt, Malicious, and Infidel a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are they, that one would hardly believe it.</p>
                  <p>The Town is ſituated on an Aſcent in plain Fields, as is before ſaid, which extend themſelves for two Leagues to the Hill of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe Fields are very Fruitful, and very well Tilled and Sown
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48499:143"/>
with Corn, Cotton, and <hi>Indian</hi> Millet. Hereabouts do alſo grow <hi>Indian</hi> Muskmelions in great quantity, by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Batiere,</hi> which are very pleaſant and well taſted, chiefly thoſe that are red within: ſo that in all my Travels I hardly met with the like.</p>
                  <p>The Town is pretty large, but very open like unto a Village, very pityfully built, where one may ſtill ſee here and there ſome ſigns of old Building,</p>
                  <p>From thence Northwards within half a League lieth the Town <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> formerly called <hi>Lidda,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> did viſit the Saints, and cured one named <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that had had a Palſie for Eight Years. Nothing elſe is to be ſeen there, but the Church of St. <hi>George,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> chiefly honour, as a Knigt and <hi>Hero,</hi> before all other Saints. After they had quite tired us, during this time, with their continual Impertinencies, we agreed with them, and went away early in the Morning, and came in good time over the Plain, to the Mountain of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to which we had ſtill Four Leagues to travel. By the way there appeared pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently on the Mountains ſeveral <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in great Cluſters to cut us off in our way, with ſuch violence, that we were almoſt forced to come to our defence, and to puſh through them by force: for our <hi>Janizaries</hi> had already flung their Iron Club into the Back-ſide of one of them, and had almoſt ſpoiled him. When they found us to be in earneſt, they took ſomething to drink of us, and let us alone. So we muſt, before we arrived at the old deſtroyed and ruinated <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (where there is no Joy nor Hopes to get any thing, as is in the Heavenly One) ſoon one after another pay them, juſt like Boys that have loſt their Game, and run the Gauntlet.</p>
                  <p>After we had endured all theſe Bruſhes, we went on, and came to the middle of the way of the Mountains, where it was very rough and ſtony, into a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Anatoth,</hi> lying on a heigth, where we reſted a little, and watered our Beaſts at a very rich Spring, that runs through it by an ancient little Church down the Hill; this is ſituated (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes in his Tenth Book and Tenth Chapter of his Antiquities, or
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48499:143"/>
ancient Hiſtory) within Twenty Furlongs of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> There was born the holy Prophet <hi>Jeremias,</hi> as you may ſee in his Firſt Chapter: and it is alſo called by <hi>Eſaias</hi> a pitiful Village, which, together with the Town <hi>Rama,</hi> did formerly belong to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Children of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> Thither went alſo <hi>Abiathar,</hi> when King <hi>Solomon</hi> did depoſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from his Prieſthood, to live on his own Ground. A little before it they ſhewed us at the top of the heigth or <hi>Silo,</hi> of Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts of the Grave of the holy Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> (where we could look about for ſeveral Leagues round) which was of <hi>Rama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ha,</hi> or <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as alſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Juſt whom helped to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> down from the Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did put him into his own new Grave. The Town was underneath the Mountain where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Samuel</hi> was buried at firſt, but carried up to <hi>Silo,</hi> after the Town was taken.</p>
                  <p>Juſt when you come to <hi>Jeruſalem, Nicopolis</hi> lieth on the Left Hand upon the Heighth, formerly called <hi>Emmaus,</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Threeſcore Furlongs diſtant, as the Scripture telleth us: whither <hi>Chriſt</hi> did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the two Diſciples, and explained the Scriptures to them, and at laſt made himſelf known to them. We left it and went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is now called <hi>Gotz</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi> The Road is very rough and rocky; ſo that we ſaw very little, but on each ſide in the Valleys many delicate large Olive Trees, and ſome few Vineyards.</p>
                  <p>The City lieth on the heighth of the Mountains, as the 125th. <hi>Pſalm</hi> teſtifieth. It is not to be ſeen, until you come over the bare and rough Mountains inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Proſpect of it on this ſide.</p>
                  <p>Juſt before it without, on the top of Mount <hi>Gihon,</hi> are to be ſeen ſtill ſome Antiquities of the Town <hi>Helia,</hi> which <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor built after the Deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and called it after his own Name <hi>Helia.</hi> This was firſt taken by <hi>Coſröe,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> (who did overcome him again) and afterwards by <hi>Homar</hi> the Third King of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who demoliſhed it; afterwards it was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48499:144"/>
more contracted, and ſomewhat built again in its old place. In theſe days it is, as well as all that Country, under the Dominion of the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before it we diſmounted, for no outlandiſh Man hath permiſſion to ride into their Towns, and went under the Gate <hi>Hebron,</hi> to ſtay there for the Father <hi>Guardian,</hi> to whom we had, by one of our Carriers given notice of our Arrival, and alſo deſired him to get us Licenſe from the <hi>Sangiach</hi> to come in. In the mean time ſome Mendicant Friars came out of the Monaſtery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us very kindly. Soon after the <hi>Ermin</hi> came alſo riding, with his Clerk, and asked us from whence we came, how many there were of us, and what our Names were. And after they had written it down, and every one had paid him his due (to have ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to ſee the holy Places) the <hi>Ermin</hi> promiſed it us, and put his Right Hand upon his Head, (which is the faſhion in theſe Countries) and bended forwards to let us know that we might confide in his Promiſe. Then they let us paſs, and the Friars conducted us in, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Left Hand, through ſome ſmall Streets or Lanes, into the Monaſtery, which is behind on the Town-Wall towards the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>This, although it is not large and ſpacious, yet is it very handſom, and ſtrong-built: we went into lodge there as all Pilgrims do that come there, where Father <hi>Jeremy</hi> of <hi>Brixen,</hi> a Brother of the Order of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norites</hi> of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> a Guardian of the holy Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> (which had been Preſident of this Monaſtery of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the other of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> for Eighteen Years together) received us very kindly. There are but very few Monks in it, and they are of all ſorts of Nations, as <hi>Italians, Spaniards, French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> yet of the laſt named I found not one when I arrived there. Theſe lead the Pilgrims about, together with an Interpreter, or <hi>Truſchemant,</hi> that underſtands the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, and ſhew them the holy Places as well within as without the City. But before we went out the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> admoniſhed us, that we muſt have a care, and not go to the Graves of the Heathens, which are almoſt throughout
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48499:144"/>
                     <hi>Turkey</hi> without the Towns, near to the Highways: for if one or more ſhould, before he was aware of it, which may eaſily happen, go to them, the <hi>Turks</hi> would be very much offended at it, partly becauſe they take any one that is not circumciſed, to be unclean, and ſo they fear that they might make them alſo unclean: partly becauſe they are very jealous of their Wives, wherefore they permit them not eaſily to walk or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the open Street, except they have a mind to go into the Bath or <hi>Pagnio,</hi> or to viſit the Graves of their deceaſed Parents or Relations: and where Women are preſent, every one had beſt to come away, to avoid Danger.</p>
                  <p>After he had ſaid this, he went on ſaying, That if any ſhould be among us, that were come over the Sea hither, that could not bring very good proof, that they did appear before his Holineſs the <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and were there abſolved by him, that ſuch were in his Holineſſes Excommunication, and therefore could not be admitted to ſee thoſe holy Places, much leſs obtain the Indulgences, which in former Ages had been left with them, out of great kindneſs of the Popes, to be diſtributed among the Pilgrims, wherefore he deſired, that every one might ſhew him their Certificates. All theſe Points he uſed to propound to every one that cometh there, in courſe, as I had heard before of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that had been there formerly; that they were very glad to ſee Pilgrims arrive, and that they uſed to ſhew the holy Places to them alſo that bring no Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from his Holineſs the <hi>Pope,</hi> hoping, that they will recompenſe them at their Departure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did not much mind this Excommunication, but let that remain in its ancient Credit: but my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, two whereof were Prieſts that uſed to ſay Maſs, were very much aſtoniſh'd at it, and full of Trouble, that they ſhould be under his Holineſs's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication before they were aware of it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began to excuſe themſelves, and ſaid, That they did not know any thing of it, neither had they had any opportunity in their Travels to come to <hi>Rome:</hi> But although this had been omitted before their Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48499:145"/>
yet they would certainly do it as they went back. Notwithſtanding all this the <hi>Guardian</hi> ſeemed to be very earneſt, and made ſhew as if he could not abſolve them; yet at laſt, after he had long enough kept them in this fear, he began to declare, that he had alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived full power from his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and the whole <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Church, to abſolve all thoſe that did not bring any Certificates. And ſo at laſt abſolved us in the Cloiſters of his Monaſtery in <hi>Latin</hi> with theſe Words: <hi>I abſolve you of all your Sins in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And with this he concluded his Speech.</p>

                        <hi>A Plain Deſcription of the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as it was to be ſeen in our time: and of the adjacent Countries.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Glorious and Kingly City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which formerly the <hi>Saracens</hi> called <hi>Kurzitadon,</hi> but now is named <hi>Chutz,</hi> by the Inhabitants) is ſtill ſituated in the old Place, in the middle of <hi>Judea</hi> on the high Mountains, and as the Head is extolled above the reſt: which may be concluded, partly becauſe from thence you may ſee all the the Country as from a Center: partly alſo becauſe the Springs riſe here, and ſo run down, as from a higher place, every way and to every part thereof; as the holy Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> doth teſtifie in his Fourteenth Capter, where he ſaith: <hi>That at that time freſh Streams ſhall flow from Jeruſalem, half thereof to the Sea toward the Eaſt, and the other half towards the furtheſt Sea.</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48499:145"/>
There are alſo many other places of Scripture, that <note rend="inter">Though <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might be ſituate in the higheſt part of <hi>Judea,</hi> yet are not the following places of the Scripture a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of it. For becauſe it was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and ſupreme Town, in regard of Greatneſs, Multitude of People, Strength, Juriſdiction, and other Privileges, tho its ſite were not higher than that of other Towns, yet might People well enough be ſaid to go up thither, it being higheſt in reſpect of Dignity, tho not of place. So we make no ſcruple to ſay in common ſpeech, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever travels up to <hi>London,</hi> goes up thither; and whoſoever travels from thence, goes down into the Country, let his Habitation be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much higher ſituate then <hi>London.</hi> Yet was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſituate on a Hill, which is enough to verifie all thoſe Expreſſions, tho that Hill were not the higheſt in <hi>Judea.</hi>
                     </note> teſtifie the high Situation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in the Eighth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Verſe 26. where the Angel of the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Philip,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Ariſe and go towards the South, unto the way that goeth down from Jeruſalem unto Gaza,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Tenth Chapter of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond Verſe: <hi>And they were in the way going up to Jeruſalem.</hi> And the Tenth Chapter of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Verſe 30. <hi>A certain man went down from Jeruſalem to Jericho.</hi> And Verſe 31. <hi>And by chance there came down a certain Prieſt that way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Situation of <hi>Jericho,</hi> together with the great Plains thereabout, through which the <hi>Jordan</hi> runs from the North towards the South, together with the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> where formerly <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> ſtood, you ſee from the Town, over a barren Hill, below ſo plainly, that one would think we might go thither with eaſe in three Hours, and yet it would require a whole Days Journey. Beyond the River that ſeparateth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi> from <hi>Judea,</hi> lie the high Hills <hi>Abarim</hi> and <hi>Nebo</hi> over againſt <hi>Jericho,</hi> whence <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as is ſaid <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> the 32d. and 34th. Chapters) had a full Proſpect of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; one may ſee them thence ſo plainly, as alſo the Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> which toucheth them beyond the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> that one would alſo think they were very near.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:48499:146"/>They bring yearly a vaſt quantity of Sheep to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> from off the Mountains, which feeding upon the fragrant, delicate and hearty Herbs that grow there, have Meat that taſtes very pleaſantly, the Tails thereof are very fat, above half a ſpan thick, and one and a half broad and long. The Levitical Prieſt (as we read in <hi>Leviticus</hi> the Ninth Chapter, and other places) uſed to burn this together with all the Fat of the Entrails, and the two Kidneys for a Sin-Offering.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Goats, with hanging Ears, almoſt Two Foot long. And therefore ſome <hi>Arabians,</hi> called <hi>Balduini</hi> keep in the Deſerts, that have no certain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, but lie continually in the Fields, and go from Country to Country in great numbers, whereſoever they find good Paſture for their Beaſts and Camels. I have met with many of them in my Travels, and have ſome time ſtayed with them all Night in their Tents, they are commonly Soldiers armed uſually with Bows and Long-Pikes made of Cane, as the other <hi>Arabians,</hi> and becauſe of their Nimbleneſs and Courage they are very much preferred before the reſt.</p>
                  <p>This holy Land (which, according to the Promiſe made to the Patriarchs, was for many years in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) was (as you read in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Chap. 8.) a moſt fruitful and rich Country, abounding with Corn, Fruits, Wine and all that is required to the maintenance of Man's Life. So the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>That he will give them a Land, that ſtill floweth with Milk and Honey.</hi> For it hath rich Valleys, Hills, Fields, and Gardens, richly adorned with Fountains and Trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that it was very well choſen to be the worldly Paradiſe, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did live, honor and ſerve God. Now as the Land in its Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſurpaſſed other Lands, ſo did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> excel all other Cities in Building, Glory, Fortification, and Number of Inhabitants. Moreover God viſited the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the beginning, and had a Houſe built in this City for himſelf, which he choſe before all others to ſanctifie his Name there. And above all this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them with High Prieſts, Kings and Prophets, until God the Father did ſend his only Begotten Son,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48499:146"/>
our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh, to reveal to them his Will with Teaching and Miracles.</p>
                  <p>But when they would not acknowledge his merciful Viſitation, nor receive his Meſſengers, but did rather abuſe, ridicule, and kill them, rejected the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> himſelf, and adhered to, and adored ſtrange Gods, and ſerved them; God did reject and diſperſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens burnt and deſtroyed their City and Temple, and reduced their fruitful Country into bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Deſarts, and a deſolate Wilderneſs, and ſo the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment came upon them, which the holy Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> did foretel them in the Thirteenth Chapter, and 9th. Verſe, ſaying, <hi>Behold the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land deſolate; and he ſhall deſtroy the ſinners thereof out of it.</hi> And further in the Twenty fifth Chapter, and Second Verſe, <hi>Thou haſt made of a City a heap; of a defenced City a ruine; a place of Strangers to be no City, it ſhall never be built.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo maketh mention of this in his Ninth Chapter, &amp;c. This ought to ſerve us and all Men as an Example of the fervent Anger of God, to be a warning to us for ever. For if of the Glorious City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which God had choſen before others, and of its vaſt Buildings, that made her famous before her Deſolation, there is at this Day nothing at all to be ſeen, ſo that one might very well doubt, whether it ever ſtood there, were it not for ſome holy places, and its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that give us demonſtration thereof. If I ſay this worldly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of its unbelieving Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that would not acknowledge the Bleſſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> nor adhere to his Doctrine to their Salvation, is quite rooted out; and inſtead thereof, the way of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> opened to us Heathens, by the holy Apoſtles: <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> This way to our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath for many years paſt, been ſhewed us ſincerely by the Miniſters of the holy Word of God, but we do not only, not much care for it, but ſeek rather other by ways, that lead us to Idolatry, Sin and Vices nay, to our utter ruine. Wherefore it is to be feared, that if we do not repeat in time, and return to God again, that he will come
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48499:147"/>
upon us with his wrath (as he hath already begun) and deliver us up into the Hands of our Adverſaries, that we may fall by their Swords (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth threaten us in his Thirty ninth Chapter,) and to puniſh us according to the Deſerts of our Sins. Wherefore we ought to lay to heart the terrible Example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and turn from our evil ways, that we may avoid the Puniſhments that befel them. We ſee that thoſe who were formerly the People of God, are now come to be ſo blind, and full of Errors, and of ſo depraved a Life, that there is hardly any like them to be found even among the Infidels and Impious. Wherefore they are by all Men deſpiſed and hated, chiefly by the <hi>Turks</hi> (which hate them more than any other Nation) ſo that they would not let them live among them, if the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor had not for a great Sum of Money given them a peculiar freedom. And beſides all this, now adays, their Towns and Countries are inhabited by <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> that do not love to till or cultivate the Ground, but will rather ſtarve, than take pains to get a good Livelihood by their Hand-Labour. And although the Country about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is very rocky, rough, ſtony, and ill managed, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they will not endeavour to mend and improve it, but find out the fruitful Lands that are here and there, and over-run the Country like Graſhoppers, ſo that you may obſerve it yearly to decay more and more. Seeing then that there is but little Tillage about the City, therefore the product of the Earth there is but very ſmall, ſo that they muſt have almoſt all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries brought them from other places.</p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is ſtill pretty large; but very ill built, hath within its Walls (which the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor cauſed to be built about Twenty Years ago) large places that lie deſolated, and are ſo full of Stones and Rocks, that one can hardly walk in them. The Gardens (even thoſe that are within the City, and are but ill managed) are ſurrounded with Mud Walls, not above Four Foot high, ſo that one may climb over them without any difficulty. Theſe are waſhed down again by Rain in a very little time, ſo that they want mending continually.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:48499:147"/>Their Habitations are alſo little and and low, have Clay-Walls, and many of them are decayed, ſome lie quite in a heap. The Churches of the two Apoſtles, that of St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> are in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as alſo the Priſon where St. <hi>Peter</hi> was kept, the Habitation of <hi>Veronica</hi> (which the Cordeliers ſhew us for them) and a great many places more. In ſome Streets chiefly near to their <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Exchange, are very old Vaults, part whereof are decayed and broken, part filled up with Duſt, which runs out into the Streets: wherefore (chiefly in the Summer) the Duſt lieth ſo thick in them, that you may ſee every ſtep in it, as in Snow or Sand.</p>
                  <p>All which ſheweth, that the <hi>Turks</hi> deſtroy or ruin more than they build; wherefore they are deſervedly called <hi>Turks,</hi> that is to ſay, Deſtroyers. The preſent Town, as to the Extent of its Walls, is not much leſs than the old one was, wherefore one ſhould admire, conſidering how it is built now, how it was poſſible it ſhould hold ſo many People as it is ſaid were in it at the time of its Deſolation, <hi>viz.</hi> a Million of Men, or as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſay, Three Millions. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was formerly ſurrounded with very ſteep Cliffs, deep Ditches and Valleys, chiefly on three Sides, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, Eaſt and Weſt, ſo that one could not eaſily get up to it but only on the North Side, where the Town was low, lying in a Plain: therefore did <hi>Titus</hi> firſt attack it in a place near the Village called <hi>Scapas,</hi> Seven Miles diſtant from it, and afterward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and took it: which the holy Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did foretel many years before, in the Firſt Chapter and Twelfth Verſe, ſaying, <hi>Out of the North an Evil ſhall break forth upon all the Inhabitants of the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Ditches and Valleys are now quite filled up with the Ruins of the broken Walls and Buildings, ſo that one may go into the Town, as into an open Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, without any hinderance or pain. But when the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> after he had taken it, ſaw that the Town was open, and that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Pilgrims came thither in great numbers from all places and Countries, he feared that they might make themſelves Maſters of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48499:148"/>
it again, as they had done ſome years agone, wherefore he ordered it to be ſurrounded again with new Walls, which although they are very high, yet they are ſo thin and ſlight, that they are not able to withſtand the leaſt violence. But as the Town was anciently built four ſquare, ſo it is now built more round, chiefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> which formerly was without the Town, but now is Walled in; ſo that you may ſtill ſee two corners, one whereof is towards <hi>Galilee,</hi> where the Gate of that corner is, which is ſtill open, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one of the handſomeſt, through which you go to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> diſtant three days Journey; as alſo to <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea Philippi,</hi> which is now called <hi>Balbec,</hi> where ſtill are to be ſeen ſome very fine Antiquities; and alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> which is ſix days Journey diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from thence 6 days Journey more to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the greateſt Town for Trade in all <hi>Syria. Jeremiah</hi> maketh mention of this Gate in his 31ſt Chapter and the 38th Verſe, <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that the City ſhall be built to the Lord, from the Town of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.</hi> And alſo <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in his 14th Chapter, and in the 2d Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the 26th Chapter, and 9th Verſe; It is ſaid <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzia</hi> built Towers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Corner-Gate, and at the Valley-Gate, &amp;c. The ſecond corner Mount <hi>Zion</hi> maketh, where it doth end toward the South, whereon, as alſo on the Mount <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> the City is riſing towards the North. The old City had twelve Gates, as you read in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The 1ſt, the <hi>Fiſh-gate,</hi> which was alſo called the Gate of <hi>Hebron,</hi> becauſe the Road of <hi>Hebron</hi> went through it, which is about ſeven or eight hours walking diſtant from it. 2.

The <hi>Priſon Gate,</hi> whereof <hi>Nehemiah</hi> maketh mention in his 12th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through which our Saviour Chriſt carried his Croſs. 4. <hi>Rayn-Gate.</hi> 5.

The Prophet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> maketh mention of them, in his 3d, 8th, and 12th Chapter, ſo that it is not needful to ſay any more. Theſe Gates are ſo mightily decayed, that there is not to be ſeen the leaſt of the old Buildings. The <hi>Turks</hi> have inſtead of them, built others in the New raiſed Wall, but yet not half ſo many in number, whereof ſome (according as the Town is enlarged in ſome places, and contracted in others) are diſplaced; others are erected again in the ſame places, according to the Old Streets, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>Fiſh-Gate,</hi> which is ſtill ſtanding towards the Weſt behind Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and over againſt Mount <hi>Gihon,</hi> as you may conclude out of the words of the 2d Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> in the 33d Chapter, and 14th Verſe. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> built a Wall without the City of <hi>David,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Gihon,</hi> in the Valley even to the entring in at the <hi>Fiſh-Gate.</hi> This Gate hath its Name, becauſe they brought many Fiſhes from the Sea-ſide through this Gate into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So is alſo ſtill ſtanding, on the outſide of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>Tiropaeon</hi> (which diſtinguiſhed the two Mounts, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the Temple Mount called <hi>Moriah</hi>) the Gate of the Fountain, which hath its Name becauſe it leadeth towards the Fountain of <hi>Siloha,</hi> which <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> in his 2d Chapter, Verſe 14, calleth the <hi>Kings Pool.</hi> Through this was our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true promiſed <hi>Siloha,</hi> brought a Priſoner bound from the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> over the Brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> into the Houſe of <hi>Hannas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> in the upper Town, as we read in the 12th Chapter, Verſe 37. that by the <hi>Fountain-Gate</hi> they went up to the City of <hi>David.</hi> The ſame way alſo the two Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were ſent to beſpeak the Paſchal Lamb, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where they met the Man with the Pitcher of Water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sheep,</hi> or <hi>Beaſt-Gate,</hi> is alſo ſtill ſtanding by <hi>Moriah,</hi> the Mountain of the Temple, which the <hi>Turks</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and its Holy Places.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>MOunt <hi>Sion,</hi> very famous in holy Scripture, hath round about it ſteep ſides, high Rocks, deep Ditches and Valleys, ſo that it is not eaſie to climb up to it, only on one ſide towards the North, where it buts upon the lower Town, ſo that the Caſtle and Town of <hi>David,</hi> ſituated on it, was very ſtrong, and almoſt Invincible, as you may read in the 48 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>The joy of the whole earth is Mount Sion, on the ſides of the north, the City of the great King. God is known in her places for a refuge, for the Kings were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> &amp;c. Seeing then that the Caſtle, and the upper Town <hi>Millo,</hi> vvas ſo vvell fortified vvith Tovvers and Walls that it vvas not eaſily to be taken, the <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> (after that <hi>Canaan</hi> the vvhole Land of Promiſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvith the Tovvn of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> vvas taken) did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves in it againſt the vvhole force of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a long time, although they often attempted to take it, and called the Tovvn of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after their Name <hi>Jebus,</hi> until the Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> came, vvho took it by force; and after he had rebuilt the upper Tovvn, and joined the Caſtle vvith it into one Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſurrounded it vvith Walls, he called it after his ovvn Name, The City of <hi>David,</hi> and kept his Court there, and gave alſo Lodgings to his Hero's and Officers, vvhereof <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> vvas one, vvho had his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings near to the Kings Palace, vvherein the King vvalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Roof of his Houſe, ſavv the fair <hi>Bathſheba</hi> his Wife, and committed Adultery vvith her.</p>
                  <p>Theſe their Habitations, as they are ſtill built in theſe Days, have inſtead of Thatch or Tiles, plaiſter'd Roofs, ſo that one may walk on them, as you may ſee here, that King <hi>David</hi> walked on it. And alſo in the Second Chapter of the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> where is ſaid,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48499:150"/>
That when the Two Spies, ſent into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Jericho,</hi> came into <hi>Rahab</hi>'s Houſe, and the King ſent to ſearch after them, they went at her requeſt up to the Roof of the Houſe, where ſhe hid them with the Stalks of Flax, which ſhe had laid in order upon the Roof. But ſeeing there is nothing ſo ſtrong in in this World that is not tranſitory, therefore is alſo this Worldly Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> together with its ſtrong Building and Fortification (which was rather a Type of the true Rock in <hi>Zion,</hi> Chriſt our Lord, and his Heavenly Kingdom, and Holy Church that was built thereon) ſo ruined and deſolated, that the greateſt and higheſt part thereof before the Town, (except a <hi>Turkiſh Moſche,</hi> ſome Tile Houſes and a few Acres of it) lieth quite like a Deſart, covered with Rocks and Stones. So it is come to paſs, what <hi>Micah</hi> in his Third Chapter and the Twelfth Verſe predicted: <hi>Therefore ſhall Zion for your ſake be plowed as a field, and Jeruſalem ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heaps, and the mountain of the houſe, as the high places of the foreſt.</hi> And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> Cap. 5. Verſe 18. ſaith, <hi>The mountain of Zion, which is deſolate, the foxes walk upon it.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his Thirty ſecond Chapter, Verſe 14. <hi>The Palaces ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, the multitude of the City ſhall be left, the forts and towers ſhall be dens for ever, a joy of wild aſſes, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of flocks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Caſtle of the <hi>Turks</hi> is ſituated at the top of the inward part of the Mount, towards the Weſt Side near the <hi>Fiſhgate,</hi> which is alſo newly built, and very well ſurrounded with Walls and Ditches: under the Gate are ſeveral great Guns to frighten the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> that come thither in great Flocks, chiefly againſt great Feaſts from all Nations, <hi>Armenians, Georgians, Abyſſins, Latinists,</hi> &amp;c. for they fear that elſe the Town might be taken from them again.</p>
                  <p>Within the Fort near the <hi>Fiſhgate,</hi> is ſtill a ſtrong high Tower, built up with great Free-ſtone, which is quite black through Age: wherefore ſome ſay, that it did anciently belong to the Fort, and was built by one of the Kings of <hi>Juda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:48499:150"/>So much I thought convenient to mention of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> concerning other famous places that are to be ſeen upon and about it, I will only mention the chiefeſt thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as you go out of the <hi>New Gate</hi> of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> there is a long Street wherein on the Left Hand is an ancient Church, of the holy Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> the Greater, Brother of <hi>John,</hi> which <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor, as alſo many more, did build on the Market Place of the upper City where he was beheaded. The <hi>Armenians</hi> that have poſſeſſion thereof, did conduct us into it, ſhewed us the Building, and the place where the holy Apoſtle was beheaded with the Sword (as you read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> the 12th. Chapter) by Order of <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> to whom he was delivered out of ſpite, as a ſeditious perſon, by the High Prieſt <hi>Abiathar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then we came to the place of the Habitation of <hi>Hannas,</hi> whereto <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord was firſt of all brought a priſoner, and bound (or fetter'd) wherein was nothing obſervable, only a large Court, and in it an old Chapel, called the <hi>Angels,</hi> which we ſoon left, and went out of the Gate of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> to the Habitation of <hi>Cayaphas,</hi> where we ſaw an Orange-tree planted in the place where the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> did warm himſelf when he denied our Saviour the third time: further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Chapel, called <hi>St. Salvators,</hi> where, in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was the Place of the High Prieſt, where Chriſt was ſeverely accuſed by <hi>Cayaphas,</hi> and by his Servants mocked, ſpit upon, and beaten; wherein is an Altar, whereon the great Stone of the Grave ſtill lieth, that ſtopped the Door of the Sepulchre, which is very like unto the Rock of the Grave in its breaking. That the Habitation of the High Prieſt was in the upper City <hi>Joſephus</hi> does teſtifie in the Seventeenth Chapter of his Second Book of the <hi>Deſolation</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſaith thus: <hi>When the rebellious</hi> Jews, <hi>that had the lower Town in poſſeſſion with the Temple, did undertake to poſſeſs themſelves alſo of the upper Town, they did aſſault it with all might and power, and at laſt take it; then they drove out the Soldiers, which had the Chief Prieſts and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48499:151"/>
Men in power with them, out of the upper Town, ſet the Habitation of</hi> Ananias <hi>the High Prieſt on fire and burnt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this on the top of the Mount, ſtands on the Plain a large Church, which the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monks had not long ago in poſſeſſion, and lived in it, wherefore their Father did call himſelf a <hi>Guardian</hi> of the holy Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> But after that the <hi>Turks</hi> did about Twenty years agon poſſeſs themſelves of it, and kept it to themſelves, and made a <hi>Mahumetan Moſche</hi> of it; the Monks were forced to flie, and take the Habitation where they now live inſtead thereof.</p>
                  <p>Of this Church or <hi>Moſche</hi> we ſaw only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Habitation of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> for no Chriſtian is allowed to go into it. It was built many years agon by <hi>Helena,</hi> Mother of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the Emperor, as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> teſtifieth in the Thirtieth Chapter of his Eighth Book: wherein is alſo included the Habitation the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were locked up in for fear of the <hi>Jews</hi>: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the paved Dining-Room (or Hall) wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his Diſciples did eat the Paſsover; where he alſo waſhed their Feet, and ſent the Holy Ghoſt after his Aſcenſion to them: where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note n="*" rend="inter">

Near unto this, in the place of the Palace of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the ſame Queen <hi>Helena</hi> ordered a Church to be built for the Holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and many more, whereof mention is made at large in the above quoted place.</p>
                  <p>This Mount extendeth its ſelf towards the South, out before the City, and hath on the other ſide where it is higheſt, other higher ones about it, diſtinguiſhed with Ditches and Valleys, <hi>viz.</hi> towards the Weſt Mount <hi>Gihon,</hi> at the bottom whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> was
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48499:151"/>
anointed King by the Prieſt <hi>Zadock</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> as we read in the Firſt Chapter of thr Firſt Book of <hi>Kings</hi>: upon this at the top towards the Road of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> lieth the Field of Blood, in their Language called <hi>Hakeldemas</hi> that was bought for 30 Silver Pieces; to bury the Pilgrims there, where you ſee ſtill to this day here and there large and deep holes, and one among the reſt very big one, wherein are ſtill to be ſeen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral whole Bodies lying by one another.</p>
                  <p>A deep Valley ſeparates this Mount from Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> which beginneth at the <hi>Fiſh-gate,</hi> and goeth down to the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi>: in it is a Conduit by the upper Pool called <hi>Aſuia</hi> in the Third Chapter of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> which is pretty large, yet without any Water) which receiveth its Water from the high Spring of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> this was covered by King <hi>Hezekias,</hi> and laid down to the Town of <hi>David,</hi> as we read in the Second Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> Chap. 32. The holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 7. Verſe 3. mentioneth it, when ſhe Lord ſaid to him; <hi>Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhub thy ſon, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the path of the fullers field,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Before Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> towards the South, at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Rivulet <hi>Kidron</hi> lieth the Mount of <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> in the Fourth Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. 23. called <hi>Maſhith:</hi> between this and Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> is a Valley, through which goeth down the Road by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> &amp;c. This is higher and ſteeper than any hereabout. There you ſee ſtill ſome old Walls of the Habitation wherein the Concubines of <hi>Solomon</hi> did live, after whom the King ran in his old Age; and they did ſo poſſeſs him, that they turned his Heart from God Almighty after their Gods, and ſo he did that that did not pleaſe the Lord God, as you may read in the Firſt Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. 11.

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:48499:152"/>Underneath the Mount was the Valley <hi>Benhinnem,</hi> wherein the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did build a Temple to the Idol <hi>Moloch,</hi> and did worſhip him, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Further towards the Eaſt, you ſee from the top of Mount <hi>Zion</hi> the Fountain and Pool of <hi>Siloah</hi> below in the Valley, called by <hi>Joſephus Tiropaean,</hi> which divideth this and the Temple Mount, and becometh to be very narrow between them, and extendeth it ſelf from the Rivulet <hi>Kidron</hi> towards the North to the place of Skulls, where it groweth ſo large again, that the lower Town of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his Tenth, and <hi>Zacharias</hi> in his Ninth Chapter, called <hi>The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) was ſituated therein.

                  <p>As we went about, and came to one of the places, the Monks did ſhew the Pilgrims in each of them, the Number of the Years for the Pardons laid there by his Holineſs, as in ſome Seven Years and Seven Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, but in ſome others, as in the place where the Holy Ghoſt was ſent, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> did eat the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his Diſciples, and waſhed their Feet, and where he at ſeveral times appeared when the Doors were ſhut: and where alſo (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ſaith) the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> after the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> her dear Child, did dwell for Fourteeen Years, &amp;c. full Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Indulgences from all Sins and Facts for ever.</p>

Wood to obtain Indulgence: or with opinion to come here nearer to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; becauſe all theſe things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to Scripture. As the Lord himſelf ſaith: <hi>Time will come that you ſhall neither on this Mount nor at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father.</hi> And he alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth us of theſe that ſay; <hi>Lo Chriſt is here, Chriſt is there, lo he is in the deſarts, he is in the Chamber:</hi> that we ſhould not believe them, nor go out, but rather confide on his promiſe, that he will be with us to the end of the World: and where two or three are met together in his Name that he will be in the middle of them. Wherefore our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no need, becauſe he is himſelf preſent with them that believe in him, of any Vicegerent, that ſhould on Earth uſurp ſuch Power, and take ſuch Honor and Glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to give Indulgence at his pleaſure: becauſe all theſe things belong only to God. When I ſaw that they did not much mind this my Diſcourſe, I let them alone in their Opinions, but yet I ſaw here and there all theſe places, and conſidered by my ſelf what our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> had, by his bitter Sufferings and Death, by his Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, procured us from his Heavenly Father. When the Pilgrims came to one of the above-mentioned places of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and had ſaid their Prayers, they went into it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated it, fell down again before it, and kiſſed it with great Submiſſion and Devotion; pulled out ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces, <hi>viz.</hi> Beads and Roſaries turned of the Wood of the Trees of the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> ſome wrought Points, Laces, &amp;c. tied together in Bundles, to touch the holy place with it; they alſo knocked off in ſome places (where they might) ſome ſmall Pieces, to take them along with them as conſecrated Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to diſtribute them amongſt their Friends at their Return.</p>
                  <p>All the while that they were thus buſie, I conſidered rather ſtanding behind, what our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had ſuffered for us in theſe places, how he had humbled himſelf, and came down to us miſerable Sinners, to help us, and to extol us that were fallen, and to make us free of the heavy Burthen of our Sins:
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48499:154"/>
how he was led before the Seat of Judicature of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> that we might not be led before the ſevere Judgment Seat of the Almighty God: that he ſuffered himſelf to be led captive and bound, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the Bands of the Devil and Death, and to ſave us from the Jaws of Hell: and as <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaith in his 53d. Chapter, Verſe 5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> But that our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the High Prieſt, and Scribes, &amp;c. for our ſakes, and that he was obedient to his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the Curſe of God and eternal Death. And to make us certain, that he had procured theſe his unſpeakable Benefits and Heavenly Treaſures for us, and that we really ſhould be partakers thereof; before his paſſion he did inſtitute his holy Supper upon the Mount, in the large upper Room, wherein he doth not only communicate them to us, but giveth us alſo (if we receive the holy broken Bread, and the bleſſed Cup, with true Faith according to the Inſtitution) his real Body and Blood, to feed us to eternal Life: where we then ſhall ſit, with our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all the elected ones (after this life) as Coheirs in the high upper Room of his Heavenly Father, at his Table, to eat and drink it with him anew. And that we might heartily comfort our ſelves with theſe his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefits, he alſo after his Aſcenſion, ſent us on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> his Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Truth, to incline our Hearts, to believe ſtedfaſtly all that he hath promiſed us in his holy Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, which was long before predicted by the holy Prophets was full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled on this Mount: whereof we read in ſeveral places of the holy Scripture, <hi>viz. Joel</hi> ii. 28. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs afterward that I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For on mount Zion, and in Jeruſalem, muſt be a Deliverance according to the promiſe of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ii. 3. <hi>Come ye and let us go up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for out of Zion ſhall go forth
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48499:154"/>
the law and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> So that the Preaching of Chriſt's holy Goſpel, and his Kingdom did begin from <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was afterwards ſpread abroad by his holy Apoſtles through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grant then, O our dear Lord</hi> Chriſt, <hi>unto us, thy Holy Ghoſt; that he may keep us in the Knowledge of thy holy Word, and that he may ſo ſtrengthen and comfort us in it, that we may freely and without any fear confeſs it before the Face of our Enemies and Adverſaries; and if they offend and proſecute us, that we may overcome our Croſſes and Perſecutions with patience, that thy Honor may be advanced, and our Conſtancy appear. Grant us alſo, that he may plant theſe thy Graces in our Hearts, that we may comfort our ſelves with the hope and expectation of thoſe Treaſures which thou haſt by thy Death and Paſſion merited and purchaſed for us. So that we may</hi> abide in thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and dwell in thy holy Hill <hi>for ever.</hi> Amen. <hi>Pſalm</hi> xv. 1.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Mount</hi> Moria <hi>and the Glorious Temple of</hi> Solomon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WIthin the City near to Mount <hi>Zion</hi> lieth another called <hi>Moria,</hi> divided from it by the Valley of <hi>Tiropaeon,</hi> which is now filled up and made even with the top (as I have ſaid before) that hereabout is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Depth or Unevenneſs to be ſeen. This as well as the other meets with the Rivulet or Brook of <hi>Kidron</hi> towards the North, and on both of them the Town lieth on the ſides or deſcent. This is very famous in the Holy Scripture, as you read <hi>Geneſis</hi> xxii. That the pious Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to offer his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> on this Hill, for a Burnt-Offering to the Lord: whereon <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> the firſt Founder and King of the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48499:155"/>
Town <hi>Salem,</hi> and Prieſt of the Almighty God, did firſt build a Temple, and therefore named the City <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So we read in the Second Book of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> Chap. iii. That on the ſame holy Mount King <hi>Solomon</hi> did begin to build a Houſe for the Lord, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> many years afterwards. This was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly very high, ſurrounded with deep Ditches and Cliffs, ſo that it would make a Man giddy to look down from the top into the depth. Wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> took a great deal of pains before they could get upon it, to take and deſtroy that glorious and well-built Temple, which was in the laſt Deſolation (as well as before in the firſt burnt by <hi>Nabuhcodonoſor</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed and razed to the Foundations, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them, <hi>Mark</hi> xiii. <hi>That there ſhould not be left one ſtone upon another that ſhould not be thrown down, becauſe they did not acknowledge the gracious time of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that all hopes might be taken away from the <hi>Jews,</hi> to return and to build the Temple again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh their Worſhip; <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperor, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all, ordered, in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 134, all to be broken down that was left, and to root it up, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh all heighths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fill up all Ditches, to level Cliffs, and to make the Ground even all over: he did alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Name and Religion of the Inhabitants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof introduced the Heatheniſh Idolatry. In the place of the Grave of Chriſt he built a Temple for the Idol <hi>Jupiter</hi>; on Mount <hi>Calvaria</hi> another for the Idol <hi>Venus</hi>; and another at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to the Idol <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>: and at laſt in the place where formerly in the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſtand the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> he erected his own Image on a high Column for his memory, which was ſtill ſtanding, in <hi>Hieronymus</hi>'s time. The heighth of this Mount cannot be obſerved any where elſe now then without by the Fountain <hi>Siloah,</hi> and in the Valley of <hi>Benhinnon,</hi> and ſo it did remain deſolate to the times of the great Emperor <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that, when the <hi>Jews</hi> undertook to rebuild the Temple at the Charge of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate (who
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48499:155"/>
would make <hi>Chriſt</hi> a liar, the Lord having ſaid that their Houſe ſhould be left unbuilt) a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake (when they had opened the Ground to lay the Foundation) did move and ſhake the whole place to that degree, that every thing was turned upſide down, and abundance of <hi>Jews</hi> did periſh in it. But when the <hi>Jews</hi> did not matter this, but endeavoured to go on with the Work in hand, the next day Flames of Fire broke out of the Ground, and fiery Beams ſtruck down from Heaven, which deſtroyed more than the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and burnt all their Tools, <hi>viz.</hi> Saws, Axes, Shovels, Hammers, &amp;c. When the <hi>Jews</hi> would not leave their Error for all this, the night following ſome ſmall glittering Croſſes like Stars fell down upon their Cloaths, which they could not waſh off the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor get out by any means: and an Earthquake and ſuch a violent Hurricane came upon it, that it diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Seeing that the Temple, together with the Mount it ſtood upon, are razed and deſolated, ſo that one can hardly now diſcern what they have been anciently every one that goeth by (becauſe the Lord did not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his own Houſe, where his Name was ſanctified) hath reaſon to be aſtoniſhed at it, and to call to mind the ſtrange anger of God againſt thoſe that leave the Lord their God, and adhere to other gods, ſerve and adore them.</p>
                  <p>Now adays the <hi>Turks</hi> have taken poſſeſſion of this Mount, and all the Ground whereon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple did ſtand, and have built a <hi>Mahumetan Moſche</hi> on it; which <hi>Homar</hi> the Third after the great Impoſtor <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> built when he had taken the holy Land and the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This is not very large nor high, but fine and covered with Lead, hath a great Court Yard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, paved with white Marble, and here and there Orange and Date Trees are planted in it, which is very pleaſant, about the ſides thereof are ſome high Towers and Gates, one whereof is vaſtly bigger than any of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48499:156"/>
the reſt, which is near to their <hi>Batzar,</hi> or Exchange, which is very old, high, and hath very good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in it, wherefore the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monks ſhew it inſtead of the Gate of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, before which lay the Man that was lame from his Mother's Womb, that begged Alms from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid: <hi>Silver and gold I have none, but ſuch as I have give I thee: In the Name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth, riſe up and walk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of the Gate of this Yard, as commonly in all their Church Porches, hung ſome Lamps. I could have willingly gone in before them, to ſee the Rock and Fountain, whereof <hi>Ezek.</hi> in his Forty ſeventh Chapter maketh mention, together with the inward Building, but becauſe according to their <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Laws, all thoſe that are not circumciſed are accounted to be unclean, therefore going into their Churches is forbid to <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> if any one is catch'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In this Court-Yard is ſtill another Gate, called the <hi>Golden Gate</hi> by the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> but becauſe it ſtands juſt over againſt the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> therefore it is to be taken to be the Gate <hi>Sur,</hi> or rather, as <hi>Nehemias</hi> ch. iii. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xlvii. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxi. ſay; For the Gate of the Stairs, which <hi>Semaia,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sahamia,</hi> the Keeper of them did build: through which our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did go into the Temple on Palm-Day, to drive out the Buyers and Sellers. Now altho this is walled up in the New Town Wall, ſo that you cannot go ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out or in; yet conſidering its ancient Arches, it looketh rather like a Church than a Town-Gate.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the Yard ſtands a <hi>Turkiſh Moſche,</hi> or Temple, called the Rock: this is eſteemed very much by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and next to thoſe of <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina</hi> reputed to be the moſt holy. Becauſe God Almighty hath wrought many great Miracles there: and that there <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as they falſly write of him in their Books) called by God to be the laſt and greateſt Prophet, did ride from <hi>Mecha</hi> to that of the holy Rock of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is Forty
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48499:156"/>
Days Journey, on a very ſwift Beaſt called <hi>Elmparae,</hi> conducted thither by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who, at his arrival did help him off of his Beaſt, tied it up, and then led him by the Hand into the Temple, where he found many Prophets ſtanding together in a Circle, which God had reſuſcitated for his Honor, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and to acquaint him with new good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and what God had prepared for him (I ſuppoſe ever burning Flames of Fire) among the reſt he did alſo find <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> each of them preſenting him, firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> with a Fatt of Wine, <hi>Abraham</hi> with a Fatt full of Milk, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> with a Fatt of Water. Then a Voice ſpake to him from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>If thou chuſeſt the Fatt with Wine, thou and thy People ſhall periſh: if thou chuſeſt the Fatt with Milk, thou ſhalt alſo periſh: but if thou chuſeſt the Fatt of Water, thou and thy People ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved eternally</hi>

                  <p>Theſe and many more inſipid Lies of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which are very ridiculous and ſilly Fables, are believed to be as true as the Goſpel by the <hi>Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> &amp;c. They alſo certainly believe (chiefly theſe that live at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the Pilgrims know) that on the laſt day their <hi>Mahomet</hi> is to come and ſeat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Rock of the Temple of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then when all the People of the Earth ſhall appear before the Lord of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſhall ask <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who the reſt are (meaning the <hi>Christians</hi> that have been under the Yoak of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor) then ſhall <hi>Mahomet</hi> anſwer and ſay, <hi>They are theſe that have ſerved me faithfully:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall let them paſs into Paradiſe and eternal Felicity: which they believe to conſiſt in gratifying Fleſhly Luſts and Deſires, in Eating and Drinking, Fine Cloaths, coſtly Jewels, Gold, Silver, Pearls, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Spring-Gardens, beautiful and cleanly Women. Therefore the Temple is ſo highly eſteemed by the <hi>Turks</hi> and others of the ſame Faith, and believed to be ſo holy, that they go into it on their bare Feet with great Devotion, and come twice a year thither in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48499:157"/>
in great Caravans from all places, moved thereunto by the great Zeal they have towards their <hi>Mahomet</hi>: but chiefly theſe Pilgrims that have been at <hi>Madina-Talnabi,</hi> and <hi>Mecha,</hi> that is Three Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney farther, who return by the way of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which is now by them caled <hi>Chutz</hi>) to ſay alſo their Prayers there: and are of opinion, that if they ſhould do otherwiſe, than to come thither, their Peregrination would not be acceptable to God. Amongſt theſe are a good many Renegado <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that go with them to <hi>Mecha,</hi> to get by their Devotion into greater preferment, and Wealth, wherefore they are eſteemed by them as holy and creditable ones (altho they are full of Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Roguery) as theſe that come from <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> own Blood: they keep them very honorably, and pray for them as their Victors, and endue them with great great and peculiar Privileges, ſo that their ſingle Witneſs is as valueable as three, four, ſix, ten of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according as they have been oftener in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And that every body may know them, they put upon their Turbans on their Heads, their <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s green Colours, as thoſe of their Prieſts do, which eſteem themſelves to be his Relations, which are only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as the <hi>Perſians</hi> wear their red Colour) to wear ſuch Turbants. Wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> believe it to be a ſin to cover thoſe Members, which Nature hath made ſecret, with that Colour which their Prophet did bear on his Head. When the before-mentioned Renegado-<hi>Chriſtians</hi>; are come to this degree, they are bought by every Body for Money, to bear witneſs before the <hi>Cady,</hi> or any other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrate, and that even in Cauſes whereof they have not the leaſt knowledge. So it happens daily, that thoſe that give larger Bribes to the Magiſtrate, and do exceed their Adverſaries in number of Witneſſes, make their loſt and foul cauſe good: and of this they make no Conſcience, becauſe their <hi>Alcoran</hi> teacheth them, that God doth not impute to them perjury, but only if they do not invoke him: ſo that it is full Satisfaction, if they feed ten poor ones for this Tranſgreſſion, or if they cloath them, or if they redeem one priſoner: but if they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48499:157"/>
enough to do this, they faſt for it three times. This is of a very ill conſequence, becauſe they are not afraid to be Perjured and to cheat others. And although theſe and other the like Sins, are very common amongſt the <hi>Turks, Viz.</hi> Robbing, and to break their Faith, &amp;c. (which are directly againſt God) yet for all that theſe (becauſe they have loſt all remembrance of Confeſſion, Penitence or mending of their Lives) exceed them in this by far. Beſides all this they do not let the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> know who or what they are, but rather ſtudy to their utmoſt Power, to abuſe and hurt them, as often as they find an opportunity, nay they would not ſpare their very Lives, if they dare do it for fear of the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Magiſtrates. In this they are very like unto the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> (which in former Ages were ſubject unto the <hi>Soldans</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and did live on the ſouth ſide of Mount <hi>Libanus</hi>) which, as Defenders and Protectors of their own Religion, were ſet out before other <hi>Saracens,</hi> to Murder and Kill clandeſtinly all thoſe that did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their <hi>Mahometan</hi> Laws and Religion. But after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor did beat the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and took his Dominions from him, the Fury of theſe Aſſaſſinators was alſo ſoon quelled. For the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> doth not allow in any of his Provinces, of Murthers, as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> did, but puniſheth them ſeverely, and keepeth very ſtrict Laws that no Body may hurt the other, which you may Conclude by this, that if one doth but fetch Blood from the other in the leaſt, he is not only mulcted in one or two Ducats, but ſometimes in Forty, Fifty, Nay, ſometimes in a Hundred, according to the Hainouſneſs of the Crime, and the Ability of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; and ſo he keepeth his Subjects in Peace and Quietneſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Pilgrims that go to <hi>Mecha,</hi> there are many others in their great <hi>Caravans,</hi> that rather, like unto Pedlers, endeavour to get thither with ſmall Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by the help of their <hi>Carvatſcharas,</hi> or Inns, and Hoſpitals, to make good Profit there, by Buying and Selling, then out of Devotion to wait on their <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and amongſt them there are alſo ſometimes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but at their Arrival they muſt not Viſit the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Places, much leſs touch them. Wherefore they buy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand all ſorts of Merchandiſes, chiefly at <hi>Cayro,</hi> (from whence, to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it's ten days Journey) to ſell or ſwap them at <hi>Mecha,</hi> and other places. Which cuſtom we need not think to be ſtrange among the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſeeing that a great many are found among the <hi>Roman</hi> Pilgrims, that pretend to be good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that go Pilgrimages to <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Jacob, Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. not only to get his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes Abſolution and Indulgences, but rather to make good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all theſe Pilgrims, chiefly theſe that have been oftneſt at <hi>Mecha</hi> are by the <hi>Turks</hi> in greateſt eſteem, and that Green Colour, which only belongeth to the Prieſts to wear, is the ſooner allowed them, whereby they may be known, as the Brothers of St. <hi>Jacob</hi> are known by the Scallopſhells: The ſame is alſo with their Camels, for on the lower part of one of their Forefeet, you may ſee as many ſmall Chains hung as they have been times there in <hi>Caravans,</hi> ſo that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may ſoon diſcern them.</p>

Underneath it is a great Cave, ſo wide that ſome hundred Horſe may with eaſe be drawn up in Battalia therein. This is alſo in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> dare no more come in here then in the other. By this Prohibition (<hi>Viz.</hi> That the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſhall admit into their

Churches or Porches thereof no Strangers which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Laws are not Cleanſed and Waſhed) you may eaſily ſee, that the <hi>Turks</hi> have taken many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Laws from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and according to their depraved underſtanding and mind, Tranſcribed them into their <hi>Alcoran:</hi> So we ſee that anciently they have their Circumciſion, Offerings, Waſhings, Faſts at certain times of the year, marrying more then one Wife, not Eating any thing that is Unclean, or Pork, or what is ſuffocated, not having Bells, not drinking Wine, as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſt muſt not do, derived from the <hi>Jews:</hi> But this laſt Law concerning not drinking of Wine, is not only not kept, for they drink thereof without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let it be as ſtrong as it can, more than ony other Nation. It being then true that they chooſe the Fatt with Wine preſented them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is before ſaid, to their own Ruin and Deſtruction, wherefore I pray that God may fulfil their Prophecy, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>SEing I have here above made mention, amongſt the reſt of the Places and Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh Moſchèes,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Mahomet</hi> their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: I cannot but alſo Relate ſomething of theit Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and Superſtitious Life and belief, as I have obſerved in my Travels, and during my ſtay among them, chiefly ſomething of their outward Ceremonies, good Works, wherewith they think to fulfil the Laws, to cleanſe themſelves from their manifold Sins and Tranſgreſſions, and to obtain Gods Mercy and Love. Wherefore they ſtrive that they may be found always buſie in theſe good Works, whereof they reckon the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48499:159"/>
chiefeſt to be; Alms, Pilgrimage, Faſtings, to make Offerings, to abſtain from certain Food or Drinks, frequent Waſhing, Praying, upon which two laſt they look moſt of all, as the true means, by which (if they keep them diligently) they may be freed and abſolved from their Sins, according to the Promiſes of their dear Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Such and the like have alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> had in the Old Teſtament, where without doubt their Prophet (being by his Mother an <hi>Iſhmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>) had them alſo. But ſeeing that he alſo Attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to theſe Abſolution and Satisfaction for our Sins, and alſo conſequently Salvation and everlaſting Life: Therefore all thoſe that follow and believe his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, miſs the only Mediator and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (of whom as well as of his Holy Word, they elſe have a good Opinion, as appeareth by their <hi>Alcoran</hi>) in whom God the Father Almighty will only be known, Invoked, and Adored. As St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in his 5th. Chap. 23. <hi>He that Honoureth not the Son, Honoureth not the Father that hath ſent him</hi>: And <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. where Jeſus ſaith, <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father</hi>; and in the 4th Chapt. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>There is no Salvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> wherefore although <hi>Mahomet</hi> doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Command and Teach, that we muſt Adore the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, yet they do not know the true God, that will only be Adored and Honoured in his Beloved Son; and beſides <hi>Mahomet</hi> will not allow that God hath a Son, and much leſs, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the true God, in whom we ſhall believe. For in his Diabolical and Blaſphemous mind and thoughts he hath this precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if God ſhould have a Son he might come to be Diſobedient unto him (as happeneth ſometimes chiefly amongſt them, to worldly Princes) which would expoſe all Creatures in Heaven, as well as on Earth unto great Danger. So he denieth the Deity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be no more (as <hi>Arius</hi> doth) then a great Saint, and meer Man. So he hath the ſame Opinion with <hi>Macedonius,</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt whom, and Chriſt he ſometimes maketh but one perſon. And ſo the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48499:159"/>
                     <hi>Turks</hi> know no more, by the Inſtruction of their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Prophet, of the true living God (that is one in his Eſſence and three in Perſons) then when they Adored the Fire, water and other Elements, nay Heaven and Earth (as alſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> have done) before they come over to the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and adhered to the Doctrine of their <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And beſides they have no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they do not believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Meſſenger of God, was Crucified, Dead and Buried, but that another, that was very like him, ſuffered in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of him, becauſe he was Seated in Heaven (where into God received him, and that he was to return again at the End of the World) a great deal higher then that he could be ſo ſhamefully killed by the <hi>Jews</hi> that impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people; wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> admire it very much, that ſo many Pilgrims of all Nations, come to ſee the Grave of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with ſo great a Devotion, which is not his. And although the <hi>Turks</hi> prefer their <hi>Mahomet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo do not believe right neither of his Eſſence nor of his perſon, ſo that therefore all their Worſhip, with what Devotion ſoever performed, is null and in vain, becauſe it is not in <hi>Chriſt</hi>: Yet for all that they Praiſe and Eſteem <hi>Chriſt</hi> very high, and Extol him far beyond any Man, as one that was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that hath here on Earth carried on his Doctrine, and confirmed it with powerful Miracles. Wherefore they Eſteem the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other Writings of the Prophets, but chiefly the Four Evangeliſts, which they call the Book <hi>Jugilis</hi> (and the Books of <hi>Moſes Threſit</hi>) as true and Godly. And ſometimes they pretend ſo fairly, that an ordinary Man that is not well inſtructed in the Chief Articles of Chriſtianity, although there is ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, might eaſily be ſeduced, and perſwaded. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Turks</hi> will not allow, neither to <hi>Jews, Moors,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nay not to their own Nation, to ſay any thing ill of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor to Curſe him, but if any body ſhould preſume to do it, the ſoles of his Feet are ſtruck very ſeverely with many blows, and he is Fined beſides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Ability. So their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48499:160"/>
the Holy Scripture very much, and ſaith, that it containeth Truth and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>If they would but often look into it (as their <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> teacheth them in ſeveral places) to read in it, and mend their Lives according to it, they might eaſily be brought to the right way again; but he himſelf doth not ſtand by his words, but falleth off again from them afterwards, and ſpeaketh quite otherways of the holy Scripture, and that ſo differing, that he quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf. For as he did commend it before, ſo now he diſcommendeth it again, when he ſaith, That it hath been (becauſe it is too difficult to be kept) long ſince quite out of Doors, chiefly in thoſe parts where is written, That we muſt do good to our Enemies; leave all for his ſake; love God with all our heart, &amp;c. and our Neighbor as our own ſelf. And that therefore he <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was peculiarly and purpoſely choſen by God Almighty, to bring down with him the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and communicate it to the World (that was then drown'd in Luſts, Sin and Vices) to reform and bring it to rights again. Beſides this he knew very well how to diſguiſe his Tricks, and how to behave himſelf in his Life and Converſation, devoutly and diſcreetly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the People, and how to blind them under this pretence, that they did believe him, and receive him the ſooner to be a great Prophet and Meſſenger from God. When he found that he had got a good Party, and a great many Adherents, that impowered him, he Studied daily more and more, to order his Laws ſo, that they might be acceptable and pleaſing to all the World. And thus he got in a great many places ſuch a fame, that, to our Grief, in theſe times, he hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and poſſeſſed a great part of the World with his Erroneous and Poiſonous Doctrine, the <hi>Turks</hi> cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhering to this Doctrine, therefore their Hearts are ſo blinded with darkneſs, that they cannot have any true knowledge either of God the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo they miſs of the right way that would bring them to the Knowledge, and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Sins, and conſequently to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereof, and ſo make them Children of God,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48499:160"/>
and Heirs of Life Everlaſting. But on the contrary, they remain Impenitent, and perſiſt in their ſinful Life, with ſuch a Confidence and Security, that they know not when they commit Sins; as to take a Mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Goods away by force; to deſtroy his Houſe and Lands; to undermine his Life and Livelihood; and alſo, to contaminate themſelves with Uncleanneſs, Whoredom, Sodomy: Not to keep an Oath that hath been taken; to Revenge themſelves; from whence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, Envy, Hatred, Anger, Contention, Murder, &amp;c. as we hear, what Injuſtice and Violence the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> committeth daily upon our Brethren and Siſters, that border upon his Dominions; which we need not to wonder at, becauſe, if they fall out amongſt themſelves, they try all Unjuſt means to Revenge themſelves. Wherefore they accuſe their Adverſaries often falſely (becauſe they dare not offer any violence) before their Judges, and ſo bring them to Damage, Trouble and Pains. But when they have committed one of theſe, or the like Facts, and have a mind to free themſelves of it, or to be Abſolved, they go after their own invented Devotion, to good Works, Alms, Prayers, Faſting, Redeeming of Captives, &amp;c. to make ſatisfaction to God for their committed Sins, as their <hi>Alcoran</hi> teacheth them. And ſo they lead a Life of good outward Converſation, and are very diligent in their Devotion, chiefly in going to their Prayers at the five Cuſtomary hours of the Day, when they leave their VVork, and go to Church. And ſeeing that in theſe Countries they have neither Clocks not VVatches, to tell them the time of the Day and Prayers, inſtead of them they have their Prieſts (called <hi>Meitzen</hi> by them) on the Steeples, which are ordered to cry out the Hours with a loud Voice, that you may hear them as far almoſt as the Ringing of a Bell, even throughout the whole Town. The firſt Hour of Prayers is an Hour and half before Day-light: The ſecond is about Noon: The third (which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Latzera</hi>) is about Three a Clock in the Afternoon: The fourth is at Sun-ſet; and the fifth when after the Sun is down, the Twilight or whitiſhneſs of the Skies is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48499:161"/>
gone, and the Stars appear clearly. Sometimes two of theſe Prieſts ſing together, which is common in great Towns, and they ſing almoſt as with us they ſing a Ballad, ſo that while the one is ſinging, the other may fetch his breath; and ſo they ſing by turns, until the Song is at an end. When I came firſt into theſe Countries, and hear'd them Sing about that time in the Morning, I believed the <hi>Turks</hi> did it that they might brisk themſelves up to go to Work, until I heard them do the ſame at other hours in the day time, and underſtood they were their Prieſts. So they Sing about Five a Clock at Night very well, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſomething longer, becauſe of the Sick that live near, which deſire it of them, to make them cheerful, and to have a good heart, which we need not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, for their Clergy (which are not Wiſer or more Learned than the Lay-men) know not how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, or to make them joyful, much leſs how to give good and wholſome Inſtruction, out of the Word of God (although they believe it to be true) how to obtain forgiveneſs of Sin, and Gods Mercy, Love, or Commiſeration, but think it to be ſufficient, if they Admoniſh them that lye a dying, to think of God, and to Pray to him that he may have Mercy upon them; and afterwards to waſh their Body to cleanſe them quite from all Sins, according to the Law of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which they highly eſteem, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they ſerve not only the Living but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Dead; wherefore the <hi>Turks</hi> waſh themſelves daily, chiefly at the Hours of their Prayer, when they are a going to Church, and that very carefully and diligently, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Hands, Privy-Members, Head, Neck, Feet, nay the whole Body, according as they are Contaminated or become Unclean. So in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their Sins, they have three ſorts of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereof one is that of the whole Body, which theſe muſt make uſe of that are not Married, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate themſelves with Concubines; wherefore the Baths are kept continually in an equal heat, and are open to any body both by Day and Night, that theſe that have occaſion to waſh their whole Body, may not
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48499:161"/>
be hindered in their Devotion, but ſoon go to Church again. The ſecond is performed on the Organs of the five Senſes, and the Head, to cleanſe them from all ſpots and blemiſhes, which are contracted by ill thought, and frivolous and unſeemly diſcourſes; wherefore there are ſeveral Ciſterns here and there, but chiefly in their Churches and Chapels, where they waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt, that being clean, they may be worthy to come to Church to Prayers, for if they ſhould omit it, they believe that their Prayers would not be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and ſo he would not hear them. So they begin firſt with waſhing of their Hands, then they lift up the Water with the hollow of their Hands, and ſo let it run down to their Elbow; then they waſh their Mouth, Noſe, Eyes, Ears, Head, Neck, and at laſt their Feet, and ſpeak ſome peculiar words with it. When they have no Water, which often happeneth in large Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> they are allowed by their Laws inſtead thereof, to rub theſe Members over with Sand. But that they may not be hindered by their Cloaths, from coming to theſe Members, they wear ſuch ones that have wide Sleeves, no gatherings about their Neck, nor have any Strings about their Drawers. The third ſort is alſo eſteemed to be very neceſſary, and is made uſe of as often as they empty their Body by Stool or Urine, or Belching, and ſo they waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cowring down before the Ciſterns, publickly without ſhame, both before and behind, in the ſight of every Body. According to what hath been ſaid, we ſee that they mind only the outward cleanſing of their Body, and ſo they look alſo upon the outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, rather than to think how they ought, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Commands, to cleanſe themſelves from their inward Leproſie, by the Bath of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to Circumciſe their Hearts, by an inward Spiritual Circumciſion, whereof they know nothing. When their Clergy-men have cried out the Hours, from the Steeples to the <hi>Batzars,</hi> or <hi>Exchanges,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Turks</hi> have waſhed and cleanſed themſelves, they go into their Chapels, which are in the middle of their great <hi>Camps,</hi> or <hi>Carvatſchars,</hi> where I could ſee it
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48499:162"/>
beſt, becauſe I durſt not go into their <hi>Moſques.</hi> After they have left their Shoes at the Gate, they do not turn, nor look back for one another to ſpeak, but go ſtraight forwards, until they come to their places where they ſtand ſtill, and look upon their Prieſt that is before them, and mind him, when he beginneth the Prayers, that they may ſay it after him, and imitate his Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or means, whereof he maketh uſe, as the lifting up his Hands, ſtroking over his Forehead, bending his whole Body forwards, falling down upon his Knees, kiſſing the Earth; and at length when the <hi>Leila hillalla</hi> beginneth, turning their Heads from one ſide to the other, whereby they give a hint, That they are in Peace, and good Will with God and their Neighbors. While they are in their Holy Places, you ſhall hear none of them Sneeze, Cough, Hawk or Spit, for they are of Opinion, that, if they ſhould do ſo, God would not hear their Prayers ſo effectually, becauſe they ſhould not be perfectly clean. They have no ſet Form of their Prayers, and Pray generally for good Fortune, and other Worldly welfare; for Victory for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; that God may ſend great Diviſions amongſt us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that ſo they may have a better opportunity to fall upon us, and to beat us. They ſuffer no Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their Temples or Chapels, and are only for Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the true and only God, Creator of Heaven and Earth; and ſo inſtead of them they have Pictures of ſine Plants or Flowers, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Roſes, &amp;c. and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi>; and ſo you find on their Gold and Silver Coins, no Pictures or Images of their Emperors, as upon ours, but only the Names of them, or of the Towns where they are Stamped, in <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters, (which are common to both Nations) together with the date of the Year, which they begin from the time when <hi>Mahomet</hi> fled into the Deſarts, which for that reaſon they call the Year of <hi>Hegira,</hi> where he got a great number of Adherents, and was made by them a King; this was done in the Year of Chriſt 622. After they have ended their Prayers, they begin to talk to one another, and ſo every one of them goeth home to VVork again; and they are allowed on their
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48499:162"/>
Feaſt-days (which they keep on <hi>Friday,</hi> as we do on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi>) to open their Shops again after Prayers, and to go to VVork, becauſe they ſay that Idleneſs may the eaſier draw them into Sins. So one may eaſily know by their Shops, according as they are opened or ſhut up on theſe three days, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they belong to <hi>Chriſtians, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi>; beſides none of theſe forceth one to obſerve the others Holy-days, and ſo they live peaceably and quietly together. Before the <hi>Turks</hi> Holy-day beginneth, they lighten on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night before, as ſoon as it beginneth to be dark, upon their high Steeples, many Lamps, whereof they hang without on the Galleries round about, three rows one above the other, ſo that as you look upon them in the Night, they look like unto a threefold Garland; they let them burn ſo long until they go out of themſelves one after the other. The ſame Lamps they alſo light every Night during their <hi>Lent,</hi> which beginneth in their Month <hi>Romadan</hi> (ſo called by the <hi>Arabians</hi>) and doth laſt all that Month long. Their Year conſiſteth of Twelve Months, which they Accompt by the Moon-lights; ſo that their Months do not agree with ours, (for theirs have not one with the other above 29 or 30 days) and conſequently their Years want between 10 or 11 days of ours, ſo that their <hi>Lent</hi> falleth at an uncertain time, ſometimes in the Spring, and ſometimes in the Summer, &amp;c. ſo in my time it began in <hi>December,</hi> and ended in <hi>January.</hi> During all this time they are very Devout, and ſtrive to be at the Prayers and Duties; for if any body ſhould Dye in <hi>Lent</hi> time, that had uſed not to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent them, they would look upon him as a loſt and damned Man, and doubt whether they ſhould Bury him or no. During their <hi>Lent</hi> they Eat nothing before Night; when the Stars appear, then every one goeth home to Eat, or elſe in the great <hi>Batzars</hi> to a Cooks Shop, to buy Victuals, where all Night long is ſo great a throng of poor People, that have nothing to Eat at home, that they lift one another almoſt up; there you ſee one Eating, another Drinking, another Crying out, others Quarrelling, which cauſeth ſuch a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48499:163"/>
Crowd and Noiſe, as is enough to make one Deaf and Giddy. When <hi>Lent</hi> is at an end, then they begin their <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Feaſt (which they call <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lubaira</hi>) which they keep with great Solemnity for three days, ſalute one another very kindly, and wiſh one the other all health and happineſs, as we do on <hi>New-years-Day</hi>: They alſo ſeek all ſorts of Paſtime, chiefly the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which in great places erect Gibbets three Fathoms high, to the top whereof they tye ſtrong Ropes, almoſt like as the Children do in our Country, where they Swing others for a ſmall recompence; when any body ſits in it, two ſtand ready with a broad String, one on each ſide, which they fling before him, and fling him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with it, and ſo ſet him a Swinging. Others run before the People that are walking, and ſprinkle them with ſweet ſmelling Water, to get a little ſpell of Money out of them, chiefly the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they will not eaſily leave before they have ſatisfied them; wherefore they are neceſſitated to ſtay at home on theſe days. Not long after they keep another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Feaſt, called <hi>Chairbairam,</hi> where they alſo uſe all ſorts of Geſticulations, which were too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late here; they do not Faſt on thoſe days, but they Sacrifice young Steers and Wethers, &amp;c. cut them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall pieces, to diſtribute them among the People, for the Honor of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he did obey God, and would have Sacrified his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> to him: At this abundance of Heathens congregate themſelves in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places before the Towns, to go in Pilgrimage to <hi>Medina-Talnabi, Mecha,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for love to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Amongſt them many are found, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered again from dangerous Diſtempers, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from great Dangers, and then did make a Vow, either to go on Pilgrimage to one of theſe places, or elſe to kill ſuch a number of Beaſts to diſtribute among the Poor as an Alms.</p>
                  <p>According to what I have ſaid before, that they compute their Months more by the Moon-light, and ſo accompt Twelve of them to a Year, they obſerve mightily the Change of the Moon, chiefly the New Moon, to ſee it again. Wherefore at that time they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48499:163"/>
go often in great Numbers out, unto the next Hill, to obſerve it the better, after Sun ſet. He that ſeeth it firſt ſheweth it with great rejoycing to his Companions. In their Prognoſtications they alſo mind the Moons Light and according to that, they make their Accompt, to know then if any thing ſhall happen. They have alſo (as ſome of them have told me) a peculiar Book, which they keep very cloſe to themſelves, wherein is briefly Written, what ſhall happen to them every year, whether it be good or bad: This beginneth in the ſame Year, with their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for 1000 Year, when this is at an End, they have nothing more of that Nature worth any thing.</p>
                  <p>And being they go no further, ſome will deduce or conclude from thence, that their Reign will ſoon have an end, when thoſe years are paſſed. Wherefore they fear the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> very much, and confeſs themſelves, that they expect to ſuffer a great blow from the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>: And this one may ſee or conclude, from hence for on their Holidays in the Morning about 9 of the Clock, they ſhut up the Gates of their Towns, great Champs, and other publick Habitations, as I found at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> ſo that many times I could not get either out or in until they opened them again, for they fear at that time to be Aſſaſſinated by the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being then that their Term of Years is near expired, for when I lived in theſe Places in the year 1575. they Writ 982 of this ſame Term, ſo that there was not quite 18 Years more to come.

have begun their Reign almoſt at the ſame time when <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould appear, about the year 666 as we Read in the 13th Chapter and the laſt Verſe of St. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation.</hi> And beſides it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in theſe miſerable times (when it ſeems as if every thing would turn topſie turvy) that theſe Years are paſſed, and that Satan is looſed, as if our dear Lord God would make an End of this malicious World. Add that ſome Learned Mathematicians do Prognoſticate that at theſe times, but chiefly in the year 1588. great Alterations will be in all the parts of the World. When we add to this Date the 42 Months, or 1260 days, or the 3½ years, whereof the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and alſo the Holy Evangeliſt and Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation</hi> make mention, the Eighteen Years that are ſtill wanting of the 1000 Years of their <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as is above ſaid) will be compleated, ſo that theſe two years Numbers do very well again agree together.</p>

This is almoſt black with Age, and ſo Artificially Erected, that one can hardly find any juncture, where the Stones are put together. This was the High Place (as it is ſaid) before the Judgment Hall, whereon the Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men uſe to be expoſed to the ſight of the People, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> durſt not go into the Houſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature at their High Feaſts, as <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſunday</hi> (as you may Read in the 18th Chap. of St. <hi>John</hi>) that they might not make themſelves Unclean, but Eat of the Paſchal Lamb: Wherefore <hi>Pilat</hi> did ſeveral times go out to the People to ſhew them our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſit down in the Judgment Seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> as you Read in the 19th Chap. of St. <hi>John</hi> Verſ. 13. This Arch is open at the Top in the Middle, and hath two other ſmall Arches about the widneſs of an ordinary door one by the other ſupported by a Marble Column, in one of them ſtood <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his Crown of Thorns on, and <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> in the other, when he ſaid to the People, <hi>Behold the Man.</hi>

Wherefore, although it is not the ſame (which hath been burnt long agone by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afterwards Rooted out by the <hi>Romans</hi>) yet it is built in the ſame Place, where the King's Palace did ſtand, on the height of Mount <hi>Bethzetha,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> Teſtifieth, from the North over againſt the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Fort <hi>Antonia</hi>: Where our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Mocked and Abuſed by <hi>Herod</hi> and his Servants, and had a White Garment put upon him, and ſo was ſent back again to <hi>Pilate.</hi> In theſe Habitations, chiefly theſe of <hi>Pilate,</hi> are ſtill to this day, <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrates <hi>(Sanchiachs, Cadis, and Soubaſhaws)</hi> dwelling, that keep Courts of Judicature there; and therefore no body is admitted to come in, before he hath Gratified the Maſter and Servants.

                  </argument>
                  <p>ON the 27th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> in the year 1575 after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> did ſend to the other Lords of the Temple, to let us in to the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvaria</hi> (which the <hi>Turks</hi> keep always Locked up.) But we and ſome other Friers in their own Habit, went with their Father <hi>Guardian</hi> to the Temple of the Mount, which firſt of all the Pious Queen <hi>Hellen</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Great Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (after ſhe had deſtroyed the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> that was Built upon the Place of the Grave) did Build, as ſhe did alſo build ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches in ſeveral Places, <hi>Viz.</hi> That at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Born: That of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> the greater, in the Place of the Upper Town, where he was Beheaded: And an other on the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Aſcend into Heaven: As alſo another at <hi>Bethania,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Raiſe <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his dear Friend, from the Dead, and in many other places, at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and on the Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> &amp;c. But when afterward the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was many times Beſieged, and at length taken from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by the unbelieving <hi>Saracens, Hequen</hi> that malicious King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> did in the year of Chriſt 1011. Demoliſh theſe Churches, and ſo they remained until after his Deceaſe his Son <hi>Daber</hi> came to the Government, who afterwards in the year 37. did give leave to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (when he renewed with him their Old Correſpondency) to Rebuild it again at his own Coſt and Charges. In theſe our times, when it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> free Egreſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, is quite denied to the <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrims,</hi> that come to ſee the Holy Places: For when they ſaw that many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> came yearly thither from all Places, <hi>Viz.</hi> From <hi>Armenia, Aethiopia, Syria, Aegypt, Greece,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48499:166"/>
Italy,</hi> Nay from all Places of <hi>Europe,</hi> they have put a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sum of Mony (according as they are near, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, under his Dominions or not) to be paid by them, to be admitted. For ſome pay two or three Seckins or Ducats, other four and five; but we that are Outlandiſh, as <hi>Italians, French-men,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> (as well knowing that we do not ſpare for Mony) muſt pay Nine Seckins a piece, and that without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, muſt be paid in weighty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Venetian</hi> Ducats: And they keep the Temple Locked up cloſe, until every one of them have paid their due: By theſe means the <hi>Grand Senior</hi> hath acquired himſelf a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable yearly Revenue, which amounts to ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats yearly. But yet it is now adays nothing near to what it hath been formerly, when all was under Popiſh Darkneſs, and the Pilgrims uſed to Flock thither in great Numbers. For ſince in our time, by the Grace of God, the Holy Goſpel hath been brought to Light again, and began to be Preached (which ſheweth us a far nearer and better way to find <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to have true and full Pardon and Remiſſion of our Sins) ſo that daily more come to the knowledge of the Truth, and return to the Lord, his Revenues decreaſe as much as the Number of the Pilgrims that uſed to reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>When we came pretty near to the Temple, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have ſeen Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> told us, that this Mount, together with the holy Grave, and the Garden (wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> did firſt appear unto <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>) were intirely taken into the Temple, ſo that no heigth at all was to be ſeen without.</p>
                  <p>Juſt when we came into the Court of the Temple there appeared an old Heatheniſh Priſon, wherein are Priſoners kept to this day, near which did ſtand the <hi>Priſon-Gate</hi> (whereof we ſaw ſtill ſome part of the Wall up in the Wall of the Church) through which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did carry his Croſs to the place of Sculls, which in former days was without the Town, as you may chiefly in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. 17. V. 20. clearly ſee, where he writes; <hi>And they led him out to crucifie him.</hi> And in the Thirteenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Verſ. 12.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48499:166"/>
where it is plainly writ, that <hi>Chriſt ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> But when afterwards the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> did rebuild and enlarge the deſolated Town, he did alſo ſurround with a Wall the place where our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did ſuffer, which was without towards the North-Weſt, beyond the Mount <hi>Moria,</hi> ſo that now it is ſituated almoſt in the middle of the City of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and becuſe of this Inlargement he call'd the Town after his Sirname <hi>Helia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſtaying a great while at the Gate, before they did open it unto us, ſeveral <hi>Oriental Chriſtians,</hi> to wit, <hi>Greeks, JACOBITES, Armenians,</hi> &amp;c. came to us to viſit their Prieſts, and to perform their Devotion in it, ſo that about Three-ſcore went in with us.</p>
                  <p>The Building of the Temple is very large, of ſtrong Walls, and ſo thick, that it taketh away the Light within: it is richly covered with Grey Marble within and without, and ſupported by ſome Marble Pillars about a Fathom and a half thick, ſo ſtrongly, that one may conclude from thence, that neither Labour nor Coſts were ſpared in its Building. Yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> (notwithſtanding the holy Places and the Coſtlineſs of the Building) have in ſome places ſpoiled and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſome part of the Walls thereof, ſo that now they are no more like to the old ones that were before, and beſides (as the <hi>Guardian</hi> told us) half of it is hardly remaining. Yet it is ſtill very large, and ſo well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up again, that one can hardly perceive the Loſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>As we went through, we paſſed by the Grave of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in a glorious large Chapel, called our <hi>Ladies</hi> which the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> have in poſſeſſion, and is hung with Tapeſtry very well wrought. Within it is a great Altar, on each ſide whereof is to be ſeen a Nick, artificially made of white Marble, the Windows whereof are very well guarded with Iron Bars: in that towards the Left Hand is kept a piece of the Column whereon <hi>Chriſt</hi> was whip'd; it is of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Colour, three ſpans long, and four over. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Right there is a ſmall Crucifix, in the middle whereof is in-laid a ſmall piece of the true Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:48499:167"/>From thence we went further into their Veſtiary; which hath ſeveral large Rooms, where we ſtaid until the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> had put on their uſual Habits to go their Rounds with us, and to ſhew us the holy places with the uſual Ceremonies. When they had made themſelves ready we came out again into the Church, and left the Chancel of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that is in the middle, and the holy Grave upon our Right Hand, and went to the Left to another Chapel, whereby the <hi>Grecians</hi> have an Altar without, by which in the Marble Floor, are two Holes to be ſeen, wherein they pretend that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was detained priſoner until they had fixed the Croſs for him on the place of the Sculls. This Chapel is within very deep, and ſo dark, that when you go into it you believe that you go into a Cave, where the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> believe, as I underſtood by a <hi>French</hi> Man of their Convent, who was in a Prieſt's Habit, and as we went about, ſtanding before the Altar, did tell us, what they had done to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place; that they did detain <hi>Chriſt</hi> there (as in a place where into they threw the Duſt) to mock him, until his Croſs was got ready for him.</p>
                  <p>Juſt by the Chapel behind the Chancel, they ſhew on a high Arch another place, where the Soldiers did ſhare <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Cloaths amongſt them, and caſt Lots for his Coat.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat farther about they ſhew a pair of Stairs of Twenty nine Steps, which we deſcended, and came into a great Chapel of Queen <hi>Helen,</hi> ſituated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> wherein is ſtill towards the Right Hand of the Altar a glorious and beautiful high Seat of Marble whereon the Queen uſed to ſit, when ſhe had a mind to overlook the Workmen, to ſee whether they went on right; for ſhe loved Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mightily, as appeareth ſtill to this day by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her mighty Buildings. Behind this Seat are eleven Steps, which go further down Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> where the Ciſtern hath been, wherein Queen <hi>Helen</hi> found the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Underneath on the Altar, 'tis true, there ſtands one, but it is new, and therefore to be ſuppoſed, to be put
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48499:167"/>
there of late years. At the bottom of the Stairs do alſo appear very plainly the cracked Rocks, as it is mentioned in Scripture: <hi>And the rocks rent.</hi> And theſe Rents or Cracks are a foot wide, and ſo deep as to reach from the top to the bottom of the rocky Mount of <hi>Calvaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we came up into the Church again, they ſhewed us at the bottom of Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> a Chapel that was locked up, and in it underneath the Altar a large blackiſh Stone with ſome reddiſh Spots upon it, in the ſhape of a piece of a Pillar, which was brought thither from <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Houſe of Judicature, whereon our Lord did ſit, when the Soldiers did put the Crown of Thorns on his holy Head, and did ſalute him as a King with their Knees bended, and did alſo mock him, ſpit in his Face, and whip him. This Crown was twiſted out of Thorns, called by the <hi>Arabians, Nauſegi</hi> and <hi>Athauſegi</hi>; and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Latiniſts,</hi> which have kept the ſame Name, <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> whereof there are three ſorts, the firſt of which is the true one (which is alſo common in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) which doth not only grow without, but alſo within the Town of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> plentifully; this puts out early in the Spring, into long, thin and pliable Twigs, with a great many long and ſtrong Prickles. Juſt by it cometh out above from the Chancel of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> a path up to Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> which they forced from the <hi>Georgians,</hi> as they did before from the <hi>Armenians,</hi> by giving Money to the <hi>Turks.</hi> Which is very common in theſe Countries; for if one hath any Buſineſs to be done by the <hi>Turks,</hi> it cannot be eaſier obtained, than if you bribe them more than your Adverſary, wherefore it happeneth very often that ſuch places are taken away from one Nation, and given to the other.</p>
                  <p>Underneath this Way or Gallery you aſcend nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Steps to go up to Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> where we ſaw two Chapels one behind the other, which were open, and had a very delicate Floor, artificially inlaid wirh Flowers of ſeveral Colours, the like whereof is hardly to be ſeen any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:48499:168"/>At the top of the Stairs we left our Shooes, and went in, and attended the Prieſt, which did alſo there, as he had done in other places before, give us a ſhort account of what had been done to our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in theſe places, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the hindmoſt Chapel his Hands and Feet had been extended, and ſharp Nails drove through them, and ſo with a great deal of Indignation he was fixed to the Croſs. And that in the foremoſt our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did hang on the Croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Malefactors, where there was ſtill to be ſeen the Hole wherein the Croſs of our Lord did ſtand. He alſo briefly repeated to us the Seven Words which he did ſay when he was upon the Croſs; and for a Concluſion he told us, that his Holineſs the Pope had laid there Indulgences for ever, for all Sins and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, to be diſtributed among the Pilgrims.</p>
                  <p>When we had done we went further into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſaw firſt a place two Cubits high, which was alſo covered with fine Aſhen-coloured Marble, watered with Blew, in the middle whereof was a round Hole about a Span over, and was lined with Tin, wherein did ſtand the Croſs of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is ſo cloſely tipped and lined, that the Pilgrims can take neither much nor little of this, nor any other place, as the holy Grave, or <hi>Bethlehem</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born, &amp;c. Wherefore notwithſtanding the pretence of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> that in their <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> and Crucifixes are little pieces of the fore-mentioned places, it is all falſe and nothing of Truth in it, which they muſt confeſs themſelves, it being all covered with Marble. Near to this Hole, both to the Right and Left, where the Croſſes of the Two Thieves did ſtand, in the Room of them two others are erected, where hard by that on the Left at the inſide, is to be ſeen a long and large Fiſſure in the Rock of the Mount, which the Queen left on purpoſe open in the Marble Pavement, ſo that you may very plainly ſee it, and it goeth down very deep, as I have told you before.</p>
                  <p>When we come down again from the Mount, and come out behind the Chancel toward the Gate of the great Church, there lieth in the Pavement a fine and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48499:168"/>

                  <p>From thence as we went further towards the Grave of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we left below towards the Left on the place of a Scull, another Chapel, wherein are the Graves of ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kings, <hi>viz. Gottofredi,</hi> and <hi>Baldewin,</hi> &amp;c. which took the Land of Promiſe by force from the Infidels, and came towards the Right by the Chancel of the <hi>Greeks</hi> into a great round and high Building of the holy Grave, which butts upon the Church, and is below towards it, it ſtanding upon very ſtrong double Marble Pillars, quite open: it is covered with Lead, and hath at the top a great Window, where the Light falleth in, which is four Fathoms ſquare, where underneath is the holy Grave of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> under the open Sky, ſo that at all times, both Rain, Dew and Snow fall upon it.</p>
                  <p>Before the Paſſage into the Sepulchre is a ſmall Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, wherein is nothing of any moment to be ſeen, than a Square Stone, juſt before the Door of the Grave; this is of the true Rock of the Grave, about eight Inches thick, whereon (as ſome ſay) the Angel of the Lord, that rolled back the Stone from the Door, did ſit. This was alſo uſeful and did ſerve to keep the great Grave-Stone, that was before the Door of the Grave (which is hardly three Foot high) ſteady, that it might not give backwards. That the Door was but low, and that the Stone did lean before it, you may ſufficiently ſee out of the Twenty fourth Chapter of the holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt S. <hi>Luke,</hi> Verſe 12. when he ſaith: <hi>Then aroſe Peter, and ran unto the ſepulchre, and ſtooping down,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48499:169"/>
read alſo of the Door of the Sepulchre, and that the great Stone before it uſed to be rolled. When you will go into the Door you muſt ſtoop very much, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creep than go into it. The Sepulchre within is even with the Floor of the Chapel, and of the whole Church, and is ſo large, that four perſons may ſtand very eaſily by one another.</p>
                  <p>After the Prieſt had ended his Speech which he made in the Sepulchre, of the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we heard without in the Chapel, and had alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Popes Indulgences for ever, we went in alſo, and looked upon the Rock whereout the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre was cut, and found it underneath on the Right Hand (altho it had been very much torn by the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels) ſtill in very good Order, ſo that we could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern it ſtill diſtinctly, where now the Monks have made an Altar, and covered it with a large fair Marble. Over it hung about Twenty Lamps, which made the Sepulchre (which elſe is very dark) very light; one whereof belongeth to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> another to the <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and others to other Princes; they look very carefully after them, becauſe they bring them in a conſiderable Revenue yearly. The <hi>holy Sepulchre</hi> is lined within and without with grey Marble, and chiefly without ſome adorned with carved Columns that ſtand between it.</p>
                  <p>On the outſide of the Door of the Sepulchre doth hang a fine Golden Piece, wherein our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very artificially wrought, as he did appear after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection unto <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> firſt, and afterwards alſo to the Women: at the top of the Sepulchre is alſo a ſmall round Steeple, which is covered with Lead, and upheld with ſix double Marble Columns: beſides this there is at the Back of the Sepulchre another plain Chapel, wherein the <hi>JACOBITES,</hi> as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, perform their Devotion.</p>
                  <p>More at the Left Hand, as we went out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre again, near to it in the Pavement, are two large Circles, rarely inlaid of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, in the middle whereof are two round Stones of Marble, one
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48499:169"/>
whereof is white, and the other red, lying in the ſame place of the Garden, where <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and took our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener. Thus much I thought convenient to relate of theſe places that are ſhewn in the Circuit.</p>
                  <p>When I found my ſelf to be in theſe places where our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did walk about, teach, and by his Paſſion, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion work our Redemption, and procure and purchaſe our Salvation, from his Heavenly Father again, I did remember and rejoice at theſe incomparable Benefits, and merciful Treaſures with all my heart; for it cannot otherwiſe be, but that every true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is upon this Mount of <hi>Calvary,</hi> and thinks there of the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in the Sepulchre of his glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, muſt find great Paſſions within his Breaſt: as you alſo read in the laſt Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Verſe 8. of the Women, where you find theſe Words: <hi>And they departed quickly from the ſepulchre, with fear and great joy.</hi> This I found alſo in my Heart and Mind, ſo that it was, as if I ſaw our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of the Almighty God, to humble himſelf, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient to his Heavenly Father, even to Death, nay, to the Death of the Croſs, to bring us miſerable, ſinful Men to Rights again, and to deliver us clearly from all Debts and Puniſhments, and ſo to procure us the only and true Indulgences.</p>
                  <p>After we had ſeen Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> the Sepulchre of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and other places, we went into the Veſtiary again to eat our Supper.</p>
                  <p>After Supper, they led us up into the Gallery (which is in the round Building over againſt the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre) to ſtay there all Night: but ſome of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſung below in the Church, others did grumble together, and played with their ſweet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cymbals (which were made of pure Metal about the bigneſs of a large Walnut-ſhell) ſo pleaſant Tunes or Muſick, that I rather looked on them, and minded their Muſick, than ſlept.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning my Comerades, after they had been at Confeſſion, and received the Sacrament upon
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48499:170"/>
Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> came to me into the Church again, with an intention to go round once more. So we ſaw the holy places once more, and at laſt alſo the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which we left the day before at the Foot of the Hill on our Left Hand, belonging to the <hi>Grecians</hi>; they let us in very willingly, becauſe of our Chaplain, who was alſo a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and ſhewed us in it at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part where it was pretty dark, a large and deep Crack of the Rock: afterwards alſo on each ſide, ſome fine and high Tombs of ſome Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Gottefrid de Boulion,</hi> and others, which were for ſome time poſſeſſed of the Land of Promiſe: theſe ſtand on delicate Columns, cut out of curious grey Marble, whereon are ſome Epitaphs, which I thought to ſet down here underneath, together with a ſhort Relation when they did take the Land of Promiſe, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how long they were poſſeſſed of it, and how many Kings did ſucceed one another in it.</p>

King left two Sons <hi>Baldewin</hi> and <hi>Alamric,</hi> and after he had reigned Eleven Years, he fell dead when he hunted a Hare on full ſpeed. After him his Son <hi>Baldewin the Third</hi> was Crowned, who alſo died in the Twenty fourth Year of his Reign, after he had fought ſeveral Battels, and taken ſome Towns. Then his Brother <hi>Alamric</hi> came to the Crown, who was a great War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, ſo that he was very fit for this Dignity, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many Victories againſt Sultan <hi>Saladin.</hi> But afterwards when the Scales were turned, he died alſo after his return from <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Year 1178, his Son <hi>Baldewin the Fourth,</hi> and the Seventh King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Government of the Kingdom in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his Reign. This, although he was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, yet he managed his Buſineſs very well, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Dominions courageouſly and gloriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infidels. And becauſe he would not be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by reaſon of his Diſtemper, therefore he married his Siſter <hi>Sibylla</hi> to a Marquis of <hi>Monteferrato,</hi> called <hi>William.</hi> She was brought to Bed, in the firſt year, of a Son, and called him after his Uncle <hi>Baldewin.</hi> But when <hi>William</hi> died, he married her again to <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> Count of <hi>Joppe</hi>; with this condition, that after his Deceaſe he ſhould Rule the Kingdom for his Son-in-law, and be his Guardian ſo long until he came at age. But he behaving himſelf very ill in the mean while, the King grew ſo angry with him, that he would by no means ſuffer him to live in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ordered another to fill up his place, one <hi>Raymond,</hi> a Count of <hi>Tripoli.</hi> Soon after the King died before his Son was quite Twenty Years old, and was alſo buried in the Temple of the holy Sepulchre.

                        <hi>A Common Account of ſeveral ſorts of</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>but chiefly of them that are always to be found in the Temple of Mount</hi> Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: <hi>And alſo how theſe, and many other Strangers, are treated by the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror (as by their chief Head, to whom they generally are ſubjected) and his Officers.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvaria</hi> live <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of ſeveral Nations; as <hi>Latins,</hi> or <hi>Italians, Abyſſins, Graecians, Armenians, Georgians, Neſtorians, Syrians, Jacobites,</hi> &amp;c. which for the moſt part are Prieſts and Friers, which are of ſo different Opinions in many Articles of Faith, that many of them might ſooner be reckon'd amongſt the Superſtitious and Hereticks than <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; wherefore each of them have their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Habitation and Chapel, that they may perform their Devotion undiſturbed by one another. The <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Emperor alſo lets them alone, and doth not at all trouble them for their Religion, nor endeavour to bring them over to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>; and is very well contented to receive his Yearly Tribute, which is exactly demanded as it cometh to be due. I have ſeen many of them in the Temple, to go up and down in their peculiar Habit, and once I did attend at their Devotion, ſo that I eaſily paſſed away the time, that the <hi>Turks</hi> kept us Locked up in it.</p>
                  <p>Their Pilgrims reſort thither Yearly, chiefly againſt the great Feaſts or Holy Days, in great Numbers, to ſee the holy Places, not only from the Eaſtern, but alſo from the Weſtern Countries: Theſe that are under the ſubjection of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which they are almoſt all of them (except the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Abyſſins</hi>) muſt pay him Yearly the fourth part of all their Revenues: He that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48499:174"/>
hath four Olive, Almond, or Quince-Trees, muſt yield one of them to be the Emperors. So in their Harveſt, every fourth Sheaf is alſo his; their Harveſt beginneth in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and endeth in <hi>May,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> chap. 16. verſ. 9. <hi>Seven weeks</hi> (that is from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſonday</hi>) <hi>ſhalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the ſeven weeks from ſuch time as thou beginneſt to put the ſickle to the corn.</hi> Beſides this Impoſition, they have another; that is, They muſt pay Yearly for every Head that is Male, the Poor as well as the Rich, one Ducat, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, chiefly when the <hi>Sultan</hi> intendeth to go to War with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; then he beginneth to lay theſe Taxes upon them a Year before-hand, and hath it Gathered in. He that hath not wherewithal to pay it, is forced either to ſell one or the other of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to perpetual Slavery, or elſe to give one of them to the Grand <hi>Turk,</hi> according to his liking to be his own for ever: And what is more, he ſendeth every 4th or 5th Year through all his Dominions his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>viz. Wallachia, Servia, Boſnia, Albania, Colchid,</hi> &amp;c. to fetch away every third Son of his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Subjects, and they always chuſe that which they like beſt; and ſo they bring together a great Number, and call them <hi>Azanoglans,</hi> and give them to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> to be their Servants. Theſe have in ſome chief places their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes from their Infancy, that in time they may be fit to be made Officers and Commanders in time of War. In this the <hi>Turks</hi> exerciſe great Cruelty and Pride, they ſpare no Body, for if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> doth poſſeſs ſome ſmall matter of Riches, he muſt either keep it very privately, or elſe with a great deal of diſcretion ſay, That it is all belonging to his <hi>Emperor</hi> and him. So if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> hath occaſion for any thing of theirs whatſoever, it muſt be granted him without any refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal: But what a trouble and heart-breaking this muſt be to the poor Parents, not only to have their Children that are free by Nature, forced to ſuch a Brutal way of Life and Education, but, what is more, taken away from Baptiſm to Circumciſion, from the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Congregation and Faith, into a ſevere Slavery and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48499:174"/>
wherein they are brought from their Duty to their Parents, into a mortal enmity againſt them and their other Relations, every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may with himſelf conſider.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> where there is choice, take them that are ſingle and young, becauſe, they being ſtill infirm, and but ſlightly grounded in their Faith, they are the ſooner ſeduced, chiefly if they are Inſtructed in their <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Laws, and Educated therein for a while, for then they ſoon forget their own Faith, and grow in theirs, and ſo as they grow up in Years, they alſo grow in their Malice, and become to be worſe than they themſelves, as daily Experience doth ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame ſtamp are alſo theſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been taken Priſoners in the War, turn <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malucks</hi> (which they call in their Language <hi>Haracs</hi>) and are Circumciſed. Theſe are free from all Impoſition as well as the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſave only the Tenth, but dare not go away without their Maſters leave, upon pain of Death; if they are taken, they are according to their Law, without any Tryal, Sentenced and Condemned to be burnt. And theſe alſo are confirm'd and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in their impious and baſe Life, that they forget God and themſelves, never think of coming home again to hear the Goſpel Preached, or to ſee their Friends and Relations again. Yet the Priſoners are not ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much preſſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> to deny their Faith and turn, except there ſhould be found one or more great Perſons among them, for ſuch they always uſe to preſs more, and endeavour to turn them one way or other, and promiſe them great Preferment if they will declare for their Religion; for they are in hopes, that if they could perſwade them, a great many more of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones would alſo come over with them. If ſuch are perſwaded by them and turn, they are entertained by the <hi>Turks</hi> very Honorably, and called <hi>Tſcheleby,</hi> that is, Gentlemen, and endued with great Revenues, but yet they do not eaſily confide in them, or put any Truſt into their hands, and do not eſteem ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and faltering Men in their Heart, although they
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48499:175"/>
carry themſelves very friendly before their faces, for they make account, That he that will eaſily deny his Religion, will alſo betray his Prince and Country if occaſion ſhould ſerve. I have known in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſome Slaves, whom their Maſters that bought them as their Servants, did very much preſs to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but when they did mightily reſiſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, and ſay, That they could not admit thereof with a ſafe Conſcience, and if by force they ſhould take away their Prepuce and Circumciſe them, that notwithſtanding all that, they could not Circumciſe their Hearts, and therefore they deſired them not to trouble themſelves any further with them, they were for all that ready and willing to ſerve them honeſtly and faithfully to the utmoſt of their power: So their Maſters have been ſatisfied with this Anſwer, and have preſſed them no more. But if it ſhould happen that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould be taken in one of their <hi>Moſques</hi> (for they as unclean Men are forbid to come there) or ſhould diſpute with them, or ſpeak ill of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his Laws, or ſhould pronounce theſe words, which are almoſt written every where in their Churches, and underneath their Gates, in their <hi>Arabian</hi> Language: <hi>Leila hillalla Mahammet raſur alla</hi>; that is to ſay, <hi>O God only God, and Mahomet a Prophet of God,</hi> he muſt (becauſe they are an Epitome of their Religion, Confeſſion, Belief and Laws) ſuffer himſelf to be Circumciſed, or elſe loſe his Life. For being that <hi>Mahomet</hi> did defend his falſe Doctrine deſcribed in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> rather with the Sword than with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and true Grounds, that it might not be diſcovered, and ſo his Adherents leave him. <hi>Mahomet</hi> to prevent this, by the Devils Inſpiration, hath ſtrengthen'd it with ſtrong Points and Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> That no body ſhall diſcourſe or diſpute with any Sectaries whatſoever, much leſs believe them, or read their Books, as ſuch wherein is no ground to be found, becauſe all that is good and true in the Old Teſtament, teſtified by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in the New one, by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is by him taken out and Tranſcribed into his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be believed and kept as the Word of God,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48499:175"/>
without any ſcruple or ſearch; and he that ſpeaketh or writeth againſt it, muſt fall by the Sword, and beſides be Damned for ever.</p>
                  <p>Who doth not ſee that this ſubtile <hi>Mahomet</hi> did this, that any Body that he gets once into his Snares, or that falls into his Net, might be ſo intangled, that he muſt be forced to keep there, to periſh and to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever; notwithſtanding all his ſweet Promiſes of great Priviledges, Salaries, and Permiſſion of <hi>Sodomitiſh</hi> Sins, Robbing, Burning, Perjury, &amp;c. which Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions they regard but very little, ſeeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Prophets promiſe, if they Pray but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and Waſh themſelves often, they do not only not hurt them, but by continual uſage of the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned means, they become to be cleaner than we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from our Sins, in the Bath of Regeneration. To theſe Traditions of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> ſtick ſo cloſe, and believe them implicitly, according to the Commands of <hi>Mahomet</hi>; ſo that one, although he be of another Opinion, becauſe they will hear no Contradiction nor Objection, is forced to hold his Tongue and ſay nothing. And in caſe you ſhould ask them, why they are forbid to Eat Pork, or Drink Wine? they anſwer and ſay, That their Parents did ſo before them, partly becauſe they are unclean, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are forbid it in their <hi>Alcoran</hi>; or elſe that if they ſhould over-fill themſelves with it, ſo that they ſhould bring it up again, it might contaminate their Cloaths, and ſo they ſhould commit a great Ruſticity; ſo that they know not how to give any reaſon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Religion. Wherefore their Law ought to be called or reputed Cruel, and a Tyrannical one, that is rather upheld by the Sword than by Reaſon and Juſtice; which alſo appeareth from thence, that they carry a Naked Scymiter before the Noble-mens Sons, when they carry them about the Streets in order to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; and alſo their Prieſts, chiefly thoſe that are called <hi>Antippi,</hi> after Prayers and Sermon, ſhew unto the People from a high place, a burning Torch in one Hand, and a Naked Scymiter in the other, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their own Adherents, and to frighten thoſe that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48499:176"/>
are of a contrary Opinion; and ſo <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretends to his Adherents, that God hath bidden him to Conquer all other Nations by the Sword, until they confeſs that there is no other God beſides God, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Prophet; or elſe agree to pay him Yearly Tribute, and to be his obedient Subjects; if they follow his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, his Laws will endure ſo long as they defend them by the Sword. Now how ſtrictly they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proſecuted theſe his Commandments, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries have formerly, to their grief, ſufficiently Experienced, <hi>viz. Aſia, Syria,</hi> the <hi>Land of Promiſe, Aegypt, Thracia, Greece,</hi> &amp;c. which they have not only Conquered, and to their own great Improvement ſubdued, but have alſo infected them with their Poiſonous Doctrine to ſuch a degree, that in theſe our times there are but very few to be found in theſe parts, that do adhere unto the true Religion.</p>
                  <p>It being ſo then, that God Almighty hath viſited them with theſe great puniſhments, by reaſon of their manifold Sins and Ingratitude, for his Holy and Sacred Word, and that we alſo are guilty of theſe and the like Sins and Vices, we cannot wonder that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Juſt God, ſhould, according to our Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſend alſo ſuch a horrid <hi>Tyrant</hi> againſt us, to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us very much, and come ſo near to us, that we muſt expect every moment (except we amend) the like Puniſhments and Execution. And ſo we hear dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to our grief, that this potent <hi>Tyrant</hi> is continually at Work, and taketh one ſtrong Town after another; and what is more, they take often in their Excurſions a great number of our Brethren and Siſters, part whereof they Murder Barbarouſly, others they carry away into perpetual Slavery. When they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Victory, and have got Booty, there is ready, and at hand, ſeveral Sutlers, that drive a great Trade with Buying and Selling poor Priſoners; theſe buy them of the Soldiers, Chain them (after they have given the Grand <hi>Turk</hi> the Tenths thereof, according to his Choice and Pleaſure) together with long Chains, and ſo drive them away miſerably, as if they were Beaſts, to the chief Trading Towns, to ſell them with profit

                     </gap> that come thither from Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. There you find Weekly, in their <hi>Betzars</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,</hi> many Priſoners of ſeveral Nations, <hi>viz. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Moors, Arabians, Indians, Abyſſins,</hi> and amongſt them Young and Old, Men and Women, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are White, and others Black; thither come the Chapmen and cheapen them; they have liberty to look upon their Naked Bodies, as if they were Beaſts, and to feel them, whether they are ſound in their Limbs, or whether they have any defect, which they always fear. If they like their Bargain, the Buyers take them home with them into their ſmall Habitations or Tents, and put them (chiefly thoſe that were given to Idleneſs, and have Learned no Trade) to any ſort of hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and all that they get ſo belongeth to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who diſpoſeth of it as he pleaſeth. Wherefore thoſe that keep many Men and Maids, eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves richer for it; and ſometimes they Marry them together, and when they beget Children, they are Slaves as well as themſelves, and he hath power to Educate them, and to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſeth. Wherefore the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (that to their Temporal Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, they may not alſo acquire Eternal ones, for their Childrens ſake) in theſe Countries do ſeldom Marry, but rather ſtudy how to make their eſcape (if they are not hindered for want of that Language, and by Unskilfulneſs of the Roads); or elſe they go with their Maſter before a Juſtice, in their Language called <hi>Cadi,</hi> and there buy their Liberty for a Sum of Money, or elſe agree with him for a certain time, and ſo make a Contract with him concerning their Liberty, which commonly theſe do that intend to perſevere in their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, or undertake to get ſomething by their Handy-work, that when the time is paſt, or the Money paid, the Juſtice may, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument before made by him at their Requeſt, declare him Free, and give him a Paſs, to ſhew upon the Road, that he may not be moleſted. Other ways to get their Liberty there are but very few, except their Maſter ſhould happen to Dye, which commonly in their laſt Will, declare that their bought Servants, after the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48499:177"/>

                  <p>But yet that but a few Slaves come from thence to us again, the chief reaſon is not, as many think, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> preſs them to change their Religion; for although they ſometimes threaten them, as they uſe to do or treat them ſomewhat more hardly than is uſual in their Servitude, as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo do very often, but rather their Secure and Impenitent Life which they lead, forgetting God and his holy Word to that degree, that they know not how to give an Account of their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith and Religion; nay (what is more) they know not the difference between theſe two Religions, which are ſo vaſtly differing, although they would, if they did know it, rather ſuffer Death than be ſeduced from the true Religion, and precipitate the Soul, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Body, into Damnation. When then the knowledge of the Truth is gone, and Faith almoſt, if not quite Extinguiſhed, ſo that there is but little hope left of their Salvation, they daily forſake their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as faſt as Worm-eaten Fruit falls from the Tree; begin to think how to compenſate their bodily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may lay up and get Money by Robbing and Burning, and ſo get Privileges, to live according to their own Will and Pleaſure, like Beaſts in daily Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs; and when they are harden'd in it, they come at laſt to ſuch a degree of Sottiſhneſs and Brutality, that (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) they believe the chief good of this World to conſiſt in Voluptuouſneſs, wherein they periſh at length, and muſt expect the Wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Turks</hi> have Conquered one or more (which they diſcern at firſt by their Fore-finger, which theſe that have a mind to turn uſe to ſhew to them firſt, as a Token by lifting of it up over their Heads, chiefly in their <hi>Moſques</hi>) they rejoyce in them mightily, and are clearly of Opinion, That this their Work is precious and good before God, and that their Religion is confirmed and upheld by the aſſenting of many; wherefore they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48499:177"/>
ſoon meet together, to confirm theſe Turn-coats with their uſual Ceremonies, and ſo to make them true <hi>Turks.</hi> Firſt they lay before them a Croſs, whereon they muſt trample three times, ſpit upon it, and repeat every time ſome words after them taken out of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>; ſo the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that will be made <hi>Turks</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them after them. When this is done, three of them are ready with their Bows, and ſhoot together up, and give them before the Arrows fall down again <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Names: Then (if they be Men) they ſet them up upon high Horſes, put them on their beſt Clothes, and Dreſs them neatly, and ſo lead them for two days together through all the Streets, that every body may ſee them, and know them to be ſuch as do adhere to their Religion, and ſo to be free to walk and deal among them without any hinderance. If they are of an higher degree, and of great Authority, ſometimes Ride along with them ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gentlemen of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in their beſt Dreſs, accompanied by many <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> who fire here and there in the Streets for Joy, but chiefly in thoſe places where they ſpy <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They have with them all ſorts of Muſical Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> The Drums, great Drums, and little Drums, (which they beat at that ſame time both above and below) Hautboys, and others: They alſo carry in this their Proceſſion long Streamers upon long Poles, almoſt like unto them that we ſee in the Croſs-walks in our Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and beſides, the Rabble that run before and behind make ſuch a noiſe, that one cannot hear the other. When all this is over, they Circumciſe them at laſt on the third Day, and then they reckon ſuch an one to be a true <hi>Muſulman,</hi> that is, A Circumciſed one, who hath leave to go to their <hi>Moſques</hi> without being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to buy their Books and Writings, and to Read them, which muſt not be ſold to others that are not of their Religion, upon pain of great puniſhment, that they may not come into unclean hands, or to be trod upon as Writings of no Worth.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Jewes,</hi> whereof there are a great many among them, and are called by them <hi>Choifut</hi> or <hi>Chifoutler,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ours in Cheating and Cozening by far, and there
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48499:178"/>
is no doubt but they would oftentimes renounce their Religion to make profit: But the <hi>Turks</hi> envy them more than we <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they do not Truſt them, they reckon them not worthy to Eat with them as they do with us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor Marry with them; much leſs will they receive them as any thing related to their Religion, except it be, that before for ſome days they have frequented the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, and there are Baptized, and have often Eaten Pork, that unclean Meat that is alſo forbidden unto them. When they have done thus, they proceed with them after the ſame manner as is before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that live among the <hi>Turks,</hi> as the <hi>Surians, Armenians,</hi> &amp;c. they have here and there in great Trading Cities, their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Streets which they Inhabit, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without in the Suburbs; and thereabout alſo ſmall and low Churches, where they perform their Devotions. When they begin to be decayed of Age, or are burnt by Fire, or deſtroyed in War time, if they will have them built up again, they muſt have leave firſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrate, and lay down a good Sum of Money, which grants nothing except you greaſe them well.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> (to ſave Charges) ſuffer no Bells nor Clocks, neither in their own nor other Temples, nor will they give leave to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to Ring to Church with them, ſo that all day long you neither hear a Bell Toll, nor a Clock Strike. Inſtead thereof, the <hi>Turks</hi> have, according to their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> their Five Hours ſet, which their Prieſts call out from the high Steeples, and in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, with a loud Voice, and with ſtopped Ears, and cry, <hi>Alla Haickbar,</hi> that is, <hi>God is true</hi>; and then, <hi>Leila hillalla, Mahammet raſur alla</hi>; each of them he repeats twice, to call the people to their Devotions. But the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a Servant, that at the Hours of Prayers and Sermon goeth about with a ſtrong Cudgel, and ſtriketh, in every Street, on one or more Doors made ſtrong for that purpoſe, as if it were upon an Anvil, ſeveral times, which reſounds through all the Street.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:48499:178"/>When the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> pray, they obſerve almoſt the ſame Ceremonies with the <hi>Turks, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> &amp;c. they turn themſelves towards the South, they ſpeak low in the beginning, lift up their Hands, bend their Heads and whole Bodies downwards; then they fall down upon their Knees, kiſs the Earth ſeveral times, and pray with great Devotion, which Cuſtom the <hi>Jews</hi> keep alſo, and that without doubt, becauſe the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> uſed the ſame in their Prayers, as we read in the Seventeenth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Verſe 3. and 17. And <hi>Abraham fell on his face</hi>: Exod. xvii. 11. <hi>When Moſes held up his hands Iſrael prevailed</hi>: and in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. 42. is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did but mind the Fervency and Zeal of the Heathens and Superſtitious in their Prayers, we ſhould ſee what reaſon we have to awake from our Lazineſs and Coldneſs in our Prayers, and to pray with earneſtneſs. There live in <hi>Turkey</hi> ſo many <hi>Christians,</hi> that they inhabit the greateſt part of that Country; wherefore conſidering their great number (to ſpeak according to all human probability) it would be an eaſie matter to ſubdue the <hi>Turks</hi> without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of any outlandiſh Power, and to drive them out of their own Countries, did not God Almighty, who viſiteth us for our manifold Sins, ſet them over us as a Puniſhment: For although the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor</hi> ſets his <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that live amongſt his People, nor be able to bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch mighty and numerous Armies of good and experienced Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for the moſt part, wear as well as the <hi>Turks</hi> long Cloaths, and gird their Loins with fine and ſoft Rollers, ſome of Silk, and others made of Cotton; in them they keep ſtill to this day their Money, chiefly the poor, as ſome with us, that have no Pockets, do in their Handkerchiefs, tied up in a ſtrong knot; the ſame without doubt did the Ancients wear, as the Words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 9. give us to underſtand; where he ſpeaketh to his Diſciples, and ſends them into the whole world, ſaying, <hi>Provide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes.</hi> (In the <hi>German</hi> Bible we read <hi>Girdles.</hi>) With ſuch a one, without doubt, the Prophet <hi>Agabus,</hi> did tie the Hands and of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Ceſarea</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Philip,</hi> when he would make him to underſtand, that the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would take and tie him, and at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up into the hands of the Heathens, as you may read in the 21ſt. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Now altho the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> go as well as the <hi>Turks</hi> in long Cloaths, ſo that that way they are hardly to be diſtinguiſhed from one another; yet they are diſtinguiſhed by the peculiar Colours of their Turbants, which they wear; for the <hi>Turks</hi> wear white ones, as alſo do the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> only theſe put behind to it a red coloured Cloth, and the others make it up in another form, and let one of the ends hang down behind, to defend their naked Necks from the exceſſive heat of the Sun. But the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that have a differing Religion are not allowed to wear a white one, unleſs another Colour be mixed with it, much leſs a green one; which Colour being their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets,</hi> and eſteemed to be holy, is not allowed to be worn by any Body, neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (except to their Prieſts and ſome Pilgrims that have been on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to <hi>Mecha</hi>) neither in Turbants nor other Cloaths. So the <hi>Armenians</hi> have blue; the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> fleſh colored: the <hi>Grecians, Maronites, Surians,</hi> and others have white ones with blue Liſts wrought into them. But the <hi>Jews</hi> have yellow ones, as they have in our Country
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48499:179"/>
yellow Bonnets: yet when they have a mind to travel afar off, as into <hi>Meſopotamia, Aſſyria, Perſia,</hi> or into the <hi>Indies,</hi> &amp;c. (ſeeing that the <hi>Turks</hi> hate them, that ſo they may travel the ſecurer, and with little Charges) they put on white ones by the way, and pretend to be <hi>Tſchelebys,</hi> or Noble Men, nay ſometimes Meſſengers of the <hi>Cambre,</hi> which they may eaſily do, becauſe they underſtand the Languages, yet not without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

                  <p>There are alſo ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phyſicians, which inſtead of the yellow Turbants, wear red high Hats, of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they exceed in number the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ones, that go cloathed like the common people.

                  <p>So much of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general.

                  <p>AS the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> in former days did excel almoſt all other Nations in Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and uſed to have their Children inſtructed at home in thir own Univerſities in all manner of Learning; ſo
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48499:180"/>
in our times we find the contrary; for in all <hi>Greece</hi> there is not one Univerſity to be found, where ſuch Diſcipline and Learning flouriſhes as did anciently: juſt ſo is the deſire of Learning, and inſtructing their Children extinguiſhed in them. They take greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in idle Diſcourſes, and rather love Idleneſs, which they have learned very well, ſince they truckle under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Yoak. 'Tis true, they write the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, but which is as corrupt and different from the Ancient, as the <hi>Italian</hi> is from the <hi>Latin.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> deſpiſe them for their Lazineſs and Cowardize, and on the contrary they love the <hi>Germans, French</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and praiſe them, ſaying, That they are ſtout and courageous Soldiers; they call them all by the ſame Name <hi>Franci,</hi> becauſe the Diviſions of our Country are unknown to moſt of them.</p>
                  <p>In former Ages they had here and there in large and eminent Towns, inſtead of the <hi>Pope</hi> (whom they will not obey, nor be ſubject unto) their <hi>Patriarch,</hi> Archbiſhops and Biſhops, whereof ſome are ſtill kept up: but after the <hi>Turks</hi> did take and poſſeſs themſelves of their Country, there is fewer of them in number, and they have ſmaller Revenues.</p>
                  <p>Without their Country, they have in great trading Cities, as <hi>Cayro, Alepo, Antiochia</hi> of <hi>Syria, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. their peculiar Churches, and chiefly in ſome holy places in the Land of Promiſe. As at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> the place of Sculls whereon <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Crucified: and alſo the beautiful Chancel that is in the middle of the Church: wherein is a round hole about a ſpan over in a ſtone, which is, as they pretend, the middle of the Earth, according to the Words of the Kingly Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when he ſays: <hi>God, who now is my King from the beginning, has wrought our ſelves on the middle of the Earth.</hi> Beſides theſe, they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called the Holy Croſs, about an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile out of Town, which, as they pretend, is built on the ſame place where the Tree did grow, whereof they made the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Beſides this they have a great many more which I reckon unneceſſary to mention here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:48499:180"/>Some of their Church-Doors are ſo low, that you muſt ſtoop when you will go through them.</p>
                  <p>They believe that the Holy Ghoſt doth proceed only from the Father, and not from the Son. They keep yearly two great Faſts, and they eat Fleſh upon the Sabbath, or Saturday, at pleaſure: they ſing the Maſs in their own Language, that every Body may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. In their Churches they ſuffer no emboſſed Work, nor carved Images, but have plain Pictures on Boards, or on the Walls. They do not believe a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory (as the Papiſts there called <hi>Latini</hi>) nor that our Praying, Faſting or Offering, for the Dead, can do them any good. And they are mightily diſpleaſed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts do not, according to the plain words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> marry as well as they, nor give the Lords Holy Supper in both kinds, as our Lord himſelf did inſtitute it. Wherefore they condemn ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, and excommunicate the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Adherents on the holy Friday yearly. And becauſe they reckon them to be ſuperſtitious, they will not permit them to ſay Maſs upon their Altars; but if they ſhould do it, they accuſe them before the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>So it happened when I firſt came over, that they were very angry with a Papiſt that had ſaid Maſs upon their Altar, and ſo had profaned it, wherefore they did immediately conſecrate the Altar again, and had the Prieſt before the <hi>Cadi:</hi> and they brought it ſo far, that he was mulcted Five hundred Ducats, to pay in a ſhort time. When he thought that the Puniſhmenr was greater than the Treſpaſs or Tranſgreſſion, he did ſeek for help at <hi>Alepo</hi> and <hi>Tripoli</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Conſul, but did obtain no great matter, ſo that he was ſtill in election to pay the Forfeiture.</p>

They are alſo very much inclined to help and aſſiſt the poor Slaves, that are under <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and ready to help them out. Their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whereof there are many amongſt them, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed not only over all <hi>Turkey,</hi> but alſo <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and many other Countries; wherefore they have in all chief Towns of Trading, as <hi>Antiochia, Alepo</hi> ſituated in <hi>Coeloſyria, Orpha,</hi> &amp;c. their peculiar Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Churches: and alſo in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (whither they go in great numbers) the beautiful Church of St. <hi>Jacob</hi> the Greater: and alſo below near to the place of Sculls, another Chapel locked up, &amp;c. and have commonly before their Chancels large Hangings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which the Prieſts keep ſeparated from the People.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, although they agree in very many Points and Articles exactly with thoſe of the Reformed Religion, yet notwithſtanding they have ſome Errors worth to be rejected, and ſome ſcandalous Cuſtoms beſides. So you may ſee them here and there cry over the Graves of their deceaſed Friends: for to give them Viſits they go out in the morning early, the greater part of them
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48499:182"/>
old Women, and there they make ſuch Mourning and and Howling, that the Travellers that come by (for their Graves or burying places are generally out of Town near the High Ways) may hear them a great way off. There you ſhall ſee them ſit, ſome folding their Hands over their Heads, and looking mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: others fetching great Sighs, beating on their Breaſts: others ſpreading themſelves over the Graves, as if they would embrace their Friends, and take them in their Arms. In the mean while their Prieſts go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout among them Reading and Praying, and ſometimes they ſpeak to ſome of them. When they have done mourning thus, and caſt Sorrows from their Hearts ſufficiently, they ſit down together, eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
                  <p>They do not at all eſteem the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> but have their own Prelates, which they honour with great and peculiar Reverence: neither do they believe any Indulgences, nor Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>Their Prieſts go in plain Habits: they have Wives as well as their Laymen: they let their Hair and Beards grow: they keep on <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> a great Feaſt, and ſoon after beginneth their Lent, which they keep ſtrictly, and therein, as alſo on Wedneſday and Friday all the year round, they eat neither Eggs nor Fleſh, nor any thing elſe that ever had life in it, only Saturdays and Sundays they are allowed them, to refreſh themſelves: other Feaſts and Holydays they do not keep any at all. In all theſe points, they rather agree with the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> than the <hi>Romans</hi>: and alſo in theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> That they eat not of unclean Meats, that are forbidden in the Old Teſtament; they admit to the Communion young and old without diſtinction: they baptize their Children in the Name of the Holy Trinity: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith: they Preach, Sing, Pray, and perform all their Devotion, in the Vulgar Tongue, that every one may underſtand it: they uſe for the Interpretation of the Word of God, the Writings of <hi>John Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>: they dare not, no more than all the other Nations that live amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> (except the <hi>Maronites</hi>) make

So he did diſpatch him, and ſent along with him the chiefeſt of his Courtiers, and ſent him away with a great Train, as did become a King. When he was come into his Kingdom, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained theſe Lords and Gentlemen very Honorably, and promoted them before all others to the higheſt and beſt places, that they might the willinger ſtay with him. But all this would not prevail with them, but they grew daily more tired, and unwilling to ſtay longer in theſe ſtrange and unaccuſtomed Countries; and this encreaſed daily more and more, and at length to that height, that they reſolved that (if the King would not give them free leave) they would endeavor to make their eſcape Clandeſtinly againſt the Kings Will to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Judea.</hi> When this their deſign came before the King he was very angry, and ordered immediately, that a Mark ſhould be burnt on their Foreheads, that every body might know them; and iſſued a Proclamation, That all his Subjects might watch them, and if any or more of them, that were a going away ſhould be taken, they ſhould detain them, and ſend them to him again.

                  <p>THE <hi>Latinists</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> living at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the often before-named Temple, are Friers of the Order of the <hi>Leſſer Franciſcans</hi>; they chiefly poſſeſs the Holy <hi>Sepulcher</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> which they keep in very good order, and read their <hi>Hora's</hi> diligently, wherefore their Father ſtileth himſelf <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> of the Holy <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> Beſides this, they are poſſeſſed of more Holy Places, as at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the Stable, wherein our dear Lord <hi>Christ</hi> did lye in the Manger with the Ox and the Aſs: In the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48499:188"/>
Mountains of <hi>Judea,</hi> the Temple of <hi>St. John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>: In <hi>Bethania,</hi> the Sepulcher wherein <hi>Lazarus</hi> had lain four days, when <hi>Christ</hi> raiſed him from the Dead, and here and there many others. Theſe, as all know, are diſperſed in a great many places and Kingdoms; nay, almoſt through all the World. Their Head is the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretends to be the Vicegerent of <hi>Christ,</hi> and taketh upon himſelf ſo much Power, as to preſcribe to all Men Laws according to his own pleaſure, which <hi>Christendom</hi> finds every day to its great grief. Wherefore in the mean while they are grown into ſo many Diviſions, Idolatry, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they out-do quite all the before-named Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But being that they are in theſe our times ſo very well deſcribed, that (thanks to God) they are very well known to every body, therefore I forbear to write more of them, and will only, before I conclude, make mention of theſe Brethren that live at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> only in a few Points, and ſay that theſe that live in the Monaſtery at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are about 20 in number more or leſs, according as they go and come, and among them are <hi>Spaniards, Italians, French-men</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> &amp;c. that commonly are ſent thither by Kings and Princes; but being that they have more Churches and places in and without <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to provide for, their Father <hi>Guardian</hi> diſtributeth them, ſends ſome to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to look after the Manger of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> others upon the Hills of <hi>Judea</hi>; to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> and towards <hi>Bethania,</hi> &amp;c. but before all others, always two and two into the <hi>Temple</hi> of Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> to ſtay there for 14 days together. But being that the <hi>Temple</hi> is always Lock'd up, that the Prieſts that are within it may not want for Food, as well as others that are with them, therefore three holes, one bigger than the other, are made in the great Door of the Church, that through them all Neceſſaries of Meat and Drink may be conveyed to them. Theſe that are thus Locked up in the <hi>Temple,</hi> do but look diligently after the Holy <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and Read their <hi>Hora's,</hi> with Singing and Praying, and to look after the Lamps; but chiefly thoſe that hang in the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48499:188"/>
illuminate it. There are about twenty of theſe Lamps, one better and clearer than the other; they belong for the moſt part to great Perſons, as Kings and Princes, whereof they have their Yearly Revenue, that is ſent them by their Brethren; but chiefly from <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and the moſt <hi>Catholick</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But from <hi>Germany, England,</hi> and alſo now <hi>Cyprus</hi> the Iſle, ſince it hath been taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they have nothing as they had in former Ages; and the Moſt <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> doth alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begin to forget them, which they have found ſome years ſince; and the number of the Pilgrims doth alſo decreaſe, which formerly uſed to flock thither in great numbers, and ſometimes to reward them, beſides Meat and Drink, very Nobly, which they find very prejudicial to them, ſeeing they have no Revenues of any other Lands, or the like.</p>
                  <p>They receive the Pilgrims, that come in to them, very kindly, and treat them very well with Meat and Drink, and ſhew them all the Holy Places, and keep them ſo long until they have ſeen every thing to their ſatisfaction, and are willing to depart.</p>
                  <p>They are but very meanly Clothed, like unto Poor Mendicants; they live very privately, and keep their concerns very cloſe, becauſe of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſe-men or <hi>Beduins,</hi> that fall upon them daily, and Ravage theſe Countries continually, wherefore they are in great danger. When they come, you muſt at leaſt give them Meat and Drink, if not other Booty, as I ſaw my own ſelf at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> when I firſt arrived there, that twelve Horſe-men, with Guns, Arrows, and Darts, very well Armed, came to the Gates of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and they were forced to ſatisfie them, before they would leave them, and to give them good words beſides. So that they are not only ſufficiently plagued by them, but alſo by the <hi>Sangiachs,</hi> and <hi>Cadis,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrates at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who have continually their Eyes over them that are well to paſs, for Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is ſo great with them, that if they can but hear of one that hath Money, they ſtudy Night and Day, how (if poſſible they can) they may right or
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48499:189"/>
wrong make him puniſhable. So they lately accuſed the <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians</hi> falſely, and puniſhed them in ſome hundred Ducats; whereat the <hi>Baſſaw</hi> of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> (under whoſe Command <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is) did wink, in hopes to have a great ſnack out of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the Knights of the Temple of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Order of the</hi> Johannites.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving made mention of theſe, I remember ſtill an other Order, that is, The <hi>Johannites,</hi> or <hi>Knights Templars</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which did firſt begin in the Reign of <hi>Baldewin de Burgo,</hi> the ſecond of that Name, and the third King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This Order is more Secular than Divine, and therefore quite differing from all the reſt, for they need not to ſay Maſs, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any other Devotion; but when they have heard Maſs, and ſaid ſo many <hi>Pater-Noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> they have ſufficiently diſcharged their Office. This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was firſt Invented by His Holineſs the <hi>Pope</hi> to that end, and indued with many Priviledges, that they might reſiſt and oppoſe the <hi>Turks,</hi> and that all Infidels and Hereticks might by them and their Adherents, by force of Arms, be driven and routed out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And that he might promote this deſign of his, more earneſtly, he took in thoſe chiefly that were well Born, and had great Revenues (as Princes, Counts, and other Noblemen). So it hath often happened for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, chiefly when Popery was in a flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that along with the Pilgrims, that had a mind to ſee the Holy Places, and to go to the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> many Perſons of Quality came, moved thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to out of great Zeal, together with them, to ſee them alſo, and to take upon them the Order of that Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in the Sepulchre of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for that purpoſe. And beſides that, other
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48499:189"/>
conſiderations there were which moved them to it, <hi>viz.</hi> The high Title, and the Authority of the Place, and great Priviledges, whereby they hoped to be ſtill preferred to greater Dignities. Now as every one of them had laid before them to conſider theſe Points and Articles, which every one muſt promiſe and take an Oath to keep them ſtrictly, ſome great and potent Men found it ſo ſevere and hard, (as you may ſee by that that followeth) that they were not only aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, but refuſed openly to take it upon them. But what is laid before them that are made Knights, and alſo what Ceremonies are uſed in it, I thought convenient to mention here briefly.</p>
                  <p>If there be one or more of them ready for it, that have at the inſtance of the Guardian, according to the Ancient Cuſtom, been at Confeſſion, and alſo received the Sacrament, <hi>ſub una Specie,</hi> under one Species, on Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> they are with great Ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from thence into the holy Sepulchre, whither are alſo conveyed ſome other things that belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>viz.</hi> A fine Book, a Sword richly tipped with Gold, with a red Velvet Girdle, a Chain weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a hundred <hi>Hungarian</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, whereon hangeth a Golden Croſs of this Form and Shape,<note rend="inter">
                        <figure/>
                     </note> a pair of Spurs with red Velvet Straps, which are laid down one by another upon the Altar of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. As ſoon as the Gentleman cometh into it, they begin immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſay Maſs, and after that they Sing without ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Pſalms. In the mean while the Gentleman lyeth down upon his Knees in the Sepulchre before the <hi>Guardian,</hi> until the Friers have done Singing. Then the <hi>Guardian</hi> bids all that ſtand about, to ſay <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and an <hi>Ave-Mary,</hi> on behalf of the Gentleman that is to be Knighted. When this is done, he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Gentleman, before he taketh the Oath, to conſider upon what condition he is admitted there; When this is done, he bids the ſtanders by Pray for him once more, and then admoniſheth the Gentleman again,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48499:190"/>
and telleth him alſo, That hereafter he muſt be in all things ſubject and obedient to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; That he muſt fight and reſiſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> as Enemies and Hereticks, ſo long as his Blood and Heart is warm. Then the <hi>Guardian</hi> asketh him further, whether he doth receive all theſe Points (as they are written word by word, in that Book, and ordered by his Holineſs the Pope, and ſubſcribed by his own Hand) and whether he will Swear by the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre to keep them. Whereupon he conſents to it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and promiſeth with great eagerneſs and joy to keep it with all his Heart, and thanketh God that he hath made him worthy of this Bleſſing, and for having made him capable of it. After this the Monks begin again a long Song; and then the <hi>Guardian</hi> taketh up the three Pieces, the Chain, Sword and Spurs, and puts them on upon him, and ſo adorneth him as begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Knight. At laſt he taketh alſo the Book, and puts it before him, and telleth him once more what he is about, and what he is going to Swear. When he hath underſtood it, he kneeleth down again, and puts out his two Fingers, which the <hi>Guardian</hi> puts upon the red Croſs in the Book, and readeth to him the Oath; the Contents whereof are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That upon his Conſcience he do Swear there to theſe following Words, Not with a falſe Heart, but that he doth confeſs out of Zeal, with great eagerneſs, and with a clean Heart, and alſo Swear by <hi>Gods</hi> Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Holineſs the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he is a good <hi>Catholick,</hi> Educated in that Religion from his Infancy to that preſent hour; and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will go from it ſo long as he liveth, but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Defend and Protect the <hi>Roman</hi> Church againſt the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and their Adherents, with Words and Deeds, ſo long as his Heart is warm; and that he will never be in a place where any evil is taught, or ſpoke of his Holineſs the <hi>Pope. Secondly,</hi> That he doth Swear by <hi>Gods</hi> Omnipotence, and the <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Croſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he is a Nobleman in the fifth Generation, both by Father and Mother. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He Sweareth alſo, that hath ſo good Income that he need
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48499:190"/>
not to follow Merchandizing, or any other Trade, nor to borrow Money, or to ask others for help, but that he hath ſo much that he can live upon his Revenues, and keep three Horſes beſides from year to year, for the Service of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, if neceſſity ſhould urge, and others ſhould riſe againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to moleſt it, that he will then always be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready, beſides the three Horſes, to aſſiſt her with all his utmoſt power. He muſt alſo promiſe that he will ſo long as he ſhall live, diligently attend at Maſs, and hear four or five every day; and alſo that he will keep the Faſts zealouſly, and Eat neither Fleſh, nor Butter, nor Cheeſe, nor Egs, on them; and alſo that he will confeſs and receive the Sacrament once a month, or every ſix Weeks at furtheſt, and ſend his Family at leaſt once a year in <hi>Lent</hi> time to do the ſame. And alſo that he will not forget, to the Honour and Encreaſe of the ſaid Church, to remember her in his laſt Will; that he will protect and provide for the Widows and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs; that he will maintain the Friers and Nuns, and their Monaſteries; and if by the Seculars any thing ſhould be taken away from them, that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, but endeavour to the utmoſt of his power, as if it were his own, to recover it again. That he will aſſiſt thoſe that would willingly turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and endeavor to bring them over; but that he will keep none in his ſervice, nor any ways aſſiſt them that do not firmly adhere unto it. Then there is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, That he will ſay 49 <hi>Pater-Noſters,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> every day, and viſit his Holineſs the <hi>Pope</hi> once a Year, and come into the ſeven Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and perform his Office; and alſo aſſiſt at the Sacraments, and other Ceremonies, with due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and alſo Reſpect and Honour the Holy Water. At length to conclude, he is forbid to talk Idly, to be Drunk, to live Looſely, and to commit Sodomy, that he being Knighted, may not lead a diſorderly Life, and give to others ill Example.</p>
                  <p>When then the Guardian hath read the Oaths that are written upon Parchment out of the Book, the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallier</hi> kneeleth down again, and when he bendeth his
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48499:191"/>
face down, and leaneth with both his Arms on the Book, which lieth on the Altar-Stone of the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> the Guardian bids the Friers, or Monks, again to Pray; then he draweth out the Sword, and maketh with the flat ſide of it three Croſſes upon his Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſaying, At the Command of God, and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the Encreaſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I create you <hi>N.N.</hi> now a Member of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, a Knight, in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt.</hi> And further he adds, That in the room of his Holineſs the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he doth Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him of all his Sins: And that he doth alſo give him leave, and command him, by the Oath he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his Holineſs the <hi>Pope,</hi> to wear the uſual red Croſs (as a Sign whereby he may be known) publickly in his Coat of Arms, and on his Clothes. Alſo, if he pleaſe, to put him in mind, as often as he ſhall look upon it, what he hath Sworn, and to keep it the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When all this is over, and they have Prayed again, the <hi>Guardian</hi> wiſheth him Joy of his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and rejoyceth with the whole Convent that he is come to this acknowledgment, and is become a true Member of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church; that he and all his Brethren will always pray for his long Life, and that God may keep him in health, to the comfort of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Immediately approach to him all the Monks (while he is ſtill ſtanding in his Ornaments) and call him Brother; and when they have alſo wiſhed him Joy one after the other, the Guardian beginneth the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c. and then he taketh all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments away again from him. Afterwards he leadeth him about with the Vicar in Proceſſion to the Holy Places, to Inveſt him alſo in every one of them; when that is done they go to Dinner.</p>
                  <p>Although in former years every body was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently admitted (as you may ſee by what hath been here before ſaid) except he were a Nobleman for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations; yet in our time it is come to that paſs, that they admit every body to it without any ſtrict Examination, that can pay the Money (which cometh to eleven or twelve Ducats). Nay, every Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48499:191"/>
that doth intend to take upon him that Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, doth pray and perſwade his Companions by the way that they would do the ſame, that he may have company, which the Pope doth allow of (becauſe very few Noblemen come there now a-days) that he may in caſe of Neceſſity ſtill have ſome friends to aſſiſt him, for his Holineſs wants Champions, becauſe he taketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Civil Government as well as the Eccleſiaſtick, that when they can defend and prove their Religion no longer by Scripture, they may defend and uphold it by Power and Strength of Arms. Now as the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, according to Ancient Cuſtom, gives Atteſtates to every Pilgrim concerning their Pilgrimage, under his great Seal, that they may have it to ſhew, ſo he giveth alſo one to the Knights of the Order of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and bids them to carry the Letter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Perſon to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſhew it to the Pope. This is ſufficient of the Temple of Mount <hi>Calvaria,</hi> and its Holy Places, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that are dwelling there of their Chapels, and of their Errors.</p>

And ſo I begin with the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> which lyeth towards the Eaſt before the <hi>Temple-hill,</hi> over againſt the <hi>Sheeps-gate,</hi> on the other ſide of the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48499:192"/>
Brook of <hi>Cedron,</hi> as the Holy Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in his 14th Chapter and 4th Verſe, when he ſaith, <hi>And his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jeruſalem on the Eaſt.</hi> This Mount is about a quarter of a League, on as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, A Sabbath-days Journey diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> pretty high, rough and ſtony, full of pleaſant <hi>Olive-Trees,</hi> (from whence it hath its Name) and alſo others; as <hi>Fig-Trees, Lemon</hi> and <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Citron,</hi> and <hi>Siliqua-Trees,</hi> by the Inhabitants called <hi>Charnubi, Turpentine-Trees,</hi> and <hi>Palm-Trees</hi>; the like I have ſeen but few, &amp;c, There is alſo ſome good Herbs, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſtrange <hi>Origanum, Tragoriganum, Roman Mother of Time, Spica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardi,</hi> and a peculiar ſort of <hi>Coniza,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At the foot of the Mount they ſhew us firſt a great Church, between the Rivolet <hi>Cedron</hi> and the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> which was ſo covered with Earth, that you could ſee nothing of it but the Entry, and before it without, a large place three ſteps deep. This Church was built by <hi>Helena</hi> Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and called the Sepulchre of our <hi>Lady the Mother of God</hi>; to go into it, you muſt go down 44 ſteps: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it toward the right, there is a ſmall Chapel, where they ſay our <hi>Lady</hi> was Buried; and therefore, by the Benevolence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> there is diſtributed and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Pilgrims, full forgiveneſs of all Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Puniſhments for ever. Some are of Opinion, That this Church did formerly ſtand even with the Ground, and that after the Devaſtation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when part of the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> was filled up, it was covered thus over. This Church ſtands (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ſaith in his 8th Book and the 30th Chapter) on that place where the Village <hi>Gethſemane</hi> ſtood, whereby the Garden was whither our dear Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, juſt before his Paſſion, go with his Eleven Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, after he had Eaten the Paſchal Lamb with them, and given Thanks, according to his uſual Cuſtom, over the Rivolet of <hi>Cedron,</hi> to regain us that which was formerly loſt by our Anceſtors in the Garden. There he left his Eight Diſciples, while he went to Pray, as the Scripture telleth us; when he took with him <hi>Peter,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48499:192"/>
James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and began to mourn, to quake, and to tremble, and ſaid to them, <hi>My ſoul is ſorrowful unto death, ſtay here, watch with me, and pray that you enter not into temptation</hi>; and he withdrew from them about a Stones caſt (where he kneeled down, fell three times on his face, and prayed to his Heavenly Father, where he wreſtled with Death, and Sweat a bloody Sweat, ſo that an Angel muſt come down from Heaven at laſt to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him). This place is underneath a great Rock that hangeth over a great Cave, juſt at the Entry of the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Valley is ſtill where it cometh down from the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> pretty deep, and is called by the holy Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> the Valley of <hi>Judgment,</hi> as you may read in his 3d Chapter, 14 Verſe; which words of <hi>Joel</hi> give us to underſtand, that the Lord, as he was (when he came firſt upon Earth) in this Valley taken Priſoner, Bound, and carried away to the place of his bitter Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Crucifixion and Dying, ſo he ſhall in his ſecond and glorious coming, appear in this Valley of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> again to Judge all people of the whole Earth, &amp;c. that then the Impious ſhall ſee whom they have pierced. <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſpeaks alſo of it in the above-mentioned place.</p>
                  <p>As you go from thence to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> you ſee below towards your left hand, near unto the Bridge of the River <hi>Cedron,</hi> an old ſquare Building like unto a Steeple. This, altho it is believed to this day not only by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but alſo by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> to be the Grave of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> as you ſhall ſee them fling Stones into it as they go by, to revenge his Undutifulneſs ſhewn to his Father King <hi>David,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he was not Buried there, as we read in the 2d Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the 18th Chapter, Verſ. 17. <hi>And they took Abſalom and caſt him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of ſtones upon him.</hi> Yet for all this, when <hi>Abſalom</hi> was alive (as you may farther read in the before-mention'd Chapter) he erected a Column in the Kings Dale, for he ſaid, <hi>I have no Son, therefore this ſhall be for a

remembrance of my Name,</hi> and called this Pillar after his Name; and it is ſtill called to this day <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Place. Of this Pillar writes alſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the 7th Book of his Antiquities and the 10th Chapter, ſaying, And <hi>Abſalom</hi> did erect a Kingly Column of Marble in the Valley (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> chap. 14. it is called the Kings Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley) that is two Furlongs from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Juſt by this Pillar beginneth a very ſteep Foot-Path, which parts a little above it into two, one whereof goeth Southward, at the bottom of the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> towards <hi>Bethania</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> &amp;c. down through the Valley that is made by this and the other part of the Hill (called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhit</hi> in the 4th of the <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. 23.) but the other goeth over the height of the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> out by <hi>Bethania</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha.</hi> A little higher on this Hill did our Saviour ſit, over againſt the Temple, when he foretold his Diſciples that ſhewed him the glorious Buildings thereof, That not one Stone ſhould remain upon another that ſhould not be thrown down. And did alſo tell them at length, the terrible and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Signs that ſhould come to paſs before the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the end of the World. To this day we ſtill ſee into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Moſque, with its large Paved Court-yard, over the Walls thereof, ſo perfectly, that you may diſtinguiſh almoſt the Perſons that walk there. From thence, when you go up to the Hill, which is very ſteep and rough, there is a large Plain, from whence our dear Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and aſcended into Heaven, as you may ſee by the words of the Holy Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in his firſt Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Verſe 9. where he ſaith, <hi>And he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> And Verſe 12. <hi>Then returned they unto Jeruſalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is from Jeruſalem a Sabbath-days journey.</hi> On this place (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> mentioneth) did Queen <hi>Helena</hi> alſo afterward Build a ſtately Church, which now is ſo decayed, that there is no more to be ſeen of it but a New built Chapel in a large Yard ſurrounded with a Wall. Juſt by it on a Hill of the Mount towards the North and <hi>Galilea,</hi> there is an old decayed Building, which was formerly
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48499:193"/>
(as my Guide informed me) an Inn for the <hi>Galileans,</hi> where commonly did take up thoſe that went to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> from <hi>Galilea.</hi> Wherefore they are of opinion, that ſome of them were there in the time of Chriſt, that alſo were Spectators of his Glorious Aſcenſion, as it doth appear by the Words of the two Angels, that ſpoke to them, and ſaid, <hi>You men of Galilea, why ſtand you here gazing up into Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But if you duly conſider theſe words, you will find, as you read it in the Second Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Verſe 7. that the Apoſtles themſelves were theſe <hi>Galileans,</hi> where it is written: <hi>Behold, are not all thoſe which ſpeak Galileans? and how hear we every man in our own tongue,</hi> &amp;c. So did alſo the holy Angels ſpeak to the Apoſtles after the ſame manner, and called them <hi>Galileans,</hi> rather to bring them, as Elders of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, off their worldly thoughts, which they had conceived in their Hearts, of the reſtoring of the worldly Regiment or Kingdom again (which they ſhould have left, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof looked upon the Heavenly Kingdom, whereinto <hi>Chriſt</hi> was aſcended, unto the Kingdom of God, whereinto they were received as Members, which is a more ſpiritual Kingdom, that doth not conſiſt in outward things, Eating and Drinking, &amp;c. but in a clean and faithful heart. After this they ought to ſtrive, and to make it their only buſineſs, that it may be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to all men, and be ſpread abroad all the World over.</p>
                  <p>From the top of the Mountain, you have a proſpect over all the holy Land, towards the North over the Valley <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> (which is juſt at the bottom of the Hill) into the Country of <hi>Galilea</hi>: towards the Eaſt, over ſome naked Mountains, down into a large Field which extends it ſelf to the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> that is, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentioneth, Twenty nine Leagues long, and Fifteen broad, whereof the Scripture maketh often mention, chiefly in the Books of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> and in the Second of <hi>Samuel,</hi> Chap, 15. where it is written, That when King <hi>David</hi> did flie from his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> he tarried in the Plain Fields until he had intelligence of him. In theſe is ſtill remaining the Pillar of Salt that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was turn'd
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48499:194"/>
into, when ſhe againſt the Command of God, turned to look back to the City. The famous Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Flavius Joſephus</hi> did in his time ſee it in his own perſon: and the Pilgrims viſit it to this day, and beat off of it ſome ſmall pieces, as they do every where, chiefly in holy places, and yet it is found ſtill whole, and without any defect; which did put ſome Pilgrims, that once went towards the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> into great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now, that they might be certain and aſſured of the Truth of the common Aſſertion, That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was broken off of this Pillar, was always found whole again; they did, chiefly one of them, (as I was informed by one that had had been there before) knock a whole Hand off, and took it away with them. Now after they had been at the end of their Journey, and came back again, and went to look for it on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they found it whole again, and exactly like unto the old one as it had been before. Further beyond the Plain Fields, at the other ſide of <hi>Jordan</hi> that runs through it, there appear the <hi>Arabian</hi> Mountains, that were inhabited by <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and half the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> they are very high, and afford very good Paſtures for the Cattle: ſome among them were much noted and famous of old, as the Mountain of <hi>Seir</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> Mount <hi>Garizim</hi> and <hi>Ebal,</hi> whereof is made mention in the Twenty ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Deuterenomy</hi>; and alſo in the Thirty ſecond Chapter, of Mount <hi>Abarim, Nebo,</hi> and the point of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> ſituated in the Land of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> overgainſt <hi>Jericho,</hi> which together with all the adjacent places are very well ſeen; as well as towards the Weſt the Rivulet <hi>Cedron,</hi> and the ſituation and largeneſs of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> After we had looked about ſufficiently, we went down to the place of the Village <hi>Bethphage,</hi> which is at the other ſide on the Aſcent of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and belongeth to the Prieſts of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> this is ſo ruined, that now adays there is nothing left of it ſave only a few Foundation-Walls. Into this did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſend his Diſciples, to looſen the She-aſs and the Colt which was tied to the Door in the Road) and to bring them to him, whereon our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo did ride to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48499:194"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Five days before he ſuffered, being the true Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Before it the Mount is pretty plain, and is very rough and rocky, wherein <hi>Bethania</hi> lieth on the Right Hand upon one aſcent, of the other part of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> as is before ſaid, But the Village of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> (whereof you read in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> Chapter XI,) is further out by the beginning of the Road towards <hi>Jericho,</hi> which is ſtill very dangerous, becauſe of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Vagabonds. In theſe Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did our dear Saviour oftentimes take up his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them; and in the ſame did <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> anoint the Feet of our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> with a precious Ointment of <hi>Nard,</hi> and dry them again with her hair: in our days they are quite deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and nothing left thereof but Ruins. Near it as you come back again to <hi>Bethania,</hi> in the Plain lieth a large Stone, where alſo you may ſee the above-mentioned places very plain: where they ſay that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> did meet the <hi>Lord,</hi> when he came up the Steps, and reſted on the Mount, and talked with him of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of her Brother, before her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> did know any thing of the arrival of <hi>the Lord.</hi> Wherefore ſhe went back again into their Village, to call her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> ſecretly, who, when ſhe heard that our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was near, at hand, did haſten and went to him, for he was not yet come into the Village, and fell down at his Feet, and ſaid weeping, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here my brother had not died:</hi> then <hi>he groaned in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and enquired preſently after the place where <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> his dear Friend was laid, and went with them to it to <hi>Bethania</hi> that Village, diſtant a League, (about an hours going) or as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>about fifteen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on an aſcent: wherein was a ſmall Chapel, and underneath it a deep covered Cave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Lazarus</hi> had lain Four Days, as you may alſo ſee in the before quoted Chapter, where it is in the Thirty eighth Verſe ſaid: <hi>It was a cave, and a ſtone lay upon it.</hi> When the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friars would go to the Grave of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they were forced to go through this Village, and a great concourſe of the poor Inhabitants uſed to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48499:195"/>
flock about them, and did ſurround them, and detained them till they gave them ſomething to be diſtributed amongſt them; that they might evade this Trouble, and not be neceſſitated to go through his Village, when they go to the Grave, they have made behind at the other ſide on the heighth, another Avenue, but they do not eſcape the <hi>Mobile</hi> for all that, for they meet them notwithſtanding, chiefly, if they know or have intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that any Pilgrims came along with them to ſee the Grave. So we did find it, for they came and kept us locked up in it ſo long, till we had given them ſo much as did ſatisfie them. As you come out again from <hi>Bethania</hi> towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Friars ſhew an old Building, where <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper did dwell, in which when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was at the Table, <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> did come, and did break again, yet ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days after, a Glaſs of pretious Unguent of <hi>Nard</hi> over his Head, which filled the whole Houſe with a fragrant Scent; which pleaſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo well, that he took her part againſt his Diſciples, and commended her proceedings ſo highly, that it is recorded to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual memory. From thence if you come nearer into the Valley between the Mounts of <hi>Olives,</hi> there is ſtill to be ſeen ſeveral Fig-trees whereabouts <hi>Chriſt</hi> did curſe one of that kind, becauſe he found no Fruit thereon when he was hungry. Juſt at the coming out of the Valley near unto the Steps of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> you ſee the City again, but chiefly the Mount of the <hi>Temple</hi> and Gate where you go up, walled up in the new Wall. From this Valley, when our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in ſight, and came down the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the People, as he came riding long, cried, ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna, to the Son of David, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after when he came nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, he lamented with tears alſo their future miſery, and the terrible deſtruction of the Town, and went in from thence toward the Golden Gate into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and drove out the Buyers and Sellers.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BEthlehem</hi> formerly called <hi>Ephrata,</hi> is ſituated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South Twenty Furlongs or a <hi>German</hi> Mile diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The neareſt way to it you go through the Gate of <hi>Hebron,</hi> and come to the Right by the upper Mote, and the bloudy Field, up the ſteps over mount <hi>Gihon,</hi> where juſt before you ſee a Ciſtern with good freſh Water near the Path, made of white Stones, and well prepared: near which the Star did appear again unto the three wiſe Men of the Eaſtern Countries, and led them into <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Near it there groweth a Turpentine Tree larger and higher than any that ever I ſaw elſewhere in my life. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about half way, you paſs over a Hill, at the top whereof you may ſee both Towns, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Before you is a large Valley, which altho it be rocky, yet is it fruitful both of Corn and Wine. In it towards the Right Hand near the Road is an Acre called the <hi>Cicer-Field,</hi> which had its Name (as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) from the following Tranſaction. It is ſaid, that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> went by at a certain time, and ſaw a Man that was a ſowing <hi>Cicers,</hi> he did ſpeak to him kindly, and asked him what he was a ſowing there, the man anſwered ſcornfully, and ſaid, <hi>He ſowed ſmall ſtones. Then let it be,</hi> ſaid our Lord, <hi>that thou reap the ſame ſeed thou ſoweſt.</hi> So they ſay, that at Harveſt-time he found inſtead of the <hi>Cicer</hi>-peaſe, nothing but ſmall Pebles in ſhape, and colour and bigneſs, like unto them exactly. Now whether there be any thing of truth in it or no I cannot affirm, but this I muſt ſay, that there are to this day ſuch ſtones found in this Field. For as we went by, ſome of us went
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48499:196"/>
into it, and did gather a great many of them, that were in bigneſs, ſhape and colour, ſo like unto theſe <hi>Cicers</hi> (by the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Ommos,</hi> and in <hi>Latin Cicer arietinum</hi>) that we could hardly diſtinguiſh them from natural ones.</p>
                  <p>Hard by it you ſee ſtill ſome old Ruins of old Stones, where firſt <hi>Abraham</hi> the Patriarch did build a Tent as you read <hi>Geneſis</hi> 12.8. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence unto a Mountain on the Eaſt of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and pitched his Tent, having <hi>Bethel</hi> on the Weſt, and <hi>Hai</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt. Senacherib,</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when he went before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did come into this Valley with all his might and power: and had by the Angel of the Lord in one nights time, One hundred and eighty five thouſand Men ſlain: and ſtill to this day there are two great holes to be ſeen, wherein they flung the dead Bodies: one whereof is hard by the Road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Betlehem,</hi> the other towards the Right Hand over gainſt old <hi>Bethel</hi>: which Town fell to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and is called ſtill to this day <hi>Bethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſella,</hi> and is ſituated half a League farther towards the Weſt at the Foot of the Hill, in a very fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There did <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patriarch when he fled from his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſee in his ſleep the Ladder which reached up into Heaven, whereon the holy Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and deſcended, wherefore he erected there a ſtone for a mark, and called the place <hi>Bethel,</hi> which was called <hi>Luz</hi> before, as you may read in the Twenty eighth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> As you come nearer to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> you ſee the Grave of <hi>Rachel</hi> at your Right Hand near the Road, which <hi>Jacob</hi> did erect there, when his Wife died in labour with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as you read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> xxxv. 16. <hi>And they journeyed from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath:</hi> and Verſe 18. <hi>And it came to paſs as her ſoul was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting (for ſhe died) that ſhe called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin: and Rachel died, and was buried in the way Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob ſet a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's Grave unto this day.</hi> Before you come quite thither there is juſt by without it on the Left a good
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48499:196"/>
rich Ciſtern, which is deep and wide. Wherefore the People that go to dip water, are provided with ſmall Leathern Buckets and a Line, as is uſual in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and ſo the Merchants that go in <hi>Carrvans</hi> through great Deſarts into far Countries, provide themſelves alſo with theſe, becauſe in theſe Countries you find more Ciſterns or Wells than Springs that lie high. This was formerly under the Gates of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> whereof King <hi>David</hi> longed to drink: wherefore his three Champions did break into the Camp of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> and did dip ſome Water out of the Well, and brought it to the King: but the King would not drink of it for certain Reaſons, as you may read in the Twenty third Chapter of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and in the Twelfth Chapter of the Firſt of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> From thence we went by the Path of the Mount into <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the Town of <hi>David,</hi> where he was born, and anointed King by the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>; it lieth upon an Aſcent, its Buildings, Town-Walls and Towers are ſo decayed, that now it is quite open, and nothing at all to be ſeen, except the Well and Monaſtery, but ruined Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
                  <p>Juſt without <hi>Bethlehem</hi> at the the other ſide of the Path, towards the Eaſt (for formerly the Town reached fo far) they ſhew ſtill the Stable, under a large Rock, wherein <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> God and Man was born of the immaculate Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and laid in a Manger. Of his coming, and the place where he ſhould be born, the holy Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> long before propheſied in his Fifth Chapter, and Second Verſe, ſaying: <hi>But thou Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little among the thouſands of Juda, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael: whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſting.</hi> On that place hath <hi>Helena,</hi> Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, alſo built a ſtately Church; but ſince it is ſo ruined and demoliſhed, that hardly half of it is left, as one may ſee by the old Walls of the Foun-Foundation, and other Places and Arches that are ſtill left without; yet that part that ſtill remaineth ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is very large, covered with Lead at top, and is ſo
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48499:197"/>
glorious a Building, that one ſhall hardly find a better any where. For within it is paved with white Marble all over, and upheld with a great many large and high Marble Pillars, each whereof is about Nine Spans in Diameter; I told about Fifty of them, they ſtand without before the Chancel (and underneath them is the place of the holy and joyful Birth of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) in four Rows one behind the other, and ſo give a glorious Ornament to the whole Church. There are alſo to be ſeen on the Arches and the Walls about, ſome fine Hiſtories, taken out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made in Moſaick Work, laid in with Colours very artificially: and are ſtill ſo plain to be ſeen and and diſcerned, as if they were made but the other day. The Cave wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born, hath without on each ſide of the Chancel, underneath which it is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way into it, one againſt the other, the Doors thereof are commonly locked up, becauſe behind the Church there is ſtill another, through which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally go down into it; therein is below at the Right Hand ſtill another leſs one, going down two ſteps more, which is the true Stable, wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did lie in the Manger between the Ox and Aſs: ſo there is ſtill in the ſame place made a marble one very well wrought. Without before it we put off our Shoes, and went in with the Father <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> into the holy place. Where when I conſidered, the joyful Birth of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: where he, as the true long before promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Saviour was born, I was affected as if I ſaw the Child wrapt up in Swadling Cloaths, and lying in the Manger, diſguiſed in our mortal Fleſh and Blood, yet without ſin, that we as Children of Wrath and eternal Damnation, might be received again by God his Heavenly Father, as his Children, unto everlaſting Salvation: that did humble himſelf ſo low, as to be born in a dark Stable in the miſerableſt Poverty, that he might bring us out from the Filth and Mire of Sin wherein we lay, into the Parlour of his Heavenly Father. <hi>Seeing then, my dear Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that thou art come to us into the World, as the true Light, to make of us, that were Children of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48499:197"/>
Darkneſs and eternal Damnation, Children of Light and eternal Salvation and Felicity; I return unto thee, O Lord, for theſe thy unſpeakable Benefits, eternal Praiſes, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou hast aſſumed our Fleſh and Blood, and haſt alſo cauſed theſe thy Merits and Benefits to be by thy holy Angels profered to me; thereſore I pray thee let me come to thee with the poor Shepherds, and ſee thy ſaving Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, give me and us all thy Grace and Holy Spirit, that we may comfort our ſelves with this thy bleſſed Birth, againſt our ſinful and impure one, conſtantly and without ceſſation, that we may rejoice in it, in good and bad Times, in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and Adverſities, in proſperous Succeſs and ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in the time of this temporal Life, heartily, until at length we ſhall, in the life to come, ſee thee with all the elected ones, face to face, to all Eternity.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>This Cave is underneath about the Walls lined, with long Tables of Grey Marble, adorned with Blue, artificially laid in: the Rock that cometh out over the Stable only excepted. Juſt by the furthermoſt Entry of the fine Chapel there are others, in one whereof St. <hi>Jerom</hi> did live, and did Tranſlate the Bible out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> Languages into the <hi>Latin.</hi> In another near it lieth buried, the Noble Pious <hi>Roman</hi> Lady <hi>Paula,</hi> with her Daughter <hi>Euſtachia.</hi> Who after the Deceaſe of her Husband, went thither to St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> where ſhe led all the reſt of her Days in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Piety, until at length ſhe died in the Lord. From thence we came up again into the Church, wherein without cloſe to the Chancel on each ſide were to be ſeen two Altars, covered with good large Marble; on one thereof on the Left the Father <hi>Guardian</hi> did ſhew me the Effigies of the old <hi>Simeon,</hi> holding the Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Arms, and in the Manger ſtill another, with this Admonition, <hi>That from hence we may ſee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and learn, that it is not culpable at all to have Images, ſeeing that Nature it ſelf alloweth ſo much unto Stones that Images may grow in them. Wherefore they are not only not to be forbidden, but rather to be honoured.</hi> But what every Chriſtian ought to think of this, being quite contrary to the Holy Scripture, every Child that hath but begun to learn the Catechiſm, can eaſily and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48499:198"/>
ſufficienlty decide. The <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monks have near the Church a large and pleaſant Habitation, and alſo by it great Gardens, (rich of fine Plants and good Fruits) defended round about with high Walls, againſt the Incurſions of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which they make daily. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> lieth high, ſurrounded by the Hills of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> as you may ſee by the Words of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Thirty firſt Chapter, Verſe 15. where he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie the Murthering of the Children, which cruel Tyranny <hi>Herod Aſcalonit</hi> did a great while after in Chriſt's time execute, the words are theſe: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, a voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping: Rachel weeping for her Children, refuſed to be comforted for her children becauſe they were not.</hi> In this Monaſtery, becauſe it lieth at the top of the path, you ſee with pleaſure, as well as on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the Confines of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> and the Dead Sea, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> but chiefly within the ſpace of a League and half towards the South, a great and high Hill, which extends it ſelf much further than the reſt, whereupon in former years the ſtrong and mighty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Thecköa</hi> was built, whereof the holy Prophet <hi>Jeremias</hi> maketh mention in his Sixth Chapter, and alſo <hi>Amos</hi> (who did propheſie there) in his Firſt Chapter. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had this in poſſeſſion a great while, and did keep it againſt the Infidels and Heathens for above Thirty years after <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Holy Land were taken; for they had Corn and Wine, and Water, and other Neceſſaries abundantly of their own growing, ſo that they might have kept it longer, if a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſtemper had not got among them, which did encreaſe to that degree, that they were forced to leave it, and to retire to more healthy places. When the Heathens did underſtand that the Chriſtians were marched off, they fell into the Caſtle with a great multitude, tore it all to pieces, and did demoliſh it to the very Ground, ſo that now one cannot diſcern that ſuch a one did ſtand there before. But this loſt Troop of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did at length ſettle themſelves on Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and began to inhabit it, where they are ſtill remaining in our times, and call themſelves (as I

have told you before) <hi>Truſci.</hi> About <hi>Bethlehem</hi> there are ſome Valleys very well tilled with Corn and Wine, and among the reſt a very pleaſant and fruitful one, that beginneth immediately by the Church and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and runs down towards <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Jordan.</hi> This is below pretty wide, full of Olive and Fig-trees, it alſo bringeth forth ſome comfortable Herbs, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome ſtrange <hi>Origanums, Tragoriganum, Roman Serpillum,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Sathar, Abſintium Santonicum,</hi> which groweth every where in the holy Land, this hath ſmall aſh-coloured Leaves, very like unto them of ours, and many ſmall Stalks, full of ſmall yellowiſh Seeds, it is of an unpleaſant Smell, very bitter, with a ſaltiſh ſharpneſs, wherefore it is reputed to be the <hi>Scheha</hi> of the <hi>Arabians:</hi> from whence our Worm-ſeed cometh.</p>
                  <p>In this Valley were the Shepherds, to whom the Angels of the Lord did appear, and declared to them the ſaving Birth of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſuddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, and ſaying: Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> In that place, which is about half a League below <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is ſtill a Church, which alſo Queen <hi>Helena</hi> did build, as <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> teſtifieth in the Thirtieth Chapter of his Eighth Book, this is for the greateſt part fallen in, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more but a ſmall Arch is to be ſeen of it. Hard by it did ſtand the Tower <hi>Ader,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> writes, whereby <hi>Iſrael</hi> did erect a Tent, (as you may read in <hi>Geneſis:</hi>) and looked after the Sheep with his Twelve Sons. This is in our time ſo demoliſhed, that it lieth quite in Ruins. Beyond it in another Valley not far from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they ſhew ſtill to this day a large Orchard, full of <hi>Citron, Lemon, Orange, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, and Fig-trees,</hi> and many others: which King <hi>Solomon</hi> did plant in his Days, with Ponds, Canals, and other Water-Works very pleaſantly prepared: as he ſaith himſelf in the Second Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> Verſe 5. <hi>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48499:199"/>
trees in them of all kind of fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees.</hi> This is ſtill in our time full of good and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trees, wherefore it is worthy to be ſeen for their ſakes, and alſo for the Ditches ſake that are ſtill there. Wherefore I really believe it to be that ſame whereof <hi>Joſephus</hi> maketh mention in his Eighth Book of the <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities,</hi> and the Seventh Chapter. ſaying: <hi>And the King rode in a Chariot, cloathed in white, and it was his Cuſtom to ride early in the morning to a place called</hi> Hetten, <hi>a hundred Furlongs from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>where he had a Garden with Water-pools and Works very pleaſant and rich. Thither went the King for his pleaſure; and did always uſe great diligence and conſideration in all things, and took delight to ſee every thing neat and handſom,</hi> &amp;c. After we had ſeen the chiefeſt places within and without, near and a far off of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> we returned to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> again by another way that was near as far again about, and went over the Mountains of <hi>Judea,</hi> which have firſt as you come from thence very good and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Valleys, full of Vines and Corn, but the nearer you come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the higher and rougher are the Mountains. In this way half a League from <hi>Nebeleſchol,</hi> the Friars ſhewed us a Well very rich of Water, juſt by the Road that goeth down to <hi>Gaza,</hi> this runneth into a ſmall Rivulet, wherein the holy Apoſtle <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> did baptize <hi>Candaces</hi> Chamberlain to the Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> by it is nothing elſe to be ſeen but a ſmall Church, and a Fiſh-pond. From thence we came over high, rough and ſteep Hills into the Deſerts, where St, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did lead his life in his young Age, there is nothing to be ſeen but a very ancient Chapel, and hard by it a delicate Spring on the top of the Hill, where we went up to refreſh our ſelves a little, with eating and drinking of what we had taken along with us. About the Roads grow many Trees, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Charnubi,</hi> the Fruit whereof is called <hi>St. John's Bread</hi> in our Country, and is brought to us in great plenty. From thence we had ſtill a very rough and hilly way to the Church and Habitation of <hi>Zachary,</hi> whither the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did come (climbing over the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48499:199"/>
Hills) to give <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Viſit, &amp;c. before it a League diſtance nearer to the Town, at the end of the Valley <hi>Raphaim</hi> (whereof the holy Scripture maketh often mention, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Fifteenth and Eighteenth Chapters of <hi>Joſhua</hi>; and in the Firſt of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and the 12th. Chapter) ſtands in a very pleaſant and fruitful place, the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> and by it, before you come quite to it, falleth down the Spring of <hi>Nephthaah</hi> that is very rich of Water. This Church is very ancient, but yet pretty well built, and hath on the Left Hand as you go in, a deep and hidden Cave, wherein <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did hide her ſelf with <hi>John</hi> her Child, that it might not be ſlain, with the Children of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> by the Servants of <hi>Herod,</hi> whereof you may read more in the <hi>Proto-Evangelium</hi> of St. <hi>Jacob,</hi> where it is thus written:
<q>When <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did hear that among the reſt of the Innocents which <hi>Herod</hi> had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be killed, her Son <hi>John</hi> was alſo ſearched for, ſhe did climb up the Hills, and looked about her where ſhe might hide him; but when ſhe ſaw no place there where ſhe could do him, ſhe ſighed, and cried out with a loud voice, ſaying: <hi>O ye hills of Gad, take both the Mother and the Child:</hi> for ſhe could not aſcend them: the Hill did open it ſelf inſtantly, and took them into it, &amp;c.</q>
But how afterwards <hi>Herod</hi> did ſearch for <hi>John,</hi> and how he did threaten and exhort his Father <hi>Zachary,</hi> to tell him where his Son was, and alſo how his Servants did kill <hi>Zachary,</hi> (not being ſatisfied with his Anſwer) for it in the Porch of the Temple, is at length related in the Books of the Martyrs of the Learned and Reverend <hi>Ludowich Rabus.</hi> As you come from the before-mentioned Church, nearer to the Town of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there is ſtill ſeen a large Pillar, that is of great Antiquity, and lieth very high between the Mountains on a high Hill, five Furlongs off of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherefore ſome take it to be Ruines of the Fortification of <hi>Betzura</hi>: but as far as one can underſtand by the Books of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that is ſituated more towards the Eaſt behind Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> Juſt before it within ſtands in the Valley (that is full of pleaſant Olive Trees) a very old, yet well built
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48499:200"/>
Church called the Holy Croſs, whereof ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Friars are poſſeſſed: they pretend that in that place, the Tree did ſtand, that was made uſe of for the Croſs of Chriſt: this we did ſoon leave, and went over a ſmall height through the Gate of <hi>Hebron</hi> again into <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and made our ſelves ready to return the next day again to <hi>Joppe</hi> towards our Ship. And ſo we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the <hi>Father Guardian,</hi> their Interpreter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had conducted us, for their Faithfulneſs and Services done us according to our Ability, to their full content and ſatisfaction, wherefore the <hi>Father Guardian</hi> did freely give to each of us a Certificate under his uſual Seal, that we had ſeen all the holy places, which were named in it. This done, we went away, and came the next day to <hi>Rama</hi> towards <hi>Joppe.</hi> By the way I found ſome <hi>Lentiſcus's</hi> from whence the <hi>Maſtich</hi> cometh, <hi>Arbutus, Ilex,</hi> and a ſtrange ſort of Willows, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Saſſaf,</hi> but by <hi>Theophraſtus Elaeagnus,</hi> ſome <hi>Olive-Trees, Palm-Trees, White Mulberry-Trees, Sumach-Trees</hi> and <hi>Styrax,</hi> from which cometh a fweet ſmelling Gum, called by the ſame Name, that is brought from thence into our Country; <hi>Spartium, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> which is a ſtrange Shrub, and the Juice thereof retaineth the ſame Name, and is found ſometimes in our Apothecaries Shops: the King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> maketh mention thereof, under the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Name <hi>Hadhadd,</hi> by which alſo the <hi>Arabians</hi> call it, their Speech running much upon the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout grow alſo very many Fruits (called <hi>Siliquae</hi> by the <hi>Latines,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore it is probable, that the prodigal Son deſired to fill his Belly with theſe Fruits, which, as it appeareth by the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, the Hogs did eat, and yet could not have enough of them to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Hunger. Beſides theſe I found alſo by the way many <hi>Turpentine-Trees,</hi> by the Inhabitants called
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48499:200"/>
                     <hi>Botin</hi> and <hi>Albotin,</hi> which are very common in <hi>France,</hi> chiefly about <hi>Montpelier,</hi> they have ſmall green Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; that are of a reddiſh Colour, and hollow within, and are oftentimes baſely ſold and uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries for the true <hi>Carpabalſamum:</hi> for theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers above-mentioned, as we read in the Eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Nehem.</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did take Bows, and made themſelves Tents of them to live in, during their great Feaſt of Tabernacles. I ſaw alſo chiefly between <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Joppa</hi> ſome white <hi>Barbery</hi> Trees, which I took firſt for <hi>Paliurus</hi> the third kind of <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> unto which they are very like, except the Fruits whereby I did diſcern them firſt, and beſides they are much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and their Branches covered with a white Bark. Now although they are not to be taken for the ſame, yet they are very like unto the ſecond <hi>Paliurus</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Theoprastus</hi> maketh mention in the Fourth Chapter, and the Fourth Verſe. Among the Corn I did find a ſtrange <hi>Origanum, Serpillum: Smilax aſpera, Triones</hi> of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> whereof I have made mention above.</p>
                  <p>After we had made our ſelves quite ready to ſail for <hi>Tripolis,</hi> whither we had about Forty <hi>German</hi> Miles, we went aboard the Ship, and ſet Sail with a fair Wind. But this did not laſt long, for as ſoon as we were out at Sea, there aroſe one that was ſo contrary to us, that we hardly reached the Confines of <hi>Tirus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> the Fourth Day, where we arrived in our former Voyage at night, as I have ſaid before, I ſaw nothing of any Buildings on the Shoar, but ſome ſmall Houſes in the place where formerly the Town <hi>Sarepta</hi> did ſtand, which (as you may read in the Fourth Chapter of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the Third Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. 17.) was ſituated near unto <hi>Sidon,</hi> or as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes in his Eighth Book of the <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities,</hi> Chap. 13. between <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> in the Country of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> wherein the holy Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> during the great ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did live a great while with a Widow, and did reſtore her dead Son to life again.</p>
                  <p>Departing thence the night befel us before we gat over againſt <hi>Sidon,</hi> but we went ſo near the Town, that we could ſee the Houſes, and ſome Rocks butting upon
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48499:201"/>
them by Moon-light. From thence the nearer we came to <hi>Tripolis,</hi> the more the wind was for us, ſo that we arrived there on the Firſt of <hi>October</hi> in the year 1575, in very good health and condition. Wherefore I give eternal Thanks, Glory, and Praiſe unto the Almighty God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <hi>How I took ſhip at</hi> Tripolis <hi>in</hi> Syria, <hi>and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back from thence to</hi> Venice, <hi>and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled home again to my own Relations at</hi> Augſpurg.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AT my Arrival at <hi>Tripolis,</hi> when I hoped that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might have been done for the Good of <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft</hi> (whom I left in Priſon behind, as is above-mentioned) towards his Deliverance: that we ſeeing we came out together might have remained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a while longer, and have ended our Journey to our content, I found there was not only nothing done to the purpoſe, but his Cauſe came to be worſe and worſe, ſo that it was even or odd whether I ſhould not have been caſt into Priſon alſo, and beaten ſeverely to boot. When thus he was detained in Priſon, I received a Letter and Command, as well from his Adverſary, as from my own Friends, deſiring me to take the Cauſe in hand earneſtly, to bring them both to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation; and that if I would do ſo, I ſhould do him greater ſervice, than if I ſhould ſtay a whole year longer at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> expecting his Deliverance. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many means were uſed after my Departure, for his Liberty, yet they proved all fruitleſs, unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vain, ſo that he was forced to ſpend three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire years miſerably in this ſevere <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill at length he was miraculouſly delivered.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48499:201"/>
Wherefore I got every thing ready for my Departure, and went aboard the Ship called the <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> on the Day of St. <hi>Leonhard,</hi> being the Sixth Day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> in the year 75, (having firſt taken my leave of the above-mentioned my dear Friend <hi>Hans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Krafft,</hi> whom I loved as my own Brother) and the next day we put out, having a very good wind. So our Navigation proceeded in the beginning very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, and we diſcovered on the Third Day early the great Iſland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But when we approached unto it, a Hurricane aroſe ſuddenly, and blew ſo fiercely upon us, that it wound our great Sail round about our main Maſt, ſo that it was a wonder to me, that it did not bring it by the Board, or (as it would if the Seamen had not ſtruck it down immediately) turn the Ship over, and ſink her. Theſe Winds ariſe from a Wind that is called by the <hi>Greeks, Typhon</hi>; and <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth it <hi>Vertex</hi> and <hi>Vortex</hi>: but as dangerous as they are, as they ariſe ſuddenly, ſo quickly they are laid again alſo. The Seamen pretend, that one ſhall ſooner perceive them in the Ship below (becauſe they come up from the depth of the Sea) than above Deck. After this had continued about a quarter of an hour it was quite over, ſo that it was perfectly calm, and the Sea very quiet. So our Seamen hoiſted up their Sail again, and ſteered towards the <hi>Capo del Graeco,</hi> with an intention to run in ſtill before Sun-ſet into the Harbour of the Metropolis called <hi>Famaguſta</hi>: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were aware of it another Wind aroſe that did ſend us back again, ſo we ſtood out at Sea, and went on with it ſo well, that we paſſed the Iſland that is One hundred and ſixty <hi>Italian</hi> Miles long. Not long after the Wind did change, and it came to be foul Weather, and ſo contrary to us, that we went on but very ſlowly, and we were forced to drive upon the Sea on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſeveral Days, until at length we came before the Land of <hi>Pamphylia</hi> and <hi>Lycia</hi> (which came in ſight now and then) nearer to the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes:</hi> then aroſe a Northerly Wind that helped us into our true Road again, and blew ſo freſh, that in a few hours we went by that mountainous Iſland <hi>Scarpanthus,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48499:202"/>
by <hi>Solomons</hi> Point of the Iſle of <hi>Candia</hi> out towards the South, which is Forty Leagues further: and we had been almoſt quite thrown over into <hi>Africa,</hi> if we had not ſheltered our ſelves under the next Mountains, ſo we got clear of the Noiſe and Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Wind and Sea: but inſtead of that our Ship came ſo near unto the Shoar of <hi>Candia,</hi> that we feared every moment to have been ſhipwracked, which had certainly befaln us, if our <hi>Nacchier,</hi> (that manageth the Sails) with his Seamen, (who wrought very hard until they brought the Ship out at Sea again) had not had not for two days and nights done their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour. When we kept thus out at Sea, foul Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther befel us again, and contrary and rough Winds blew afreſh, ſo that it was very dangerous ſailing; wherefore our Maſter as well as the Men thought it beſt to get into a Harbour: but finding that it was very dangerous to get in there, they went back again to the Iſland <hi>Calderon,</hi> which lieth not above a <hi>German</hi> Mile from <hi>Candia,</hi> to land there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſtay for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Weather. This Iſland is ſmall, and ſo rough and ſandy within, that it cannot be inhabited; but yet being full of Buſhes, thoſe of <hi>Candy,</hi> turn, chiefly in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, their Cattel into it. Here I found a kind of <hi>Mandrake</hi> with blue Flowers in great quantity, and alſo very many <hi>Oxycedri</hi> like unto our <hi>Juniper</hi> Buſhes, which, are almoſt as high as our <hi>Pine-trees.</hi> When we, during this hard Weather, were in this Iſland <hi>Calderon</hi> for ſhelter, we ſaw ſometimes Clouds in the ſhape of a <hi>Pillar,</hi> that came down from the Skies to the next Mounta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, and ſo extended themſelves ſloping down into the next Sea. <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention alſo of them in his Forty ninth Chapter of the Second Book. When this did touch the Sea, it began to ſuck as it were through a Spout ſo fiercely, that the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move in that place, as if it were in a ſtorm, ſo that we could not only hear the Noiſe, but alſo ſee the great motion thereof. In the beginning it was pretty clear, but the longer it remained there, the darker it grew, until at length it aroſe up again and aſcended into the Skies like unto a thick Cloud. Wherefore it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48499:202"/>
may very well be, that ſometimes Worms, Frogs, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſes, Snails, Muſcles, &amp;c. may fall down with the Rain, chiefly in thoſe places that are near to the Sea: for I have my ſelf ſeen it many times in my Travels between <hi>Bononia</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> on the high Mountains, where I have found ſeveral of them. When the Wind blew fair for us again, and we had ſufficiently provided our ſelves with Wood and freſh Water, we hoiſted up our Sails again and came away; and at length (not without great labour and changing of the wind) we got out before the Iſland of <hi>Candy</hi> (which is about Two hundred and fifty <hi>Italian</hi> Leagues long) into the open Sea, with an intention to go ſtrait away for <hi>Venice.</hi> In the mean time one of our Seamen did catch on a Hook, that he had baited with ſome meat, a large Fiſh, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Lamia,</hi> but this Fiſh being of ſome hundered Weight in bulk, he brought him upon the hook by degrees to the Ship, then they faſtened a Rope about his Gills, and ſo drew him up very ſafely. When they did cut it open to ſalt it, I found that its Bones were but very ſmall, and not harder than a Cartilage. They gave us now and then ſome of it to eat, but it was ſo much ſalted, that we could not eat it, ſo that at laſt they were forced to leave it. Soon after one of the Pilgrims, that was a Prieſt at <hi>Lille</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> got a Bloody Flux ſo violently, that he was in danger of his life, ſo I took care of him, and gave him what Phyſick I had by me in the Ship. When we came to the Iſland of <hi>Cerygo,</hi> (elſe called <hi>Cithera</hi>) belonging to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> lying near to the <hi>Morea</hi> (from whence <hi>Paris</hi> took away the Queen of King <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and carried her to <hi>Troy</hi>) upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Hurricane aroſe towards Night with Blowing, Thundering and Lightening, ſo that we at ſeveral times did deſpair of our Lives. For when the Waves ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as big as large Rocks, and preſſed very hard upon our Ship, ſo that they did fling it now on this, and then on the the other ſide again, with great violence; ſo that not only our Goods, Arms, Trunks and Boxes were tumbled up and down in the Ship, but that alſo we were forced to take great care of our ſelves during
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48499:203"/>
this Tempeſt, that we might not tumble over board, we were in great danger. But how terribly ſoever this looked in the dark night, yet it ſtill increaſed; for in a little-while after the place that held the Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that were near unto the Steerage (where I had my Cabin) broke open, ſo that the Bullets ran up and down over all the Ship according as ſhe rolled. Soon after the beating of the Waves knocked off the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that was behind at the outſide of the Ship, and left ſome Nails about a Finger thick, that held it in the Wood, with ſuch a power, that one might hear it almoſt all over the Ship. After all this the great Sail was alſo torn off and fell down into the Sea, ſo that we thought no leſs than that we were all loſt: for then the Ship was wholly left to the mercy of the roaring Waves, that flung her, and toſſed her about like a Foot-ball, from place to place (which you may deduce from thence, that the <hi>Guardian</hi> that held himſelf faſt to the Main Maſt upon the Deck, was ſometimei above a Mans depth under Water) ſo that every moment we expected to be overturned, and ſo drowned. Yet in all this Calamity, we did not give over all, but did what we could for our ſafety, ſeeing that we could not do what we would, we ſtood together and pulled the Sail out again, yet we did not all pull together, for it was ſo dark that we could not ſee one another, but when it lightened, and in the place of the torn one we put up another new one; for generally in ſuch Ships they are provided with two Sails, and alſo with two Maſts and Rudders. After the Seamen had put on the new Sail, not without great labour, difficulty and danger, they fell down upon their knees, and began to pray to their Interceſſors and Patrons (which every one chuſeth for himſelf) by their Names, ſome to <hi>Peter,</hi> other, to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> others to the holy Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but chiefly and before all the reſt to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who in the like imminent Dangers, Neceſſities and Calamities, hath ofteneſt before all the reſt ſhewed himſelf by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Tokens (according to their Opinion) ready to aſſiſt and to help, ſo that they might be ſure of his help, and ſo comfort themſelves with a certain Deliverance.</p>

                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48499:203"/>After they had ſaid their Prayers, they let me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they had ſeen three burning Candles on the top of the Main Maſt, wherefore ſome of them for Joy vowed ſolemnly to go a Pilgrimage to certain Holy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe to give a certain Sum to one of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. This Tempeſtuous weather held on all the Night long, and alſo for a great part of the next Day, ſo that the Seamen Prayed three ſeveral times; I cannot juſtly tell whether I was more aſtoniſhed at their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or at the Tempeſtuouſneſs of the Sea, but chiefly when I underſtood, that they ſought, without <hi>Chriſt</hi> our true Saviour and Helper, in this great danger to others, and ſuch that did not only know nothing of us, as we may ſee by the words of <hi>Eſai,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Abraham knoweth nothing of us, and Iſrael doth not know us</hi>; but that alſo (if they had been ſtill alive) would have directed us themſelves to the true and only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo we read, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf did not know what was become of her Son, until ſhe found him ſitting amongſt the Teachers in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and alſo at the Wedding of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilea,</hi> ſhe did direct the Servants (that told her that they wanted Wine) her ſelf to her Son our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they might not look upon her any more) when ſhe ſaith to them, <hi>What he bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This we left on our right, and did go ſtraight forwards to the next Iſland of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48499:204"/>
belong, as well as <hi>Zant,</hi> to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and had over againſt us a fine large and ſtrong Port called <hi>Argoſtala,</hi> before which it was 14 days before we arrived; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left, a Ship (being under full Sail before a ſtrong Wind and miſſing the Entry) was Staved all in pieces. Into this we got (the Lord be thanked) ſafe, and remained there for ſome days to refreſh our ſelves. Juſt behind this Iſland is the Channel <hi>Viſcardo,</hi> wherein the Great <hi>Armada</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did ride againſt the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ones, until at length it came to a Fight before it, where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> obtained a Glorious Victory. After we found our ſelves in a ſafer and quieter place than we were before, and did hope quickly to get good Bread alſo, inſtead of our old black and Worm-eaten Biskets (which had been Loaden in <hi>Spain</hi> a great while agon, wherewith we had made ſhift a good while) ſome of us went the next morning into the next Village (which was pretty large) to buy ſome. But we did miſs of our aim very much; for being that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants continually and hourly feared that the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe <hi>Armada</hi> was not far off, would make a deſcent upon them therefore they conveyed all the Goods they had into the Caſtle, that we could ſee lye very high beyond the great Harbour, and had kept no more but what was neceſſary for their daily uſe; ſo that no Proviſion at all was to be had or found: And they had ſo little of Bread, that we went about in the Village from Houſe to Houſe, and could hardly get for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as much Bread as would ſerve us for our Dinner. But as for Wine they let us have what we would, which was Red, and very good, which the Merchants knew very well; wherefore they bought a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity thereof, to carry to <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſo did our Ships Maſter alſo. We alſo found many ſmall Grapes growing there, on the Vines, which (as many as I ſaw of them) are rather leſs and lower than ours in our Vineyards. During this our tarrying, our Pilot being Sick, ſo that he was not able to direct the Ship any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Compaſs, our Maſter ſtrove to get another, and that the rather, becauſe the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea whereinto we expected to come daily) is very
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48499:204"/>
dangerous, becauſe of its narrowneſs, plenty of Iſlands, and hidden Rocks, to Navigate. So we got a <hi>Greek,</hi> and after the Weather began to be fairer, we put out to Sea again. But this did not continue long, for when we came out a little out of the Harbor, we had other Winds upon the Sea, that were rather contrary to us, and hindered us ſo very much in our Navigation, that after many days we arrived only before the Fort of <hi>Corfu,</hi> otherways called <hi>Corcyca</hi> (which we could hardly ſee in that Miſty and Foggy Weather) not without great pains and labour. This ill Weather, with the contrary Winds, laſted very long, and encreaſed more and more, the Wind continuing high; ſo that we had almoſt been caſt over into <hi>Apulia</hi> againſt our intention, chiefly between <hi>Cataxo</hi> and <hi>Raguſa,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> had we not quickly made the Iſland of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leda.</hi> So we ſpent our time in this Navigation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hard and contrary Winds, with great pains and labour, but were beſides obliged to be above Deck, (becauſe ſhe was filled up with Goods all vvithin to the vveight of above Tvvelve Thouſand Centners) vvhere vve endured great Cold, and muſt remain there in all the Rain and Storms.</p>
                  <p>After this we went into a ſmall Channel between this and another Iſland, where we lay at Anchor all Night: Early in the morning we ſaw a Galley coming from the Sea upon us. As ſoon as we ſaw her, before we could well diſcern her becauſe of the too great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we made all ready for our defence to reſiſt her; but when ſhe came nearer to us, and we found by her Flags that ſhe was our friend, we were at reſt again, and diſcharged, when ſhe went by us, three great Guns to ſalute her according to the uſual Cuſtom of the Sea. When ſhe was paſt by, we weighed our Anchor alſo, and ſailed to <hi>Curtzola,</hi> another Iſland and Town, towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> called <hi>Corcyra nigra,</hi> which is very ſtrong, and formerly did belong to <hi>Raguſa,</hi> but now it is ſubjected to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This we left on the left hand, and went towards another now called <hi>Lieſena,</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Pharia,</hi> which lay about 50 Leagues nearer to us. This we did ſoon make, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48499:205"/>
arrived in the Port on <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi>-Eve, which is cloſe by the Town, ſo that one can look very pleaſantly into the wide open place. In the morning early, at the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day, thoſe in the Town diſcharged ſome great Guns for Joy, which were in the next Church, ſtanding near to the Harbor, according to their Ancient Cuſtom on ſuch great Holy-days. When theſe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, thoſe alſo that were upon the Caſtle, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, and lieth cloſe to the Town Walls up very high, did diſcharge ſome; after them, thoſe alſo that were upon the 6 Gallies that arrived in the Harbor after us did the ſame; at length it came alſo to our turn, that lay at Anchor in the Harbor, as well the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as the great ones, whereof there was a great many; there it began to bounce and crackle, (for in our Ship we had 16 great ones) and it made ſuch a noiſe in the Harbor, that one would have thought all the Buildings fell over one another. This ſhooting alſo occaſioned ſo great and thick a ſmoak, that we could hardly ſee one another. After Dinner we went aſhore to buy good New Bread, inſtead of our Worm-eaten Biskets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (God be thanked) we found enough, which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us very much. In this time the Prieſt that was dangerouſly Sick of the Bloody Flux, was ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of it, that he, with his Comrades, went over to <hi>Ancona,</hi> to go from thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> After we had rode at Anchor in this Harbor for four days, by reaſon of bad weather, we weighed at length, and came away to the Ancient and Famous Town <hi>Zara,</hi> (by <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> called <hi>Jadera</hi>) which is accompted to be 150 Leagues. Between <hi>Lieſena</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> there lies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſmall Iſlands, where a great many Pirates ſhelter themſelves, that are called by a peculiar Name <hi>Scacki.</hi> Theſe ſleep in the day time, and are here and there on high places, to take notice of the Ships that go up and down, that they may fall upon them in the Night, and take them at a diſadvantage, ſo that it is very dangerous to Ride there; and that ſo much the more, becauſe the Sea is hereabout very narrow, by reaſon of the many Iſlands that lye in it, wherefore the Pilots muſt daily take care, to get in good time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48499:205"/>
a Port, where they may Ride ſecurely all Night-Nay, ſometimes even the Ships in the Harbors are not ſecure from theſe <hi>Scacki</hi>'s or Pirates, for ſo it happen'd that we were once in a Port at Anchor in our Voyage, which although it was very well ſecured and ſtrong, yet we were not ſecure there from the <hi>Sacki's</hi>; as it had happen'd in this ſame Harbor but a year before, to a Ship called <hi>Cantarena</hi> (which the <hi>Sacki's</hi> did get into by Night) which came off greatly by the loſs, ſo that they had great occaſion to remember it; wherefore we divided our ſelves into four parts, and ſo kept Watch by turns all Night long. Whiles we thus kept Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſaw them ſeveral times come in ſmall Boats, as if they were Fiſher-men, yet as I am informed, there are often 40, 50, and 60 Men that lye hid in theſe ſmall Boats, and watch their opportunity to get near to the great Ships, to Board them, and enter upon them. Wherefore as ſoon as we ſaw that they would come to us, we cry'd out, <hi>Fuoco, fuoco,</hi> that is to ſay, Fire, to ſhoot off the Guns at them; when they heard this, they preſently anſwer'd, <hi>Amici, amici</hi>; that is to ſay, We are friends; and ſo they went away again. Now when we believed that we were eſcaped all danger, we got into a greater one by the overſight of our Pilot; for when he had order to go to <hi>Zara,</hi> he did not obey this Command, fearing that our Ship-maſter would put him out there becauſe of his ill behaviour, and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his room, wherefore that he might ſtay longer with us, he Steered for the Iſlands of <hi>Vergetes,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that becauſe he could get over with Gallies (whom he had all along generally ſerved) he might alſo get over with a Merchant-man (that was heavy Laden and ſo drew more Water) ſafe and without any danger. But this did not ſucceed well, for when we ſailed along between the Iſlands, we loſt the depth of Water by degrees, and at laſt ſtrook with a great cracking, ſo that we could expect nothing but Shipwrack, which would of neceſſity have followed if our Rudder had not remained whole in this ſtriking, and lifted up the Poop of the Ship, and ſo ſhoved the fore-part ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the depth; to which ſucceſs the ſwelling
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48499:206"/>
Sails did not alſo contribute a little. So did God, our dear Lord, Miraculouſly ſend that the Ship, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the help of the Rudder (which was at leaſt three ſpans deeper in the Water than the Ship) got off and went on her way. Having eſcaped again this great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and danger, we Landed in another Iſland that was not far off; over againſt which, on the ſide of <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> lieth the Village <hi>Mortera,</hi> between two famous Towns, <hi>viz. Zara</hi> and <hi>Sebernis,</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> on a Mountain of this Iſland (behind which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a good Village) you may pleaſantly ſee the whole ſituation, together with the confines of the <hi>Turks,</hi> very plainly; in this Village we took up and Lodged in it, until our Sloop, that we had ſent out to <hi>Zara</hi> for another and more expert Pilot, came back again.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they arrived with the New Pilot, we broke up again, embarked and ſailed for <hi>Venice,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we had about 250 <hi>Italian</hi> Leagues. When we came out before the Caſtle of <hi>St. Michael</hi> (which lieth in the Sea over againſt <hi>Zara</hi> on a high Mountain) a North Wind aroſe, with ſuch a Tempeſtuouſneſs, that it had almoſt caſt us towards <hi>Italy,</hi> had not our Pilot (who knew the Shores, and Landings of Ships, better than the former) done his beſt, and Landed preſently, which could not be done but with great Might and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, (for we were bound to go againſt the Wind) yet we accompliſhed it; which you may eaſily gueſs, for of thoſe 6 Gallies that met us in <hi>Lieſena,</hi> but two could make our Harbour (becauſe they were not ſtrong enough for the Wind although they uſed their utmoſt force in Rowing) the reſt were forced to go back again, and to ſhelter themſelves behind the outward Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>Into the ſame Harbour was alſo juſt before us run in, to ſhun the ill Weather, a Yatcht, that had about eleven Men on Board; they did Pump out the Water that was run in, and dry their Sails upon the Land, by which we did conjecture that they alſo had not been in ſmall danger. We did ſend ſome of our Men on Board of them to know who they were; and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd us, That they had Letters from the <hi>Great Sultan,</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:48499:206"/>
to their Maſters the <hi>Venetians,</hi> concerning a Peace that was agreed upon, which their Envoy at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had ſent by Land to <hi>Cattaro,</hi> one of their Towns, where they were delivered up to them, to carry them to <hi>Venice</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed. After this great Storm was over, we went on again in our Voyage. By the way I ſaw nothing worth mentioning, but now and then a Village, where ſometimes, if convenient, we Landed, and ſtaid there all Night. In one of them I found a great deal of Saffron, which was very like unto that of <hi>Vienna,</hi> both in look and goodneſs. So at length we came to the large and very deep <hi>Golfo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> by which within lieth the Town <hi>Segna,</hi> where the <hi>Windy-Country</hi> endeth, and the <hi>Hiſter-Land</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. This <hi>Golfo</hi> is about 100 Miles long and 30 broad, ſo that in clear Weather one may ſee very well over it, but it is very dangerous to ſail over it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its great motion, it is eaſily diſcern'd from the Sea from without; over this we came (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) very well, and Landed at <hi>Rovigna,</hi> a ſmall Town ſituated on a high Rock. This belongeth, as well as others thereabout, as <hi>Pola, Parentza,</hi> &amp;c. to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> from whence to <hi>Venice</hi> we have ſtill about 100 Miles. But being that it is very dangerous to go from thence with large and Loaden Ships to <hi>Venice,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Republick doth keep there always ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Pilots (to prevent further miſchief) that do nothing elſe but conduct the Ships that arrive in <hi>Hiſtria</hi> ſafely thither. And theſe do not eaſily put off, unleſs they have very good mild and clear Weather; which was the occaſion that our Ship did tarry there; ſo that we all, except the Seamen, which we left in the Ship behind, went into a Barge on the 14th day of <hi>January</hi> late, and went all Night long to <hi>Venice,</hi> where we all ſafely arrived the 15th of the ſame Month about Noon.</p>
                  <p>At my arrival I met with ſome very good Friends and Acquaintance, with whom I ſtayed for ſeveral days, to refreſh and reſt my ſelf after the great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips I had endured, and Dangers I had paſſed. After they had made me very welcome, and ſhewn unto me
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48499:207"/>
all kindneſs and civility, and I had reſted my ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, I reſolved to Travel with a <hi>Venetian</hi> Poſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany</hi> again; ſo we Travell'd together from thence to <hi>Treviſo, Trent, Botzan, Inſpruck, Amberga,</hi> &amp;c. (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, I found my Couſin <hi>Hans Widholtz,</hi> and <hi>George Hindermayer Botzen</hi> Riding by him, who kept me all that Night with them in their Inn) ſo at length I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the 12th day of <hi>February</hi> 1576, at <hi>Augsburg,</hi> my dear Native Country, to the great Rejoycing of my dear Parents and Relations, which I all found in indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good Health. I thank the Almighty, Merciful and Good God, that is one in his Eſſence, and three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for all his Mercies he hath beſtowed upon me, in all my great Dangers and Neceſſities, both by Sea and Land, for his dear Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his ſake.

                  <p>THIS famous Mountain, ſo celebrated by the Ancients, ſtands in a Peninſula or Promontory of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſtretching out into the <hi>Aegaean</hi> Sea; its Shadow reaches to <hi>Lemnos,</hi> or <hi>Stalamine</hi>; 'tis inhabited only by Monks, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caloyers,</hi> who never marry, though other Prieſts of the Greek Church do. Theſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyers</hi> abſtain from all Fleſh, and even from ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous Fiſhes in <hi>Lent</hi> time; they live very hardly and ſeverely; their ordinary Diſh is pickled Olives, not green like ours, but black and ripe, dry'd without Pickle. There are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48499:213"/>
about 6000 of theſe <hi>Monaſticks,</hi> that inhabit ſeveral places of this Mountain, on which are ſeated 24 large old Monaſteries, encompaſſed with high ſtrong Walls, for defence againſt Pyrates and other Robbers, though they who ſpare no body are kind and indulgent to the <hi>Caloyers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Monaſteries the Ceremonies of the Greek Church are moſt diligently and ſtrictly obſerv'd, and theſe <hi>Caloyers</hi> or Monks are the moſt reverenc'd of any belonging to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves will often ſend them Alms, being taken with the Sanctity of their Lives; and the Monks who inhabit Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> the Deſarts of St. <hi>Anthony, Jeruſalem,</hi> and other holy places, are always the more valued, and reſpected, if they have lived before on Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> which is in as great eſteem and veneration amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> amongſt the <hi>Latines.</hi> This place is under the Juriſdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who pays about 12000 Ducats <hi>per annum</hi> to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> upon the account of the <hi>Europaean</hi> Greek Church. The Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria, Damaſcus, Antioch, &amp;c.</hi> give alſo their particular Sums to the Turk, who gives liberty of Religion to all that pay Tribute.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe 6000 Religious, or Caloyers of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> none lead idle Lives (as moſt of the Monks in other places do) but every one hath his daily Employment, ſome labour with the Ax, Spade, and Sickle, dreſs their Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, cut Trees, build Fiſhing-Veſſels; others carry Sacks full of Proviſion, Bread, and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſome ſpin and weave, their Diſtaff being made of the <hi>Arundo Donax,</hi> and their Spindle of the Herb called <hi>Attractilis</hi>; ſome are Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48499:213"/>
Bricklayers, and Carpenters; they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally clothed like Hermits.</p>
                  <p>This Mountain is about three days Journey long, and may be ſeen about 30 leagues off at Sea; the Monaſteries are at ſome diſtance: They give ſuch Proviſions as they have <hi>gratis</hi> to all Travellers whatſoever, as pickled or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Olives, raw Onions, ſalted Beans, Biſquet, Salted Fiſh, ſometimes freſh, for they often go a fiſhing, their Veſſels or Boats being cut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty out of the thick Trunks of <hi>Plain Trees</hi>; their Nets, for want of Cork, are ſupported with <hi>Gourds,</hi> as they are in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis</hi> with the Bark of <hi>Pines.</hi> The chief Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery is called <hi>Ageas Laura,</hi> and fronts the Iſle of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> it contains about 300 Caloyers or Greek Monks; thoſe that look towards the Continent or <hi>Macedonia</hi> have all their peculiar Names, and contain ſome 200, others 150 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyers. Formerly there were good Greek Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts in theſe Monaſteries, but now none at all, unleſs of Theology; no Poets, no Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, no Philoſophers, not one of the Monks learned, of 6000 ſcarce above two or three know how to write or read, ſo degenerated and depreſs'd is the Greek Nation at preſent: They uſe Wax-Candles and Lamps in their Churches, as alſo Statues, Pictures and Bells: They have no Poultry, Pigeons, or any other Birds; nor Sheep, nor Cows, nor Goats; becauſe they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all Fleſh: They hunt no Game (tho' there is great variety and plenty) only Fiſh near the Shore. I obſerv'd abundance of thoſe Birds called <hi>Molliceps</hi> (a ſort of <hi>Chaffinch</hi>) as alſo of the <hi>Torquilla</hi> or <hi>Wrynecks.</hi> No People have the Privilege of living on this Mountain but theſe <hi>Caloyers.</hi>

                     <hi>Mount Athos</hi> abounds with many rare Plants, but becauſe many of them are already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to grow near <hi>Mount Ida</hi> in <hi>Candia</hi>; I ſhall induſtriouſly omit to name ſuch of them in this place. I obſerv'd here the <hi>Apion</hi> (a ſort of knobbed <hi>Spurge</hi>) which the <hi>Caloyers</hi> themſelves know to be purgative. <hi>Hippogloſſum</hi> or <hi>Horſe-Tongue, Veratrum nigrum,</hi> or <hi>Black Hellebore,</hi> common in the Valleys; <hi>Beech, Hornbeam, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Oleaſter, Myrtles, Oleander</hi> with a red flower, ſeveral <hi>Bindweeds</hi> running up to the high tops of the <hi>Plane Trees,</hi> which here vye in height with the Cedars of <hi>Libanus,</hi> or the Firrs of <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a ſort of <hi>Cantharides</hi> on this Hill called <hi>Bupreſtis,</hi> of a yellowiſh colour, very foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, feeding on Brambles, Succory, Nettle, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyza, and other Herbs: If any Beaſts ſwallow this Inſect, they ſwell and dye. There is a ſort of <hi>Cray-fiſh</hi> in the freſh Rivolets, which the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyers</hi> eat raw, and I my ſelf found the taſte of them very ſweet and grateful: They do not crawl up from the Sea, but breed in the Streams above. There is a Plant in the Valleys called <hi>Elegia</hi> (perhaps a Species of <hi>Arundo</hi>) whoſe Branches ſerve inſtead of Writing-Pens, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Turks</hi> nor the <hi>Greeks</hi> know the uſe of Quills.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caloyers</hi> brought us ſeveral things to eat, as Rocket, Roots of Smallage, the Bulbs of Leeks, Cucumbers, Onions, Garlick, which we eat without either Oyl or Vinegar; black Olives, courſe Bisket, and Wine; they alſo regal'd us with ſalted and dry'd Fiſh, <hi>Sepia</hi>'s, <hi>Polypi,</hi> and <hi>Loligines, Crabbs,</hi> and other Cruſtaceous and Teſtaceous Animals. Theſe Monks had rather dye than eat Fleſh upon any occaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48499:214"/>We aſcended to the very top of <hi>Mount Athos,</hi> where we could not long endure the Cold; we ſaw from thence many adjacent Provinces and Iſlands, as <hi>Caſſandria, Scyton, Lemnos, Thaſſon, Samothracen, Imbron, &amp;c.</hi> In our deſcent we obſerv'd Firrs, and Pitch-Trees, which differ'd a little from thoſe of <hi>Mount Ida,</hi> for in theſe the Cones adher'd ſo cloſe to the Branches, that they would not ſeparate; beſides, theſe were very ſmooth, whereas the others were ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous.</p>
                  <p>There being no Haven under this Mountain, the <hi>Caloyers</hi> are forced to draw their Fiſhing-Veſſels aſhore, and place them behind Iron Gates, leſt the Pyrates ſhould ſet fire to them. They exchange their Grapes, Olives, Figgs, Onions, Garlick, Beans, and Legumes with the Mariners, who bring them ſome Wheat: They have Mills on the Streams of the Hill. They expreſs an Oyl out of their <hi>Bayberries,</hi> which they ſend into <hi>Walachia, Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Servia,</hi> where 'tis ſold. They take abundance of the <hi>Long Oyſter</hi> or <hi>Langouſte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The multitude of Springs and Streams, the variety of Herbage and Evergreens, the Woods and pleaſant Shoar, do all render <hi>Mount Athos</hi> one of the moſt charming places in the World.</p>

                  <p>LEaving <hi>Mount Athos,</hi> we travelled in two days to <hi>Saloniki,</hi> formerly called <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> and in two days more we reach'd <hi>Sidero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capſa,</hi> the <hi>Chryſites</hi> of the Ancients, where now the Turks, and many other Nations, work the rich Oars, which afford yearly a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Treaſure, and make the place much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and reſorted to. 'Tis ſituated amongſt the Valleys, at the foot of high Mountains, and yields monthly to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> for his ſhare only above 18000 Gold Ducats, and ſometimes 30000 clear of all Disburſements. There are about Five or Six hundred Furnaces diſpers'd up and down theſe Mountains, which abound with great varieties of <hi>Pyrites, Marchaſites,</hi> and other Oars, which they work in a different manner from the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Their Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Work-houſes are all placed on the ſides of Rivolets, for all their Bellows play with Wheels turn'd by Streams of Water. The white Soot of the Chimneys is called <hi>Spodus</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholix,</hi> as it differs in colour, of which above ten pounds may be gathered every week. They ſeparate the Lead from the Gold and Silver by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48499:215"/>
particular fuſions, then the Silver from the Gold by <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> Out of the Gold they coyn their Ducats, which are very flexible, and eſteem'd the pureſt Gold in the World, always clean and reſplendent.</p>
                  <p>From theſe metallick Mountains we ſaw <hi>Mount Athos,</hi> and great part of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which appear'd hilly. I obſerv'd here two Serpents never ſeen before by me; the Greeks called them <hi>Sapidi</hi> or <hi>Sapiti,</hi> which comes near to <hi>Seps</hi> or <hi>Sips.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Syderocapſa</hi> gather abundance of the <hi>Rhus</hi> or <hi>Sumach,</hi> which they uſe in preparing their Skins, and tanning their Leather, which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> do with the Pods of their <hi>Acacia,</hi> the <hi>Natolians</hi> with the Cups of the Acorns of a Dwarf-Oak called <hi>Eſculus,</hi> the <hi>Illyrians</hi> with a black Myrtle (perhaps the <hi>Rhus Myrtifolia</hi>) the <hi>French</hi> with Oak bark, the <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> and <hi>Phrygians</hi> with the bark of the <hi>Picea.</hi>

                  <p>In a Lake near <hi>Syderocapſa</hi> I took notice of ſeveral Fiſhes, as one called <hi>Laros</hi> by the Natives, becauſe the <hi>Gulls</hi> feed much upon it, by the Latines <hi>Gania,</hi> by the French <hi>Mouatte,</hi> by thoſe of <hi>Diepe</hi> and <hi>Newport, Mauue.</hi> Another called <hi>Claria,</hi> by thoſe of <hi>Lyons, Lotte</hi>; by the <hi>Pariſians Barbotte.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Liparis,</hi> the <hi>Perch,</hi> young <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In the adjacent Country there are Fallow Deer, Buffalo's, Wild Boar, Goats, Red Deer, and our Roe Deer, Porcupines, Urchins, Wolfs, Foxes, Hares; the Chamois or Rupicapra; the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laphus different from the Hippelaphus.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48499:216"/>Leaving <hi>Syderocapſa,</hi> we ſpent two days in getting to <hi>Cavalla,</hi> anciently called <hi>Boucephala,</hi> whereas we might have gone by Sea in half a day: In this Journey we ſaw the River <hi>Strymon,</hi> and on it Swans, and other Birds like <hi>Pelecans:</hi> At the mouth of this River are ſeen the Remains of a place called by the Natives <hi>Chryſopolis,</hi> tho' <hi>Pliny</hi> puts it not far from <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> We ſaw <hi>Ceres</hi> the <hi>Cranon</hi> of the Ancients; afterwards <hi>Tricala,</hi> and ſo by the ſide of the Mountain <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpota,</hi> through a great Plain to <hi>Philippi,</hi> near which are many Villages and ſeveral Mines. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd hereabouts <hi>Miſſeltoe</hi> on the Oak, as alſo in many other places of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where they make Bird-lime. The Ground is very much over-run with the <hi>Paliurus</hi> and <hi>Rhamnus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ruins of <hi>Philippi</hi> are about two days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Trica</hi> or <hi>Tricala,</hi> and <hi>Philippi</hi> ſcarce three more from <hi>Philippolis.</hi> Theſe were great Roads in the time of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> now heaps of Rubbiſh, and Sepulchres of Marble with <hi>Inſcriptions.</hi> The Iſle of <hi>Taſſo</hi> is but ſix hours diſtant, and from thence this great quantity of white Marble might have eaſily been fetch'd. The Magnificence of <hi>Philippi</hi> may be gueſs'd at from the number of theſe noble Monuments and Inſcriptions, from the fair <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with its Marble Seats: 'Tis not oval, as thoſe at <hi>Otricholi</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſpherical, as thoſe at <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Niſmes:</hi> There are alſo Dorick and Ionick Pillars, with many Statues belonging to the Temple of <hi>Divus Claudius.</hi> At <hi>Cavalla</hi> or <hi>Boucephala</hi> there are ſtill great Ciſterns of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Cement (as at <hi>Baiae</hi>) and <hi>Aquaeducts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Departing from <hi>Cavalla,</hi> we paſs'd by Mount <hi>Haemus,</hi> over the River <hi>Neſus,</hi> and came to <hi>Bouron</hi> on the Salt-Lake of <hi>Biſto,</hi> near a moiſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48499:216"/>
Plain, full of <hi>Cytiſus, Halimus, &amp;c.</hi> as about <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi.</hi> Here are taken great quantity of <hi>Dace</hi> or <hi>Dare,</hi> which they pickle as we do Herrings, as alſo ſmoak and dry them. The Fiſhing on this Lake is very conſiderable, for from hence they ſupply many diſtant places. About ſix hours from <hi>Bouron</hi> we came to <hi>Commercina,</hi> where they ſell great variety of Proviſions; from thence we went to <hi>Cypſella,</hi> where they make Alum by gently calcining the Stone, and letting it diſſolve afterwards in the Air by the Dews and Rains, and then boyling and cryſtallizing the impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Water. In this Journey we ſaw many old <hi>Roman</hi> Highways pav'd with great Stones.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed the <hi>Mariſca</hi> (of old <hi>Hebrus</hi>) in a Ferry, and came to <hi>Vire</hi>; here they waſh ſome Gold out of the Sand, but are often forced to uſe Quickſilver in the ſeparation. The Water of <hi>Hebrus</hi> is very cold in the middle of Summer, and the Banks are ſet with <hi>Tamarisks</hi>; King's-fiſhers build their Neſts in holes on the ſides, they make them of the Bones and Scales of little Fiſhes. The Natives hereabouts often leave their Habitations to work in Harveſt time: Their Sickles differ from ours, and their Corn is not threſh'd but trodden with Cattel. In this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney we found great variety and plenty of <hi>Jaſpars</hi> and <hi>Chalcedony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> gather all the Galls or Excreſcencies on the <hi>Turpentine</hi> Trees, which they ſell at <hi>Pruſa,</hi> for the dying of Silks.

we left <hi>Heraclea</hi> on the left, and paſt <hi>Selibria,</hi> a days Journey diſtant from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Honey of <hi>Heraclea</hi> is ſaid to be pernicious, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe the Country abounds with the <hi>Chamaeleon niger</hi> (a ſort of <hi>Carlina</hi>) to whoſe Root adheres a very venomous Excreſcence called <hi>Ixia,</hi> which may affect the Bees that feed on that Plant.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Muſt beg your Excuſe for not having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you in ſo long a ſpace: The little reſt I have had, and the great unſettledneſs of my Condition is the reaſon. Neither have I now any great Curioſities to impart to you; only ſome ſmall Circumſtances of my Journey I will run over.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Venice</hi> I ſet out with thoſe Gallies which carried their Ambaſſadour that went for the Port. We touch'd at moſt of the conſiderable Towns of <hi>Iſtria</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> by the way. In <hi>Iſtria</hi> we ſaw <hi>Pola,</hi> an ancient Republick. There remains yet an Amphitheatre entire; it is of two orders of <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Pillars, placed one over another, and the lower Pillars ſtand on Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals, which is not ordinary; for, commonly they have nothing but their <hi>Baſes</hi> to ſupport
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48499:219"/>
them. There is, beſides a Temple dedicated to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> a Triumphal Arch, built by a Lady of the Family of the <hi>Sergii,</hi> in honour of ſome of her Kindred, which commanded in theſe Countries; beſides ſeveral Inſcriptions and ancient Monuments, which are in divers parts of the Town.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Dalmatia</hi> I ſaw <hi>Zahara,</hi> which is now the Metropolis of the Country. It was anciently called <hi>Jadera.</hi> It's now very well fortified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encompaſs'd on three ſides with the Sea, and that part which is toward the Land extreamly advantag'd by all the contrivances of Art, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Caſtle and a Rampart of very lofty Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to guard it. I found here ſeveral ancient Inſcriptions, by me copied, which will not find room in the compaſs of a Letter. We paſs'd in ſight of <hi>Zebenico,</hi> and ſaw three Forts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Town, St. <hi>Nicolo,</hi> St. <hi>Gioanni,</hi> and <hi>la Fortezza Vecchia</hi>; but we went not aſhore. That which is moſt worth ſeeing in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> is <hi>Spalatro,</hi> where is <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Palace, a vaſt and ſtupendious Fabrick, in which he made his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence when he retreated from the Empire: it is as big as the whole Town, for the whole Town indeed is patch'd up out of its Ruines, and is ſaid by ſome to take its Name from it. The Building is maſſive; there is within it an entire Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> eight-ſquare, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Porphyry Pillars, and Cornice, worth any bodies admiration. There is a Court before it, adorned with <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Pillars of that Stone cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Lucia</hi>; and up and down the Town ſeveral fragments of Antiquity, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and other things, worth taking notice of.</p>

                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48499:219"/>Four miles from <hi>Spalatro</hi> is <hi>Salona,</hi> which ſhews the ruines of a great Town.

I was at <hi>Leſina,</hi> where is nothing very remarkable; but <hi>Biondi,</hi> that hath written our Engliſh Hiſtory, was of it. <hi>Trau</hi> is ancient, and hath good marks of its being ſo.

                        <p>I was in the Harbour of <hi>Raguſi,</hi> but not in the Town, becauſe we made no ſtay there. From hence we paſt the gulph of <hi>Budua,</hi> and ſaw the Mountains of <hi>Antivari,</hi> the Plain of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and came to <hi>Saſſino</hi> a ſmall Iſland, from whence we could ſee the Town of <hi>Valona,</hi> and the Mountains <hi>Aeroceraunii,</hi> which are very near, and are now called Mountains of <hi>Chimaera.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſtay'd a fortnight in <hi>Carfu,</hi> and had time to view all that was conſiderable in the Iſland, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Gardens of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> that is, the place where they are ſuppoſed to have been, now called <hi>Chryſida,</hi> a moſt delicious ſituation: The ancient Port, now called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>I went from <hi>Zante</hi> to <hi>Patras,</hi> a Town in <hi>Achaia,</hi> of good note among the Ancients. Near it is a great Mountain, mention'd by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> by the name of <hi>Petra Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48499:220"/>
know how to give any account of. There are the Remains of a large Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> who, they ſay, was martyr'd there. This is the firſt Town I ſaw on the Continent of <hi>Greece.</hi> The Plain about it is very fruitful, full of Springs and Rivolets; finely wooded with Olive-trees, Cypreſſes, Orange and Lemon-trees. The Citrons here are counted among the beſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, and are ſent for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> So are all their Fruits in very good eſteem.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> I have ſpent two months. Next to <hi>Rome</hi> I judge it moſt worthy to be ſeen for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of any I have yet been at. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Minerva</hi> is as entire as the <hi>Rotunda.</hi> I was three times in it, and took all the dimenſions, with what exactneſs I could; but it is difficult, becauſe the Caſtle of <hi>Athens,</hi> in which it ſtands, is a Garriſon, and the <hi>Turks</hi> are jealous, and brutiſhly barbarous, if they take notice that any meaſures it. The length of the <hi>Cella</hi> or Body of the Temple without ſide, is—168 Feet Engliſh.<note rend="inter">Theſe Meaſures you may rely on, as exact to half a foot.</note> The breadth—71 Feet Engliſh. The <hi>Portico</hi> of the <hi>Dorique</hi> Order, which runs round it, hath 8 Pillars in front, 17 on the ſides; the length of the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co is 230 feet Engliſh.

                           </gap> and Portico's; but they are too long for a Letter. The <hi>fuſte</hi> or ſhaft of the Pillars is 19½ feet in circumference: The <hi>Intercolumnium</hi> 1¼ of the diameter of the Pillars.</p>
                        <p>The Temple of <hi>Theſeus</hi> is likewiſe entire, but 'tis much leſs, though built after the ſame model. The length of its <hi>Cella</hi> is but 73 feet, the breadth 26. The whole length of the Portico, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48499:220"/>
goes round it, 123 feet. 'Tis a <hi>Dorique</hi> Building, as is that of the <hi>Minerva.</hi> Both of them are of white Marble.</p>
                        <p>About the Cornice on the outſide of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Minerva</hi> is a <hi>baſſo relievo</hi> of men on horſeback, others in Chariots, and a whole proceſſion of people going to a Sacrifice, of very curious ſculpture.

                        <p>In the temple of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> on the Front within-ſide the Portico, at the Weſt-end, is the Battel of the <hi>Centauri,</hi> and at the Eaſt-end ſeems to be a Continuation of that Hiſtory: But there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Figures of Women, which ſeem to be <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the outſide the Portico, in the ſpaces between the <hi>Triglyphi,</hi> are ſeveral of the Proweſſes of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> moſt in Wreſtling with ſeveral perſons, in which he excelled: All his poſtures and locks are expreſt with great art. Others are Monſters, which he is made encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with, as the Bull of <hi>Marathon,</hi> the Bear of <hi>Calydon, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> a round Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, only of ſix feet diameter, but neat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture. The Pillars are of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, which ſupport an Architrave, and Friſe, wherein are done in <hi>relievo</hi> the Labours of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> The top is but one Stone, wrought like a Shield, with a Flower on the outſide, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth like a Plume of Feathers.</p>
                        <p>There is yet ſtanding the Tower of <hi>Andronicus Cirrheſtes,</hi> which is an Octogone, with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of eight Winds, which are large, and of good workmanſhip; and the names of the Winds remain legible in fair Greek characters, (where a Houſe, which is built againſt it on one

                        <p>There is a delicate Temple of the <hi>Conique</hi> Order in the Caſtle, whether of <hi>Pandroſos,</hi> or whom, I cannot tell, but the Work was moſt fine, and all the Ornaments moſt accurately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven:</p>
                        <p>The Length of this Temple was 67 Feet.</p>
                        <p>The Breadth — 38 Feet.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Pillars which remain of a Portico of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> are very ſtately and noble: They are of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, and above 52 feet in height, and 19½ in circumference: They are canellate, and there are now ſtanding ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them, with part of their Cornice on the top. The Building, to which they belonged, I meaſur'd the Area of, as near as I could conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and found it near a thouſand feet in length, and about ſix hundred and eighty in breadth.</p>
                        <p>Without the Town, the Bridge over the <hi>Eliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> hath three Arches, of ſolid Stone-work: the middlemoſt is near 20 feet broad. There is the <hi>stadium</hi> yet to be ſeen, whoſe length I meaſured, and found it 630 feet, near to what the preciſe meaſure of a <hi>stadium</hi> ought to be, <hi>viz.</hi> 625.</p>
                        <p>Towards the Southern Wall of the Caſtle there are the Remains of the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with the Portico of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> which is near it; the ſemi-diameter, which is the right Sine of the demi-circle which makes the Theatre, is about 150 feet, the whole Body of the Scene 256. Monſieur <hi>de la Guilliotiere,</hi> in that Book he hath

written of <hi>Athens,</hi> hath made a Cut of a <hi>Theatre,</hi> which he calls that of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which is a meer fancy and invention of his own, nothing like the Natural one, which by the Plan he has drawn of the Town, I judge he did not know. I give you this one hint, that you may not be deceived by that Book, which is wide from truth, as will appear to any body who ſees the reality, though to one who hath not ſeen it, it ſeems plauſibly written. I have dwelt long on <hi>Athens,</hi> but yet have ſaid nothing. This town alone deſerves a whole Book to diſcourſe of it well, which now I have neither time nor room to do: but I have Memorials by me of all I ſaw, which one day, if it pleaſe God, I may ſhew you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thebes</hi> is a large Town, but I found few An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities in it, excepting ſome Inſcriptions and Fragments of the Old Wall, and one Gate, which, they ſay, was left by <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he demoliſh'd the reſt.

                           <hi>Sparta</hi> is quite forſaken, and <hi>Meſtra</hi> is the Town which is inhabited, four miles diſtant from it: But one ſees great Ruines thereabout; almoſt all the Walls, ſeveral Towers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Temples with Pillars and Chapiters demoliſh'd: A Theatre pretty entire. It might have been anciently ſome five miles in compaſs, and about a quarter of a mile diſtant from the River <hi>Eurotus.</hi> The Plain of <hi>Sparta</hi> and of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> is very fruitful, and long, and well wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It will be about eighty miles in length, as I judge. The Mountains on the Weſt ſide of it very high, the higheſt I have yet ſeen in <hi>Greece</hi>; the <hi>Maniotes</hi> inhabit them. But the Plain of <hi>Calamatta,</hi> which anciently was that of <hi>Meſſene,</hi> ſeems rather richer. <hi>Corone</hi> is very abundant in Olives. <hi>Navarrino,</hi> which is <hi>eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> the ancient <hi>Pylos,</hi> hath a very ſtrong Caſtle, fortified by the Turks, and is the beſt Port in all the <hi>Morea. Alpheus</hi> is much the beſt River, and the deepeſt, and with great reaſon extolled by all the ancient Poets, and choſen for the Seat of the Olympick Games, for it's very pleaſant. The Plains of <hi>Elis</hi> are very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and large, fit to breathe Horſes in, and for hunting, but not ſo fruitful as that of <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Meſſene,</hi> which are all Riches. The beſt Woods I ſaw in <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Achaia,</hi> aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with <hi>Pines</hi> and wild <hi>Pear,</hi> the <hi>Ilex</hi> and <hi>Eſculus</hi>-trees, and, where there runs Water, with <hi>Plane</hi>-trees.</p>

                           <hi>Arcadia</hi> is a very goodly Champain, and full of Cattel, but is all encompaſs'd with Hills, which are very rough and unhewn. <hi>Lepanto</hi> is very pleaſantly ſeated on the Gulf, which runs up as far as <hi>Corinth</hi>; and without the Town is one of the fineſt Fountains I ſaw in <hi>Greece,</hi> very

rich in Veins of Water, and ſhaded with huge Plane-trees, not inferiour in any thing to the Spring of <hi>Caſtalia</hi> on Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> which runs through <hi>Delphos,</hi> except in this, that one was choſen by the Muſes, and the other not; and Poetical Fancies have given Immortality to the one, and never mentioned the other.</p>

                           <hi>Delphos</hi> it ſelf is very ſtrangely ſituated on a rugged Hill, to which you have an aſcent of ſome two or three leagues, and yet that is not a quarter of the way to come up to the Pique of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> on the ſide of which Hill it ſtands: It ſeems very barren to the Eye, but the Fruits are very good, where there are any. The Wines are excellent, and the Plants and Simples, which are found there, very fragrant, and of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.</p>
                        <p>About <hi>Lebadia,</hi> and all through <hi>Baeotia,</hi> the Plains are very fertile, and make amends for the barrenneſs of the Hills which encompaſs them: But in Winter they are apt to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown for that reaſon, and to be turn'd into Lakes, which renders the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Air very thick, and ſo were their Sculls too, if the Ancients may be believed concerning them; though <hi>Pindar,</hi> who was one that ſublimated Poetry to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exaltation, and is much fancied and imitated in our Age, as he was admired in his own, was born there: And <hi>Amphion,</hi> who was ſaid to be ſo divine in his Muſick, that he raviſh'd the very Stones, had skill enough to entice them to make up the Walls of <hi>Thebes:</hi> So that not every thing that is born in a dull Air is dull. Theſe Vales I found much planted with <hi>Cotton,</hi> and <hi>Seſamum,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> of which they make great profit, and a great Trade at <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Lebadia.</hi>

The Channel, which runs between the Town and a Caſtle which ſtands in an Iſland over againſt it, is ſome fifty feet broad; and there are three Mills on it, which ſhew all the changes and varieties that happen in the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

                        <p>In going from <hi>Athens</hi> by Sea, I embarqued in a Port, which lies juſt by <hi>Munichia.</hi> That which they call <hi>Porto Pyraeo</hi> lies behind it a mile diſtant, which is a large Port able to contain 500 Veſſels. There are the Ruins of the Town yet remaining, and of the Walls, which joyn'd it to the City of <hi>Athens.</hi> I ſailed by <hi>Porto Phalero,</hi> the ancient Haven of <hi>Athens,</hi> which is rather a Road than a Port.

I went aſhore on the Promontory of <hi>Sunium,</hi> to view the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Temple of <hi>Minerve,</hi> which ſtood on it. Hence I ſailed among the Iſles of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago, Macroneſia, Thermea, Serphanto, Siphanto,</hi> till I came to <hi>Melo.</hi> From <hi>Melo</hi> I ſailed through the <hi>Cyclades</hi> to come hither. <hi>I</hi> paſs'd by <hi>Andros, Tenos, Mycone, Delos: Nuxia</hi> and <hi>Paros</hi> I ſaw at a

diſtance. We ſailed near the Northern Cape of <hi>Scio,</hi> and the Southern of <hi>Mytilene</hi> or <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and ſo came into the Gulf of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Within this Gulf ſtands <hi>Burla,</hi> near ſome ſmall Iſlands, which is judged to be the ancient <hi>Clazomenae: Foja,</hi> which is the ſame with the ancient <hi>Phocaea.</hi> Near this the River <hi>Hermus</hi> diſcharges it ſelf into this Gulf.</p>
                        <p>In this my Journey I had ſome miſadventures. My Companion Sir <hi>Giles Eaſtcourt</hi> died by the way.

them, but ſent them to ſome honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, accompanied with a Baſſa and Cadi, to inſtruct them in the Arts of War and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; it lies now neglected and deſpoyled of all its Ornaments.</p>
                  <p>In this part alſo are the Sepulchres of <hi>Oſman,</hi> the Founder of the Family which now reigns, and his Son <hi>Urchan,</hi> who took the City, near a Moſch, formerly a Chriſtian Church dedicated to St. <hi>John,</hi> and where was formerly a Convent of Religious, built by <hi>Conſtantinus Iconomachus,</hi> where I ſaw the figure of a Croſs ſtill remaining upon the Wall. Here hangs up a great Drum of a vaſt bigneſs, ſuch as they carry upon the backs of Camels, and I ſuppoſe is one of thoſe which they uſed in the taking of the place.</p>
                  <p>In the lower part, near the bottom of the Hill, <hi>Norad</hi> the ſecond, the Father of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, lies buried; near whereunto was formerly the Metropolitical Church of the Holy Apoſtles. The <hi>Bezeſten,</hi> or Exchange, ſeems to be much better and larger than the great one at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as are the ſeveral Caravanſerais built for the uſe and accommodation of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Travellers; in one of which, the Rice Chane, I took up my quarters.</p>
                  <p>Without the City, toward the Eaſt, is the Moſch and Sepulchre of the Emperor <hi>Bajazid</hi> the firſt, whom the Turks call <hi>Jilderim,</hi> or Lightning, and the Greek Writers <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Not far from hence is the Moſch of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the firſt, and his Sepulchre. Toward the Weſt, upon the ſide of the Hill, is the Moſch of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad</hi> the firſt, whom they call <hi>Gazi,</hi> or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, near which he lies buried. There are in the whole about 124 Moſchs, ſeveral of which were formerly Chriſtian Churches, and between
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48499:235"/>
fifty and ſixty Chanes. The Caſtles built by <hi>Oſman,</hi> when he beſieged the City, are ſlighted and altogether unfortified, the one to the North, the other to the South-weſt.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Checkerghe,</hi> about a mile and a half out of Town, are the hot Baths, much frequented both by Chriſtians and Turks. They are made very convenient to bath in, and are covered over, that they may be uſed in all weathers. Among others, there is a large round <hi>Baſin,</hi> where they uſually divert themſelves by ſwimming.</p>
                  <p>What Opinions the Turks have of our B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and the Chriſtian Religion, I ſhall brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly ſhew, as they lye diſperſed in ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> according to which they frame their Diſcourſe whenſoever either Zeal or Curioſity puts them upon this Topick; for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> upon his ſetting up to be the Author of a new Religion, finding ſuch a conſiderable part of the World profeſſing the Doctrine of Chriſt, with all the Myſteries of Faith therein contained, was caſt upon a neceſſity of ſaying ſomething both concerning him and it. By which it will appear how great the power of Truth is above Impoſture and Subtilty, and that as the Devils in the poſſeſſed confeſs'd, though againſt their wills, Chriſt to be the Son of God, ſo this <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> in the midſt of all his Forgeries and Lyes, and ridiculous and childiſh Narratives, not being able to contradict the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Belief of the Chriſtians of that, and the preceeding Ages, founded on the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, hath been forced to give teſtimony to ſeveral particulars of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48499:235"/>They confeſs then, that Chriſt was born of a pure ſpotleſs Virgin, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> choſen by God, and ſanctified above all the Women in the World; and that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of Heaven, to acquaint her with the news of it. That ſuch a kind of miraculous and ſupernatural Birth never hapned to any beſides, and that Chriſt was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and that he wrought mighty Miracles, for inſtance, that he cleanſed Lepers, gave Sight to the Blind, reſtored Sick perſons to their Health, and raiſed the Dead.</p>
                  <p>That he is a great Prophet, ſent by God to convert men from the vanity and error of their falſe worſhip to the knowledge of the true God, to preach Righteouſneſs, and to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the imperfection and miſcarriages of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; that he was of a moſt holy and exemplary life; that he was the true Word of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of God; that his Goſpel was revealed to him from Heaven, and that he is in Heaven ſtanding nigh to the Throne of <hi>God.</hi> They blaſpheme indeed with a brutiſhneſs and ſtupidity only befitting Turks, the Myſteries of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our B. <hi>Saviour,</hi> and deny that he was put to death, and ſay, that another in his ſhape was crucified by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that he himſelf was aſſumed into Heaven in his body without dying at all, and conſequently they will not own, that he ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for the Sins of the World; ſo great an affinity is there between the Hereſie of <hi>Socinus</hi> and profeſs'd <hi>Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could never yet ſee any Turkiſh Tranſlation of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; they cry up the elegance of the ſtyle, which being Enthuſiaſtick and high-flown,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48499:236"/>
by reaſon alſo of the tinkling of the periods, is very delightful to their Ears, who ſeem to be affected with Rythme mightily. Though I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is upon a more politick account, that they are ſo averſe, as to the tranſlating it into their vulgar Language, not out of reſpect to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of the Original only, whoſe full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Expreſſions they think cannot be tranſlated without a great diminution to the ſence; but to keep it in greater veneration among the People, who might be apt to ſlight and diſeſteem it, ſhould it become thus common among them. It is enough that the Prieſts and Learned men explain the difficult paſſages of it to the people, and write Commentaries for the uſe of the more curious and inquiſitive. The <hi>Perſians</hi> on the contrary think it no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Arabick,</hi> or profanation of the ſence, to tranſlate this curſed Book into their own Language, and Copies are frequent among them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Women are uſually the choiceſt Beauties of the Chriſtian Spoiles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s or <hi>Tartars.</hi> The preſent <hi>Sultana,</hi> the Mother of the young Prince <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> is a Candiot; the <hi>Valide</hi> or Emperors Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> the Daughter of a poor Prieſt, who with her Relations were ſeized upon by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in an Incurſion which they made into the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> Country. She being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> by her beautiful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and cunning Behaviour, gain'd the Heart and the Affection of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> (a man wholly addicted to ſoft Pleaſures, and who ſeldom cared to be long abſent from the Womens Apartment, but choſe to ſpend his time among them.) Having the good Fortune
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48499:236"/>
to be the Mother of the Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the eldeſt Son of his Father, who now reigns, ſhe had all the Honours that could poſſibly be done her, and was the beloved <hi>Hazaki,</hi> or chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine. During this height of Splendour and Glory, the Court removing from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> diſtant about an hundred and twenty miles, as ſhe was paſſing in great ſtate attended with her Guards, through the Streets of the City, in a Coach much like our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-wagons, but that they are latticed to let in the Air (for no one muſt preſume to ſtare, or ſcarce look upon the Women, much leſs muſt they themſelves ſuffer their Faces to be ſeen in this jealous Country) ſhe out of curioſity looking through the holes, ſaw a poor Chriſtian Slave in a Shop where Sugar and ſuch-like Wares were ſold. Upon her return ſhe ſent one of her Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs to enquire for the perſon, and to ask him ſeveral Queſtions about his Country, Relations, Friends, and the time when and how long he had been a Slave: His Anſwers were ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſatisfactory, that ſhe was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth and certainty of her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, when ſhe firſt caſt her Eyes upon him, that he was her Brother, and accordingly it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo. Whereupon acquainting the Emperor with it, ſhe immediately redeemed him from his Patron, and having made the poor Wretch turn <hi>Turk,</hi> got him conſiderably preferred.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s for the moſt part are the Sons of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> taken into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> near the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's perſon, and ſo are preferr'd to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Governments, or elſe they raiſe themſelves by their Conduct and Valour. <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſſa, in the time of <hi>Achmet,</hi> whoſe eldeſt Daughter he married, was the firſt natural <hi>Turk</hi> that was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48499:237"/>
made chief Vizier, having before been Captain Baſſa. The chief Vizier <hi>Mahomet Kupriuli,</hi> (who ſettled the Empire in the minority of this Emperor, when it was ready to be ſhaken into pieces, and diſſolved by ſeveral powerful Factions in the State, and by the Mutinies and Diſcontents of <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi</hi>'s, who drove different ways) was an <hi>Albaneſe</hi> by Birth, the Son of a Greek Brieſt, whom out of the height of his zeal for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he made turn <hi>Turk</hi> in his old age, and converted the Chriſtian Church in the Village where he was born, into a Moſch. This man alſo forbad the <hi>Derviſes</hi> to dance in a ring and turn round, which before was their ſolemn practice at ſet times before the People, which they would do ſo long, till they were giddy by this ſwift circular motion, and fell down in a ſwoon, and then oftentimes upon their recovery from ſuch Trances, they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to revelation. The Churchmen are not very kind to his memory, looking upon him as a man of little or no Religion; and they give out, that if he had lived, he would have forbid their calling to Prayers from the Spires of their Moſchs, and hanging out Lamps; both which they look upon as ſolemn and eſſential to the exerciſe of Religion; but he as the effect of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry and Superſtitition.</p>
                  <p>They have a mighty honour and eſteem for Phyſicians, for though they are of opinion, that they cannot with all their Art prolong Life, the period and term of it being fatal, and abſolutely determin'd by God, yet they often conſult them upon any violent ſickneſs or pain, in order to make the time allotted them in this World more pleaſant and eaſie. It is extraordinary rare, that a natural <hi>Turk</hi> makes Phyſick his profeſſion and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48499:237"/>
ſtudy. They who practiſe it among them, when I was in <hi>Turkey,</hi> were for the moſt part <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> who know nothing of chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicines, but follow the uſual methods, which they learnt in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the former having ſtudied in <hi>Padua,</hi> and the latter in <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> where they paſs'd for good <hi>Catholicks.</hi> And I remember I met with a certain <hi>Jew</hi> Phyſician, who had been a Capucine in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> During the tedious Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> the <hi>Vizier,</hi> what with Melancholy, and what with the ill air of the Camp, finding himſelf much indiſpos'd, ſent for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Phyſician Signior <hi>Maſſalini,</hi> a Subject of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> but married to a Greek Woman, by whom he had ſeveral Children, who was our Neighbour at <hi>Pera,</hi> an experienc'd able man, to come ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to him, and made him a Preſent of about a thouſand Dollars, in order to fit himſelf for the Voyage, and bear the expence of it. By this worthy Gentleman's care he recovered his Health, and would not permit him to depart, till after the ſurrender of that City, which might be about ſeven months after his arrival there, treating him in the mean while with all imaginable reſpect. During our ſhort ſtay at <hi>Burſia,</hi> one of our <hi>Janizaries</hi> accidentally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with a <hi>Turk</hi> about us, whom they knew to be <hi>Franks,</hi> told him that there was a Phyſician in the company, who had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Grand <hi>Signior</hi>'s Court at <hi>Saloniki</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and was now upon his return from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where he lived. This preſently took vent, and the <hi>Turks</hi> thought that they had got a man among them that could cure all Diſeaſes infallibly; for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral immediately came to find us out in behalf
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48499:238"/>
of themſelves or their ſick Friends, and one of the moſt conſiderable men upon the place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Doctor to go to his Houſe to viſit one of his Women ſick in Bed, who being permitted to feel her naked Pulſe (for uſually they throw a piece of fine Silk or Curle over their Womens Wriſts at ſuch times) ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by that and other ſymptoms and indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her Diſtemper, that opening a Vein would preſently give her eaſe, and recover her; which he did accordingly; for which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an embroidered Handkerchief inſtead of a Fee, and gained the reputation of having done a mighty Cure.</p>
                  <p>They have little of ingenious or ſolid Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among them; their chief ſtudy, next to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being metaphyſical Niceties about the Attributes of God, or elſe the maintenance of other odd ſpeculative Notions and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, derived down to them from ſome of their famed Maſters and Holy men, whom they pretend to follow. Their knowledge of the motion of the Heavens, for which the <hi>Arabians</hi> and the other Eaſtern Nations have been ſo deſervedly famous, as their Aſtronomical Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Longitude and Latitude of the fixed Stars, and of the appulſe of the Moon to them, fully evince, is now very mean, and is chiefly ſtudied for the uſe of Judiciary Aſtrology. The great Inſtrument they make uſe of is an Aſtrolabe, with which they make very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obſervations, having no ſuch thing as a Quadrant or Sextant, much leſs a Teleſcope, or any mechanical Engine, to direct and aſſiſt them in their calculation. Their Skill in <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> is as inconſiderable; I remember I heard the Captain Baſſa, whom they ſtile Admiral of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48499:238"/>
the black and white Seas, meaning the <hi>Euxine</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> ask this ſilly queſtion, Whether <hi>England</hi> were out of the <hi>Straits:</hi> And at another time the <hi>Caymacan</hi> or Governour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hearing that <hi>England</hi> was an Iſland, deſired to know how many miles it was about, in order, we ſuppoſed, to make an Eſtimate of our King's greatneſs and ſtrength, by the extent and compaſs of it.</p>
                  <p>One of the great Aſtrologers of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having heard that I had a pair of Globes in my Chamber, made me a viſit on purpoſe to ſee their contrivance, being introduced by a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman of our own Nation. After the firſt Ceremonies were over, I took my terreſtial Globe, and rectified it to the poſition of the place, and pointed to the ſeveral circles both without and upon it, and told him in ſhort the ſeveral uſes of them; then ſhewed him how <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> beared from <hi>Candia,</hi> at that time beſieged, <hi>Cair, Aleppo, Mecca,</hi> and other chief places of the Empire, with the other parts of the World: at which he was mightily ſurprized to ſee the whole Earth and Sea repreſented in that figure, and in ſo narrow a compaſs, and pleaſed himſelf with turning the Globe round ſeveral times together. Afterwards I ſet before him the celeſtial Globe, and rectified that, and ſhewed him how all the noted Conſtellations were exactly deſcribed, and how they moved regularly upon their Poles, as in the Heavens; ſome riſing, and others ſetting, ſome always above the Horizon, and others always under, in an oblique ſphere, and particularly what Stars would riſe that night with us at ſuch an hour; the man ſeemed to be raviſhed with the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, turning this Globe alſo ſeveral times
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48499:239"/>
together with his Finger, and taking a mighty pleaſure in viewing the motion of it; and yet this ſilly Animal paſs'd for a Conjurer among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and was look'd upon as one that could foretell the Events of Battels, the fates of Empires, and the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>They have no Genius for Sea-voyages, and conſequently are very raw and unexperienced in the Art of Navigation, ſcarce venturing to ſail out of ſight of Land. I ſpeak of the natural <hi>Turks,</hi> who trade either in the <hi>black Sea</hi> or ſome part of the <hi>Morea,</hi> or between <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and not of the Pyrates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who are for the moſt part Renegado's, and learnt their Skill in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> which they exerciſe ſo much to the terrour and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of it. A <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Compaſs conſiſts but of eight points, the four Cardinal and four Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral; they being at a mighty loſs how to ſail by a ſide-wind, when by hauling their Sails ſharp they might lye their courſe, and much more, when they are in the Winds eye, not knowing how to make tacks and bords, but chuſe rather to make haſte into ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Port, till the Wind blows fair. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſel, both bound for the Bay of <hi>Saloniki,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s being there, paſs'd together out of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> but foul weather hapning, the Turks got into <hi>Lemnos</hi>; while our men kept at Sea, and purſued their Voyage, and after three weeks ſtay retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to us, obſerving in their way, that the <hi>Turks</hi> remained in the ſame place where they left them, for want of a fore-wind to put to Sea in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48499:239"/>They trouble not themſelves with reading the Hiſtories of other Nations or of ancient times, much leſs with the ſtudy of <hi>Chronology,</hi> without which Hiſtory is very lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; which is the cauſe of thoſe ridiculous and childiſh miſtakes, which paſs current and uncontradicted among them. For inſtance, they make <hi>Job</hi> one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Judges, and <hi>(Iſcander) Alexander the Great</hi> Captain-General of his Army. They number <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> among the Anceſtors of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Sampſon, Jonas,</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi> were his Contemporaries. In this they are more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than their falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> has perverted ſeveral Hiſtorical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in the Writings of the Old Teſtament, and is guilty of vile and abſurd Pſeudo-chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms. To remedy this defect, of which he was very conſcious, and the better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kingdoms and Republicks of it, the late great and wiſe <hi>Vizier, Achamet,</hi> made his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <hi>Panagiotti,</hi> a learned <hi>Greek,</hi> at leiſure hours, even at the Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> as well as at other times, read ſeveral ancient Hiſtories to him, and render them <hi>extempore</hi> into the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Language, and particularly <hi>Blaeus Atlas,</hi> with which he was mightily pleaſed, and made great uſe of, and truly gained the reputation of a ſolid and judicious Stateſman, as well as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier among the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Miniſters, who in the ordinary courſe of their Negotiations applied themſelves to him.</p>

                  <p>In their civil deportment and behaviour one towards another, the left hand is the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and honourable place, except among their Eccleſiaſticks; and the reaſon they alledge is, becauſe they write from the right hand, and the Sword is worn on the left ſide, and ſo is more at his diſpoſal, who walks on that hand.

                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are, as to their temper, ſerious, or rather enclining to moroſity, ſeldom laughing, which is accounted an Argument of great vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lightneſs.

The better and richer ſort, who have nothing to do, ſitting all day at home, dolling upon a Sofa, or rais'd place in their Rooms, and taking Tobacco, which their Slaves fill and light for them: And if they retire in the Summer or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn for a week or fortnight, to ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fountain in a Wood, with their Women, it is chiefly to enjoy the Refreſhments of the cool Air. In the times of Triumph indeed for ſome great Succeſs obtained againſt the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when the Shops are open for three nights together, and hung with Lights, as well as the Spires of the Moſchs in curious Figures, they are guilty of extravagant Mirth, running up and down the Streets in companies, and ſometimes ſinging and dancing after their rude way; but this fit being over, they ſoon return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer melancholy. In the Coffee-houſes where they uſe to reſort to tipple, there is uſually one hired by the Owners to read either an idle Book of Tales, which they admire as Wit, or filthy obſcene Stories, with which they ſeem wonderfully affected and pleaſed, few of them being able to read. Theſe are the Schools which they frequent for their Information, tho' in times of War when things went ill with them, their Diſcourſes would be of the ill Government;

                  <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Coyn in it ſelf is pitiful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, which I aſcribe not only to their want of Bullion, but to their little Skill in matters relating to the Mint. Hence it comes to paſs,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48499:241"/>
that Zecchines and Hungars for Gold, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dollars and Zalotts for Silver ſtamp'd in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> paſs current among them, moſt of the great Payments being made in them, they not caring either through Ignorance or Sloth, to follow the example of the <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperors, who uſually melt down the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Mony imported by the Merchants into their ſeveral Countries, and give it a new ſtamp. The moſt uſual pieces are the Sheriphi of Gold, ſomewhat leſs in value than a <hi>Venetian</hi> Zecchine, and Aſpers, ten of which are equal to Sixpence <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſome few three Aſper pieces. A Mangur is an ugly old Copper piece, eight of which make but one Aſper, and is not I think a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Coyn, but rather <hi>Greek.</hi> They have no Arms upon their Coyn, only Letters emboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on both ſides, containing the Emperor's Name, or ſome ſhort Sentence out of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> look upon Earthquakes as ominous, as the Vulgar do upon Eclipſes, not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Philoſophy of them. During my ſtay in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was above two years, there hapned but one, which was <hi>October</hi> 26. 1669. about ſix a Clock in the morning, a ſtark Calm preceding. It laſted very near a minute, and we at <hi>Pera</hi> and <hi>Galata</hi> were as ſenſible of it as thoſe who were on the other ſide of the Water; but, praiſed be God, nothing fell, and we were ſoon rid of the Fears in which this frightful Accident had caſt us, being in our Beds, and not able, by reaſon of the ſurprize, in ſo little a ſpace to have paſt through a Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry down a pair of Stairs into the Court, if we had attempted it. The Turks made direful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on it, as if ſome Calamity would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48499:242"/>
fall upon the Empire, quickly forgetting the great Triumphings and Rejoycings which they expreſt but a few days before for the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Candia.</hi> In the year 1668, in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Earth ſhook more or leſs for forty ſeven days together in the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> at <hi>Anguri (Ancyra)</hi> and for fifteen at <hi>Bacbaſar,</hi> as we heard from a <hi>Scotch</hi> Merchant, who liv'd there: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that at this latter place, on the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> between three and four of the clock in the Afternoon it laſted for a quarter of an hour; ſeveral Houſes were overthrown, and ſome hundreds of Chimneys fell (it being a very populous Town) and yet there were but ſeven kill'd. The Trembling being ſo violent, both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> forſook their Houſes, and betook themſelves to the Fields, Vineyards, and Gardens, where they made their abode for ſeveral days.</p>
                  <p>Their Puniſhments are very ſevere, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judg'd the moſt effectual way to prevent all publick Diſorders and Miſchiefs. They uſe no great formality in their proceſſes: If the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal be taken in the Fact, and the Witneſſes ready and preſent to atteſt it, and ſometimes if there be but probable circumſtances, without full conviction, condemn him; and ſoon after Sentence, ſometimes an hour or leſs, hurry him away to execution. For an ordinary Crime, Hanging is the uſual Death; but for Robbery and Murder committed upon the High-way, by ſuch as rob in Parties and alarm whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or for Sacrilege, or for any hainous Crime againſt the Government, either Gaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or Excoriation, or cutting off the Legs and Arms, and leaving the Trunk of the Body in the High-way, or empaling, that is, thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48499:242"/>
an Iron ſtake thro' the Body out under the Neck, or at the Mouth; in which extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miſerable wretch may live two or three days, if the Guts or the Heart happen not to be wounded by the pointed Spike in its paſſage. This Puniſhment ſeems to have been in uſe among the <hi>Romans, Seneca</hi>'s Epiſt. 14. <hi>Cogita hoc loco carcerem, &amp; cruces, &amp; eculeos, &amp; uncum, &amp; adactum medium hominem, qui per os emergat, ſtipitem:</hi> And ſo in his Book <hi>De Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione ad Marciam, cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Alii capite converſos in terram ſuſpendere: alii per obſcena ſtipitem egerunt, alii brachia patibulo explicuerunt:</hi> Murder is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pardoned, and eſpecially if the Relations of the murder'd perſon demand Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The Circumciſion, though it be a ſacred Rite, is perform'd in their private Houſes, and never in the Moſchs.</p>
                  <p>The Women colour their Eye-brows and Lids with an ugly black Powder, I ſuppoſe, to ſet off their Beauty by ſuch a ſhadow; and their Nails with the Powder of <hi>Kanna,</hi> which gives them a Tincture of faint red, like Brick, (as they do the Tails and Hoofs of Horſes) which they look upon as a great Ornament. Their great Diverſion is Bathing; ſometimes thrice, if not four times a week. They do not permit them to go to Church in time of Prayer, for fear they ſhould ſpoil their Devotion: The <hi>Turks</hi> being of ſo brutiſh a temper, that their Luſt is raiſed upon the ſight of a fair Object. They are call'd oftentimes by the Names of Flowers and Fruits, and ſometimes fantaſtick Names are given them, ſuch as <hi>Sucar Birpara,</hi> or bit of Sugar, <hi>Dil Ferib,</hi> or Raviſher of Hearts, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48499:243"/>Their Skill in Agriculture is very mean. In their Gardens they have ſeveral little Trenches to convey Water where it may be moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their Plants and Flowers. They know little or nothing of manuring their Grounds: Sometimes they burn their Fields and Vineyards after Harveſt and Vintage, partly to deſtroy the Vermin, and partly to enrich the Soil. They tread out their Corn with Oxen, drawing a ſquare Plank-board, about a foot and half or two foot over, ſtudded with Flints, and winnow it upon their Threſhing-floors in the open Air, the Wind blowing away the Chaff. They feed their Horſes with Barly and chopt Straw, for I do not remember ever to have ſeen any Oats among them; and they make but little Hay.</p>
                  <p>For draught of great weight in their Carts they make uſe of Buffalo's.</p>
                  <p>Camels will endure Travel four days together without Water, and will eat tops of Thiſtles, Shrubs, or any kind of Boughs: They are very ſure footed, and kneel when they are a loading, and live to a conſiderable number of years, ſome even to ſixty.</p>
                  <p>The chief Furniture of their Houſes are Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, or Matts of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> neatly wrought with Straw, ſpread upon the Ground; they having no occaſion of Chairs, Couches, Stools, or Tables, their Poſtures within doors being different from ours. They have no Hangings, but their Walls are whited and ſet off with Painting, only adorn'd with a kind of Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane; no Beds clos'd with Curtains.</p>
                  <p>They Seal not with Wax, but Ink, at the bottom of the Paper, the Emperor's Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſually written with flouriſhes and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd characters: Nor have they any Coats of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48499:243"/>
Arms upon their Seals, there being no ſuch thing as Gentility among them.</p>
                  <p>Some of them, notwithſtanding their Zeal for <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the Religion by him eſtabliſh'd, retain not only a favourable and honourable Opinion of our Bleſſed Saviour, but even place ſome kind of confidence in the uſage of his Name, or of the words of the Goſpel, though it may ſeem to be wholly in the way of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. Thus in their Amulets, which they call <hi>Chaimaili,</hi> being little bits of Paper about two or three fingers breadth, roll'd up in pieces of Silk, containing ſeveral ſhort Prayers or Sentences out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> with ſeveral Circles with other Figures, they uſually inſcribe the holy and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name of JESUS, or the figure of the Croſs, or the firſt words of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and the like. They hang them about their Necks, or place them under their Arm-pits, or in their Boſom near their Hearts (being the ſame with what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Some have them ſow'd within their Caps: and I heard of a <hi>Turk</hi> who was ſo ſuperſtitious herein, that he always pluck'd it off, and was uncover'd, when he had occaſion to make Water. Some are ſuch Bigots in their Religion, and ſo furious againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that not only they treat them with all imaginable Scorn and Contempt, but take it ill to be ſalam'd or ſaluted by them, as if it were the effect of ſawcineſs or unbecoming familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their malice againſt the Chriſtians makes them envy the rich Furs they line their Veſts with, and it is a trouble to theſe hypocritical
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48499:244"/>
Zealots to ſee the <hi>Franks</hi> ride upon their fine <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The reſpect which they ſhew the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is wonderful; they dare not open the Leaves of it with unwaſhen hands, according to the advice or command written in <hi>Arabick</hi> upon the Cover, <hi>Let no one touch this Book, but he that is clean.</hi> They kiſs it, and bend their Heads, and touch their Eyes with it, both when they open it and ſhut it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Janizaries,</hi> when they attend upon <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Ambaſſadors</hi> to their Audience, ſeem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their Bravery, and in a Habit far from that of a Souldier, being without either Fire-Arms or Swords, which latter are not worn, but in time of Service, or when they are upon a march, or embodied, wearing a Cap made of Camels Hair, with a broad flap dangling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, a gilt embroider'd Wreath running round it, and an oblong piece of Braſs riſing up from the middle of their Porehead near a Foot, with a great Club in their Hand, like inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Civil Government. But when they are in the Camp, they throw off their upper Veſt and Turbants, which they wear at all other uſual times, as troubleſome, and put on a Feſs, or red Cap, which ſits cloſe to their Head, and tuck up their <hi>Duliman</hi> or long Coat to their Girdle, that they may be the more quick and expedite in their Charge.</p>
                  <p>They affect ſinery and neatneſs in their Clothes and Shaſhes; not ſo much as a ſpot to be ſeen upon them, and in rainy or ſuſpicious Weather are very careful how they go abroad without their <hi>Yamurlicks,</hi> which is a kind of Coat they throw over their Heads at ſuch times.</p>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48499:244"/>Their Pans and Diſhes are for the moſt part of Copper, but ſo handſomely tinn'd over, that they look like Silver.</p>
                  <p>There are thouſands of Gypſies or <hi>Zinganies</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> who live the ſame idle naſty kind of life as they do in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and pretend to the ſame art of telling Fortunes; and are lookt upon as the offscouring of Mankind.

                  <p>The <hi>Derviſes</hi> generally are melancholy, and place the greateſt part of their Religion in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and other Severities. Some cut their Fleſh, others vow not to ſpeak for ſix or ſeven years, or all their lives long, though never ſo much provoked or diſtreſſed. Their Garments are made of a courſe ſort of Wool, or Goats Hair: they are tyed up by the Vow of their Order ever from marrying. Several of this Sect, in the height of their Religious Phrenzy, have attempted upon the lives of the Emperors themſelves, (at whoſe Government they have taken diſguſt) as <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, and <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> as if ſuch deſperate attempts were fatal to Bigots in all Religions.</p>
                  <p>They pay a mighty Veneration to any Relick of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> his Banner is ſtill preſerved in the Treaſury of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and is look'd upon as the great Security of the Empire. They believe that it was ſent from Heaven, and conveyed into the hands of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> as a Pledge and ſign of Succeſs and Victory in his Battels againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and all other Enemies of the <hi>Muſulman</hi> Faith. It was ſent to <hi>Candia,</hi> to encourage the Souldiers to endure the fatigue of that long and tedious Siege; and when it was brought thence after the ſurrender of that City, to be depoſited in its uſual place, the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi> gave ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, that row'd in the Galley that was fraught with this holy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48499:246"/>
Ware, their Liberty. They pretend to have ſome Rags of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Veſt, to which they aſcribe great vertue. In confidence of which the Emperor <hi>Achmet,</hi> in the time of a great fire, which raged at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when all other means failed, dipt part of them in Water, to be ſprinkled upon the Fire to rebate the fury of it.</p>

                  <p>The Prieſts have no Habit peculiar to their Profeſſion, whereby they are diſtinguiſh'd from others. If they are put from their Moſchs for Miſcarriage or Neglect of doing their Duty, or if they think fit to reſign and be Prieſts no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they may betake themſelves without any ſcandal to ſecular Employments, their former Character and Quality wholly ceaſing. While they remain Prieſts, they counterfeit a more than ordinary gravity in their diſcourſe and walking: and affect to wear Turbants ſwelling out, and made up with more croſs folds: which was all the difference which I could obſerve by their Head-Attire, which is various, though I could not find that this was conſtantly and ſtrictly obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Byram</hi> time, which is the great Feſtival of the year, at which time every one looks cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and merrily, among other ſigns of mutual Reſpect, they beſprinkle one another with ſweet Water. They indulge to ſeveral Sports; and ſome are mightily pleaſed with Swinging in the

                  <p>The Government is perfectly arbitrary and deſpotical; the Will and Pleaſure of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror having the force and power of a Law, and oftentimes is above it. His bare Command, without any proceſs, is enough to take off the Head of any Perſon, (though never ſo eminent in Dignity; though uſually for formality, and to ſilence the murmurings of the Souldiery and People, the Sentence is confirmed by the <hi>Mufti.</hi>) Sometimes <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, who have amaſſed great Treaſures in their Governments, are cut off in their own Houſes in the midſt of their Retinue, the Meſſengers of Death producing the Imperial Command, uſually ſent in a black Purſe, and not a Sword drawn in their defence. Others, if they are obnoxious to the leaſt Umbrage or Jealouſie, tho' diſmiſt the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtrations of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and with rich Preſents in order to take poſſeſſion of Places of great command in the Empire, before they have got two or three days Journey from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> have been overtaken and ſtrangled. In the Army Commands are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to merit, Courage and Conduct are ſure to be rewarded, the way lying open to the meaneſt Souldier to raiſe himſelf to be the Chief of his Order. But other Preferments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon meer Chance, and upon the Fancy of the Emperor, whether the perſon be fit or no, and they are as ſoon loſt. The leaſt ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or miſcarriage proves oftentimes fatal, and a more lucky man is put in his place, and he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a third, if unfortunate in a deſign, though managed with never ſo much Prudence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48499:247"/>
and Valour. They admit of no hereditary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and have no reſpect to Deſcent or Blood, except the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; he only is great and noble whom the Emperor favours, and while his Command laſts. According to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that paſſes current amongſt them, a Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's Son by a <hi>Sultana,</hi> or a Daughter or Siſter of the Emperor, can riſe no higher than to be a <hi>Sangiacbei,</hi> or Governor of ſome little Province, much inferiour to a Baſſa, and under his Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Being born of Slaves for the moſt part, they do not pride themſelves in their Birth, very few among them being ſcarce able to give any account of their Grandfathers. They have no Sirnames, but are diſtinguiſhed by their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and places of abode, and enjoying by Law a liberty of having what Women they pleaſe, they have little or no regard to Alliance or Kindred.</p>
                  <p>Their Empire owes the continuance of its Being to the ſeverity of the Government, which oftentimes takes place without regard either to Juſtice or Equity, and to their frequent Wars, which prevent all occaſions of Mutiny and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction among the Souldiers, which happen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when unemploy'd. So that tho' Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may put a warlike Sultan upon enlarging his Territories by new Conqueſts, yet reaſon of State forces a weak and effeminate Prince, ſuch as was <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to make War for his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Their Politicks are not owing to Books and Study, and the Examples of paſt-times, but to Experience, and the plain ſuggeſtions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common Sence: They have Rules of Government, which they firmly adhere to, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Reins ſtreight, eſpecially being cruel and inexorable to Criminals of State, who never are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48499:247"/>
to expect any Mercy or Pity. Their Councils formerly were open, and their Deſigns known, and proclaimed before-hand, as if this had been a Bravery becoming their greatneſs, and that they ſcorned to ſteal a Conqueſt. But they have learned ſince the Art of Diſſimulation, and can lye and ſwear for their Intereſt, and ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive in their Careſſes to the Miniſters of thoſe Countries, which they intend to invade. But their Preparations for arming are made with ſo much noiſe, that an ordinary Jealouſie is ſoon awakened by it to oppoſe them, in caſe of an attack. They ſeldom or never care to have War at both Extremes of the Empire at the ſame time, and therefore they are mighty ſollicitous to ſecure a Peace with <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> when they intend a War upon the <hi>Perſian</hi>; and as much as is poſſible, they avoid quarrelling with two <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes at once, being uſually at league either with <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> when they war upon <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſo on the contrary; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more than a Union of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes bordering upon them, which would prove ſo fatal to their Empire, and quickly put a Period to their Greatneſs; for hereby they would be put upon a neceſſity of making a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War, to their great loſs and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and at laſt either be forced to beg a Peace of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or run the hazard of loſing all by a further proſecution of War.</p>
                  <p>This they are very ſenſible of, and therefore as they take all occaſion to promote Quarrels and Diſſentions in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> ſo they greatly rejoyce, when the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are at War one with another. This is their great time of advantage, and they know, that it is their true Intereſt to purſue it, though they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48499:248"/>
do not always, by reaſon of the ill condition of their own Affairs, make uſe of it. During the Civil Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Baſſa's and other Commanders of the Army were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to make a War on that ſide, and to enlarge his Conqueſts as far as <hi>Vienna,</hi> no conjuncture having been ever ſo favourable to conſummate ſuch a deſign, in which <hi>Solyman</hi> ſo unhappily miſcarried. They promiſed him an eaſie Victory, aſſuring him, that the Animoſities of the Princes of the Empire were ſo heightned, that there was no room left for a Reconciliation, that he was but to go in the Head of an Army to take poſſeſſion, and that <hi>Auſtria</hi> would ſurrender at the firſt news of his march towards it. The Emperor was not to be moved at that time by theſe Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and plauſible Diſcourſes; being continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged, he as often denyed. One day when they came to renew their Advice about the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> War, he having given order before, that ſeveral Dogs ſhould be kept for ſome days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meat, commanded that they ſhould be brought out, being almoſt ſtarved, and Meat thrown among them; whereupon they ſnailed and bit one another: In the midſt of their noiſe and fighting he cauſed a Bear to be let looſe in the ſame Area; the Dogs forgetting their Meat and leaving off their fighting, ran all upon the Bear, ready to prey upon them ſingly, and at laſt killed him. This Diverſion the Emperor gave his Baſſa's, and left them to make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>A certain Prophecy, of no ſmall Authority, runs in the minds of all the People, and has gain'd great credit and belief among them, that their Empire ſhall be ruined by a Northern
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48499:248"/>
Nation, which has white and yellowiſh Hair. The Interpretation is as various as their Fancy. Some <hi>fix</hi> this Character on the <hi>Moſcovites</hi>; and the poor <hi>Greeks</hi> flatter themſelves with fooliſh hopes, that they are to be their Deliverers, and to reſcue them from their Slavery, chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of their Communion, and owe their Converſion to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, to the Piety and Zeal of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Biſhops formerly. Others look upon the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> as the perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the Prophecy, whom they are moſt to fear. The Ground and Original of his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I ſuppoſe, is owing to the great Opinion which they have of the Valour and Courage of that warlike Nation. The great Victories of the <hi>Sweeds</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> under <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> were loudly proclaimed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as if there were no withſtanding the ſhock and fury of their Arms: and their continued Succeſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the <hi>Turks</hi> in their firſt Belief, and their Fears and their Jealouſies were augmented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when <hi>Charles Guſtave,</hi> a Prince of as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick a Courage, and as great Abilities in the Art and Management of War as the juſtly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> entred <hi>Poland</hi> with his Army, and carried all before him, ſeized upon <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and drove <hi>Caſimire</hi> out of his Kingdom, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt made an entire and abſolute Conqueſt, only a few places holding out. This alarmed the Grand Signior, and the Baſſa's of the <hi>Port,</hi> as if the Prophecy were then about to be fulfilled, who did not care for the company of ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Neighbours, who might puſh on their Victories, and joyning with the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> advance their Arms further, and make their Country the Seat of a War, which might draw after it fatal conſequences. To prevent which, Couriers are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48499:249"/>
diſpatch'd from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> then in concert with the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> to command him to retire with his Army out of <hi>Poland,</hi> as he valued the Peace and Safety of his own Country, and the friendſhip of the Grand Signior, whoſe Tributary he was, and by whoſe Favour he had gain'd that Principality: And the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> the ſworn Enemies of the <hi>Poles,</hi> who at that time lay heavy upon them, were wrought upon by the ſame Motives and Reaſons of State, to clap up a Peace with them, that being freed from theſe diſtractions, they might unite their Forces the better together, and make head againſt the <hi>Sweeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> when they are admitted by the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to an Audience, (their Preſents being then of courſe made, which are look'd upon as due, not to ſay, as an homage) are diſmiſt in few words, and referred by him to his <hi>Wakil</hi> or Deputy, as he uſually ſtiles the chief <hi>Vizier:</hi> and a ſmall number of their Retinue only permitted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of kiſſing his Veſt, and then rudely enough ſent away.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signiors keep up the ſtate of the old <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Princes: They do not expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves often to the view of the People, unleſs when they ride in Triumph, or upon ſome ſuch ſolemn occaſion; when they go to the Moſchs, or divert themſelves in the Fields, either in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or hunting, they do not love to be ſtared upon, or approached. It is highly criminal to pry into their <hi>Sports,</hi> ſuch an inſolent Curioſity being often puniſhed with Death. The Story is famous of <hi>Morad</hi> the Third, who baiting a Bear in the old Palace with a Maſtiff, and eſpying three fellows upon the Tower of <hi>Bajazid</hi>'s
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48499:249"/>
Moſch, who had planted themſelves to ſee the <hi>Sport,</hi> commanded their Heads to be ſtruck off immediately, and be brought before him, which was done accordingly. Inſtances of ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio's are frequent in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory: This following hapned during my ſtay at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the return of Vizier <hi>Achmet</hi> from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> after the ſurrender of that City, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end put by him to that tedious and bloody War, he acquainting the preſent Emperor, then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> with the Hiſtory of that famous Siege at large, made ſuch terrible Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their and the <hi>Venetians</hi> mining and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining one another, that the Emperor was reſolved out of curioſity to ſee the Experiment made of a thing that ſeemed to him almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. A Work was ſoon raiſed and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and above thirty Murderers and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon the High-way, and ſuch-like Villains were put into it, as it were to defend it. The Grand Signior ſtood upon an Eminence at ſome conſiderable diſtance, expecting the iſſue of it; upon a Signal given, the Mine was ſprung, and the Fort demoliſhed, and the poor wretches torn piecemeal, to his great ſatisfaction and amazement.</p>

And firſt for <hi>Byzantium,</hi> the received Latitude of it by <hi>Appianus, Mercator, Ortelius, Maginnus,</hi> and ſome others, is 43 degrees and 5 minutes.

a true information. Though it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> in places remoter from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> hath much erred. I ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in our own Country, where he ſituates <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But in my judgment <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is very excuſable in theſe and the like Errors, of ſeveral other places far diſtant from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſeeing he muſt for their poſition neceſſarily have depended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon relations of Travellers, or Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mariners, or upon the Longitude of the day, meaſured in thoſe times by <hi>Clepſydrae</hi>; all which how uncertain they are, and ſubject unto Error, if ſome celeſtial Obſervations be not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and thoſe exactly taken with large Inſtruments, (in which kind the Ancients have not many, and our times, (excepting <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Arabians</hi>) but a few) I ſay no man, that hath converſed with modern Travellers and Navigators, can be ignorant.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE firſt and faireſt of the three greater <hi>Pyramids</hi> is ſituated on the top of a rocky Hill, in the Sandy Deſart of <hi>Lybia,</hi> about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile diſtant to the Weſt, from the Plains of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> above which the Rock riſeth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred feet or better, with a gentle and eaſie aſcent. Upon this advantageous Riſe, and upon this ſolid Foundation the <hi>Pyramid</hi> is erected; the heighth of the ſituation adding to the beauty of the Work, and the ſolidity of the Rock giving the Superſtructure a permanent and ſtable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Each ſide of the <hi>Pyramid,</hi> computing it according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> contains in length 800
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48499:257"/>
Graecian feet: And in <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> account 700 <hi>Strabo</hi> reckons it leſs than a furlong, that is leſs than 600 Graecian feet, or Six hundred twenty five Roman. And <hi>Pliny</hi> equals it to 883. That of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> in my judgment, comes neareſt to the Truth, and may ſerve in ſome kind to confirm thoſe proportions, which in another Diſcourſe I have aſſigned to the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian meaſures: For meaſuring the North ſide of it, near the <hi>Baſis,</hi> by an exquiſite <hi>radius</hi> of ten feet in length, taking two ſeveral ſtations, as Mathematicians uſe to do, when any Obſtacle hinders their approach, I found it to be Six hundred ninety three feet, according to the Engliſh Standard; which quantity is ſomewhat leſs than that of <hi>Diodorus.</hi> The reſt of the ſides were <hi>examined</hi> by a line, for want of an even level and a convenient diſtance to place my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, both which the <hi>Area</hi> on the former ſide afforded.</p>
                  <p>The Altitude of this <hi>Pyramid</hi> was long ſince meaſured by <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> who according to <hi>Tatianus Aſſyrius</hi> lived about the fiftieth Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, but his Obſervations is no where by the <hi>Ancients</hi> expreſſed: Only <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of a courſe propoſed by him, how it might be found, and that is by obſerving ſuch an hour, when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the body is equal to its height. A way at the beſt, by reaſon of the faintneſs and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the extremity of the ſhadow, in ſo great an Altitude, uncertain, and ſubject unto Error. And yet <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Thales,</hi> hath the ſame Story, from the Authority of <hi>Hieronymus. Hieronymus</hi> reports, That he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the <hi>Pyramids</hi> by their ſhadow, marking when they are of an equal quantity. Wherefore I ſhall paſs by his, and give my own Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48499:258"/>
The Altitude is ſomething defective of the Latitude; though in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s computation it exceeds; but <hi>Diodorus</hi> rightly acknowledges it to be leſs, which if we meaſure by its perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is Four hundred eighty one feet; but if we take it as the <hi>Pyramid</hi> aſcends inclining (as all ſuch Figures do) then it is equal, in reſpect of the lines ſubtending the ſeveral angles, to the Latitude of the <hi>Baſis,</hi> that is to ſix hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three feet.</p>
                  <p>What exceſſive heighths ſome fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or borrow from the relations of others, I ſhall not now examine. This I am certain of, that the <hi>Shaft or Spire</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> before it was caſually burnt, being as much, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than the altitude of the Tower now ſtanding (1647) did exceed the height of this <hi>Pyramid.</hi> For <hi>Cambden</hi> deſcribes it to have been in a perpendicular, five hundred and twenty feet from the Ground.</p>
                  <p>If we imagine upon the ſides of the <hi>Baſis,</hi> which is perfectly ſquare, four equilateral trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles mutually propending, and enclining, till they all meet on high as it were in a point (for ſo the top ſeems to them which ſtand below) then ſhall we have a true notion of the juſt dimenſion and figure of this Pyramid: The <hi>Perimeter</hi> of each triangle comprehending two thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty nine feet (beſides the Latitude of a little Plain, or Flat on the top) and the <hi>perimeter</hi> of the <hi>Baſis</hi> Two thouſand ſeven hundred ſeventy two feet: Whereby the whole <hi>area</hi> of the <hi>Baſis</hi> (to proportion it to our meaſures) contains four hundred eighty thouſand, two hundred forty nine ſquare feet, or eleven Engliſh Acres of Ground, and 1089 of 43560 parts of an Acre. A proportion ſo monſtrous, that if the Ancients
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48499:258"/>
did not atteſt as much, and ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to be more, this Age would hardly be induced to give credit to it. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing each ſide to contain eight hundred feet, the <hi>area</hi> muſt of neceſſity be greater than that by me aſſigned, the ſum amounting to ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty thouſand; or computing it as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> doth, the <hi>area</hi> will comprehend four hundred and ninety thouſand feet: And in the calculation of <hi>Pliny,</hi> if we ſhall ſquare eight hundred eighty three (which is the number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by him to the meaſure of each ſide) the Product ſeven hundred ſeventy nine thouſand ſix hundred eighty nine, will much exceed both that of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and this of <hi>Diodorus.</hi> Though certainly <hi>Pliny</hi> is much miſtaken, in aſſigning the meaſure of the ſide to be eight hundred eighty three feet, and the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Pyramid to be but eight <hi>iugera,</hi> or Roman Acres: For if we take the Roman <hi>iugerum</hi> to contain in length two hundred and forty feet, and in breadth one hundred and twenty, as may be evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Varro,</hi> and is expreſly affirmed by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> then will the <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> or whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, of the <hi>iugerum</hi> be equal to twenty eight thouſand eight hundred Roman feet; with which if we divide ſeven hundred ſeventy nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred eighty nine, the reſult will be twenty ſeven Roman <hi>iugera,</hi> and 2089 of 28800 parts of an Acre. Wherefore if we take thoſe numbers eight hundred eighty three of <hi>Pliny</hi> to be true, then I ſuppoſe he writ twenty eight <hi>iugera,</hi> inſtead of eight, or elſe in his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſide, to the <hi>area</hi> of the <hi>Baſis</hi> he hath erred.</p>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48499:259"/>The aſcent to the top of the Pyramid is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in this manner. From all the ſides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we aſcend by degrees; the lowermoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is near four foot in height, and three in breadth. This runs about the Pyramid in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and at the firſt, when the Stones were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which are now ſomewhat decay'd, made on every ſide of it a long but narrow Walk. The ſecond degree is like the firſt, each Stone amounting to almoſt four feet in height, and three in breadth; it retires inward from the firſt near three feet, and this runs about the Pyramid in a level, as the former. In the ſame manner is the third row placed upon the ſecond, and ſo in order the reſt, like ſo many Stairs riſe one above another to the top. Which ends not in a point, as Mathematical Pyramids do, but in a little flat or ſquare. Of this <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath no where left us the dimenſions, but <hi>Henricus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> an able and deſerving man, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſupplied it for him; for he makes it to be eight <hi>orgyiae</hi>; where if we take the <hi>orgyia,</hi> as both <hi>Heſychius</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> do, for the diſtance between the Hands extended at length, that is for the fathom, or ſix feet, then ſhould it be forty eight feet in breadth at the top. But the truth is, <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in this particular, whilſt he corrects the Errors of <hi>Valla</hi>'s Interpretation, is to be corrected himſelf; for that Latitude which <hi>Herodotus</hi> aſſigns to the admirable Bridge below (of which there is nothing now remaining) he hath carried up, by a miſtake, to the top of the Pyramid. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> comes nearer to the truth, who deſcribes it to be but nine feet. <hi>Pliny</hi> makes the breadth at the top to be twenty five feet, <hi>Altitudo</hi> (I would rather read it <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo</hi>) <hi>à cacumine pedes</hi> 25. By my meaſure it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48499:259"/>
13 feet, and 280 of 1000 parts of the Engliſh foot. Upon this flat, if we aſſent to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Proclus,</hi> it may be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi> Prieſts made their Obſervations in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and that from hence, or near this place, they firſt diſcovered, by the riſing of <hi>Sirius,</hi> their <hi>annus</hi>

That the Prieſts might near theſe Pyramids make their obſervations, I no way queſtion, this riſing of the Hill being, in my Judgment, as fit a place as any in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for ſuch a deſign, and ſo much the fitter by the vicinity of <hi>Memphis.</hi> But that theſe Pyramids were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Obſervatories, (whereas by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Ancients I have proved before, that they were intended for Sepulchres) is no way to be credited upon the ſingle authority of <hi>Proclus.</hi> Neither can I apprehend to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Prieſts with ſo much difficulty ſhould aſcend ſo high, when below with more eaſe, and as much certainty, they might from their own Lodgings hewn in the Rocks upon which the Pyramids are erected, make the ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For ſeeing all <hi>Aegypt</hi> is but as it were one continued plain, they might from theſe Cliffs have, over the Plains of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as free and open a proſpect of the Heavens, as from the tops of the Pyramids themſelves. And therefore <hi>Tully</hi> writes more truly, <hi>Aegyptii, aut Babylonii, in cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum patentium aequoribus habitantes, cum ex terra ad nihil emineret, quod contemplationi coeli officere poſſet, omnem curam in ſiderum cognitione poſuerunt.</hi>

The top of this Pyramid is covered not with <note n="(d)" place="margin">Les voyages de Seign. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont.</note> one or <note n="(e)" place="margin">

The degrees by which we aſcend up (as I obſerved in meaſuring many of them) are not all of an equal depth, for ſome are near four feet, others want of three, and theſe, the higher we aſcend, do ſo much the more diminiſh: neither is the breadth of them alike, the difference in this kind being, as far as I could conjecture, proportionable to their depth. And therefore a right line extended from any part of the <hi>Baſis</hi> without, to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of every degree. Of theſe it was impoſſible for me to take an exact meaſure, ſince in ſuch a revolution of time, if the inner parts of the Pyramid have not loſt any thing of their firſt perfection, as being not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Injury of the <note n="*" place="margin">The Air of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is confeſſed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to be often full of Vapors; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both by the great dews that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after the Deluge of <hi>Nilus</hi> for ſeveral months; as alſo in that I have diſcovered at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Winter time, ſeveral obſcure Stars in the conſtellation of <hi>

the <hi>Delta,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as the <hi>Lybian</hi> Mountains terminate it on the <hi>Weſt,</hi> being ſo vaſt, that the breadth and depth of every ſtep is one ſingle and entire Stone. The relation of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> is more admirable, who make the leaſt Stone in this Pyramid to be thirty feet. And this I can grant in ſome, yet ſurely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted in all, unleſs we interpret their words, that the leaſt Stone is thirty ſquare, or to ſpeak more properly, thirty cubical feet; which dimenſion, or a greater, in the exteriour ones, I can without any difficulty admit. The number of theſe Steps is not mentioned by the Ancients, and that cauſed me, and two that were with me, to be the more diligent in computing them, becauſe by modern Writers, and ſome of thoſe too of repute, they are deſcribed with much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and contrariety. The degrees, ſaith <hi>Bellonius,</hi> are two hundred and fifty, each of them ſingle contains in height forty five digits, at the top it is two paces broad; for this I take to be the meaning of what <hi>Cluſius</hi> renders thus: <hi>Abaſi autem ad cacumen ipſius ſupputationem facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, comperimus circiter,</hi> 250 <hi>gradus, ſinguli altitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem habent</hi> 5 <hi>ſolearum calcei</hi> 9 <hi>pollicum longitudinis, in faſtigio duos paſſus habet.</hi> Where I conceive his <hi>paſſus</hi> is in the ſame ſence to be underſtood here above, as not long before he explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in deſcribing the <hi>Baſis</hi> below, which in his account is 324 <hi>paſſus paululum extenſis cruribus. Albertus Lewenſtainius</hi> reckons the Steps to be two hundred and ſixty, each of them a <hi>foot and a half</hi> in depth. <hi>Johannes Helfricus</hi> counts them to be two hundred and thirty. <hi>Sebaſtianus Serlius,</hi> upon a relation of <hi>Grimano the</hi> Patriarch <hi>of Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> and <hi>afterwards Cardinal,</hi> (who in his Travels in <hi>Aegypt</hi> meaſured theſe degrees) computes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48499:261"/>
them to be two hundred and ten, and the height of every ſtep to be equally three palms and a half. It would be but loſt labour to mention the different and repugnant relations of ſeveral others; that which by experience and by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent calculation I and two others found, is this, that the number of degrees from the bottom to the top, is two hundred and ſeven, though one of them in deſcending reckoned two hundred and eight.</p>
                  <p>Such as pleaſe, may give credit to thoſe fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Traditions of ſome, That a Turkiſh Archer ſtanding at the top, cannot ſhoot beyond the bottom, but that the Arrow will neceſſarily fall upon theſe ſteps. If the Turkiſh bow (which by thoſe figures which I have ſeen in ancient Monuments, is the ſame with that of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ſo dreadful to the <hi>Romans</hi>) be but as ſwift and ſtrong as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; as ſurely it is much more, if we conſider with what incredible force ſome of them will pierce a Plank of ſix inches in thickneſs, (I ſpeak what I have ſeen) it will not ſeem ſtrange, that they ſhould carry twelve ſcore in length, which diſtance is beyond the <hi>Baſis</hi> of this Pyramid.</p>

Which Traditions of theirs are little better than a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>; and therefore leaving theſe, I ſhall give a more true and particular deſcription out of mine own Experience and Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>On the North ſide aſcending thirty eight feet, upon an artificial bank of Earth, there is a ſquare and narrow paſſage leading into the Pyramid, through the mouth of which (being equidiſtant from the two ſides of the Pyramid) we enter as it were down the ſteep of an Hill, declining with an angle of twenty ſix degrees. The breadth of this Entrance is exactly three feet, and 463 parts of 1000 of the Engliſh foot; the length of it beginning from the firſt declivity, which is ſome ten palms without, to the utmoſt extremity of the Neck, or ſtreight within, where it contracts it ſelf almoſt nine feet continued, with ſcarce half the depth it had at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, (though it keep ſtill the ſame breadth) is ninety two feet and an half. The Structure of it hath been the Labour of an exquiſite Hand, as appears by the ſmoothneſs and evenneſs of the Work, and by the cloſe knitting of the Joynts; a Property long ſince obſerved, and commended by <hi>Diodorus,</hi> to have run through the Fabrick of the whole Body of this Pyramid. Having paſſed with Tapers in our Hands this narrow Straight; though with ſome difficulty (for at the farther
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48499:262"/>
end of it we muſt Serpent-like creep upon our Bellies) we land in a place ſomewhat larger, and of a pretty height, but lying incompoſed: Having been dug away, either by the curioſity or avarice of ſome, in hope to diſcover an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Treaſure; or rather by the Command of <hi>Almamon,</hi> the deſervedly renowned Calife of <hi>Babylon.</hi> By whomſoever it were, it is not worth the enquiry, nor doth the place merit deſcribing, but that I was unwilling to pretermit any thing, being only an Habitation for Batts, and thoſe ſo ugly, and of ſo large a-ſize, (exceeding a foot in length) that I have not elſewhere ſeen the like. The length of this obſcure and broken ſpace containeth eighty nine feet, the breadth and height is various, and not worth conſideration. On the left hand of this, adjoyning to that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Entrance through which we paſſed, we climb up a ſteep and maſſy Stone, eight or nine feet in height, where we immediately enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lower end of the firſt Gallery. The Pavement of this riſes with a gentle acclivity, conſiſting of ſmooth and poliſht Marble, and where not ſmeared with Duſt and Filth, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a white and alabaſter colour; the Sides and Roof, as <hi>Titus Livius Burretinus,</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> an ingenious young man, who accompanied me thither, obſerved, was of impoliſh'd Stone, not ſo hard and compact as that on the Pavement, but more ſoft and tender; the breadth almoſt five feet, and about the ſame quantity the height, if he have not miſtaken. He likewiſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome irregularity in the breadth, it opening a little wider in ſome places than in others; but this inequality could not be diſcerned by the eye, but only by meaſuring it with a careful Hand. By my obſervation with a Line, this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48499:263"/>
Gallery contained in length an hundred and ten feet. At the end of this begins the ſecond Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, a very ſtately piece of work, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, either in reſpect of the curioſity of Art, or richneſs of Materials, to the moſt ſumptuous and magnificent Buildings. It is divided from the former by a Wall, through which ſtooping, we paſſed in a ſquare hole, much about the ſame bigneſs as that by which we entred into the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid but of no conſiderable length. This nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage lyeth level, not riſing with an accli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as doth the Pavement below and Roof above of both theſe Galleries. At the end of it, on the right hand, is the Well mentioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> the which is circular, and not ſquare, as the <hi>Arabian</hi> Writers deſcribe: The diameter of it exceeds three feet, the Sides are lined with white Marble, and the deſcent into it is by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening the Hands and Feet, in little open ſpaces, cut in the Sides within, oppoſite and anſwerable to one another in a perpendicular. In the ſame manner are almoſt all the Wells and Paſſages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ciſterns at <hi>Alexandria</hi> contrived, without Stairs or Windings, but only with inlets and ſquare holes on each ſide within, by which, uſing the Feet and Hands, one may with eaſe deſcend. Many of theſe Ciſterns are with open and double Arches, the lowermoſt Arch being ſupported by a row of ſpeckled and <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble Pillars, upon the top of which ſtands a ſecond row, bearing the upper and higher Arch: The Walls within are covered with a ſort of Plaiſter for the colour white, but of ſo durable a ſubſtance, that neither by time, nor by the water is it yet corrupted and impaired. But I return from the Ciſterns and Wells there to this in the Pyramid, which in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Calculation is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48499:263"/>
                     <hi>eighty ſix cubits in depth,</hi> and it may be was the paſſage to thoſe ſecret Vaults mentioned, but not deſcribed by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that were hewn out of the natural Rock, over which this Pyramid is erected. By my meaſure ſounding it with a line, it contains twenty feet in depth. The reaſon of the difference between <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Obſervation and mine, I ſuppoſe to be this, That ſince his time it hath almoſt been dammed up, and choaked with Rubbage, which I plainly diſcovered at the bottom, by throwing down ſome combuſtible matter ſet on fire. Leaving the Well, and going on ſtraight upon a level, the diſtance of fifteen feet, we entred another ſquare paſſage, opening againſt the former, and of the ſame bigneſs. The Stones are very maſſy, and exquiſitely joynted, I know not whether of that gliſtering and ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled Marble I mention'd in the Columns, of the Ciſterns at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This leadeth (run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in length upon a level an hundred and ten feet) into an arched Vault or little Chamber, which by reaſon it was of a Grave-like ſmell, and half full of Rubbage, occaſion'd my leſſer ſtay. This Chamber ſtands Eaſt and Weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the length of it is leſs than twenty feet, the breadth about ſeventeen, and the height leſs than fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. The Walls are entire, and plaiſter'd over with Lime; the Roof is covered with large ſmooth Stones, not lying flat, but ſhelving and meeting above in a kind of Arch, or rather an Angle. On the Eaſt ſide of this Room, in the middle of it, there ſeems to have been a paſſage leading to ſome other place, whither this way the Prieſts went into the hollow of that huge <hi>Sphynx,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> term it, or <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphynx,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> calls ſuch kinds (being by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s calculation 102 feet in compaſs about the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48499:264"/>
Head, in height 62, in length 143, and by my obſervation made of one entire Stone) which ſtands not far diſtant without the Pyramid, South-eaſt of it, or into any other private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, I cannot determine; and it may be too this ſerved for no ſuch purpoſe, but rather as a <hi>Theca</hi> or <hi>Nicchio,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> ſpeak, wherein ſome Idol might be placed; or elſe for a piece of Ornament (for it is made of poliſh'd Stone) in the Architecture of thoſe times, which ours may no more underſtand than they do the reaſon of the reſt of thoſe ſtrange proportions that appear in the Paſſages and inner Rooms of this Pyramid. Returning back the ſame way we came, as ſoon as we are out of this narrow and ſquare paſſage, we climb over it, and going ſtraight on, in the trace of the ſecond Gallery, upon a ſhelving pavement (like that of the firſt) riſing with an angle of twenty ſix degrees, we at length come to another partition. The length of the Gallery from the Well below to this partition above, is an hundred fifty and four feet; but if we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the pavement of the floor, it is ſomewhat leſs, by reaſon of a little vacuity (ſome fifteen feet in length) as we deſcribed before, between the Well and the ſquare hole we climbed over. And here to reaſſume ſome part of that, which hath been ſpoken, if we conſider the narrow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at the mouth of the Pyramid, by which we deſcend, and the length of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Galleries, by which we aſcend, all of them lying as it were in the ſame continued line, and leading to the middle of the Pyramid, we may eaſily apprehend a reaſon of that ſtrange Eccho within, of four or five Voices, mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Fourth Book, <hi>De placitis philoſopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>; or rather of a long continued <hi>Sound,</hi> as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48499:264"/>
I found by experience, diſcharging a Muſquet at the entrance; for the ſound being ſhut in, and carried in thoſe cloſe and ſmooth paſſages, like as in ſo many Pipes or Trunks, finding no iſſue out, reflects upon it ſelf, and cauſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe and circulation of the Air, which by degrees vaniſhes, as the motion of it ceaſes. This Gallery or <hi>Corridore</hi> (or whatſoever elſe I may call it) is built of white and poliſh'd Marble, the which is very evenly cut in ſpacious Squares or Tables. Of ſuch Materials as is the Pavement, ſuch is the Roof, and ſuch are the Side-walls that flank it; the coagmentation, or knitting of the Joynts, is ſo cloſe, that they are ſcarce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable by a curious Eye; and that which adds a grace to the whole Structure, though it makes the paſſage the more ſlippery and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, is the acclivity and riſing of the Aſcent. The height of this Gallery is 26 feet, the breadth is 6 feet, and 870 parts of the foot divided into a thouſand of which three feet, and 435 of 1000 parts of a foot, are to be allowed for the way, in the midſt; which is ſet, and bounded on both ſides with two banks (like Benches) of ſleek and poliſh'd Stone; each of theſe hath one foot, 717 of 1000 parts of a foot in breadth, and as much in depth. Upon the top of theſe Benches, near the Angle, where they cloſe, and joyn with the Wall, are little ſpaces, cut in right angled pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Figures, ſet on each ſide oppoſite to one another, intended, no queſtion, for ſome other end than Ornament. In the caſting and ranging of the Marbles in both the Side-walls, there is one piece of Architecture, in my judgment very graceful, and that is, that all the courſes or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are but ſeven, (ſo great are thoſe Stones) do ſet, and flag over one another about
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48499:265"/>
three inches, the bottom of the uppermoſt courſe overſetting the higher part of the ſecond, and the lower part of this overflagging the top of the third, and ſo in order the reſt, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend.</p>
                  <p>Having paſſed this Gallery, we enter another ſquare hole, of the ſame dimenſions with the former, which brings us into two <hi>anticamerette,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> would call them, or <hi>Anticloſets,</hi> (give me leave in ſo unuſual a ſtructure to frame ſome unuſual terms) lined with a rich and ſpeckled kind of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble. The firſt of theſe hath the dimenſions almoſt equal to the ſecond; the ſecond is thus proportioned, the <hi>Area</hi> is level, the Figure of it is oblong, the one ſide containing ſeven feet, the other three and an half, the height is ten feet. On the Eaſt and Weſt ſides, within two feet and an half of the top, which is ſomewhat larger than the bottom, are three Cavities, or little Seats, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>This inner <hi>Anticloſet</hi> is ſeparated from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by a Stone of red ſpeckled Marble, which hangs in two Mortices (like the leaf of a Sluce) between two Walls, more than three feet above the pavement, and wanting two of the Roof. Out of this Cloſet we enter another ſquare hole, over which are five lines cut parallel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, I have not obſerved any other Sculptures or Engravings in the whole Pyramid, and therefore it may juſtly be wondred whence the <hi>Arabians</hi> borrowed thoſe vain Traditions I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48499:265"/>
before related, <hi>That all Sciences are inſcribed within in Hieroglyphicks.</hi> And as juſtly it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, upon what authority <hi>Dio,</hi> or his Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizer <hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> reports that <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> (whom <hi>Strabo</hi> more truly names <hi>Aelius Gallus,</hi> with whom he travelled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as a friend and companion) <hi>engraved in the Pyramids his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,</hi> unleſs we underſtand ſome other Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids not now exiſtent. This ſquare paſſage is of the ſame wideneſs and dimenſions as the reſt, and is in length near nine feet, (being all of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble, moſt exquiſitely cut) which lands us at the North end of a very ſumptuous and well proportion'd Room. The diſtance from the end of the ſecond Gallery to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, running upon the ſame level, is twenty four feet. This rich and ſpacious Chamber, in which Art may ſeem to have contended with Nature, the curious Work being not inferiour to the rich Materials, ſtands as it were in the Heart and Center of the Pyramid, equidiſtant from all the Sides, and almoſt in the midſt between the <hi>Baſis</hi> and the top. The Floor, the Sides, the Roof of it are all made of vaſt and exquiſite Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble, which if they were not vailed, and obſcured by the ſteam of Tapers, would appear gliſtering and ſhining. From the top of it deſcending to the bottom, there are but ſix ranges of Stone, all which being reſpectively ſized to an equal height, very gracefully in one and the ſame altitude, run round the Room. The Stones which cover this place are of a ſtrange and ſtupendious length, like ſo many huge beams lying flat, and traverſing the Room, and withal ſupporting the infinite maſs and weight of the Pyramid above. Of theſe there are nine which cover the Roof, two of them are leſs by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48499:266"/>
half in breadth than the reſt, the one at the Eaſt end, the other at the Weſt. The length of this <note n="(b)" place="margin">Theſe proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Chamber, and thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the length and breadth of the hollow part of the tomb, were taken by me with as much exactneſs as it was poſſible to do; which I did ſo much the more diligently, as judging th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The breadth of the Weſt ſide at the Joynt or Line, where the firſt and ſecond row of Stones meet, is ſeventeen feet, and an hundred and ninety parts of the foot divided into a thouſand (that is 17 feet, and 190 of 1000 parts of a foot.)

                  <p>Within this glorious Room (for ſo I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it) as within ſome conſecrated Oratory, ſtands the Monument of <hi>Cheops,</hi> or <hi>Chemnis,</hi> of

                  </head>
                  <p>FROM this Pyramid we went to the ſecond, being ſcarce diſtant the flight of an Arrow from it; where by the way I obſerved, on the Weſt ſide of the firſt, the Ruines of a pile of Building, all of ſquare and poliſhed Stone; ſuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Baſaltes,</hi> and deſcribes to be <hi>ferrei coloris, &amp; duritiae, of an Iron colour and hardneſs.</hi> Formerly it may be ſome Habitation of the Prieſts, or ſome Monument of the Dead. To the right hand of this, tending to the South, ſtands this ſecond Pyramid, of which beſides the Miracle, the Ancient and modern Writers, have delivered little. <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, that <hi>Cephren,</hi> in imitation of his Brother <hi>Cheops,</hi> built this, but that he fell ſhort in reſpect of the magnitude: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have meaſured them.</hi> It were to be wiſhed, for fuller ſatisfaction of the Reader, he had expreſſed the quantity, and alſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he took his meaſure. He adds, <hi>It hath no ſubterraneous Structures, neither is the</hi> Nilus <hi>by a Channel derived into it, as in the former. Diodorus</hi> ſomewhat more particularly deſcribes it thus: That <hi>for the Architecture, it is like unto the former, but much inferiour to it in reſpect of magnitude: Each ſide of the Baſis contains a ſtadium in length.</hi> That is, to comment on his words, of Graecian
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48499:269"/>
feet ſix hundred, of Roman ſix hundred twenty five. So that by this computation, each ſide ſhould want an hundred Graecian feet of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Pyramid. <hi>Pliny</hi> makes the difference to be greater, for aſſigning eight hundred eighty three feet to the former, he allows to the ſide of the Baſis of this, but ſeven hundred thirty ſeven. By my obſervation, the Stones are of colour white, nothing ſo great, and vaſt, as thoſe of the firſt and faireſt Pyramid; the ſides riſe not with degrees like that, but are ſmooth and equal, the whole Fabrick (except where it is oppoſed to the South) ſeeming very entire, free from any deformed Ruptures or Breaches. The height of it, taken by as deliberate a conjecture as I could make, (which it was eaſie to do, by reaſon of the nearneſs of this and the former, being both upon the ſame Plain) is not inferiour to it; and therefore <hi>Strabo</hi> hath rightly judged them to be equal. The ſides alſo of the <hi>Baſis</hi> of both are alike, as, beſides the authority of <hi>Strabo,</hi> the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Doctor aſſured me, who meaſured it with a line. There is no Entry leading into it, and therefore what may be within, whither ſuch ſpaces and compartiments, as I obſerv'd in the former, or whether different, or none, I muſt leave to every mans private conjecture, and to the diſcovery of after-times.</p>
                  <p>This is bounded on the North and Weſt ſides, with two very ſtately and elaborate pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I do not ſo much admire, as that by all Writers they have been pretermitted. About thirty feet in depth, and more than a thouſand and four hundred in length, out of the hard Rock theſe Buildings have been cut in a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, and ſquared by the Cheſſel, as I ſuppoſe, for Lodgings of the Prieſts. They run along at
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48499:269"/>
a convenient diſtance, parallel to the two ſides we mentioned of this Pyramid, meeting in a right angle, and making a very fair and graceful Proſpect. The entrance into them is by ſquare openings, hewn out of the Rock, much of the ſame bigneſs with thoſe I deſcribed in the firſt Pyramid. Whether theſe were ſymbolical (as the Theology of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> conſiſted much in myſterious figures) and the depreſſure and lowns of theſe were to teach the Prieſts humility, and the ſquareneſs and evenneſs of them an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and regular deportment in their actions, I leave to ſuch as have written of their Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks to determine. The hollow ſpace within of them all, is ſomewhat like to a ſquare and well-proportion'd <hi>Chamber,</hi> covered and arched above with the natural Rock: In moſt of which, (as I remember) there was a paſſage opening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other compartiment, which the rubbage and darkneſs hindered me from viewing. On the North ſide without I obſerved a line, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, engraven with ſacred and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Characters, ſuch as are mentioned by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> to have been uſed by the Prieſts, and were different from the vulgar characters in civil Affairs: In which former kind <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> makes <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been skilful, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes him to have been learned in all the wiſdom of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Theſe ran not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> in our times write, but were continued in a ſtreight line, as we uſe to write: And are to be read (if any underſtand thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Sculptures) by proceeding from the right hand to the left, and as it were imitating the motion and courſe of the Planets: For ſo <hi>Herodotus</hi> expreſly informs us, That the <hi>Graecians</hi> write and caſt account, going from the left hand
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48499:270"/>
to the right, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> from the right hand to the left.

                  </p>
                  <p>It will be in vain to repeat the Traditions and Deſcriptions of ſeveral others; all which by a kind of Confederacy agree in the ſame Tale for the ſubſtance, only differing in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: So that I ſhrewdly ſuſpect that <hi>Diodorus</hi> hath borrowed moſt of his Relation from <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>; and <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> from <hi>Diodorus,</hi> or from them both; and the more learned Neote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks from them all. For elſe how can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they ſhould ſo conſtantly agree in that, which if my Eyes and Memory extreamly fail me not, is moſt evidently falſe? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have a ſtrong jealouſie, that they never came near this third Pyramid; but that they did, as I have obſerved all Travellers in my time in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to do, fill themſelves ſo full, and as it were ſo ſurfeit with the ſight of the greater and fairer Pyramid, that they had no Appetite to be Spectators of the reſt, where they ſhould only ſee the ſame Miracle (for the Pyramids are all of the ſame figure) the farther they went, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and preſented as it were in a leſs Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. Or if they did view this, it was <hi>quaſi per tranſennam,</hi> very perfunctorily and ſlightly; and that through a falſe and coloured Glaſs; for they have miſtaken both in the quality of the Stone and colour of the Pyramid. I begin with <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> who by a notable piece of Forgetfulneſs, if it be not a <gap reason="foreign">

Preſumption to correct the place, and inſtead of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. I know not how to palliate or excuſe his other Error, where he makes this Pyramid to be built as far as to the middle of it, with <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Marble. If this ſort of Marble be <hi>ferrei colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as it is deſcribed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and granted by <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> both of them expreſſing the colour to be black, and the latter bringing it from the remoteſt Mountains of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where the Marble hath the ſame Tincture and Colour with the Inhabitants, then can this relation of <hi>Herodotus</hi> no way be admitted; for the whole Pyramid ſeems to be of clear and white Stone, ſomewhat choicer and brighter than that in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two other Pyramids. And therefore I wonder that <hi>Diodorus, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and amongſt latter Authors <hi>Bellonius, Gillius,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, ſhould have all follow'd <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when with a little pains and circumſpection, they might have reformed his, and their own errour. It may perhaps be alledged in their defence, that they mean the Buildings within are erected with black and <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Marble; and yet if this be granted, ſince there is no entrance leading into this, no more than is into the ſecond Pyramid, what may be within depends upon the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Tradition or Conjecture, both which are very fallible; though it cannot be denied, but that cloſe by this, on the Eaſt ſide of it, there are the ruines of a Pile of Building, with a ſad and dusky colour, much like that we deſcribed in paſſing to the ſecond Pyramid, which might be the ground and occaſion of this Error. I cannot excuſe the Ancients, but <hi>Bellonius</hi> or <hi>Gillius</hi> (for it is no matter which of them owns the relation, when both of them have erred) are far more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48499:271"/>
inexcuſable, becauſe it might have been expected from them what <hi>Livy</hi> ſuppoſes, <hi>Novi ſemper ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptores, aut in rebus certius aliquid allaturos ſe, aut ſcribendi arte rudem vetuſtatem ſuperaturos credunt.</hi> Whereas theſe on the contrary have depraved what hath been in this particular with Truth delivered by the Ancients; for whereas <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> equal the ſide of the <hi>baſis</hi> to three hundred feet, and <hi>Pliny</hi> extends it to three hundred ſixty three, theſe make it only a third part greater than the Pyramid at <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>C. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius,</hi> near the <hi>Mons teſtaceus.</hi> So that either they have much enlarged that at <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſhrunk and contracted this; for the Pyramid at <hi>Rome,</hi> exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſured on that ſide which ſtands within the City, is compleatly ſeventy eight feet Engliſh in breadth, to which if we add a third part of it, the reſult will be an hundred and four; which ſhould be equal to this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Pyramid in the notion and acception of <hi>Bellonius.</hi>

ſome of them were very conſiderable. And therefore I cannot but tax the omiſſion of the Ancients, and the inadvertency of all modern Writers and Travellers, who with too much ſupineneſs have neglected the deſcription of one of them; which in my Judgment is as worthy of memory, and as near a Miracle as any of thoſe three which I have mentioned. And this ſtands from theſe South and by Weſt, at twenty miles diſtance, more within the Sandy Deſart, upon a rocky level like theſe, and not far from the Village whence we enter the <hi>Mummies.</hi> This as the <hi>Venetian</hi> Doctor aſſured me, and as I could judge by <hi>conjecture</hi> at a diſtance, hath the ſame dimenſions that the firſt and faireſt of theſe hath, Graduations or Aſſents without, and of the ſame colour like that, (but more decayed, eſpecially at the top) and an entrance into it on the North ſide, which is barred up within; and therefore whatſoever is ſpoken of the firſt, in reſpect of the exteriour figure, is applicable to this. <hi>Bellonius</hi> exceeds in his computation of the number of them, who thus writes: <hi>Above an hundred others are ſeen diſperſed up and down in that Plain.</hi> I could not diſcover 20.

                  <p>WE had ended our Diſcourſe of the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, but that I find one ſcruple toucht upon by <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> which is worth the diſcuſſion, as a point of ſome concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Architecture</hi>; and that is, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner theſe Pyramids were built, and with what Art and Contrivance the Stones, eſpecially thoſe vaſt ones in the firſt were conveyed up. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> who firſt raiſed the Doubt, gives this ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<q>They carried up the reſt of the Stones with little Engines made of Wood, raiſing them from the ground upon the firſt row: When the Stone was lodged upon this row, it was put into another Engine, ſtanding upon the firſt ſtep, from thence it was conveyed to the ſecond row by another: For ſo many rows and orders of Steps as there were, ſo many Engines were there; or elſe they removed the Engine, which was one, and eaſie to be carried, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular row, as often as they moved a Stone. We will relate that which is ſpoken of either part; therefore thoſe in the Pyramid were firſt made, which were the higheſt, then by degrees the reſt, laſt of all, thoſe which are neareſt to the Ground, and are the loweſt.</q>
The firſt part of this Solution of <hi>Herodotus</hi> is full of difficulty. How in the <hi>erecting</hi> and <hi>placing</hi> of ſo many <hi>machinae,</hi> charged with ſuch maſſy Stones, and thoſe continually paſſing over the lower degrees, could it be avoided, but that they muſt either unſettle them, or endanger the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48499:273"/>
breaking of ſome Portions of them; which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilations would have been like Scars in the Face of ſo magnificent a Building? His ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is the ſounder; but I conceive the Text to be imperfect. <hi>Diodorus</hi> hath another Fancy:
<q>The Stones (ſaith he) at a great diſtance off were prepared in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and they report, that by the help of <hi>Aggeres</hi> (Engines not being then invented) the Work was erected. And that which begets the greateſt admiration is, that ſo vaſt a Structure was perfected in that place, which is all about repleniſhed with Sand, where there appears not any Relicks ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Aggeres, or of the hewing and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Stones: So that it ſeems not piecemeal by the Induſtry of Men, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at once, the whole pile, as it were by ſome God, was erected in the midſt of the Sands. Some of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> relate Wonders of it, and endeavour to obtrude I know not what Fables, namely, That theſe Aggeres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Salt and Nitre, were diſſolved by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the River, which wholly conſumed them without the labour of Hands, leaving this Structure (entire.) But the truth of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſo, but that thoſe multitudes of men which were employed in raiſing the Aggeres, carried them away unto their former places: For as they report three hundred and ſixty thouſand men were employed in theſe Offices, and the whole Work was ſcarce finiſhed in the ſpace of twenty years.</q>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> partly agrees with him, and partly gives another Anſwer: <hi>The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, by what means the Cement is conveyed up to ſuch a height</hi> (he rather might have queſtion'd how thoſe vaſt Stones were conveyed up) <hi>ſome ſay, that banks of Nitre and Salt were made up as

the Work roſe, which being finiſhed, they were waſhed away by the River</hi> (Nilus.) <hi>Others imagine that Bridges were made with Brick; which, the Work being ended, were diſtributed into private Houſes: for they conceive that the</hi> Nilus <hi>being much lower, could not come to waſh them</hi> (away.) If I may aſſume the liberty of a Traveller, I imagine that they were erected, neither as <hi>Herodotus</hi> deſcribes, nor as <hi>Diodorus</hi> reports, nor as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates, but that firſt they made a large and ſpacious Tower in the midſt reaching to the top; to the ſides of this Tower, I conceive, the reſt of the Building to have been applied, piece after piece, like ſo many Buttreſſes or Supporters, ſtill leſſening in height, till at laſt they came to the lowermoſt degree. A difficult piece of building taken in the beſt, and eaſieſt projection; and therefore it is no wonder, if it were not often imitated by the Ancients, and no where expreſſed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the great Maſter of Architecture <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius.</hi> Yet ſurely if we judge of things by the events, and if we reflect upon the intention of Monuments, which are raiſed by the Living, to perpetuate the Memory of the Dead, then is this as commendable a way as any. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee at <hi>Rome,</hi> that though by the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſo many Ages the <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> be almoſt decayed, and the <hi>Septizonium</hi> of <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> be utterly loſt, both intended for laſting and ſtately Sepulchres, yet the Pyramid of C. <hi>Caeſtius</hi> ſtands fair and almoſt entire; which is no more to be compared, either for the vaſtneſs of the Stones or the whole bulk and fabrick of it, with theſe, than are the limbs and body of a Dwarf to the dimenſions of a Gyant, or ſome large <hi>Coloſſus.</hi>

<q>It is confeſſed, that theſe Works (ſpeaking of the Pyramids) far excel the reſt in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not only in the maſſineſs of the Structures, and in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, but alſo in the Induſtry (and Skill) of the Artificers.

<q>We ought not to omit one of the ſtrange things ſeen by us at the Pyramids: Some heaps of Stone, being Fragments hewn off lye before the Pyramids, amongſt theſe are found little Stones, ſome in the ſimilitude and bigneſs of lentils, ſome as grains of Barly, which appear half unſcaled: They report theſe are ſome Relicks of the Proviſions, which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Workmen, and have been petrified; which ſeems probable enough.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, if there were ever any ſuch, are either conſumed by time, or ſcattered by the Winds, or buried with thoſe Tempeſts of Sand, to which the Deſarts are perpetually expoſed: But <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who not long preceded him, was not ſo

                  <p>IN my firſt Voyage to <hi>Aegypt</hi> I had ſeen the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> but having another opportunity offer'd to me, I went thither to view again theſe rare Monuments of Antiquity, to ſee whether I might not obſerve ſomething more than I have taken notice of in my firſt Relation.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th of <hi>April</hi> I went thither, in the company of the French Conſul, and many other Merchants, and with almoſt all his Houſhold: We had with us three <hi>Janizaries</hi> to guard us, ſo that we were in all about fifty Cavaliers well mounted upon Aſſes, taking with us Proviſions ſufficient for three days.</p>
                  <p>When we were come to the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> and had obſerv'd exactly every thing, I took notice that the place where they ſtood was a Burying-place.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48499:275"/>
This is plain to any that ſee the place; and doubtleſs it was the Burying-place of the old City <hi>Memphis</hi>; for all the <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtories in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that this City ſtood where the <hi>Pyramids</hi> now are, over againſt old <hi>Cairo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I took notice, that all the <hi>Pyramids</hi> have an entrance that leads to a low Alley, which is very long, and at the end is a Chamber, where the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> did place the Bodies of thoſe Perſons for whom the <hi>Pyramids</hi> were built. This Entrance is not to be ſeen in every one of the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> becauſe the Wind hath ſtopt them with Sand. I ſaw upon ſome of them ſome Hieroglyphick Characters, but I had not time to write them out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I took notice, that all the <hi>Pyramids</hi> were built in very good order; and that each of the three greateſt were at the head of ten leſſer, which are not well to be diſtinguiſh'd, becauſe of the heaps of Sand: One may yet imagine, to ſee the place, that in former Ages there have been here one hundred <hi>Pyramids</hi> little and great.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I took notice, that they are all built upon an even Rock covered over with white Sand; ſo that it is very probable that the Stones have been taken from the place, and not brought from far, as ſome Travellers imagin, and old Writers, for the greateſt is nothing but a Rock cut as a Pyramid, and covered over with a Wall of Stone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I took notice, that of all the Stones of the greateſt there is ſcarce one entire, but either worn out with the Weather and Time, or broken by ſome other Accident; ſo that though one may aſcend on all ſides to the top, yet not in all places with the ſame eaſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48499:276"/>6. I have taken notice, that none of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> are alike, or perfectly ſquare, but that all have two ſides longer than the others. I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to meaſure the greateſt; for that purpoſe I had with me a String of about thirty Land-yards; but becauſe the Winds have heap'd about it Mountains of Sand, I could not poſſibly draw a line ſtrait from one angle to the other.</p>
                  <p>On the 28th day of <hi>December</hi> I went to ſee the <hi>Pyramids</hi> the third time, with ſome Strangers. In our way we were mightily troubled with a very thick Miſt, which laſted till ten a clock in the morning; and we found a great deal of Mud in the Trenches and Ditches, which was not yet dry ſince the retreat of the River, ſo that we were carried over upon the <hi>Moors</hi> backs that were with us.</p>
                  <p>At this time I went up to the top of the great <hi>Pyramid,</hi> and I obſerv'd, as at the firſt, that the place where the <hi>Pyramids</hi> ſtand is a pure Rock, cover'd over with white Sand, which appears ſufficiently by the Ditches and Caves round about the <hi>Pyramids</hi> cut in the Rock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Rock is to be ſeen, upon which ſtands the greateſt <hi>Pyramid,</hi> by a hole at one of the Angles, between the Eaſt and the North ſides.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Pyramids</hi> are not built with Marble, as ſome ſay, but with a white Sandy Stone very hard.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greateſt hath but two hundred and ſix ſteps; and though Monſieur <hi>Th.</hi> ſaith that it hath two hundred and eight, this proceeds from his not taking notice that two ſteps are broken into four.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. On the top of the greateſt <hi>Pyramid</hi> there was anciently a Statue or <hi>Coloſſe.</hi> This appears, becauſe it is not ſharp as the others, but plain:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48499:276"/>
And there are yet to be ſeen great Pits, which were to keep faſt the <hi>Coloſſe</hi> from falling.</p>
                  <p>At preſent there is nothing on the top but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters of the Names of Perſons of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who have left them to witneſs that they had been there. There is no ſign of the Play at <hi>Mancala,</hi> which a <hi>Coptie</hi> told me was there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the days of the <hi>Pharaohs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Stones of the biggeſt <hi>Pyramid</hi> are not equal, for ſome of the undermoſt are four foot high, ſome three foot and an half, and five foot long. The Stones of the middle are three foot and five inches high, and the uppermoſt Stones are but two foot high, and three and an half long.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſides of the Pyramids are not equal; for in the greateſt it is viſible, and ſo in the others, that the North ſide is longer than that which ſtretches from Eaſt to Weſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In all the Pyramids there are very deep Wells cut in the Rock, ſquare; as I have ſeen in more than ten.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th day of <hi>June</hi> I went the fourth time to ſee the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> in the company of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Sabatery</hi> Vice-Conſul of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the paſſage to old <hi>Cairo,</hi> on the other ſide of the River, I took notice of one thing very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in its Channel; the Water was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly green, as a Cake covered over with green Graſs. This was the firſt time that I ſaw it of this colour; which cauſed me to ask of the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men what this green colour was: They told me, that the River <hi>Nilus</hi> did then putrifie, that it had continued ſo fifteen days, and would be ſo five more. Some of them ſaid, that there was none could remember to have ſeen the River ſo green as that year, 1672.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48499:277"/>To return again to the Pyramids, I went up this time to the top of the higheſt Pyramid, I enter'd into the Chamber, but ſaw no new thing which could cauſe me either to change or add to my former Obſervations. It is needleſs to ſpeak of its Dimenſions, ſeeing ſo many Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have already publiſh'd them, as Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> in his <hi>Levant</hi> Travels.</p>
                  <p>From the Pyramids we went to take a view of the Caves that are adjoyning. There are many, all cut in the ſide of a Rock; their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides are out of order, without any proportion, but their inſide very equal and poliſh'd. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one there is a deep Well ſquare, cut in the Rock, where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did put the Body of that perſon, for whom the Cave was made; for it was their Sepulchre. The Walls of many of theſe Caves are full of Hieroglyphick Figures, carved in the Rock. In ſome they are but ſmall, in others very lively. In one I number'd ſixteen great Figures, that repreſented eight Men and eight Women, holding one another by the hands, with many other ſmall Figures or Shapes, on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>The great Pyramid is 520 foot high upon a Baſe of 682 foot ſquare: The Platform at top is 16 foot and two thirds ſquare, and is compos'd of 12 large Stones, yet this from below appears to the Eye a ſharp point. A ſtrong man cannot throw a Stone from the top, ſo as to make it fall beyond the Steps or Baſis of the Pyramid.</p>

                  <p>WE ſaw next the <hi>Sphynx,</hi> near the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide. On the top ſtands the Head of a Woman of an extraordinary bigneſs and height. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Abulhon,</hi> or <hi>Abul-houl.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that it was the Tomb of King <hi>Amaſis.</hi> I imagine that this <hi>Sphynx</hi> was a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, but we cannot underſtand that it belong'd to <hi>Amaſis</hi>; for all the Records and Traditions of this <hi>Sphynx</hi> are loſt.</p>
                  <p>That it is a Tomb may appear, firſt by its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, which is in a place which was in former Ages a Burying-place; and near the <hi>Pyramids</hi> and mortuary Caves. Secondly, it is to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that it was a Sepulchre from its building. In the hinder part is a Cave under ground, of a bigneſs anſwerable to that of the Head, into which I have look'd by an entrance that leads into it, ſo that it could ſerve to no other purpoſe, but to keep a dead Corps.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Franks</hi> have, out of an exceſs of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, climb'd up by the means of Rope-Ladders, to ſee whether this Head was hollow or maſſy, and they have found it to be hollow, but filled at preſent with Sand.</p>
                  <p>The Neck is worn out round about, which cauſeth men to imagine that it will not be able to ſupport the weight of that great Head.</p>

                  <head>Of the Wells where the <hi>Mummies</hi> are.</head>
                  <p>WHen we had fully viewed this <hi>Sphynx,</hi> we took the Road that leads to <hi>Saccara,</hi> a Village, at four hours travelling from the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids,</hi> and about eight from <hi>Cairo</hi> towards the South. The Burying-place of the <hi>Mummies</hi> is near adjoyning to this Village.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it was very late, and that we were to agree with the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Village about the Price, the Number and Quality of the Wells, that they were to open for us, we ſtopt there all night, and the next morning we took with us twelve Horſemen, to guard us, of the <hi>Arabians</hi>; with them we went to this Burying-place, where the <hi>Mummies</hi> are in Caves under ground.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Well that we ſaw was that of Birds embalmed: When we had cauſed the Sand that ſtops the Wells mouth to be removed, through which we were to go down, and from thence to enter into the Cave, we cauſed our ſelves to be let down one after another, by tying a double Rope about our middles. As ſoon as we were at the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Taper, and ſeveral Matches that we had brought, we went into the Cave creeping upon our Bellies. The Cave is an Alley in the Rock, about the height of a Man, and about the breadth of a Perch, and of an extraordinary length. We found there many other Alleys on both hands, cut in the Rock, where were many large Stores, full of earthen Pots, covered over with Coverings of the ſame ſubſtance. In theſe Pots
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48499:278"/>
were embalmed Birds of all kinds, every Bird in its own Pot. And as I thought that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a Cuſtom ſo ancient and ſuperſtitious was worthy of our notice, I brought about half a dozen with me, ſome I have ſent to the Kings Library. We found alſo ſome Hens-Eggs empty, but entire, without any ill ſmell or crack.</p>
                  <p>When we had viewed ſufficiently this Cave, we returned up in the ſame manner that we went down, and found another open'd, called the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which is that was never open'd before. According to our Orders to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Tiger</hi> and the others went down in the ſame manner as into the former, I alone could not follow them, becauſe of a <hi>Quartan</hi> Fever, which had troubled me fourteen months, and took me at that very moment; but I loſt nothing by that; for theſe Gentlemen told me at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that they found an horrid ſtench, and a cloſe air, that put out their Cand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es and their Matches alſo, every time that they endeavour'd to light them, which cauſed them to get up again without entring further. They told me that this Well was much deeper than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>We cauſed another to be opened, which was not a Virgin Well, as the former, becauſe it was not ſo deep. I ventur'd into that, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my indiſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>We found there two <hi>Mummies,</hi> a great one and a little one of a Child, both in Coffins, the greateſt was of Marble, upon the Covering it had the likeneſs of the perſon for whom it was made. We cauſed theſe Biers or Coffins to be open'd, but found nothing extraordinary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we made no account of them, and left them where we found them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48499:279"/>We went down next into a Cave, called, <hi>The Church,</hi> which was not ſo deep as the former. It was nothing but a long Alley under ground, well plaiſter'd, and painted all over with Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Figures round about the ſides. It was almoſt all full of Sand, which cauſed us to creep along upon our Knees.</p>

Theſe Idols the <hi>Arabians</hi> have taken from the broken <hi>Mummies,</hi> which they have caſt away. In ſome places you may ſee great Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, full of Cyphers and enigmatical Figures, that repreſent ſomething of Chymiſtry, and of other Sciences and Myſteries, and full of ſtrange characters that are no Hieroglyphicks.

                  <p>This <hi>Pyramid</hi> is built as a Pavillion.

                  <p>Here is alſo a ſquare heap of very great hewn Stones.

                  <head>A Deſcription of an entire Body of <hi>a</hi> Mummy.</head>
                  <p>THis was a long and large Body, in a very thick Coffin of Wood, ſhut cloſe on all hands; the Timber was not at all rotten, and we found it to be Sycamore-wood, which in <hi>Egypt</hi> they call <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Fig-tree, that does not rot ſo ſoon as other Wood. Upon the Coffin the Face of him that was within it, was cut in emboſſed Work. Some Coffins there are alſo of Stone, with the Face of the perſon within, cut in Boſs, and Hieroglyphicks all along the length of it. There are two of theſe Stones in the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> at St. <hi>Mande,</hi> and I had two of them alſo, of which one was broken at <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> and the other I brought home with me very whole, which weighs betwixt ſeven and eight hundred weight. Some of theſe <hi>Coffins</hi> are made of ſeveral pieces of <hi>Cloth</hi> paſted together, which are as ſtrong as the wooden ones. I have one of this kind in my Cloſet, made of above forty Cloths glewed or paſted together in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are not in the leaſt rotten; it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48499:280"/>
all over with Idols and Hieroglyphicks, painted on a very thin Plaiſter, with which the outſide Cloth is daubed over, but it is a little ſpoil'd, the Plaiſter in ſome places being rubbed off. Among theſe Figures there is a Compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the lower end, two inches broad, and a foot long, being painted croſs-ways over the Coffin, wherein may be ſeen the manner how the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> embalmed dead Bodies. In the middle of this Compartment there is a long Table ſhaped like a Lion, on the back of which the Body that is to be embalmed is laid at length, and hard by there is a Man with a Knife in his Hand opening the Body; this man hath on a Vizard Mask, ſhaped like the Beak of a Sparrow-hawk, which (without doubt) was the Cuſtom of their Embalmers, who made uſe of that kind of Mask, that they might not breath in the Corruption that might evaporate from the dead Bodies, as the Phyſicians of <hi>Italy</hi> do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who in time of a Plague never ſtir abroad without a Mask of this kind, in the long Noſe of which they put Perfumes; though I make no doubt, but the Mask I ſpeak of is the Head of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> repreſented with the Head of a Sparrow-hawk, as they did <hi>Anubis</hi> with the Head of a Dog, the <hi>Nile</hi> with a Lyons Head, <hi>&amp;c</hi> But as a ſurer mark that it is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming, there are four Veſſels without Handles upon the aforeſaid Table, which could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Veſſels wherein the neceſſary Drugs were kept not only for the embalming, as <hi>Balm, Cedria, &amp;c.</hi> but alſo for the wrapping up and incruſtation of the Body, as <hi>Bitumen</hi> and others: By the ſides of the Table there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons ſtanding and ſitting in divers poſtures.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48499:281"/>
Within this Coffin is the figure of a naked Maid with her Arms ſtretched out.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my firſt Diſcourſe. This Wooden Coffin I mentioned being broken to pieces with Hatchets, we found an entire Body in it, which lay in this manner. The Face was covered (as commonly all the reſt are) with a kind of Head-piece of Cloth fitted with Plaiſter, on which the Countenance of that perſon was repreſented in Gold, and when we took off the Helmet, we found nothing of the Face remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is commonly reduced to Aſhes; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is, becauſe it will not admit of gumming ſo well as the other parts of the Body. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I brought to <hi>Paris</hi> the Head of a <hi>Mummy</hi> whole and entire, but it is all covered with Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Cloth, ſo neatly fitted, that they hinder not, but one may ſee the ſhape of the Eyes, Noſe, and Mouth. The reſt of the Body was ſwathed with little Bands of Cloth very neatly made, but wrapped about with ſo many caſts and turnings, that I believe there were above a thouſand Ells in it; and certainly it is ſo rare a way of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and Binding, that I think it cannot be imitated at preſent, as many Chyrurgions have acknowledged to me. Along the Breaſt and Belly there was a Band of Cloth <hi>three</hi> good Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad, and a large foot and a half long, it was faſtened to the other Bands, and upon it were ſeveral Hieroglyphicks done in Gold. I took this Writing, and folded it, that I might the more conveniently carry it up with me. I hoped to have found Idols in that Coffin, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they interred many with their Dead, either of Stone, Copper, or Green Earth, as I have ſeveral that have been found in theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48499:281"/>
but finding none, I thought there might be ſome within his Body; for after they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boweled them, they often encloſed Idols within their Bellies; for that end I had it bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, but we could find nothing. I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then that Balm which is now quite loſt, it is black, hard, and ſhines like Pitch, having much ſuch a ſmell, but more pleaſant, that kept Bodies entire, and (I believe) the Sand contributed not a little thereto, for even in the greateſt Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſometimes the dead Bodies of Men and Dogs are found entire, who falling aſleep, and ſtaying behind the Caravans, are covered over with an ocean of Sand driven by the high Winds, in which the Bodies being buried, are by the dryneſs and ſalt that is in the Sand, which drys up all the humidity of them, preſerved en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and are afterwards found, when another Wind blowing, carries off the Sand again. Many think that the Bodies ſo dryed, are the true <hi>Mummy</hi>; it is a miſtake, and that which Merchants bring into <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to be uſed in Medicine, is the <hi>Mummy</hi> we firſt deſcribed. Near the Room I went into there were ſeveral others full of Bodies, but ſeeing the entries into them were full of Sand, I called to them above to pull me up again with the ſame Rope, with which I was let down, being much diſſatisfied with my <hi>Moors,</hi> who had open'd ſo ſorry a Pit for me. When I was got up I looked upon my Cloth, whereon were Characters of Gold, but was much vexed to ſee that all the Letters diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and that by my own fault, becauſe I had folded it together when it was very humid, and ſo all the Gold and Paint ſtuck to the oppoſite ſides; whereas I ſhould have brought it up open and dryed it in the Sun. But I have others that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48499:282"/>
are finer, which are only a little ſpoiled in the bringing. I brought with me alſo ſome Hands of <hi>Mummies,</hi> which are as entire at preſent as ever they were. I had alſo the good fortune to buy upon the place ſome Idols, of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who come and ſell them to the <hi>Franks</hi> in the City. Theſe Idols are of ſeveral ſorts, and in many poſtures, there are of them of Copper, of ſeveral ſorts of Stone, and ſeveral ſorts of Earth alſo; at leaſt, I have ſome of all theſe kinds, all which I am very ſure have been taken out of <hi>Mummies,</hi> and cannot be ſaid to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, for beſides that, they have not the Art to do it, they ſell them at ſo eaſie a rate, that the very Materials are worth more. This is all I could obſerve of the Pyramids and Mummies: And hence it appears, that the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſpent more in their Tombs than during their whole Lives; and one reaſon they gave for that was, That their Houſes were only for living a ſhort time in, and their Tombs the Palaces that were to be inhabited by their Souls for many Ages. Not far from theſe <hi>Mummies,</hi> towards the <hi>Nile,</hi> are ſome remains of a large Town, which was <hi>Memphis,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, the Ancients never burying their Dead within Towns, for fear of infecting the Air, none but Chriſtians (who mind not that) bury their Dead any where. Now, to prove that theſe great Ruins are the remains of <hi>Memphis, Pliny</hi> affirms it, when he ſays, that the Pyramids are betwixt the <hi>Delta</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the City of <hi>Memphis</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Africa.</hi> At length we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by old <hi>Caire,</hi> and ſaw all that is curious, or worth being ſeen in it.</p>

                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>YOU engage me after a very undeniable manner, as I perceive by the minutes of your Philoſophical <hi>Society,</hi> to ſend you ſome account of the <hi>Porphyry Pillars</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>; and though I could have ſatisfied your Curioſity much better in this matter, had you thought of it when I was amongſt my Papers in <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet rather than hazard your good Opinion, or give the leaſt pretence of diſreſpect to your worthy <hi>Company,</hi> for whoſe Perſons and Deſigns I have ſo juſt an eſteem and veneration: I here ſend not what's fit for me to write, or you to read, but what I can remember upon this ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I intend to ſpeak concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or compoſition of Stones in general, or of <hi>Porphyry</hi> more particularly, but meerly as to matter of Fact, ſo far chiefly as it fell under my own cognizance, <hi>i. e.</hi> if you pleaſe, rather like an Hiſtorian than a Philoſopher.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place then, I think it may be taken for granted, that there is no ſuch <hi>Quarry,</hi> or Rock of Stone rather, in all the lower parts of <hi>Egypt</hi>; for ſo far as the <hi>Nile</hi> o'erflows is perfect Soil. A Sample whereof I hope you ſtill retain, and let me entreat you to be very exact in weighing it this year, that you may be ſure
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48499:283"/>
whether it be heavier in the time of the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as is generally believed) than before or after: And when, and in what proportion it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes.</p>
                        <p>The Boundaries of this overflow (which are never ten miles from the <hi>Channel,</hi> that I ſaw, generally ſcarce half of it, and in ſome places but a mile or two, (the <hi>Delta</hi> ſtill excepted, which is univerſally covered, all but the North ſide to the Sea, and a little to the Eaſt for ſome miles above <hi>Damiata</hi>) are riſing Hills of Sand, beyond which is perfect Deſart, upon the <hi>Africk</hi> ſide, the <hi>Lybian.</hi> [Higher South I have been told, there are Rocks nearer the River, and in ſome places ſtreighten it] but under thoſe Sands is a yielding Stone, not much harder than Chalk, though not ſo white, and very eaſily managed, as at the <hi>Mummies,</hi> deep ſpacious Vaults, which were the old Repoſitories for the Dead. And the like alſo may be ſaid of thoſe Cells or Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres which are hewn purely out of the Rocky Earth three quarters of a mile on the South of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Albeit nearer the Sea there are Stones of a harder kind, and with which they build; but by their mouldering away, as appears by the Remains of Houſes within the Walls of the City, 'tis plain they can't endure the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is ſufficiently corroding there. The Iron which once plated their thick wooden Gates being moſtly eaten away, and the deep Characters upon the ſides of theſe very <hi>Porphyry Pillars</hi> exceedingly defaced. Indeed about <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis, i. e.</hi> by the Pyramids, they have a milder Air, and the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> cut in thoſe Stones will laſt well enough, till they ſhall be removed into a rougher: But then they'l crizle and ſcale, as I found by ſad experience. For having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48499:283"/>
four Stones, the beſt mark'd with thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Antiquity I could meet with, and ſent them down to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in order to their tranſportation for <hi>England,</hi> I found them, upon my ſecond Voyage into <hi>Egypt,</hi> very much injur'd, being put into the Cuſtom-houſe-yard (where they lye ſtill embargo'd) by the <hi>Aga,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an intolerable Sum for liberty to ſhip them, as you may remember I told you the Story.</p>
                        <p>But yet farther in the Country there are Mountains of harder Stone: In the <hi>Nitrian,</hi> now the Deſart of St. <hi>Macarius,</hi> and not far from the Lake where the <hi>Latroon</hi> or true <hi>Nitre</hi> incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates upon the top of the Water, there are many, and ſome of them not utterly unlike <hi>Porphyry.</hi> That which neareſt reſembles its colour, though not its Conſiſtence, is the vein that produces the Eagle-ſtone, of which there are many in the <hi>Bahr Batama,</hi> a great Sandy Valley: But theſe Stones are of a different complexion from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> as you may perceive by thoſe I ſent you, which alſo will aſſiſt your conjectures of their original.</p>
                        <p>However, I can't pronounce that there is no Porphyry hereabouts; for in the chief Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the four now remaining (of 366, as many as are days in the longeſt year) dedicated to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi>; the two Stones which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their entrance are of the like, if not the very ſame ſubſtance; which I more particularly obſerv'd upon the account of their ingenious contrivance; for theſe poor People, lying other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the mercy of the roving <hi>Arabs,</hi> with theſe two Mill-ſtones (for that's their make) thus make good their Gate againſt them, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their paſſage) into which they run them,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48499:284"/>
and then drive a great wooden Wedge between them on the inſide, which ſo faſtens them, that they cannot be looſed, but upon the inſide nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And of ſuch a ſort of Porphyry is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Sphynx</hi> (a mighty head and ſhoulders 110 feet in compaſs) yet ſtanding by the Northern Pyramids.</p>
                        <p>I have indeed been told of the place upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> whence this Porphyry came, but ſo they ſhew the very Rock where the two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent double rows of Pillars in the Church of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> were hewn; though I went away ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that 'twas a quite different ſort of Stone. Another tells of a Pillar of the ſame make yet lying there; and if this be certain, you need ſeek no further. Albeit, I muſt tell you, that the Stones brought thence with the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Buck (it muſt needs be called) upon them, ſome of which you had, though reddiſh, are of a much finer, and more even tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wanſleben</hi> writes of a great many, more Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly; but I know him too well to believe all that he ſays for Goſpel. And a more ſober man, Father <hi>Carlo Franciſco d' Orleans,</hi> now Superior of the <hi>Capucines</hi> at <hi>Cairo,</hi> who went 300 leagues up the <hi>Nile</hi> in the year 69, told me of many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Statues, and Pillars at that diſtance; tho I can't be ſure he ſaid there were any of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry. But ſince 'twas in <hi>Thebais,</hi> why may we not ſuppoſe them of that black, white, and red ſpeckled <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble, famous in the World, and wherewith the leſſer Pyramid perhaps was cruſted, yet to be ſeen upon the ground about it, and when poliſh'd looks finely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="153" facs="tcp:48499:284"/>Thoſe which I have my ſelf ſeen, are one of them at the <hi>Matarea,</hi> three or four miles Eaſt of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and two at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> juſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Wall upon the North ſide of the City; (for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pillar, as they call it) half a mile without the Gate to the South, is quite of another make and matter: One of theſe is thrown down and broken into pieces, but was of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions for breadth and thickneſs with the other. The <hi>Franks</hi> call them <hi>Aguglia</hi>'s, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> particularly <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Needles, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants content themſelves with the general name of Pillars. They have no <hi>Baſis</hi> or Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals above ground; and if they never had, they muſt needs be very deep in the Earth. The Draughts I here ſend you will excuſe all farther Deſcription. One of them was very well taken by Monſieur <hi>Brute</hi> a <hi>French Druggerman,</hi> the other by a Dutch Painter, who, you'l ſee, has but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle commended his Art.</p>
                        <p>If you have a fancy, upon the ſight of'em, to ſift out the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> character with which they are engraven, perhaps you'l find it to be the aboriginal <hi>Egyptian</hi> Letter, long ſince worn out of common uſe in the Country, as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> (ſo 'tis now generally call'd) was amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi>; and that it bears proportion with the <hi>China</hi> (now in uſe) where each note repreſents a word, or rather an entire ſignification. And moreover, that 'tis wrought the ſame way too, from the <hi>top</hi> to the <hi>bottom</hi>; as you have ſeen in the Board I brought from a Door in the Village <hi>Succara</hi> (which is next to the <hi>Mummies</hi>) the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt piece of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Writing, perhaps, at <hi>this</hi> day in <hi>Europe.</hi> I confeſs that in the Vaults or Prieſts Chambers cut out of the Rock, cloſe by the ſecond Pyramid, the whole Walls are inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48499:285"/>
therewith, but I ſpeak of an Original. And if all that is there written were but exactly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, it might be then lawful to hope, that the Language ſo long ſince dead and buried in the Houſe of Bondage, might have its reſurrection in the Land of Liberty.</p>
                        <p>That ſuch vaſt Monuments might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from place to place, is difficult indeed, but not impoſſible. And if one <hi>Archimedes</hi> (as <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> preſerves the Story for us) could lanch the vaſt Ship of <hi>Hiero,</hi> which all the Strength of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was not able to bring to Sea; what might not many great Maſters in the ſame Art perform, and upon their own Dunghil too? for I may call <hi>Egypt</hi> the Mother of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, ſome of theſe Mountains are near the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and <hi>Suſs</hi> from <hi>Cairo</hi> but two or three days, from <hi>Nile</hi> leſs: And how poſſible it is to convey mighty weights by Water, let the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks at <hi>Rome</hi> declare; which were all of them brought from this very Country: And that ſuch things may be done by Land too, though not by every one, is plain enough, becauſe we ſee they have been done. At <hi>Baalbec,</hi> which is 14 hours from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> (for thence I went, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Mr. <hi>Anth. Balam</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jo. Verney,</hi> both now in <hi>England,</hi> whom I thought fit to name for my Compurgators, if you ſhould que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the credit of Story:) There is a Stone about 66 foot long on the North ſide of the Caſtle-wall, and two more of 60 each: And I believe we ſaw the way they travel'd, having left one of their Company, though not quite ſo big in the Road, as a Monument thereof to this very day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48499:285"/>If you have got the piece of this <hi>Aguglia,</hi> (for I have nothing here) you will thereby beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern its colour and compoſition.

                  <head>A Journey from <hi>Grand Caire</hi> to Mecha.</head>
                  <p>THE day that the <hi>Emir-Adge</hi> parted from <hi>Caire,</hi> he encamped in Tents, cloſe by the City, and a few days after he encamped at the <hi>Birque,</hi> which is a great Pond about twelve miles from <hi>Caire,</hi> near to which they encamp. This place is the Rendeſvouz of all the Caravans. The <hi>Emir-Adge</hi> parted from thence with the whole Caravan, <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the eighth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cuſtom for the Caravan of <hi>Caire</hi> to ſet out Seven and fifty days after the beginning of the <hi>Ramadam,</hi> that ſo it may be there punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the time. It is very pretty to ſee them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the Night-time, becauſe of the infinite number of Lamps that are in the Tents and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions. Next day, the ninth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan of the <hi>Magrebins</hi> parted alſo from the <hi>Birque,</hi> and there all of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who intend to make the Journey, meet, and make a diſtinct Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan; which depends not on the <hi>Emir-Adge</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Caire,</hi> but have a Chief of their own. That Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan never ſets out, but a day after the Caravan of <hi>Caire</hi>; they travel commonly by night, and reſt in the day time, as all other Caravans do that go to other places, that ſo they may avoid the heat, which is almoſt inſupportable; and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48499:286"/>
when the Moon does not ſhine, there are men who carry Links before the Caravan. In all Caravans, the Camels are tied tail to tail, ſo that let them but go, and there is no trouble of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.</p>
                  <p>Here I'll give the Reader an account, how many Stages there are betwixt <hi>Caire</hi> and <hi>Mecha,</hi> how many days they ſtay in them, how many hours travelling there is betwixt them, and at what Stages the Waters are ſweet or bitter, all along the way. This little Itinerary I had from a Prince of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who made that Journey whilſt I was at <hi>Caire.</hi> From <hi>Caire</hi> to the <hi>Birque</hi> it is reckoned four hours Journey; there is freſh Water there.

From <hi>Navatir</hi> to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagara,</hi> ten hours; no Water there, and the way bad. From <hi>Raſtagara</hi> to <hi>Kalaat el Nahhal,</hi> that is to ſay, the Caſtle of <hi>Palmes,</hi> fifteen hours; there they ſtay a day, and have freſh Water. From the Caſtle of <hi>Nahhal</hi> to <hi>Abiar Alaina,</hi> four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours; only bitter Water there. From <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biar Alaina</hi> to <hi>Sath el Akaba,</hi> that is to ſay the Plain of the Hill, fifteen hours; no Water there. From <hi>Sath el Akaba</hi> to <hi>Kalaat el Akaba,</hi> that is to ſay, the Caſtle of the Hill, (that's upon the ſide of the Red Sea) ſixteen hours, there they ſtay two days and an half, the way is very bad, but they have freſh Water. From the Caſtle <hi>el Aka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> to <hi>Dar el Hhamar,</hi> ſix hours and an half; no Water there, (<hi>Dar el Hhamar</hi> ſignifies Aſſes Back, and it is like the Mountain in <hi>Italy,</hi> where there

is an Inn called <hi>Scarga l' aſino.</hi>) From <hi>Dar el Hhamar</hi> to <hi>Scharafe Benigateie,</hi> fourteen hours; no Water there.

From <hi>Eyoun el Kaſeb</hi> to <hi>Kalaat el Moilah</hi> which is by the Sea-ſide, fifteen hours; there they reſt two days and an half, and have freſh Water. From <hi>Kalaat el Moilah</hi> to <hi>Caſtel,</hi> eleven hours; bitter Water there. From <hi>Caſtel</hi> to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laat Ezlem,</hi> fifteen hours and an half; bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there. From <hi>Kalaat Ezlem</hi> to <hi>Iſtanbel antir,</hi> fourteen hours; freſh Water there. From <hi>Iſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel antir</hi> to <hi>Kalaat el Voudge,</hi> that is to ſay, the Caſtle of the Face, thirteen hours and an half; freſh Water there.

From <hi>Ekre</hi> to <hi>Hank Krue,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Gulf,</hi> twelve hours and an half: no Water there. From <hi>Hank Krue</hi> (going to <hi>Hhawre,</hi> they enter into the Territory of <hi>Mecha</hi>) to <hi>Hhawre,</hi> it is thirteen hours: only bitter Water there. From <hi>Hhawre</hi> to <hi>Nabte,</hi> fifteen hours: freſh Water there. From thence come the <hi>Nabathean Arabs, Eurus ad auroram Nabathaeaque regna receſſit.</hi> From <hi>Nabte</hi> to <hi>Hazire,</hi> thirteen hours and an half: no Water there. From <hi>Hazire</hi> to <hi>Yanbouh,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Fountain,</hi> fourteen hours and an half: there they ſtay two days and an half, and have freſh Water. From <hi>Yanbouh</hi> to <hi>Soucaife,</hi> thirteen

From <hi>Soucaif</hi> to <hi>Beder Hunein,</hi> that is to ſay, the Moon of <hi>Hunein,</hi> eight hours: freſh Water there. <hi>Hunein</hi> was a man that ſhew'd the Moon in his Well. From <hi>Beder Hunein</hi> to <hi>Ssbil el Mouhſin,</hi> that is to ſay, the way of Benefaction or Benefit, fourteen hours: freſh Water there: <hi>Rabii</hi> is a Sacred place, that is to ſay, not to be enter'd into, without being well prepared and purged from all Sin. Hence it is that there are two places which are called <hi>Hara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mein,</hi> Sacred places, to wit, <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> that is to ſay, which are two Holy places, where one ſhould take heed not to ſet his foot, unleſs he be well waſhed from all Sin.

                  <head>Of the <hi>Aga</hi> ſent to meet the Caravan upon their Return.</head>
                  <p>ABout ſix weeks after the ſetting out of the Caravan of <hi>Caire,</hi> when they know that it is ready to return from <hi>Mecha,</hi> an <hi>Aga</hi> goes from <hi>Caire</hi> to guard the freſh Proviſions that the People of the Country ſend to their Friends and Relations in the Caravan, every one ſending ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities and Friendſhip, all which are well ſealed up, and delivered to thoſe they belong unto. For this effect the <hi>Aga</hi> has many Camels with him, and <hi>gets</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48499:288"/>
by the Caravan, which he meets half way. This year it returned on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> and encamped at the <hi>Birque,</hi> where the Caravan of the <hi>Magrebins</hi> arrived the day before. Several come to <hi>Caire</hi> the ſame day, and their Friends go as far as the <hi>Birque</hi> to welcome them; whereupon meeting, they kiſs again and again five or ſix times, and all who know them ſalute and kiſs them in the ſame manner; and indeed, for ſome days after there is nothing to be ſeen in the City, but people kiſſing one another, or lamenting their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who died in the Journey, Men, Women, and Children, who howl and make fearful ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, when they hear the news from the firſt of the Caravan, whom they meet. Theſe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims are forty five days in going, and as much in coming back to <hi>Caire,</hi> beſides ſome days they ſtay there; but they make but eaſie Journeys, it being impoſſible that ſo great a body ſhould march faſt, for they muſt often ſtop to load the Camels whoſe loads have fallen off, to unload thoſe that fall or die, or to bury their Dead, and a thouſand ſuch other accidents; and when one Camel ſtops, all the reſt muſt wait. They travel commonly (as I ſaid) in the night-time with Links, that they may avoid the heat. In this Journey they find but little Water, and that exceeding bad too: As for freſh Proviſions, they find none, and eat only what they carry along with them: But the worſt thing they meet with in the Journey, are certain hot Winds, which ſtifle the Breath, and in a ſhort time kill a great many people. The Prince of <hi>Tunis</hi> told me, that in one day ſeveral hundreds died of that Wind, and that he himſelf was much afraid that he ſhould have been one of the number. In fine,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48499:288"/>
in this Expedition there died ſix thouſand, what of Fatigue, Thirſt, and theſe hot Winds. In that Journey People are to be ſeen riding on Camels, and ſinging Verſes of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> who ſuddenly fall down dead. Thoſe who return with life are ſo alter'd and extenuated, that they can hardly be known; and nevertheleſs vaſt numbers of People from all parts yearly perform that Pilgrimage, and there paſſes not a year wherein Women and little Children do not make it. They who have performed that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are called <hi>Adgi,</hi> that is to ſay, Pilgrims, meaning though only the Pilgrimage of the <hi>Kiaabe,</hi> and they are much reſpected by all as long as they live, and highly credited. The <hi>Emir-Adge</hi> gains much by this Journey, for the Goods of all that dye belong to him, beſides a vaſt deal of other profits that he makes on ſeveral occaſions; and it is thought, that every Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he gets above an hundred thouſand Piaſtres, but this year he got above three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, for many People died. The greateſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of this Office is, that during the whole Expedition he is abſolute Maſter of the Field, and adminiſters Juſtice as he thinks fit.</p>
                  <p>Having in my hands an exact Deſcription of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and conſidering that few or no Travellers have ſpoken of it with any certainty, I thought it would not be amiſs to add it, and make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chapter thereof.</p>

                     <hi>MEcha</hi> is ſeven and thirty days Journey from <hi>Caire,</hi> and all over Deſarts; it is a days Journey from the Red-Sea; the Port of it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gidde,</hi> which is a little Town, wherein are two Caſtles on the two ſides of the Port, one on each ſide, and the Turks ſay that <hi>Eve</hi> lies buried there: They ſhew her Sepulchre, which is in length 38 or 40 ſteps of a man's walk, and hath no other Ornament but a Stone at each end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mecha</hi> is about the bigneſs of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> in the middle whereof is the <hi>Kiaabe</hi> or <hi>Beytullah,</hi> that is to ſay, the Houſe of God, which (the Turks ſay) was firſt built by the Patriarch <hi>Abraham.</hi> This Houſe is about fifteen foot in length, eleven or twelve in breadth, and about five fathom high. The Threſhold of the Door is as high from the ground as a man can reach his Hand, being within filled up even with the Threſhold. The Door is about a fathom and an half high, and a fathom wide, and is in the corner to the left hand, when one faces the Houſe. This Door is of beaten Silver, and opens with two leaves; they go up to it by a Ladder ſupported by four Wheels, two whereof are faſtened to the lower end of the Ladder, and the other two to two wooden Poſts about the middle of it, by means of which Wheels the Ladder is run to the Wall, when any body is to enter into the <hi>Beytullah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Houſe has a flat Roof, ſupported by three Pillars of an Octogone Figure, which are of <hi>Aloes</hi>-wood, as big as the Body of a man, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48499:289"/>
about three fathom and a half long; they are of one entire piece each, and yet run in a ſtreight Line the length of the Building, which is hung with red and white Stuff, having here and there theſe words upon them, <hi>La Illah Illal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, Mouhammed Reſoul allah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame corner where the Door is (but on the other ſide by the Wall) is the black Stone, which they call <hi>Hadgiar Aſuad,</hi> and is had in veneration by them, becauſe (as they ſay) <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood upon it when he built that Houſe, and that it ſerved him for a Scaffold, to the end he might make no hole in the Wall, it riſing higher or lower as he pleaſed, and being for that purpoſe brought him by the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Court about this Houſe, which the Turks call <hi>Haram,</hi> and it is encompaſſed with Walls, with three rows of Pillars, and Arches on the inſide of it. The four Sects of <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> have their places of Prayer in this Court, which are the <hi>Hanifi, Chafii, Maliki,</hi> and <hi>Hambeli,</hi> each in one of the four parts of the Court, with their Faces turned always towards the <hi>Beitullah,</hi> or Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p>This Houſe is begirt with two Belts of Gold, one below, and the other on high. On one ſide of the Terraſs that covers the <hi>Beitullah</hi> there is a Spout of beaten Gold, about a fathom long, that jets out, to carry off the Rain-water that falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terraſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Houſe is covered on the out-ſide with Hangings of black Silk, which is a kind of Damask, and every year there are new ones ſent from <hi>Caire,</hi> at the charges of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>

                     <hi>Medina</hi> is about half as big as <hi>Mecha,</hi> but it hath a Suburbs as big as the Town it ſelf: Much about the middle of that Town there is a Moſch, in a corner whereof is the Sepulchre of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> covered in the ſame manner as the Monuments of the Turkiſh Emperors are at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> The Sepulchre is in a little Tower, or round Building, covered with a Dome, which the Turks call <hi>Turbe.</hi> This Building is quite open, from the middle up to the Dome, and all round it there is a little Gallery, of which the out-ſide Wall has ſeveral Windows with Silver Grates to them, and the in-ſide Wall, which is that of the little Tower, is adorned with a great number of precious Stones, at that place which anſwers to the head of the Tomb. There are rich things there alſo, of an ineſtimable value, ſent by the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings, during ſo many Ages, which are faſtened within this Gallery, all round the ſaid Turret. Among others, at the place which anſwers to the head of the Tomb, there is a great Diamond, half as long as ones Fore-finger, and two Fingers broad, over which is the Diamond which <hi>Sultan Oſman,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sultan Aſhmet,</hi> ſent thither, and is equal to that which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors wear on their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Theſe two Diamonds were heretofore but one, which <hi>Sultan Oſman</hi> cauſed to be ſawed in two in the middle. Lower down there is a Half-Moon of Gold, ſet with Diamonds of great worth.</p>

Thoſe then who enter into the <hi>Turbe,</hi> ſee that the Tomb hangs not in the Air, as many have falſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and (which is more) never did hang ſo, but is upon the flat Ground raiſed and covered like the Tombs of Turkiſh Emperors and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws.</hi>

Round all theſe Hangings are the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned words in Characters of Gold, <hi>La Illah Illal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, Mouhammed Reſoul allah.</hi> Theſe Hangings are renewed every ſeven years by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors, unleſs when a new Emperor ſucceeds, before the ſeven years be accompliſhed; for in that caſe the Emperor renews them ſo ſoon as he comes to the Throne.</p>
                  <p>The Door by which they enter into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery is of <hi>Silver,</hi> and ſo is the other that goes out of the Gallery into the <hi>Turbe.</hi>

                  <p>The Pilgrims being returned to <hi>Mecha,</hi> divide themſelves in ſeveral Caravans, becauſe of the different Countries they come from, and are to go back to them again. The Caravan that met at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> upon their return paſs by <hi>Medina,</hi> and viſit <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, ſeeing it is upon their Road: Of the reſt, thoſe who are prompted by Devotion go thither, but a great part return back to their ſeveral Countries, without turning out of their way to viſit the ſaid Sepulchre, their Law not obliging them to that, as it does to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the other places above mentioned: So that they are groſly miſtaken, who have affirmed, that the Pilgrimage of the Turks is to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who obliged them to it.

                  <p>WE travell'd in moſt places of <hi>Arabia</hi> by the help of a Compaſs, and were forty days and forty nights in going between <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Mecha</hi>; Port <hi>Ziden</hi> is forty miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Mecha,</hi> from whence it receives the greateſt part of its Proviſions by the Red Sea, from <hi>Aegypt, Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> the numbers of Pilgrims and Camels being incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and freſh Water very ſcarce, and as dear as Wine in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſtole away ſecretly from <hi>Mecha</hi> in the diſguiſe of a <hi>Mammaluke,</hi> to <hi>Ziden,</hi> in order to paſs round <hi>Arabia</hi> by Sea into <hi>Perſia. Ziden</hi> contains about 500 Houſes; there lay at Anchor in the Haven almoſt 100 Brigantines and Foyſts, with divers Barks of ſundry ſorts, both with and without Oars. After ſix days ſailing we came to <hi>Gezan,</hi> a fair commodious Port full of Veſſels; the Soil is very fruitful and delicious, abounding with many rare Fruits and Flowers: The Inhabitants for the moſt part go naked. Leaving <hi>Gezan</hi> in the ſpace of five or ſix days, we reach'd an Iſland named <hi>Camaran,</hi> ten miles in circuit: In it is a Town of 200 Houſes, the Inhabitants are <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi>; it hath great ſtore of Fleſh, and freſh Water: The Haven is eight miles from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and is ſubject to the Sultan of <hi>Arabia Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix.</hi>

In two days ſailing we came to the mouth of the Red Sea.</p>
                  <p>The day after our arrival at <hi>Aden,</hi> I being ſuſpected for a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Spy, was caſt into heavy Chains, and thrown into Priſon: After fifty five days Impriſonment, I was ſet upon a Camel with my Shackles, and in eight days Journey came to <hi>Rhada,</hi> a City where the Sultan then lay with 30000 men, to make War againſt the Sultan of <hi>Sana</hi> three days diſtant from <hi>Rhada.</hi> The Sultan's Guard were <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> with ſhort broad Swords, painted Targets and Darts, Slings and Ropes made of Cotton.

                  <p>The aforementioned parts of <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> were at that time under the ſubjection of the Turks, who had got poſſeſſion of them from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> by tricks and treachery, whom they kept in awe by many Caſtles built on Hills and Paſſes, and by the many Captives they always kept as Pledges.

                  <p>Cap. <hi>Walter Payton,</hi> in the year 1613, found great Hoſpitality and Ingenuity in ſome Ports of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Felix,</hi> nearer the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, eſpecially at <hi>Doffar,</hi> a very good Road for Ships, and a fair City, where the <hi>Arabians</hi> preſented his Crew with Bullocks, Sheep, Hens, Goats, Sugar-Canes, Plantans and Coco's.

That of an hundred Perſons whom he had brought with him, of his own Servants, and the Slaves he was to preſent to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> thirty or forty were dead.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48499:296"/>
the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> gave Lands and Eſtates to all the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> that ſtayed within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and their Offspring are ſtill in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Father of this preſent King was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> but he dying ſome thirty odd years ago, the Queen his Wife, who was a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Jeſuits, and no Catholick, and who ſuffer'd impatiently, that they ſhould govern (as they pleaſed) the late King her Husband, wrought upon her Son that ſucceeded him, to perſecute all the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Jeſuits were obliged to make their eſcape, and he put to death all the Capucins whom he found. Since that time, three Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins more were put to death at <hi>Schouaken</hi>; for the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> knowing that they had a mind to come into his Kingdom, ſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Schouaken,</hi> praying him to put to death thoſe three religious <hi>Franks.</hi> The Governor of <hi>Schouaken</hi> cauſed their Heads to be immediately ſtruck off, and ſent them to the King of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> who as a Reward, made him a Preſent of three Bags of Gold Duſt, promiſing him as many Bags of Gold Duſt as he ſhould ſend him Heads of <hi>Franks.</hi> And fifteen or ſixteen years ſince, two others have been put to death, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Oinadaga,</hi> whoſe Names were Father <hi>Fioravanti,</hi> and Father <hi>Franceſco.</hi> In ſhort, this King is a declared Enemy to all <hi>Franks,</hi> whom he accuſes of being Hereticks, and of having conſpired to put the Crown upon the Head of one of his Enemies: So that a <hi>Frank</hi> who would go into that Country, muſt paſs for an <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nian</hi> or <hi>Cophte,</hi> for the King and his People are of the <hi>Cophtiſh</hi> Religion. They believe but one Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> At the end of eight day they circumciſe, as the Jews do, and baptiſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48499:296"/>
Fortnight after. Before the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> went thither, they baptiſed none before they were thirty or forty years of age. They ſay Maſs as the <hi>Cophtes</hi> do, but their Church-books are in the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Language. Their Patriarch depends on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and when the Patriarch of the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> dies, they ſend Deputies to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> to entreat the Patriarch to ſend them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he convocating his Clergy, chuſes out the fitteſt among them, whom he ſends, but is never any more heard of in <hi>Egypt,</hi> till he be dead.</p>
                  <p>There are four Kings that pay Tribute to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to wit, the King of <hi>Sennar,</hi> who pays his Tribute in Horſes. <hi>Sennar</hi> is a very hot Country. The King of <hi>Naria,</hi> who pay his Tribute in Gold. The King of <hi>Bugia,</hi> and King of <hi>Dangala. Naria</hi> is a good Country, and in that Country are the Mines out of which they have the Gold that paſſes on the Coaſts of <hi>Soffala</hi> and <hi>Guiney.</hi> Theſe Mines are not deep, as in many other Countries. From that Country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comes the Civet. I think it will not be amiſs here to ſay ſomewhat of Civets, which are ſo rare in our Country, as that they deſerve to be taken notice of where one can find them. They are called <hi>Civet-Cats,</hi> come from <hi>Naria,</hi> (as I juſt now ſaid) and are taken in Snares. The Jews in <hi>Caire</hi> keep many of them in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, where for buying a few drachms of Civet one may ſee them. It is a Beaſt almoſt as big as a good Dog: It hath a ſharp Snout, ſmall Eyes, little Ears, and Muſtachios like a Cat: The Skin of it is all ſpotted black and white, with ſome yellowiſh ſpecks, and hath a long buſhy Tail, almoſt like a Fox. It is a very wild Creature, and I believe the bite of it would put
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48499:297"/>
a body to no ſmall pain. The Jews keep them in great ſquare Wooden Cages, where they feed them with raw Mutton and Beef, cut into ſmall pieces. When they would get from them that which is called Civet, (and is the Sweat of this Beaſt, that ſmells ſo ſweet) they make him go back with a ſtick which they thruſt in betwixt the Bars of the Cage and catch hold of his Tail: When they have that faſt, they take hold alſo of his two hind Legs, pulling him half out of the Cage by the Door, which falls down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Back, and keeps him faſt there, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opens a certain Cod of Fleſh that theſe Beaſts have, which is ſhaped like a ſplit Gyſerne, and with an Iron Spatula ſcrapes all the Sweat off it within. The Males have that piece of Fleſh betwixt their Stones and Yard, which is like a Cats. The Females have it betwixt their Fundament and Privities, and it is emptied of the Sweat but twice a week, each Beaſt yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a <hi>drachm at a time,</hi> by what I could diſcern. When that Sweat or Excrement is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, it is of a whitiſh grey, but by little and little, in ſome ſhort ſpace, it turns to a very brown colour. It ſmells very ſweet at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but near hand it ſtinks and cauſes a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. There are as many kinds of Civet-Sweat, as there are of Civet-Cats, for it is more whitiſh, greyiſh, or yellowiſh, and dryer in ſome than in others, and yet they mingle all together. After all, it is in vain to think to have pure Civet, for the Jews falſifie it; and if a man imagine it to be pure, becauſe he has ſeen it taken from the Beaſt, he is miſtaken, for before People come to their Houſes, they rub the inſide of that piece of Fleſh, with a little Oyl, or ſome ſuch Stuff, that ſo the Sweat and it together may make

more weight, but when no body is preſent, they take it out pure, and mingle it afterwards. To find out the truth of this, I went one day to the Houſe of a Jew, that kept Civet-Cats, without giving him notice before, (for becauſe I had bought a little of him, and promiſed to come again another time, he asked me as often as he ſaw me, what day I would come) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſired him to get me ſome freſh Civet, he told me, that it was not the day he uſed to take it out; and having returned without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him before, upon one of the days when he ſaid he was accuſtomed to gather it, he refuſed then alſo to do it, pretending Buſineſs, which confirmed all that had been told me of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the mean time they hold theſe Beaſts very dear; for having asked that <hi>Jew,</hi> and others alſo, how much they would have of me, for a Civet Cat, they all told me, an hundred Chequins. <hi>Dangala</hi> is the capital City of <hi>Nubia,</hi> the King of <hi>Dangala</hi> is King of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> who are a kind of Blacks, of the Muſulman Religion, that came in Crowds to <hi>Caire,</hi> to get Services; they are ſomewhat ſilly, but very faithful, and ſerve for a ſmall matter, for two Maidins a day, or a Maidin and their Dyet: You may make them do whatſoever you pleaſe. They wear a blew Shirt, plat all their Hair in Treſſes, and then rub it over with a certain Oyl, to keep their Head from being louſie. At <hi>Caire,</hi> when they have any falling out, they go before the <hi>Scheiks</hi> of their own Nation, who make them Friends, and if they think it convenient, adjudg them to pay a Fine, with which they feaſt and make merry together. They are great lovers of Crocodiles Fleſh; and when any <hi>Frank</hi> has got one for the Skin, they come and beg the Fleſh,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48499:298"/>
which they dreſs with a pretty good Sawce. When theſe Blades have ſcraped together ten or twelve Piaſtres, they return home again wealthy to their own Country, provided they eſcape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbed by the <hi>Arabs</hi> upon the way, who many times ſerve them ſo, therefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly return in companies, as they came. The King of <hi>Dangala</hi> pays his Tribute to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in Cloth. The Provinces of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> are <hi>Gouyan,</hi> (where the King keeps a Viceroy) <hi>Beghandir, Dambia, Amara,</hi> (which is a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, full of Mountains and good Caſtles) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud Tegre,</hi> and <hi>Barnegas.</hi> Beſides, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces governed by Princes, who are Vaſſals to the King of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> In ſhort, the Kingdom of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> comprehends twenty four <hi>Tambours</hi> or Vice Roys.

When the King dyes, they chuſe out one of the wittieſt of them, and make him King, without

any regard to Birth-right; and when he comes to have Children, he ſends his Brothers Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſome other place, and places his Children at <hi>Ouhhni.</hi> The place where the Kings are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, is called <hi>Ayeſus,</hi> and is a kind of Grott, where the Aged are laid in one ſide, and the young in the other. Heretofore there was a Church there of the ſame name, in time of the Jeſuites; and in the ſame place there is a Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Ambaſſador aſſured me, that he had been in that Library, and I fancy it is the old Library of the Ancient <hi>Ethiopians.

The Houſes of the great Lords are like thoſe of <hi>Caire,</hi> that is to ſay, very mean, in reſpect of the Houſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the reſt are only of Mud. The Country affords men of all Trades, except Watch-makers. They have no Camels there, but Mules, Aſſes, Oxen, and Horſes. All the People of this Country eat raw Fleſh, except the King, who has it dreſs'd, and drinks Wine of Grapes; the reſt drink only Wine made of Millet or Saraſin Wheat, but as ſtrong as ours, and Brandy made of the ſame Grain. They are cloathed after the faſhion of the <hi>Franks,</hi> and wear Cloath, Velvet, and other Stuffs imported to them by the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> They have Harquebuſſes from the Turks, and of thoſe People there are not above three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred who ſerve in the Wars with Harquebuſſes. In Trading they make no uſe of coyned Money, as the <hi>Europeans</hi> do, but their Money are pieces of fifteen or twenty <hi>Pies</hi> of Cloth, Gold, which they give by weight, and a kind of Salt, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48499:299"/>
they reduce into little ſquare pieces like pieces of Soap, and theſe paſs for Money.
