         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Glorious Succeſs with which God hath crown'd
your honorable Actions, in the reſcue of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Land out of thoſe hands that without cauſe
were imbrued in the blood of our Country; is yet ſo
freſh and warme in every ingenuous heart, that (I
hope) a Propoſal, tending to a ſacrificious gratitude
to the Lord of Hoaſts, (by whoſe mercie and mighty arm, we are what
we are) will not be unreaſonably preſented to any perſon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Addreſs. Wherein I have humbly aſſumed the confidence
to mind You of the pious Cuſtoms of the Soldiers and Servants of
God in former Ages; nay of the laudable (though blind) Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45922:3"/>
of Pagans and Infidels, as Sacred, and other Hiſtory do (amply)
manifeſt? Who no ſooner could ſound <hi>Victoria</hi> after a war, but up
go the Alters, and on go the Sacrifices, in retribution of thanks to
that Deity each held in veneration.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we have (in the progreſs of this War) afforded God
ſome Days of Thanks-giving; and he (at laſt) having given us the
iſſue of our hopes; the Bleſſing and Harveſt of our Blood and Sweat:
thoſe would all look like dayes of helliſh Hypocriſie, if we ſhould not
now preſent him with ſome Deeds of Thank ſgiving; and Sacrifices
being ceaſed, we have an Opportunitie to exerciſe what he loves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is, Mercie.</p>
            <p>Not then to hold You any longer in the Porch of expectation, I
here preſent You in one hand, the Aged, the Infirm, the Orphan, to
be provided for by way of Hoſpital: and in the other hand, that
yet-in it's-Morning (but hopefull) light of this Land, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> for Addition of Revenue. To carry on both which, I
wiſh God would perſwade each heart herein concerned, to allow one
Acre of Land out of each hundred, due to him; which granted, there
is little doubt but the Adventurers, to whom God hath given ſo fair
a Returne of their pious Loanes; and Purchaſers of Debentures, who
have leaſt reaſon to oppoſe, will do the like: And the ſame deducted
from each mans Proportion, to be caſt into a ſingle, or what ſeverall
Parcels, the wiſdom of the Government ſhall judg convenient.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may object, That this Motion comes too late, much
of the Land being already diſpoſed of, (and I grant, had it been
thought of ſooner, it had been effected with leſs trouble, but) <hi>Volenti
nil difficile,</hi> we ſhould not in the leaſt pauſe at the difficulty, were it
to ſerve our owne particulars; and indeed, conſidered in the beſt
ſenſe, it is ſo, if we expect a bleſſing upon the reſt of our Eſtates; or
if there be any wiſdom in laying up treaſure in Heaven: for this ſhall
be ſurer to your houſes, then the braines of all the Lawyers that ever
trod <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hallmet in one ſcull, can make the reſt.</p>
            <p>For who knows how ſoon, prodigall Heirs (ordinarily the Iſſue
of penurious Fathers) ſhall make havock of thoſe Eſtates, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part whereof, might, though not merit, have brought a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon you to all eternitie. A fair warning for the obſervance of
that precious inch of Scripture, <hi>Whileſt you have time do good;</hi> leaſt
while you are rotting, your Heirs be revelling; and they damned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45922:3"/>
for ſpending upon their luſts, what you were damned for
denying the Lazar.</p>
            <p>And if there be any (though I hope better things) that ſhall
ſtrain at this Gnat, I wonder how they would have behaved
themſelvs towards that Camel, laid before the Young man in
the Goſpell, <hi>All that thou haſt.</hi> Remember the Widows mite,
and the ſuperlative teſtimonie our Saviour gave of it. Poor
woman! It was all ſhe had, and this a Fleece out of
a flock.</p>
            <p>And I dare affirme <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> (laying aſide their
lie) were Saints, compared to ſuch as ſhall ſay to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
<hi>I'll conſider of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we can pay the fourth part of our Rents to theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-welaths,
we may bluſh before the Angels to denie the
hundredth part to the Common-wealth of Chriſt: For this is
not to denude your walls of their hangings, to cover the fleſh
of the poor; nor your Coaches of their leather, to make them
ſhooes; your ſuper-neceſſarie pampred Steeds of their Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths,
to make them Shirts; nor your Manger of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,
to fill their Ovens; though all theſe might well be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
to reliev the meaneſt Member of Chriſt. God hath given
to many amongſt us vaſt Eſtates, large poſſeſſions; he hath given
us the Land &amp; labour of our Enemies, Beings that we neither
built nor planted; nay he hath given us our lives for a prey,
when thouſands as valiant, as pretious, as worthy as we, lie
now rotting in contempible ditches. And ſhall we not help
our Brethren to live with us? That Saying is as good as old,
<hi>Non nobis ſolùm nati ſumus,</hi> we are not born onely for our
ſelves; &amp; I hope we did not altogether fight for our ſelves; but
ſhal'be tryed by this trifle, though what is here urged as an act
of Charitie, and as yet carries no other face, may to after-ages
be rendred an act of Politie, and that Suſtenance and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being the ſubject matters here preaſt, who knows but that
caſting his bounty and bread upon the waters now, he may
after many dayes find them in the bellies and brains of his
needy poſteritie.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there may be ſome who ſet a low rate upon that
Beauty and Glory of Humanitie, Learning, which ſanctified,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45922:4"/>
reſtores us neareſt to the Image of God: but if there be, (as I
hope few) they muſt give me leave to believe they are ſuch as
would have the eys both of Church and Common-wealth put
out, that they might have the leading of them.</p>
            <p>It was highly in queſtion which was the ſaddeſt Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
that under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> or that under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate; the
firſt laboring the deſtruction of all the bodies of the Saints, and
the laſt of all books, that no memory of God or Religion might
remain: but the laſt was concluded infinitly tranſcendant, as
a device that would have thrown the world into a deeper then
Egyptian darkneſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, there are many who (I have charity to believe)
mean well, and much mind the enlargement of the bounds of
the Church, and opening a way for the light of the Goſpel in
it's puritie to ſhine upon the freckled face of the erronious
World: But alas! that's hard to be done by a language that
hath no acquaintance abroad; nor could ever travel farther
then the verges of our own ſhores, ſave amongſt our own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies;
and not communicable to other Natures by any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Rule. I muſt needs grant, that Chriſt in the election of
his Apoſtles, made choice of poore ignorant laboring men; but
I hope none will denie, that though he found them ſuch, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſealing of their great Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel,
by the Holy Ghoſt, in cloven tongues, they went away the moſt
ſublimated Scholars that ever were, or ſhall be upon the
World; That Great School-Maſter in a moment diſpelling
the miſt of deſpicable ignorance, and filling them with all
Languages and requiſite Knowledge. And 'tis obſervable, that
when God had a purpoſe to ſtay the Building of <hi>Babel,</hi> and
ſcatter mankind into fractions; he confounds their ſpeech,
and divides tongues to the Nations: but when he reſolves to
build up his Church, he recollects them all into the Mouths
of his Apoſtles. With ſome meaſure of which Qualification
(immediate gift of tongues being ceaſed) the moſt eminent
Servants of Chriſt, and faithful promoters of the purity of
his truth, have from time to time, indefatigably labored by
Nurſeries of Learning to endow the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45922:4"/>
'Tis true, Exhortations, Reproofs, Conſolations, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in plain and patent matters, are highly commendable
in thoſe of meaneſt parts; for they that feared the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpake
often one to another: but Preaching, Expoſition, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
of hidden Myſteries, do modeſtly call for ſanctified
Learning and Authority. The management of which Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I humbly leave to thoſe Champions of the Truth, whoſe
Shields I am not worthy to bear.</p>
            <p>And now craving pardon to my prolixity, glance once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
upon the poore; and wiſh the moſt obdurate wretch to
lay his hand upon his heart and conſider, how his eares will
one day tingle to hear that Soul-cruſhing charge of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
from the mouth of the Son of God, <hi>I was hungry, and
yee fed me not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adding onely this, If there be any heart ſo much Adamant,
brow ſo much braſs, or minde ſo void of Mercie, as to ſet
himſelf in poſitive Oppoſition to what is here ſuggeſted; or
that his evil Example, or Coldneſs, cauſe this great Buſineſs
to fall to the ground; he muſt give me leave to tell him, He

in Peace: And for my ſelf I ſhall humbly crave you

And indeed my LORD, it was not much my wonder,
there being nothing wherein the depraved conſtitution

have propoſed, will (I hope) be deemed the requiſite

            <p>FEw daies ſince I ſnatch an opportunitie in your
preſence to preſent ſome papers to my Lord, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
your auxiliary endeavors to perfect a work
which poſteritie may bleſſe you for, but whether or
no they were imparted to you, I am yet much to ſeek,
and more unwilling to doubt there wants its fire, or
the Prieſt a readineſſe to receive in Sacrificers. Sir, if
you are not already acquainted with it, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who is laudibly zealous for it will inform you:
Sir, the Condition of my Propoſal is the ſame with
that of <hi>Betheſda</hi> Cripple, it hath neither enemies, nor
friends, but it is ſad that ſo much preaching, and ſo
much praying ſhould not be ſeconded by that pretious
and pertinent ornament of Criſtianitie, Pitie. Sir, wee
do with a great deal of confidence own ourſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, ſit before him as his people, and call to him
for all mercies, ſafeties, and ſucceſſes, and 'tis fit our eies
ſhould bee often up towards him, but ſomtimes down
upon the poor; otherwiſe (which I much fear) wee
ſhall run a courſe parallel with the Merchant Jew, who
craves favour and credit from every man, but will truſt
no man. Sir, as for the <hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi>
your manifeſt Education in, and high improvement of
it, hath from the Pulpit ſaved me a labour, from
whence one ſentence of your Chryſoſtomiz'd exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to this glorious work, would be heard in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Eccho from generation to generation, till the

laſt Trumpet received it into the Conſort of Eternitie
Sir, I crave your pardon to my importunitie, but you
know whoſe buſineſſe it is, and further begs libertie
to tell you, it was not for nothing that <hi>Heſter</hi> was ſet
ſo near her King, <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh, Nehemiah</hi> to his
potent Maſter. Nor need I tell you, that the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that great talent of advantage God hath given
you, in the ear of that hopeful perſon (to whom you
relate) will be (one day) required. And Sir I further
crave, you will believe I write not this to move you,
but to minde you; aſſuming onely the office of a ſilly
