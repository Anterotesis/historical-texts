            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A briefe Anſwer to Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> Booke, tending to reſolve Conſcience, about the Subjects taking up of Arms.</head>
            <byline>By JER: BURROUGHES.</byline>
            <p>THere came to my hand a Book of D. <hi>Fern,</hi> tending to reſolve Conſcience in the caſe of the Subjects taking up Armes. I find it carryed on without giving any ill termes, but in farr expreſſions, ſutable to a Treatiſe that concernes Conſcience, and the more likely to prevail with it. Onely now and then ſome bitternes breakes forth; I ſhall very briefly, yet faithfully give you the ſtrength of it: Where he ſpeakes right, I will acknowledge it; and where he miſtakes, I will fairly diſcuſſe and ſhew you whence the miſtakes ariſe. I confeſſe he hath great advantage in the ſubject, becauſe it is for the King: <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe it is ſafer to plead for the King, though a man miſtakes; but if there be a miſtake in leſſening the Kings right, a man endangers his utter undoing. <hi>2.</hi> Truth about this argument, hath alwayes been tenderly handled; thoſe who have pleaded for the King, have with courage vented themſelves to the utmoſt; but others have been forced to be ſilent, or elſe but even to whisper and ſpeak halfe out, leſt they preſently meet with (not arguments, but) things of another nature to anſwer them. In which regard the power of Kings hath been raiſed to the height, and men have drunk in ſuch opinions of abſolute power in them, as they have heard confidently affirmed, practiſed, and ſeen in Books, and feeled by many taxations and cenſures; but whatſoever might informe them hath layne in the darke, not daring to appeare: Therefore well might the D. call what now people begin to heare, and enquire after, a new doctrine; it is an old truth, but newly diſcovering it ſelf. The name of <hi>King</hi> hath taken ſuch impreſſion in the hearts of people, that for a while they will be prejudiced againſt whatſoever may but ſound of limiting his power, or maintaining our right againſt it.</p>
            <p>What there is in the Epiſtle that may prejudice any mans conſcience, will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in what follows.</p>
            <div type="preamble">
               <head>Preamble to SECT. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SO many good people that are come to a ſenſe of Religion and godlineſſe, are miſerably carryed away by a ſtrange implicite ſaith, to beleeve whatſoever is ſaid or done in the name of the Parliament, &amp;c. to be infallibly true and juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems thoſe who have not a ſenſe of Religion, do not ſo eaſily beleeve the truth and juſtice of what is done in the name of the Parliament.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> This is moſt certaine, who are hardeſt to beleeve what the Parliament ſayes, but Papiſts, and notorious blaſphemers, and prophane livers? I condemne not all, but compare the generality of the one ſide, and of the other; you ſhall finde an apparent difference in the lives of the one, from the lives of the other: Yea, ſo it is now that if a man as heretofore were not prophane, or looſe at leaſt, or zealous for ceremonies, he was accounted a <hi>Puritan</hi>; ſo now a <hi>Round-head,</hi> that is, in their ordinary interpretation, one for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, This is becauſe Religion is pretended on the Parliaments ſide: So it is on the other, with as loud a cry as the Parliaments. In ſuch things where I muſt have regard to humane teſtimony, to what part I ſee the moſt that have the ſenſe of Religion to adhere, that ſide I will be on, except I ſee better grounds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104280:2"/>
then yet the D. brings to draw me from it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.20: <hi>That thou mayſt, walk in the way of good men, and keepe the paths of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>

               </head>
               <p>IN this <hi>Sect.</hi> theſe ſpecial things are conſiderable: 1. What he grants. 2. what we grant. 3. What he ſayes we grant. He grants we may deny obedience to the King, nor onely in things unlawfull by the Law of God, but by the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land. It is well this is granted; Heretofore we know this was the generall Tenet, whatſoever was commanded by the King, yea by any men in authority, if but by a Prelate, except it were againſt Gods Law, we were bound to obey it; any thing that was not ſinne, muſt be yeelded to and that for conſcience ſake. The D. in this is ingenuous; he confeſſeth that not onely Gods Law, but mans Law limits Kings power: This is a great eaſe to many mens conſciences to know ſo much.</p>
               <p>And further, if this be true, that all thoſe Scriptures that urge obedience to Kings and men in authority, muſt be underſtood with this limitation, that is, if they command according to the Laws of God, and according to the Laws of the countrey over which they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſayes, <hi>In point of reſiſtance we grant it muſt be in ſuch a caſe where there are</hi> Omnes ordines regni conſentientes, <hi>an unanimous conſent of the two Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>There is no determination that the greater part preſent of either Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon, but is as truly valid and legal, as if there were an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of them both. It is ſo in all bodies where things are carried by vote.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſayes, <hi>We yeeld it muſt be a meere defenſive reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>If the King ſhould ſend any to miſchiefe us, to ſay, we muſt onely defend our ſelves, ſo as not to offend them, is a contradiction; as for the Kings perſon, is it not the profeſſion of the Parl. to defend it? therefore we neede not diſpute now, about defending our ſelves againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſayes, <hi>this likewiſe is granted that the Prince muſt firſt be bent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion, Liberties, and Laws, and will not diſcharge his truſt, before there muſt be reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>By this he would inſinuate that our Arms taken up are unlawfull, becauſe the King hath not declared himſelfe thus.</p>
               <p>What need we be put to meddle with any thing but this in the caſe in hand? That a Kingdom ſeeing it ſelf in imminent danger of enemies to infringe the liberties of it, may ſtand up to defend it ſelfe; yea although they come forth againſt it in the name of the King: This is our caſe, and if the D. diſputes againſt any thing but this, he fights with his own ſhadow.</p>
               <p>If this be caſe as certainly it is, then a great part of the Doctors book is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the buſineſſe of the Parliaments raiſing forces: For forces may bee raiſed upon other grounds then the Kings being bent to overthrow Religion.</p>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>THe ſtrength of this <hi>Section,</hi> and almoſt all the book, is in that place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and in this place I beleeve the D. will ſee, or if he doth not, others will, that he is utterly miſtaken in the ſenſe of that place.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſayes expreſly, <hi>Whoſoever reſiſts, ſhall receive damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>But he doth not ſay expreſly, whoſoever reſiſts the higheſt men ſhall receive damnation, but whoſoever ſhall reſiſt the power: <hi>Let every one be ſubject</hi> not to the wills of the higheſt men, but <hi>to the higher power:</hi> there is a great deale
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104280:2"/>
of difference betweene theſe two: The higher power, that is, that authority that God &amp; man hath put upon ſuch a man, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that muſt be ſubjected to, &amp; not reſiſted. We profeſſe againſt reſiſting power, authority, though abuſed: If thoſe who have power to make Laws, ſhall make ſinfull Laws, and ſo give authority to any to force obedience; we ſay here there muſt either be flying or paſſive obedience; but if one that is in authority command out of his own will, and not by Law, I reſiſt no power, no authority at all, if I neither actively nor paſſively obey, no I do not ſo much as reſiſt abuſed authority. This may ſeeme ſtrange at the firſt; but if you thinke of it, you will beleeve it. The D. thinkes the anſwer to this place is onely from the limitation of the perſon, or the cauſe of reſiſting, as if we held that no particular men upon any cauſe, but States may reſiſt upon ſuch and ſuch cauſes; whereas we doe not anſwer ſo, but we diſtinguiſh betweene the man that hath the power, and the power of that man, and ſay, although the power muſt not be reſiſted according to the letter, and the ſenſe of the Text, yet the illegall will and wayes of the man may be reſiſted, without the leaſt offending againſt the Text. But we ſhall meete with this Scripture again and again, and ſhall follow it with anſwers accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He comes to examples, as firſt, the peoples reſcuing of Jonathan from Saul. He ſayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1</note> 
                  <hi>the people were in Arms already, and did but uſe a loving violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This example is onely brought to prove that Subjects may withſtand illegal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Kings, and no further, and that it plainly proves; onely, he ſayes,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> it is <hi>a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving violence.</hi> Well then, it is a violence; they reſolve that the Kings command ſhall not be fulfilled, yea though hee adds an oath to it. It was indeede a loving violence to <hi>Jonathan</hi>; ſo is all the violence that the Parliament offers, a loving violence to the Kingdome, yea and there is true love to the King too in it. The King hath not yet ſworn that he will have ſuch things as the Parl. will not ſuffer, ſo as to come to our cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; but <hi>Saul</hi> ſwore that he would have ſuch a thing done, and yet the people would not ſuffer it to be done, and yet you dare not blame them for this, nay you commend them for it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond example is, <hi>David</hi> reſiſting <hi>Saul,</hi> the D. ſayes,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2</note> 
                  <hi>It was to ſave his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Cut-throats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not our Army to ſave Parl. &amp; people from Cut-throats?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſayes, <hi>David did no act of hoſtility, but only defended himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> had no authority over any that followed <hi>Saul,</hi> for he was then a private man;<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> but our Parl. hath authority over Delinquents that follow the King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> was loath indeede to venture upon a pitcht battail, or to exaſperate <hi>Saul</hi> or his Subjects, becauſe his ſtrength was weake, 600. to a King, therefore he flies up and downe and takes not every advantage, that if it were poſſible he might gaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the eyes of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Subjects: but if they had falne upon him, and his power had beene equall to theirs, who knowes what he would have done? but we are ſure as it is, it is defenſive, and that is all it is to prove that Subjects may take up Arms to defend themſelves againſt the injuſtice of their Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For that example of David at Keilah, all the anſwer to that is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that it is an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuppoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But examine the place, you ſhall finde it as certain as a ſuppoſition can be;<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly that <hi>David</hi> had ſome expectation that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have ſtood to him and kept off <hi>Saul</hi> comming againſt him, and if they would, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the Text, that <hi>David</hi> would have ſtood to it though <hi>Saul</hi> had come againſt him. In the Text it is as plain, as this: Suppoſe the King were neere <hi>Hull</hi> going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104280:3"/>
againſt Sir <hi>J. Hotham,</hi> and Sir <hi>J.

                  <hi>Page</hi> 10. He comes to Scriptures, <hi>denying reſiſtance:</hi> let us ſee what full Scriptures theſe are.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.1. <hi>&amp;c. The conſpiracie of Corah and his company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt Moſes and Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>It is ſtrange that this example muſt be paralleld with our Parl. taking up Arms: Was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104280:3"/>
it not a moſt unjuſt and vile conſpiracie, meerly out of the pride of malicious ſpirits? Can the D. or any man think, that in juſtifying Arms in ſome caſe, we juſtifie all villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous conſpiracies and out-rages?</p>
               <p>Beſides, this place condemns riſing up againſt the Prieſt, as well as the King. Yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if they had riſen againſt the meaneſt officer that God had appointed in Church or Common-wealth, as here they did againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> it would have bin a very hainous offence; Yea if <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſhould have thus riſen againſt any Officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, it had bin a vile ſin in him; therefore this proves no more againſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reſiſting Princes, then Princes reſiſting ſubjects, or one ſubject reſiſting another.</p>
               <p>Further, we do not riſe againſt His Majeſty, as they roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi>; we deſire not that he ſhould have leſſe power then God &amp; the Laws have given him, but we would preſerve this in him, and keep off the ſtroke of any further power, ſo that we need not for this thing ſo much as examine the cauſe upon which they roſe, whether it were ſuppoſed or not, for the caſe is far differing in the end of the riſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Corah <hi>and his company ſuppoſed the cauſe ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſed cauſes for any thing is not enough;<note place="margin">Anſ</note> now we are not examining the truth of the cauſe of taking up Arms, but whether they may not be taken up by the Subject againſt the mind of the King for any cauſe.</p>
               <p>Wel, our conſciences need not be much ſcrupled from this Scripture: Let us examine the reſt he brings.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 18. <hi>where the oppreſſion of the King is mentioned, and no means of help mentioned but crying to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is the bare relation of the oppreſſion of a King without mention in that place of any means of help, but crying to God,<note place="margin">Anſ</note> a ſufficient proof that though Kings oppreſſe never ſo much, yet there is no help? Suppoſe I bring a place o Scripture, where there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Subjects riſing up in a wicked way againſt their Prince, &amp; in that place there is no other help mentioned, but only the Prince committed this to God, &amp; God reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, can there be drawn from thence an argument, that when Subjects riſe againſt Princes that they have no other help againſt them, but committing the cauſe to God? We need not go far for a Scripture in this kind, the very place the D. brought before wil do it; <hi>Num.</hi> 15. when <hi>Corah</hi> and his company roſe againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> we there read of no other help that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed, but he committed the thing to God, &amp; God revenged it.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay, yet there are other places that ſhew that Princes may make uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help.</p>
               <p>So there is for Subjects to make uſe of other helps againſt the oppreſſion of their Princes, many Scriptures have been mentioned formerly and cleered.<note place="margin">Anſ</note>
               </p>
               <p>Further, beſides this, we anſwer, that the power of all Kings is not alike, it is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe one King hath ſuch and ſuch power, therefore all muſt needs have. The power of Kings is limited or enlarged by the ſeverall Laws of ſeverall Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us ſee what the third Scripture ſayes, for yet our conſciences are not ſcrupled, it is</hi> Numb. 10. <hi>That the people might not go to war but by order from him that had the power of the Trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe there was a poſitive order there that <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt make trumpets and thus uſe them; Doth it follow that this muſt be ſo every where?<note place="margin">Anſ</note> you may by as true a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence urge the neceſſity of ſilver trumpets, and that the Prieſts ſhould blow them, as well as the former: The conſequence would be full as good. No King can uſe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in war but by the blowing of the Prieſts, for it is commanded there, as that no people can go to war till the Magiſtrates uſe the Trumpets, becauſe it is ſo ordered there; we know the Law is judiciall, and for thoſe judiciall Laws the equity binds no
<pb facs="tcp:104280:4"/>
further then according to rules of prudence and juſtice, every countrey ſhall ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull for their conditions. Beſides if this did binde, then it were a ſinne for an Act to paſſe to put the <hi>Militia</hi> for any time into any other hands, for certainly it might not then be done, no, not with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> conſent.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.9. <hi>Who can ſtretch out his hand againſt the Lords Anointed and be guiltleſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why doth the D. ſpeake of ſtretching forth the hand againſt the Lords Anointed? who endeavours it? doth not the Parliament profeſſe the defence of the Kings Perſon? 2. Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> upon this place gives you this Anſwer, That indeed it is not lawfull for a private man to lay hands, no not upon a tyrant, for it is not lawfull for a private man to kill a thiefe or a murderer, much leſſe a Magiſtrate, a Prince. But ſecondly, he tels us of ſome that have laid hands upon a King, and yet have been guiltleſſe, as <hi>Ebud</hi> upon <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab:</hi> therefore from that Scripture there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a generall Propoſition drawn, that no man in any caſe may ſtretch forth his hand againſt a King. Yea Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> anſwers in the third place, that yet Tyrants and wicked Governours may be removed by the whole State. He indeed limits this, and ſayes, it muſt be underſtood of ſuch Kingdomes as goe by election, as in <hi>Polonia,</hi> and gives this reaſon, From whom Kings receive their authority, by them may they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in keep within bounds. This it ſeems was good Divinity in thoſe dayes. This diſtinction he uſed, to deliver the opinion from oppoſition in <hi>England</hi>; but if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction be examined, there will appeare little ſtrength in it: We doe not find that D. <hi>Willet</hi> was ever reproved, or his writings cenſured for this thing.</p>
               <p>Concerning that reſtriction of his to Kingdomes by election, we ſhall, when wee come to ſhew from whence all Kings have their power, ſee, that if it proves true of them, it will prove true of others; for the foundation of all power that ſuch and ſuch men have over others, will be found either from election or covenant, which will come to all one.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Ferne</hi> proceeds thus, <hi>If the King had come into the battel, his perſon might have been hurt as well as any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been but accidentally; If a father ſhould voluntarily goe into the Army of the common enemy, againſt whom the childe is in ſervice, and the child in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging upon the enemy ſhould ſlay his father being there, eſpecially he being deſired &amp; beſeeched by any meanes not to be there, but to withdraw himſelfe; doth the child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract guilt in ſuch a caſe?</p>
               <p>H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s next Argument from Scripture is, <hi>That the Prophet reprehending the Kings of Iſrael and Judah for Idolatry and oppreſſion, none ever called upon the people for this duty of reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, There is much difference betweene Kings now, and thoſe Kings: The people then did neither give them their power, nor limit their power; They doe both now when firſt they are ſet up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this be a good argument, that becauſe when Kings oppreſſed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did not cal upon people for reſiſtance, therefore all reſiſtance in any caſe is unlawful; then, if when people have reſiſted, &amp; caſt off the Government of their King, &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have not reproved them for it; then it is lawfull for people in ſome caſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. He that will harken to his own reaſon, muſt acknowledge there is <hi>par ratio.</hi> If the Prophets exhorted not to reſiſtance, then there may be no reſiſtance, ſayes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: Then if when there is reſiſtance, the Prophets rebuke not that reſiſtance, then there may with as good reaſon be reſiſtance, ſay I.</p>
               <p>When the ten Tribes caſt off the Government of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for his oppreſſion, and
<pb facs="tcp:104280:4"/>
hearkning to his young Cavalliers about him, rather then to his ancient grave counſel; the Prophets did not rebuke the ten Tribes for what they did, but rather ſeemed to take their parts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.24. <hi>Return every man to his houſe, for this thing is from mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the D. comes to his great place again,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>which he ſayes be will free from all exceptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, bate me an Ace of that. The truth is, he vever ſo much as mentions,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> nor thinks of the great exception, which duly conſidered, will clear the Text to be nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt he ſuppoſes that the King is the ſupreme, as</hi> Peter <hi>calls him, or the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true, <hi>Peter</hi> cals the King <hi>Supreame,</hi> but in the ſame place he is made an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man, and therefore to be limited by man.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> He may be the chiefe man in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and yet limited in that authority; he is ſupreame, but not abſolute; We grant that the Houſes of Parliament, and we all, are his Subjects, but not Subjects to his will, but to that power of his that Law gives him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He takes for granted the King is the higher power. Here obſerve his miſtake. Let it be granted that the King hath the higheſt power, yet what propriety of ſpeech is it to ſay that he is the higheſt power? It is proper to God to ſay that he is Power in the abſtract.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>The King hath the higheſt power, and we muſt be ſubject to this power of his, and not reſiſt it.</hi> Who denies all this? When all this is granted, the D. hath got nothing at all; for if we reſiſt not that power which Law hath given him, we do not reſiſt the higher power, although we do not do nor ſuffer what hee would have us to do or ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he reaſons from the perſon, whoſoever, every ſoule. There was then</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Senate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what power the Senate had for the preſent upon agreement,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> or how much of their power was now given up to the Emperour by agreement, he ſhews not; and if he ſhews not this, he ſayes nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he tels us of the cauſe Chriſtians had to reſiſt, becauſe their Emperours were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Religion, and had overthrown Laws and liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt we acknowledge we muſt not reſiſt for Religion;<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> if the Laws of the Land be againſt it, we muſt either ſuffer, or ſeek to enjoy our Religion in the uttermoſt parts of the earth, rather then reſiſt.</p>
               <p>For the Emperors ſubverting Laws and Liberties, he muſt prove that the people &amp; Senate had not given abſolute power to them for the preſent, for the preventing further evils they feared, or elſe it reacheth not our caſe, for we know our people and Senate have not given any ſuch abſolute power. We muſt not be put to prove, they had, for it is his argument; therefore if he wil make it good, he muſt prove they had not. And yet ſuppoſe they had not, if we ſhould gratifie the D. in that thing, yet the Argument would be but weak: for the Apoſtle requires them not to reſiſt their power, their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: hee doth not charge them not to reſiſt their tyrannie. Certainly they could have no power but that which was given them by ſome agreement; if they challenged further, it was no authority at all: ſuch kind of tyrannie as they would aſſume to themſelves, the Apoſtle forbids not the reſiſtance of in that place.</p>
               <p>As for that he ſayes, that <hi>ſome affirm that prohibition was temporary, let them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it that affirm it:</hi> I am ful of the D. mind in that, this prohibition is a ſtanding rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for that diſtinction which he ſayes, ſome make that they reſiſt not the power, but the abuſe of the power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer, it is not reſiſting abuſed power, for it is reſiſting no power at all. Abuſed
<pb facs="tcp:104280:5"/>
power is the ill uſe of what is given to men; but the ill uſe of what was never given to them more then to any other, is abuſe of their wils, but not abuſe of their power. By Power I do not mean Strength, but Authority.</p>
               <p>Further, he ſayes, <hi>Theſe Emperours ruled abſolutely, therefore upon that ground men might reſiſt, iſ for any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Although the Emperors might uſe ſome force to bring themſelves to an abſolute power, yet whether the people were not brought to conſent to prevent farther danger, that muſt be diſproved, when our caſe ever fals, ſo as we ſhall be brought to conſent to an abſolute power, although it be out of feare (which God forbid) then this argument will concerne us, but not before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What they got and held meerly by force, without any conſent and agreement, was no power, no authority at all but might be reſiſted, notwithſtanding that prohibition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The laſt thing in that Sect. is, whereas we ſay that our Religion is eſtabliſhed by Law, theirs was not: He anſwers</hi> 2. <hi>things.</hi> 1. <hi>Shall the prohibition be good againſt Chriſtians under Emperors perſecuting Religion, &amp; not againſt Subjects enjoying their Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thoſe who have power to make Laws ſhould prove ſo wicked as to make wicked Laws againſt Religion, yet I am rather bound to paſſive obedience in that caſe, then if men never ſo good ſhould command according to their own will, and not according to Law; for there is an authority in the one, though abuſed, but none at all in the other.</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is, <hi>This prohibition did not concern Chriſtians only, but all people under the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As before, 1. we know not but theſe people had given up their right. 2. If they had not, that prohibition doth not reach them in thoſe things wherein they had not.</p>
               <p>Thus his Scriptures are anſwered, and I profeſſe I have not anſwered from a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of ſeeking to overcome in a diſpute, to put gloſſes upon the one ſide, or to ſeek evaſions from the ſtrength of the other, but as in the preſence of God to find out truth, and to ſatisfie Conſcience that hath to doe with God in a ſpeciall manner.</p>

               <p>His concluſion is in this <hi>Sect.</hi> that though the power be of God, yet the perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and the qualification of power in ſeveral forms of government, &amp; limitation of this, is by the laws of men: This is as much as we deſire. Many go no further then the deſignation of the perſon to be from man, but the D. is more fair, he ſayes the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from man alſo. If ſo, mark what follows, then no man can have any of this ruling power, but according as he is deſigned to it, qualified for it, limited in it by men, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the name be by which you call him, Emperor, King, Prince, Duke, Lord, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>Sect.</hi> is about the power of people to re-aſſume what power they have conferred upon Magiſtrates, although Gods power, yet conferred by them.</p>
               <p>He argues thus, <hi>If the power be Gods, then people cannot re-aſſume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King gives power to an inferior Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the power that this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath is likewiſe from God, for ſo the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>All power is from God</hi>: may not this power be re-aſſumed therefore? Let none put this off, with ſaying, But people are not above Kings, as Kings are above inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, for that is nothing to the argument. The argument that he makes is this, If the power be of God, it cannot be re-aſſumed: Now the anſwer is, That the power of inferiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Magiſtrates is of God, and yet it may be re-aſſumed, therefore his conſequence is not good.</p>
               <p>Further, a ſervant by ſtipulation makes a man his Maſter, who was not before: Now the power of the Maſter is Gods, may he therefore never be deprived of that power? Servants muſt ſerve Chriſt in ſerving their Maſters, as truely as Subjects muſt obey God in obeying their Prince. Paſtors and Teachers have a ruling and a miniſteriall power, and this power is Gods, may it therefore never be taken away from them?</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>We cannot recall what is once given, as in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That can never be proved, that a thing devoted to a religious uſe, can never lawfully be imployed to no other. This is a groundleſſe conceit, becauſe he brings no proofs for it, <hi>Eadem facilitate rejicitur, qua aſſeritur.</hi> But this that we ſpeake of is a civill thing. <hi>And for Kings, that the power they have may not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> he gives that reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the Lords hand and his oyle is upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Lords hand and oyle is upon Captains and other Magiſtrates.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Zecrubbabel</hi> are called <hi>The anointed ones.</hi> Prophets, Prieſts have Gods hand and oyle upon them, and cannot the power for no cauſe be taken from theſe? And yet how confidently doth the man conclude, <hi>This will not a true informed conſcience dare to doe.</hi> Certainly notwithſtanding all the information in this argument, he may doe it.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds. <hi>How can conſcience be ſatisfied, that this their argument groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon election and derivation of power can have place in this Kingdome, when as the Grown deſcends by inheritance, and hath often been ſetled by Conqueſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no body here that yet hath attempted to take any power away from the King that Law hath given him.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Howſoever, the point of inheritance or conqueſt cannot hinder; For firſt, none inherits but that which his Progenitors had, &amp; his Progenitors had no more originally then by conſent was given them: therefore the difference between Kings by inheritance, and Kings by election, in this caſe is not much. And for Conqueſt, that onely ſettles former right, or makes way to ſome farther agreement, to adde to, what was former. The right comes not from power to conquer, or act of conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but from ſome agreement, precedent, or conſequent.</p>
               <p>He further argues, <hi>It is probable indeed that Kings were at firſt by choice here, as elſewhere; but can Conſcience reſt upon ſuch remote probabilities for reſiſtance, or think that firſt election will give power againſt Princes that do not claime by it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it but a remote probabilitie that Kings were here firſt by election?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what firſt inveſted ſuch a Family with Regall power, more then another? It muſt be either God from heaven deſigning it, as <hi>David,</hi> or men appointing it,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104280:6"/>
or taken by force: there is no <hi>quartum.</hi> It was not the firſt, and to ſay the third is the right, is an extream wrong to the King. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> meer force can give right, then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is moſt forcible hath right; it muſt therefore be ſomething elſe: what can that be but the conſent of people to ſuch a family? which is in effect all one with election. You may give it what name you will, it is not therefore a remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, but a neere certaintie, that even here Kings were at firſt either by choice, or by that which in effect is all one.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſayes, that <hi>Kings of England doe not claime their right by election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>It may be they uſe not that word; but if the Doctor ſhall preſume to diſpute their claime for them, and think to get a better and ſurer claime then the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of people, that the Regall power ſhall be in ſuch a family, ſurely he will have no thanks for his labour. Let him take heed of this. Although he is pleaſed to call Election <hi>a ſlender plea,</hi> yet I beleeve he cannot bring a ſtronger.</p>

                  <hi>He is at his place in</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>againe, with the abſolute Monarchy of Romane Emperours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath been anſwered againe and againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next thing he diſcuſſes is the covenant the King enters into, and the oath he takes. And here he tels us our Kings are Kings before they enter into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or take this Oath.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>Although they be Kings before they perſonally do covenant or ſweare, yet their right comes in by their Progenitors, who had their right conferred upon them by ſome agreement or other: ſo that they have covenanted in them.</p>

                  <hi>But this clauſe in the covenant or oath is not expreſſed, that in caſe he will not diſcharge his truſt, it ſhall be lawfull to reſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not ſtand ſo much upon the oath that every King takes, as upon the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall agreement between people &amp; King, whereby this power was conferred firſt upon ſuch a family, and for that we ſay that no more power was conferred then was done by vertue of that agreement; and why there ſhould not be the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Covenant between a Countrey and a Family in matters of ſo high a nature, as there is in other Covenants amongſt men, let the Doctor ſhew, or any for him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor confeſſeth, <hi>Page</hi> 16. <hi>line</hi> 21. <hi>That Lawes are for the reſtraint of the power of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at length after the diſcuſſion of the buſineſſe, he tels you that to argue any forfeiture of power by breaking his Covenant, is an inconſequent argument. You muſt beleeve him, becauſe he ſayes ſo: If his bare word will not ſatisfie you, you are like to have nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Yet we would have him and all know, that we do not think that every breach of promiſe, and not performance of covenant in every thing, makes a forfeiture: this indeed were a dangerous conſent. But the queſtion is, Whether no breach of Covenant may poſſibly in any caſe make a forfeiture? We confeſſe our ſelves not willing to diſpute this too farre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He preſently ſeemes to grant that there may be ſome force in the argument in States elective and pactionall, but not in this Kingdome.</hi>

               <p>THis <hi>Section</hi> is ſpent in the argument of meanes of ſafety to a Kingdome in caſe the King ſhould tyrannize; if they might not reſiſt, it ſeemes God hath left them deſtitute of all helpe, they muſt needs periſh.</p>
               <p>To this he firſt anſwers, <hi>That is the ſame argument that it uſed for the Popes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of, or depoſing Princes in caſe of Hereſie, otherwiſe the Church hath no meanes to preſerve it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The good of a Church is ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Anſ</note> and God hath given it ſpirituall means enough to preſerve its ſpirituall good, although there be no ſuch power of the Pope over Princes, and we know the Church was preſerved and flouriſhed in ſpirituall beautie when there was neither Pope nor Prince to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>But the good of a Kingdom is civill and naturall, therefore it muſt have civill and naturall meanes to preſerve it ſelfe by in caſe of danger. Hence then although it be no argument that Popes may by power of Armes curb Kings, and becauſe elſe the good of the Church cannot be preſerved, yet it may be a good argument the people may in ſome caſe take up Arms to defend themſelves againſt violence, although the King gives not his conſent, becauſe otherwiſe the civill and naturall good of men in a Kingdome cannot be preſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond thing he ſayes is, What meanes of ſafety had the Chriſtians in and after the Apoſtles times?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God called them then to ſuffer; for they were not the State; though many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men that are not a State, may eaſily be brought into ſuch a condition as they have no meanes for ſafety, but they muſt needs ſuffer; and ſo many States, when the externall violence is too ſtrong for them; but when God and nature gives them meanes of deliverance, there is no neceſſitie they ſhould periſh. When the Doctor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves reſiſtance better, wee will either fly or ſuffer.</p>
               <p>As for the Chriſtians why they could not reſiſt, the Dr. ſpeakes of a reaſon that he ſeemes to be ſatisfied in, becauſe things were ſo enacted by Law, therefore they could not reſiſt: therefore he leaves their example, as invalid in our caſe, and ſo it were well that every one elſe would leave off urging, that we may never heare of the example of the Chriſtians in the primitive times applyed to our caſe more: For though it ſeems to be ſomething at firſt view, yet it is nothing when it is examined.</p>
               <p>But then he ſayes, <hi>The Edicts that concerned others were Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Anſwer hath been already, either the people then gave up their whole right to their Emperours, which we have not done to our Kings,<note place="margin">Anſ</note> or otherwiſe they were not bound to their Arbitrary government, but might have reſiſted for their own preſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if Parliaments ſhould degenerate and grow tyrannicall, what meanes of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could there be for a State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe the condition of ſuch a State would be very dangerous and like to come to confuſion; particular men could not help themſelves,<note place="margin">Anſ</note> and the whole State ought to ſuffer much before it ſhould helpe it ſelfe by any wayes of reſiſting: but if you can
<pb facs="tcp:104280:7"/>
ſuppoſe a Parliament ſo far to degenerate, as they ſhould all conſpire together with the King to deſtroy the Kingdome, and to poſſeſſe the lands and riches of the Kingdome themſelves, in this caſe whether a Law of Nature would not allow of ſtanding up to defend our ſelves, yea to re-aſſume the power given to them, to diſcharge them of that power they had, and ſet up ſome other, I leave to the light of nature to judge.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, this cannot be, becauſe the higher powers muſt not be reſiſted by an<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>This is not properly to reſiſt the power, but to diſcharge the power, to ſet the power elſewhere. The ſervant doth not reſiſt the power of his Maſter, when he upon juſt grounds leaves him, and goes to another, if he be ſuch a Maſter, as is his Maſter by his owne choice, for ſuch and ſuch ends and purpoſes, and had his power limited by agreement.</p>
               <p>I know this will be cryed out of as of dangerous conſequence, wherefore God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us (as I hope he will) for ever making uſe of ſuch a principle.</p>
               <p>It is hard to conceive it poſſible that a Parliament can ſo degenerate, as to make our condition more grievous by unjuſt acts, then it would be if the power in a Kingdom ſhould returne to the law of nature, from whence at firſt it roſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Divers lines together after the objection from want of ſafety in caſe of degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Parliament, be ſpends in commending the temper of our government in the three Eſtates, with complaints of ſome diſtemper for the preſent.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>If there were ſo many of a contrary judgement more then the others, why doe they not come and out-vote them in what things are amiſſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This addes much validitie in common reaſon to what they determine, that they are alwaies a competent number, allowable by Law to be Houſes of Parliament, and they debate and determine things in ſuch an Aſſembly that is open for ſo many, which all the Countreys and Cities in the Kingdom have choſen, to come to debate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict as they think fit. Such determinations, although I doe not ſay they ſhould be accounted infallible, yet they carry with them more likely reaſon, then thoſe who are carried by a few in ſome ſecret way.</p>
               <p>Further, why ſhould ſuch an Objection be made againſt the Houſes of Parliament, that no Court of Juſtice, no Societie that carry things by Vote, will admit, if it be once ſet? that in ſuch Aſſemblies there ſhall be ſo many at the leaſt, there may be three times more, yet ſo many makes up the Aſſembly, ſo as to enable it to ſuch and ſuch purpoſes.

               <p>He proceeds to ſhew the difference between the Low-Countreys and us, which no queſtion is ſomething, but not ſo as can make what they have done lawfull, and yet the Doctors tenets right, nor what we have done unlawfull.</p>

               <p>He ſtill takes abuſe of his power to be the doing whatſoever he pleaſe: we denie that to be abuſe of his power. We ſay in that he doth not exerciſe his authorative power at all, therefore he doth not abuſe it. If indeed ſome uniuſt Law ſhould give him any power to do wrong, the execution of this would be the abuſe of his power, and therein it is granted a true informed conſcience would rather ſuffer then reſiſt. But in the other caſe, when he doth what Law inables not to do, all the arguments of the Doctor cannot ſo inform our conſciences, as to beleeve the State muſt rather ſuffer then reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Now the Doctor caſts up his reckoning, and thinks he finds it comes to thus much, that he hath found Scripture and reaſon, ſpeak plainly againſt reſiſting.</p>
               <p>He cries victorie to himſelf, he tels himſelf what the iſſue of his own thoughts come to; but he reckons without his Hoſt, his conqueſt is too haſtie, we are not of his mind.</p>
               <p>I will onely obſerve one thing more in the concluſion of this <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any ſhall be carried away with the name of a Parliament, as Papiſts are with the name of the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Church could do as much in matters of Religion,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> as the Parliament can do in matters of the State, the Papiſts were not ſo much to be blamed for being taken
<pb facs="tcp:104280:8"/>
ſo much with the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> as as we are not for being taken ſo much with the name of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. The Church cannot make new Articles of Faith, or nullifie the old; but the Parliament can make new Maximes to be accounted Law, that were not before, and undoe what were before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church hath not a judiciall power of interpreting the Law of God, but the Parliament hath a judiciall power of interpreting the Law of the State, ſo as that is to be accounted Law, which they interpret to be ſo. I do not ſay that we are bound to beleeve, that whatſoever interpretation they make was the ſcope and intention of that Law when it was firſt made: But this I ſay, that their interpretation muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as much binding to us for obedience, as the ſcope and intention of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that firſt made that Law.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with his Scriptures, and the rationall part of his Book; and I hope others will have done with it too.</p>
               <p>If mens conſciences be ſatisfied in the lawfulneſſe of the thing it ſelf, Subjects ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms againſt the will of the King: His other part, every one who underſtands how things are with us, that is willing to be ſatisfied, will be ſoon able to ſatisfie himſelf. The ſubſtance of all that follows is, ſuppoſe that Subjects may take up Arms? yet whether there be ſufficient cauſe for us to doe it.</p>
               <p>Toward the concluſion of the Book the Dr. begins to be hot, and ſomewhat bitter, but I ſhall not here follow him in particulars, but in the generall thus:</p>
               <p>What the condition of our Kingdom is, whether in danger or not? What the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Houſes of Parliament, whether they be ſafe or not? whether their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges be broke or not? Judge you whether Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> or all the Remonſtrances and Declarations we have had from both Houſes be able beſt to certifie us: we have received information enough, and ſeen and felt enough to make us beleeve that our Kingdom is in great danger: but it may be the Doctor ſits in his ſtudy like another <hi>Archimedis</hi> drawing his lines, and the Swords muſt be about his eares before he will ſee or beleeve any danger towards us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>The Doctor puts the caſe thus, whether the conſcience can be ſo perſwaded, that the King is ſuch and ſo minded, as that there may be ſufficient cauſe to take up Arms againſt him; in this he is as miſerably miſtaken, as in all his other grounds from Scripture, and his reaſons, if he thinks this be the controverſie.</p>
               <p>For 1. we take up no Arms againſt the King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever the Kings mind be, there is ſufficient cauſe to take up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt others that ſeek our ruins. We know of the plots of bringing the Armies in the North upon Parliament and Citie: We know of the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Arms in forreign parts to ſend over hither, and time hath diſcovered their further attempts, although it hath indeed withall diſcovered they could not bring their attempts to their deſired iſſue. We know of many Delinquents that are fled from the Juſtice of the Parliament, which cannot be attached without force; and if they may ſo ſcape as they do, to what purpoſe doth a Parliament ſit? it will ſoon be made ridiculous in the eyes of the world. We know what is done in the execution of the Commiſſion of Array, and that by force of Arms, and all theſe things by thoſe who are under the authoritie of the Houſes of Parliament: wherefore if they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe evils imminent, nor rectifie theſe diſorders extant, but by power added to their authoritie, although there be no ſuch horrible things as the Doctor ſpeaks of, namely, the Kings intentions to ſubvert Religion, and our Laws and Liberties, if the King do but denie to aſſiſt in the delivering us from thoſe danger, not upon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:104280:8"/>
jealouſies feared, but upon certain proofs we know we are in, and in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of ſuch delinquents as juſtice muſt not, our ſafety cannot ſuffer to eſcape, there is cauſe enough to ſatisfie our conſciences in the lawfulneſſe of our taking up Arms. Yea, our proteſtation and duty, though we had never ſo proteſted, binds us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by all our ſtrength the Parliament in this; and in maintaining them, we do not at all prejudice the King in any lawfull power of his.</p>
               <p>This generall is enough to ſatisfie in what is ſaid in the two laſt <hi>Sections</hi>: As for particulars mentioned there, many of them are anſwered alreadie in the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; others being matters of fact, it is more eaſie for any one to anſwer that hath a mind to examine what paſſages have falne out. To go through them particularly I ſhall leave to ſome who have more time to ſpare then I, they are far more eaſie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then what was before, but not ſo profitable, and yet the anſwer would exaſperate more, they are Subjects more ſuteable for Lawyers and Statiſts to treat about then for Divines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore whereas in the concluſion of all, the Doctor deſires thoſe who will run the Hazard of this reſiſtance; firſt to ſet their conſciences before the tribunall of God, and conſider whether they will excuſe them there when they have ſhed blood, to ſay, we ſuppoſed our Prince would change Religion, overthrow liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Doctor, We can comfortably, and will freely and really ſet our conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods tribunall in this caſe, but we will not make that our plea, but we will ſtand thus before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Lord thou who art the ſearcher of our hearts, and our Iudge, thou knoweſt we aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at no hurt to our King, we deſired to live in peace, we according to our ſolemne vow and Proteſtation, have only endeavoured to deliver our Kingdom &amp; Parliament from the rage of ungodly, and violent bloody men, to bring forth the wicked unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to preſerve what thy Maieſtie, what the law of nature, and the Law of the Land hath made our own. If thou wilt pleaſe to call us to ſuffer for thy Name, we hope we ſhall be readie; but becauſe thou telleſt us that it is not the part of a Chriſtian but of an Infidell, not to provide for his family, therefore we have not ſubmitted our ſelves, wives and children to the rage of th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe bloody men: for the ſubſtance of what we have done, it hath been in thy Name, that we may be faithfull to the King, Kingdom, Parliament, and to poſteritie. What failings thou haſt ſeen in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, Lord pardon to us for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
               <p>Thus we are willing to meet the Doctor at Gods Tribunall, but he ſhall not lay our plea for us, we fear he will have enough to do to anſwer for himſelf, yea to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for that Book he hath put forth in ſuch a time as this.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>For a Concluſion of all.</head>
               <p>LEt none think that though we thus iuſtifie taking up Arms, that therfore we are of thoſe that delight in War; God forbid. Our ſouls deſire after peace, we pray for peace, we would gladly lay down our lives. (if we know our own hearts) for peace.</p>
               <p>Lately my name was injuriouſly added to a printed paper, wherein there was a Petition againſt Accommodations: It ſayes I went along with it, whereas I knew nothing at all of it, untill neere a week after it was delivered to the Houſe. Thus are we at the mercy of every malignant ſpirit, if he can get a Printer to aſſiſt him, to be rendred to the world as odious as he pleaſeth. As great an injury I ſuffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in another nature, when a few pieces of a Sermon I preached to young men were gathered together, and patched up with a deale of non-ſenſe, and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their owne as they pleaſed, and then put out as mine. Although we live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men ſet on fire, yet God forbid but we ſhould follow peace: but it muſt be the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not the peace of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:104280:9"/>And the truth is, had the people knowne their liberties before, it is very probable theſe warres would have been prevented. This I am confident hath been the great encouraging, fomenting argument for theſe warres, <hi>If we goe in the name of the King, none will dare to ſtir againſt us; What will they take up Arms to reſiſt their King</hi>? Had they ſeen the weakneſſe of this their Argument, at it is applyed to this buſineſſe in hand, that bloud that hath been ſhed would have been prevented; And if the people of the Land knew the Liberty that God, and Nature, and Law gives them, there would ſoone be an end of theſe Warres; but a few ſuch Doctors at this is, may helpe to prolong them, by dividing the people, and putting them into a maze, comming in ſo plauſible a way to informe Conſcience; whereas in truth he gives no bottome for Conſcience to reſt on, but rather puts it to a ſtand, or rather into a labyrinth.</p>
               <p>There is a neceſſitie that in theſe times peoples Conſciences ſhould be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their liberties in thit caſe then formerly, becauſe the time is (we hope) at hand for the pulling down of Antichriſt, and we find by Scripture this work at firſt will be by the people: <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.2. <hi>The Angel came down from heaven and cryed mightily with a ſtrong voice, Babylon the great is falne, is falne</hi>: And <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>I heard another voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her my people</hi>: ver. 6. <hi>Reward you her as ſhe hath rewarded you</hi>: and ſo to the 9. <hi>ver.</hi> her deſtruction is threatned. Now <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the Text ſayes, <hi>The Kings of the earth who have committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lived deliciouſly with her, ſhall bewaile her, and lament for her, ſaying, Alas, alas.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And the Merchants of thoſe things which were made rich by her, ſhall ſtand weeping and wailing,</hi> ver. 15. All her Proctors, and Commiſſaries, and Chancellors that grew rich by her, they ſhall lament. No marvaile then though ſo many Proctors get together to ſeek for peace upon any terms.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt down, and yet the Kings lament her fall: Who then muſt pull her down but the people? Not that the people can raiſe a War meerly for Religion, but God will ſo order things, that the Papiſts ſhall by their malice be put upon ſuch plots and enterpriſes, that they ſhall make themſelves lyable to the juſtice of the Law, ſo that Kings ſhall have no legall power to reſcue them from it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrates, aſſiſted by the people, ſhall in a juſt way fall upon them, even then when the Kings of the earth and their Merchants ſhall lament them. Hence <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 19.6. the <hi>Hallelujah</hi> that is begun upon the Lord God omnipotents ralgning, is begun by the people, <hi>I heard the voice as of many waters, ſaying, Hallelujah.</hi> Now the Scripture frequently ſets forth the people by <hi>waters,</hi> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.15. <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt, were peoples.</hi> We reade <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.11. where the glory of Chriſt is ſet forth, it begins at the head; but <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1 where the glory of the Church is ſet forth, it begins at the feet, <hi>How beautifull are thy feet?</hi> Surely the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe liberties God hath given people, will much help forward the great things God hath to doe in this latter age.</p>
               <p>This makes me willing to publiſh what help I can in this thing, although I know full well I run the hazard of ſuffering much in it. Let <hi>Babylon</hi> fall, let the Church proſper, it is enough, our lives are not much worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I have ſhewne the Commiſsion of the Lord of Hoſts for warres; I ſhall not yet ceaſe to pray for peace; ſuch a peace as may have as good a Commiſsion from the Prime of Peace as the preſent wars of the Kingdom have from the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which I have done is but as the taking of my pen to write a Letter to a friend; but a little ſtrength is enough to oppoſe a little ſtrength.</hi>
