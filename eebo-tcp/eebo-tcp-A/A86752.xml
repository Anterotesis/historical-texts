            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He former Parlament, as it was the <hi>birth</hi> of abundance of <hi>pangs</hi> and <hi>throws</hi> of State, ſo it ſat down in ſuch a time, and was guided by ſuch a ſpirit, and encountred ſuch accidents, that it was eaſie to foreſee that Providence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them to ſomewhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; And indeed it proved no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for the ſeceſſion of the <hi>King</hi> brought them upon extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Counſel, and in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the unhappy war, there wanted not either prudence or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116380:3"/>
animoſity, which God was pleaſed to ſmile on with happy ſucceſs, and giving in the ſtrength of the Nation into their hands, to put them alſo in a capacity of ſetling our Liberty upon ſo right a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that it ſhould not eaſily again be ſhaken. But as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in all things humane, to be corruptible, ſo it fell out in this great <hi>Body,</hi> (and all Governments may well be ſaid to be artificial men) that though it roſe as a Gyant in the morning, and ran its race ſwiftly before noon, yet ſitting long after, it grew <hi>Chatharrick</hi> and lazy, nay diſeaſed and troubleſome. Hence had it ſo many gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in its own bowels, two or three <hi>Phlebotomies</hi> were ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and the laſt extremity and refuge was taken, which cauſed at length the diſſolution of this aſſembly, which if you will either conſider for the ſtrange mutations within it ſelf, the grand enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes that it happily undertook, the wonderful alterations it hath brought in theſe Nations, (not to mention what influences it may have over all Europe) a man may truly ſay it was one of the moſt famous, fortunate, wiſe Aſſemblies, amidſt ſo many difficulties and perplexities, as ever was.</p>
            <p>Their diſſolution as it afforded much reaſon of thought to the ſpeculative, regret to thoſe related to that Power, and a kind of a bitter joy to the remnant of the malignant party, ſo it proceeded from ſuch reaſons as might certainly in the ſafety and reaſon of State juſtifie the action. For indeed though God was pleaſed to own their Counſels, ſo far as to produce many glorious events from them, yet their power at length like a ſtanding water growing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they declining from their primitive vigour and purity, and withall growing diſtaſteful to the people, who began to perceive with regret that they were unwilling to deliver up their Powers, as they had declared, and was expected, there was an inevitable neceſſity of doing ſomewhat for the publick ſafety. Adde to this, that the <hi>Bill</hi> which they had prepared, was circumſtantiated ſo as gave but very little hopes of bettering the people by that proviſion, and the greatneſs of Liberty that was left in Election, could aſſure us of nothing elſe but hot confuſion, and a deſperate revival of oppreſſed factions.</p>
            <p>But theſe things were upon that occaſion more fully handled by ſeveral pens, who ſufficiently cleared the neceſſity and juſtice of that great alteration, which as it neceſſarily brought the Power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the hands of the Lord General and the Army, (in whom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116380:3"/>
it was effectively before) ſo it put them to a conſiderable debate whither the exerciſe of this Power ſhould be transferred. They ſaw that the people (things ſo ſtanding) were abſolutely uncapable of that Power which was naturally theirs, and that it had been but to put a ſword into a mad-mans hand. They were not willing to change the form of a Commonwealth which they had bought with ſo much blood, and therefore after the fulleſt debate, it was reſolved to diſpoſe the Power into the hands of ſuch ſufficient men, and that for a time, as might with godlineſs, honeſty and ability, diſcharge the Supreme truſt, heal the diſtempers of the Nation, amend the errors of their Predeceſſors, and ſettle the Peace of the Nation upon ſuch a Baſe as ſhould not be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>This number of men meeting together, and being commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Lord General, after a great many <hi>(ſi famae creditur)</hi> inconſiderable debates, voted themſelves a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſo declared themſelves, and began to act accordingly. But it was ſoon ſeen that thoſe great expectations that brought them thither would prove abortive: For <hi>Diviſion,</hi> which is the murthereſs of Councils, appeared very briskly in their very dawn, and there was a party headed, whom nothing could pleaſe, but the wildeſt and moſt extravagant devaſtations poſſible. The main pretence was Religion, or according to <hi>their</hi> odd and fanatick Notions, the ſetting up of the Kingdome of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a conſideration which, though it found acceptation with ſome grave and ſober Inquirers, yet muſt needs be of ſo different a nature from that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from theſe men, that there cannot be two things more diſagreeing. To ſay nothing, that they not agreeing in the grounds of the notion, or the wanner of it, would certainly in their conſequences arrive at the greateſt <hi>Aſustacies,</hi> that it were impoſſible for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to ſupport his ſword in the midſt of ſuch confuſion; Not to mention that ſuch <hi>notions</hi> as theſe, proceeding from ill made brains, and diſturbed fancies, ſtrongly tinctured with an hypocondriack melancholy, not bringing any aſſurance out of the word, or any other ſign that they proceed from the Spirit of light, if they become once Magiſterial, oblige us to quit our <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> our natural <hi>reaſon,</hi> our <hi>experiences</hi> drawn even from common ſenſe, the means God hath ordained to direct us in civil matters, and to follow thoſe <hi>Wills-with-Wiſps,</hi> or <hi>ignes fatui</hi> of <hi>revelation</hi> and pretended <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116380:4"/>From hence I believe it roſe (though I cannot but conceive abundance of conſciencious and diſcreet men joined with them upon other grounds) that they voted none capable of place, who was not <hi>Godly,</hi> a word of that latitude, that it ſignifies all <hi>things to all men,</hi> different religions having brought men into ſuch a high diſtemper, that men do now accuſtome themſelves to reckon it according to what themſelves judge and opinion, not according to the converſation and practice of another; So it was eaſily perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that thoſe Gentlemen that were ſo forward in it, were not without deſign to ſeclude ſuch other as were not of their Cloath. But if we conſider this a little more ſtrictly, we ſhall find that it was neither <hi>Politick,</hi> nor indeed <hi>Rational.</hi> Not <hi>Politick,</hi> ſince all States of the world chooſe ſuch Miniſters as are the moſt fit, though many times of different perſwaſions, provided alwaies they had not ſome outward ſcandal, and were qualified with ſuch abilities as became their employments. For it is not every raw and untutored head that is fit to ſerve in the affairs of a State; Nay in ordinary buſineſs of life, when we want any thing neceſſary, we reſort not to any Tradeſmen, for that they are of ſuch or ſuch an opinion, or ſo or ſo more pragmatical than their Neighbours, but we go where we may find things more convenient and cheap for our purpoſe. Not <hi>Rational,</hi> ſince it forces the partyes <hi>ſuing</hi> to a ſtrange piece of immodeſt <hi>hypocriſy,</hi> to deſire a man to certify of their godlineſs when it may be their own hearts ſting them and tell them the contrary; and ingage the party <hi>certifying</hi> to a ſtrange preſumption, to give teſtimony of a mans heart, which is the ſeat and root of godlineſs, and of a mans actions (and that poſitively, whereas all Laws do onely admit teſtimonies of that nature, nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) whereas many of the moſt horrid Crimes may be committed in the dark, and tis the nature of guilt to avoid as much as ſhe can the eyes of men. But we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of this hereafter, and that upon occaſion of a ſubject that relates more to it.</p>
            <p>This conſideration was of ſuch importance and influence, that it ſeeemed the matrix of many other conſultations, which were very eccentrical to the publick welfare. The <hi>Law</hi> was looked on as a noiſome ruinous building, not capable of repair or alteration, but fit to be pulled down to the very ground. <hi>Propriety</hi> was ſtruck at, nay which is matter of ſad wonder, upon the account of <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116380:4"/>
Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> was to be demoliſhed &amp;c. All which gathering ſtrength and heat in debate, as the ſtirring of the wind increaſes the fire, it came to ſuch a paſs, that without a wild confuſion and devaſtation, ſuch Counſels were not permitted to proceed. And therefore ſince they were ready to pull down the very rafters of our Peace and Liberty, and ſeemed not much to care what they ſet up in ſtead thereof, Thoſe Members whom greater ſobriety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſtrained within ſuch due limits as became ſober Patriots, thoughr it not fit to mingle any more with them, but rather to reſign the Power into the hands from whence they had received it, and by ſuch retirement elude ſuch wild and pernicious Counſels.</p>
            <p>Therefore when they had upon Saturday <hi>Decem.</hi> 10. before, paſt a Vote, which ſtruck at the very root of the Miniſtry, they raiſed not ſmall apprehenſions, that the conſequences thereof might have proved very pernicious.</p>
            <p>Now the buſineſs, to put the Reader in mind, ſtood thus. The Committee for Tythes after a long debate agreed upon a report of ſeveral branches, which they preſented to the Houſe, the firſt whereof was, That ſeveral Commiſſioners ſhould ride through the Nation, in ſix circuits, and joining with other Commiſſioners in the ſeveral Counties, ſhould eject all prophane, ſcandalous, or inſufficient Miniſters, and place able and fit men in their Rooms. This becauſe it intended to uphold the Miniſtry, and that all was not to be laid waſt, and the poor ſouls be either forced againſt their light, to deny their Ordination, or elſe with their wives and families be forced to poverty and famine, ſo that in a little time we ſhould not have ſeen the face of Chriſtianity among us, paſt in the Negative, which with other circumſtances occaſioned ſo much trouble, as we have mentioned before, to the wiſeſt and ableſt men, that they the Monday after declared the incapacity in which they were in to accompliſh thoſe great ends for which they were brought together, And therefore they were reſolved to return their Powers, which with a joint conſent of the major part, ariſing with the Speaker, without any force or compulſion they did, &amp; ſo repairing to White-hall, they reſigned their Authority into the hands that gave it.</p>
            <p>There were indeed a ſmall number (under 40. which was the <hi>Quorum)</hi> who indeed had the zeal, reſolution or indiſcretion (I cannot tell well what to call it) to remain in the Houſe, and refuſed to depart. What their ends of ſtaying there were I know not, they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116380:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pretended it was <hi>to ſeek the Lord,</hi> others, that looked neerer into their actions than they had a mind to be ſeen, ſay it was to raiſe up a faction, for otherwiſe they would not have taken it ſo ill, that Col. <hi>Goff</hi> ſhould deſire them to be gone, for why ſhould they not depart when their Aſſemblie was by reſignation, diſſolved ſince they were but a degree above a Conventicle, and that place famous for the entertainment of ſo many venerable Aſſemblies, was not ſo fit for them as Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now becauſe what we have ſaid is general, and in manner meerly narrative, we ſhall deſcend to thoſe particulars which the Author of the <hi>Narrative</hi> quotes from the mouth of an Honourable Member, as his Reaſons for Reſigning, as alſo take a view of the Gloſſes the <hi>Narrator</hi> puts upon them, with this Remark at the firſt, <hi>that all intereſts are taken in, but the deſpiſed ones of Christ,</hi> which ought not to be let paſs, in regard that this pretence is fundamental with them, and therefore would be a little ſhaken.</p>
            <p>How precious every ſoul is to Chriſt that by Faith and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance lays hold of him, all muſt needs imagine that know what he became and ſuffered for us; Now to become <hi>Christs</hi> is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come humble, patient, meek, long-ſuffering, not to ingage in vain wrangling and abſtruſe theories, which the ſoul only gnaws upon, not feeds on, or hot bickering about opinions, either new or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

This may evidently appear by their common diſcourſes at <hi>Black Fryers,</hi> by their pulling down of <hi>Antichriſt, Forms, Orders, Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and ſetting up the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is in plain terms the plucking up of all <hi>Eccleſiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> policy, ſaying all waſte that they might enter and devour at pleaſure; and it is to be ſuppoſed that theſe men that have ſo much hardieſſe as to make enmity and deteſtation to all kind of Forms, if they could depoſe them, muſt needs ſet up their own, which being ſuch a <hi>Tohu Yahbohu,</hi> what an advantagious alteration it would be, it is eaſy for any man to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For thoſe <hi>Chymaerical</hi> diſcourſes of the <hi>fift Monarchy,</hi> that they as <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould inherit the Earth; that the Kingdome of Chriſt ſhould be ſet up, and all earthly power be broken to pieces like a Potters veſſel, is ſuch a Tenent, as cannot conſiſt with the very being of a civil Magiſtrate. But as it makes them Tyrants, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, Robbers, &amp;c. ſo it gives a fair pretence &amp; colour to any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult whatſoever, when the ulcer is grown ripe enough and fit to break. The paſſages at <hi>Munster</hi> are too known to need here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mention, we ſhall only note this, that as they are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſionate after <hi>Novelties</hi> and <hi>Curioſities,</hi> ſo being of the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſight, and the coarſeſt taſt, they the ſooneſt embrace them be they never ſo ill-favoured, but eſpecially matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> which though falſe, yet aided with a little impoſture, carry a certain dazling awe and ſplendour with them, that the people who are eaſily fired with harangues even in common buſineſſes, enflamed once in matters of Religion, break out like a violent conflagration and deſtroy all before them, but eſpecially, how dangerous it may be not only to the Magiſtrate, but the very peace and being of a people, when theſe <hi>principles,</hi> not only ſimplY oblige their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> to enjoy their own opinion, though it were to undergo perſecution, but their conſciences enforce them to ſeek after tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and domination over the other, as an effect, reward or privilege of their belief.</p>

            <p n="5">5. By drawing all <hi>Politick</hi> debates into matter of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that is confounding them with matters of Divinity, they not only raiſe up an inſupportable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>This is a ſmall part of what might have been obſerved of them ever ſince their firſt riſe; but becauſe my buſineſs concerns only the latter actions of ſome men, and it is a <hi>Topick</hi> of another <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:116380:6"/>
and that I could not attend thoſe admirable Lectures at <hi>Blacks friers,</hi> nor get any perfect account thereof, and for that I would be loath to deliver here any thing I doubted, for certain, I ſhall at the preſent diſmiſs it, ſaying onely this, That <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>ſeditious</hi> men never think they ſpread their nets fairlyer than when their pretences are very high and promiſing, and yet they themſelves pretend to be ſufferers in the attempt. Hence it is, the <hi>Narrator</hi> calls them the <hi>deſpiſed ones of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have touched at a few reaſons why theſe <hi>deſpiſed ones of Christ,</hi> (as they call themſelves) were not, nor ought not to be taken in, and yet that the <hi>deſpiſers of Christ</hi> were taken, which the <hi>Narrator</hi> ſo poſitively denies, we ſhall have occaſion to inſiſt on in its proper place.</p>
            <p>For his excluſive inſtances, that they were not taken in, theſe Gentlemen would be acquainted, that every <hi>Re-publick,</hi> that is to ſay, the Supreme Power in any Government, ought in all <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> to be blind and inflexible, not onely in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding matters between man and man, but alſo in returning to its own immediate ſubjects or Officers ſuch dues or claims as they are juſtly engaged for, and this with the ſame eaſineſs that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man would do that is able, or ſhould otherwiſe be compelled unto it. For bring once a diſtruſt between the Commonwealth and the people, (and diſtruſts in theſe caſes are occaſioned by non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of promiſes) you at once enfeeble their hands, and make their purſes, unleſs it be by compulſion, unſerviceable to you; whereas a gentle way of impoſition, performance of promiſes, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual gratification, makes every private Counter a part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury. And indeed this is a duty incumbent upon every Commonwealth, whoſe main intereſt is meerly to do juſtice; for though her ſpleen by this means may not ſwell ſo mightily, yet the whole body is in better health, fitter for exerciſe and a longer life. And certain it is, that God Almighty ſeems to bleſs moral Juſtice in ſeveral Nations with large felicity and duration. This thought St. <hi>Austine</hi> once had about the continuation of <hi>Rome,</hi> and whether it alſo may not take with the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day, is too nice for my ſcrutiny.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the Commonwealth ought to be ſo rigorous to its ſelf in diſcharging it ſelf not onely to Foreiners of all Compacts and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116380:7"/>
Debts, how much more tender ought it to be in preſerving to its own ſubjects that which is juſtly theirs? For whether it be as was ſaid of old, that man was <hi>naturally</hi> ſociable, or as a learned <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> hath ſaid, that he is <hi>compelled</hi> into <hi>Society</hi> meerly for the advantages and neceſſities of life, certain it is, that admit any man without protection of what he at preſeut enjoies, (unleſs it come to to be determined by Law, which is but the regulation of the force of a Country) and either his next or ſtrongeſt neighbour, if not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, ſhall diſpoſſeſs him, and conſequently there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but warr and confuſion in that place. Now if men in the ſtate of Nature find Propriety a thing ſo ſacred, ſo uſeful, what ſhall we think of Commonwealths, whoſe great deſign it is to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men, that is to ſay, to lead them to that civil happineſs jointly, which they could not arrive at ſingly? how ought they to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this point? for it the wiſeſt States have been ſo careful, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Taxes (which are neceſſary to be paied for the due preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole) ſuch a due Modetation hath been uſed, as that no more ſhould iſſue out of the purſe of the ſubject than ſhould meerly conduce to that End; and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, after the conqueſt of <hi>Perſeus</hi> by <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> out of the Treaſury then gotten freed the people for many years, as not thinking fit the Publick ſhould command a private purſe without eminent neceſſity and danger; It holds <hi>à fortiori,</hi> that taking away particular proprieties is matter of more injuſtice and unſafety in a Politique Body.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how unfitting is it for a Common wealth, without any conſideration or other proviſion at all, to diſpoſſeſs any perſons of their particular lively-hood, whether it be by office or profeſſion, and that without any proviſion at all made for the ſetting up ſomewhat elſe in the ſtead thereof, or to ſay better, reforming of the old?</p>
            <p>Certainly a mans <hi>office</hi> or <hi>profeſſion,</hi> (provided alwayes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts with the publick welfare, and be not oppreſſive to the people) is as much propriety as any other whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Having promiſed thus much, I ſhall now deſcend to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances of the <hi>Narrator,</hi> which when we have peruſed, we ſhall confront with ſomewhat neceſſary to be mentioned about the late change.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> whoſe pay they would have ſtopt, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the paſſing of the <hi>Bill</hi> for <hi>Aſſeſsments,</hi> the <hi>Narrator</hi> ſaies <hi>it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116380:7"/>
was moved indeed</hi> (nay it was highly urged) <hi>in order to the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tax, and in regard of their great eſtates and little hazard and pains, that the chief Officers would ſerve the Commonwealth freely as the Parliament did.</hi> But that this was a meer deſign to diſunite the <hi>Army,</hi> and break them in pieces, and make them odious to the people by Free-quarter, may eaſily appear by their endeavours and diſcourſes of changing Commanders in the Army, or to ſay more properly, advancing men of their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which how dangerous it is to the very being of the three Nations, cannot but be acknowledged, when it is conſidered what a number of Enemies we have to deal with, and that our protection under God lies in their hands, which by this means would be weakned. But as it happens in all civil debate, that ſly and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious factions diſcover not the main at firſt, but endeavour to creep in by inſinuations and plauſible pretences, ſo theſe people would under the pretence of inequality of Taxes abſolutely ſtop the Bill, whereas reformation (if any ſuch needed) might be made in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, and the Souldier not be forced at the preſent to ſtarve, plunder, or disband. As to what they object, of the ſmall pains, and great Eſtates gotten by Commanders, (though ſome have not gotten ſo great Eſtates as they might have done, as may be inſtanced, were it without offence) it ſeems they are very apt to forget the hazards and toyles that theſe men have undergone for that pay, and that even in the midſt of their perils and action how little they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or purſed, and now when the Lord hath honoured them with Triumphs, they muſt in a manner be laid aſide, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their pay, which hath put on (a man would think) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a reward now, rather than an entertainment. Some ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reaſon indeed there had been for this motion, if they had trifled and delayed a warr as is commonly ſeen beyond Seas, and was at firſt practiſed by their Predeceſſors here in <hi>England,</hi> the better to ſalve their own avarice, and to keep their employments a foot. But they behaved themſelves otherwiſe, their courages ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the difficulties and rigours of the coldeſt winters, and in midſt of the bittereſt froſts and ſharpeſt tempeſts they were ſeen, beſieging, skirmiſhing, purſuing and doing all thoſe actions which might be expected in a campagne, ſo that their victories were thick, and the fury of the warres in our bowels ſoon blown over. Their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116380:8"/>
memorable things in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are ſuch, as they have done more than our Monarchs could do in many Centuries of years, and yet theſe men, after all theſe merits, notwithſtanding their pay at the preſent is reduced to the loweſt it reaſonably can, and holds no proportion with the rates eſtabliſhed abroad, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains muſt be taken from them; But it ſeems the Gentlemen that made that objection concerning their great eſtates, did not look upon that part of the wallet which hanged behind their backs, for rhere were many members there, who had eſtates very different from what they had had 15. years ſince, and not a few of them had either one or more offices that might well amount to the pay of a Collonel. But theſe men that are Moles when they are to conſider themſelves, ſee as ſharp as Eagles when they come to ſurvey others. But perhaps they may have ſomewhat of the nature of the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, and coming to be made ſee their own viſages, abhorre them and burſt.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen how well the Narrator hath acquitted himſelf of the firſt particular, we ſhall come now to his ſecond, which is the taking up of the Cavaliers Intereſt in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> which is very diſingenuouſly and maliciouſly interpreted to be a complyance with that party. For Sir <hi>Johns</hi> part, though he were an eager, and ſevere purſuer of the Kings Intereſt, yet if we ſhall look upon his ſinnes and torments, they will not be found very diſproportionable. He hath been ſeveral times brought to the Bar for his life, and he lay many years in priſon, he hath loſt the profit of a very fair eſtate for many years together, though he were comprized in the Articles of <hi>Exceter,</hi> (upon which the <hi>High Court of Justice</hi> would not take away his life) and ought to have been permitted to compound, which he did alſo endeavour, but could never obtain. Certainly there were ſome <hi>Ahabs</hi> at that time, that had a mind to his Vineyard, for otherwiſe he could never have found ſuch ſtrange and diſhonourable oppoſition. Nay even at laſt, when the <hi>Court of Articles</hi> whom the Parliament made in a manner Judges of themſelves (as to relieve in particular caſes, where there might be occaſion by the rigour of ſome general Act) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing the full and large debate of the whole matter, adjudged him within the benefit of the ſaid Articles, the ſame party in the Houſe prevailed to ſuſpend the proceedings of that Court. But that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116380:8"/>
Parlament diſſolving, and the Court proceeding according to their duty, the late Parlament made an Act to confirm their Purchaſes, and that out of a very ſtrange reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the former Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ordered a ſtop, and they did it but to quiet the poſſeſſion to a ſort of Godly Purchaſers, whereas they ſhould have bethought themſelves, that if the former Parlament had done an Act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it was their duty and profeſſion to reverſe it, not to confirm it. Nor indeed can a Parlament, though a Supreme unlimitted Court, enact any thing againſt right Reaſon, or common Juſtice, but it is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, they being truſted with the peoples ſafety, not with their ruin. Nor is that reſtitution <hi>in ſpecie</hi> or value any thing; for what Juſtice can there be to take away an Eſtate due unto a man, and give him another not half ſo good and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or not half ſo much worth? Juſtice is rigorous and extreme, and will be fully ſatisfied, or elſe ſhe is not ſatisfied at all; And though in her puniſhments ſhe may ſometimes turn to injury, yet in diſtribution ſhe loves to be full and exact.</p>
            <p>There can be doubtleſs no one thing makes either a better way for conqueſt in winning a people, not for ſecuring of it by preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their affections, nothing that makes a Commander more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, more aſſures and ſecretly bleſſes the Souldier, than a faithful and an inviolate keeping of promiſe with an enemy. This is it indeed that gives reputation to Armies, &amp; makes them flouriſh, while the hearts of the others tremble. This is that indeed, which as it is the ligament of humane amity, ſo it is the bridle and reſtraint of their enmity, leſt it turn into rage and beſtiality. This all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the moſt civil, to the moſt barbarous, have with all religion obſerved; judgements and plagues upon the breach of it are frequent in all Hiſtory, and yet we that profeſs the high prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, muſt do things, no body knows why, which moſt <hi>Turks</hi> would ſcorn and deteſt. If States will be awanting to perform the faith of their Armies, they muſt either expect to be ſerved by faithleſs men, (for what honeſt man will promiſe that which he ſhall not be in ſome hopes to perform?) or elſe breed ſcorn and deſpair in their enemies, who having men accounted falſe to deal with, will account it their greateſt ſafety to expect none at their hands, and thence chooſe rather to endure deſperate and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſieges, which how dangerous and fatal they have been to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116380:9"/>
many thriving warres, cannot and need not be here exemplified.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>for the removall of the Chancery, and total altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Whether this were not ground enough (had there been none elſe) may be judged from a ſhort conſideration of the Nature of our Laws (as they now ſtand) and a due remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what happineſs and ſecurity our Predeceſſors enjoyed under them. The Law of <hi>England</hi> (as it now ſtands) is either Statute Law, Common Law, or Cuſtome, Statute Law is but the edict of the Supreme Magiſtrate, commanding or forbidding this or that thing; This relates either to the Government of the State in general, preventing or redreſſing particular crimes, or making ſuch due redreſſes, as cannot be made by the ordinary conſtitution of Government. The Common Law is <hi>recta ratio,</hi> in the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Justum</hi> between parties, holy and inviolable as the Laws of Nature and Reaſon, and though running in a municipal chanel, yet as old and venerable as Reaſon it ſelf, which it is, onely redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to practice, and as unalterable, ſince Reaſon, under never ſo many ſhapes, is ſtill the ſame; though in ſome circumſtances and proceedings there may be juſt cauſe of alteration. Cuſtome is the particular uſage in ſuch a Liberty, place or manner, different, not contrary from either, ſubordinate to both; How theſe men may contemplate a better eſtabliſhment, is a matter which as yet I ſee not any ſearch ſatisfied with, and till they produce a better, I ſhall <hi>acquieſce</hi> in not raiſing objections againſt what I ſee not how I can rationally object. But under this Law (the forms whereof have altered according to the Conſtitutions of the ſeveral Governments) have we flouriſhed ever ſince we have been a people, and ſome men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abilities and leiſure have ſo amply made it appear, as well to its conſtitution, uſe and end, that I ſhall not interpoſe with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men, but refer to their own mouths.</p>
            <p>Now ſince it is the weakneſs, or incapacity of men, that they can provide no Law againſt all emergences and contingences, and that the wickedneſs of humane nature is too ſubtil for the moſt cautious and ſevereſt preventive Juſtice, there will follow a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in caſe of frauds, concealments, ſurpriſes, cheats, and the other effects of vulgar wickedneſs, to appeal to the conſcience of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that in ſeveral particular caſes there is occaſion of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116380:9"/>
relief, yet ſuch, as by onely mitigating the rigour of the poſitive Law, may relieve the ſubject, without making a general Law, for otherwiſe, Laws would become innumerable. And if we complain of the number of Laws at preſent, and thoſe made upon general reſultances, we ſhould certainly find them inſufferable, if they once came to be formed out of particular caſes. Now this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Commonwealth (as I may call it) being as it were depoſited with the Great Seal in the Chancery, is not onely that which relieves and benefits the ſeverity and rigour of the Common Law, but is indeed the womb of all our Laws and Proceedings. which muſt neceſſarily ſtop and ſuſpend, upon the taking away of that High Court. Not but in the practice of the Court (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Court of Equity, cannot be ſo ſtrictly bound up as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law) there may happen very many delaies and foul practices; but it is a very great error in men to argue from the abuſe of a thing, againſt the being and conſtitution of the thing it ſelf; as if a man ought to be murthered, becauſe he hath a diſeaſe, and ſhould be put out of pain. But the conſtitution of the Court, (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as to exceſs of Fees, and corruption of practice might be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died) is ſuch, as without an invaluable damage to the greateſt part of the ſubjects, cannot be altered, and ſome of late have ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly conſidered, that I ſhall ſay no more of it in this place.</p>
            <p>For the profeſſion or the Law, however it now become to be looked a ſquint at, yet it is that which hath been, not onely highly reverenced by our own Anceſtors, but was the common road of advancement and honour in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> And if we obſerve, in this Nation the Profeſſors of it have found Gods bleſſing very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently fall down upon them. How many great and noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are there that flouriſh to this day, nay very few of them, as hath been obſerved by a great man, have dyed without children or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate? Nor indeed wants there not ſome reaſon of it; for being commonly the choiceſt men, culled out of the Gentry, brought up under the beſt education, ariving at the capacity of their profeſſion, with long time, ſtudy, charge and experience, 'tis no wonder, if becoming the ableſt men for the ſervice of their Country, wealth and advancement wait on them; and what an equitable thing it is, for to diſpoyl a man of his Profeſſion, when he hath ſpent his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116380:10"/>
portion or fortune (the ſtudy of the Law being ſo chargeable and ſo tedious, for I dare ſay, it coſts moſt men 1000l. before they receive 10 s.) and what a diſcouragement it will be to all worthy education, may be judged by any man, that calls his Senſe and Reaſon, not his Humour, into Counſel.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth is about matters of Preſentations, which that party had voted a way from their Proprietors. This the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber party of the Houſe, not unjuſtly apprehended to be a dangerous aſſault upon Propriety it ſelf, and therefore gave it as one of their inducements of reſigning their Power. This ſaies the Narrator, <hi>takes in the corrupt Gentry, and is a fair bait for perſons of all ſorts.</hi> We have ſaid before how much it concerns the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as a party to do juſtice to all men, not onely by ſatisfying her own engagements, but in preſerving to every man what he is already poſſeſſed of. Now if Advowſons be not matter of right, I know not what is, and if he to whom juſtice is to be done be not to be looked upon whether he be good or bad, honeſt or corrupt, but whether his claim to ſuch or ſuch a thing be equitable or no, I ſee no reaſon, why the Gentry, for being ſuggeſted onely to be corrupt, ſhould be deprived of that which is ſo juſtly theirs. Tis true indeed, that as was prudently profered, it were not amiſs to ſet up ſome way, where by there might be a ſcrutiny made into the qualities and fitneſs of the perſons preſented, but inſtead of an accidental inconvenience, to run upon a poſitive and abſolute miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, is me thinks but a ſtrange way of caution. For ſuppoſe Preſentations of private perſons were taken away, either the Church doors muſt be ſhut up, or elſe it muſt devolve into ſome higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is more inconvenient than the former. For men of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſet at diſtance cannot ſo particularly look into the lives and humours of men, But receiving only ſome ſlender Certificates, or the report of ſome trivial examination, paſs it for the moſt part, <hi>(pro forma)</hi> upon him who hath the firſt intelligence, the beſt horſe, or ſureſt friends. Whereas men of the Country have neerer occaſions of Trial and inſpection, and for the moſt part, even for their own Intereſt, chooſe the ableſt men, which the others cannot be ſo careful of, or are not ſo much concerned in. I rather mention this, for that it hath been obſerved by a grave perſon, that even the Univerſities, between whom by the Statute of <hi>Jac.</hi> the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116380:10"/>
of all Papiſts are divided, Preſent for the moſt part very haſtily and unadviſedly, without either conſidering their own right, or the value of the Perſon; Nay not ſeldome, preferre the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and droniſh fellows on purpoſe to be rid of them. But this was but a limb of the main deſign, and here they dealt like the Fox in the fable, that firſt deſired to put his foot in, that he might indeed afterwards bring in his head and his whole body. For if the right of Preſentations had once been taken away, the next buſineſs we ſhould have heard on, would have been Impropriations, then all other Tythes, and after that conſequently the Miniſtry, and for ought any man knows, private Eſtates; How dangerous theſe men are, may by this eaſily be ſeen, and what fine Concluſion will follow ſuch Propoſitions of theirs if they were but ſuffered to run on. So that the Narrator hath little reaſon to ſay, that this is to take in the corrupt Gentry, and that tis a bait for all ſorts, when, as we ſaid before, tis a preventive piece of Juſtice, and perſons of all ſorts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may come in time to be miſerably concerned in conſultations ſo heady and dangerous.</p>
            <p>For the buſineſs of Tythes, which have gained this Poſt, had been the next they had taken, though I cannot for my part vote with them who ſay they are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> yet as to the <hi>Jus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum,</hi> and the propriety of them, that great Ornament of our Nation, Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> ſome years ſince, and ſome learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the long robe, who had occaſion to argue it before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte for that purpoſe, have ſo demonſtrated, that he muſt either be very unintelligent or pervicatious, that remains unſatisfied. And therefore what a confuſion it would bring to diveſt Proprietors of what was legally their either by diſcent or purchaſe, and how it is more Antichriſtian to pay tythes, when once eſtabliſhed by Law, than to pay a Fee-farm, I ſee not, and what a preſent way it were to ſilence the whole Miniſtry a ſhort experience would teach. Nor is it leſs ſtrange that deſigns aiming at ſo much confuſſion ſhould be ſo cunningly and orderly laid.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, for the Vote of the Miniſters, which we have touched at before, It is that which they ſeemed moſt to ſtand on. That <hi>it was thought a way to eſtabliſh a national Parochial Miniſtry, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Popiſh names of</hi> Parſons, Vicars <hi>and</hi> Curates, <hi>and alſo that oppreſſive burden of Tythes, that it looked rather like making up
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116380:11"/>
a breach in the Kingdome of Anti-christ, than pulling it down.</hi> By this you clearly ſee,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that all form of Miniſtry is here damned as Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>Secondly, upon theſe grounds, the Miniſtry muſt be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is a breach m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de for all men, never ſo unfit or uncapable, to undertake that great and weighty work; for if they pretend but <hi>to be anointed for the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> (the Narrator bringing no touch-ſtone) they muſt be received.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there will ariſe innumerable contradiction, quarrels without end, and Religion ſhall periſh by her own Diviſions. For my part, as I hold conſcience too ſacred a part, (being as a man may ſay, Deputy-Judge within us) to receive any force, ſo, in ſome particular Truths, when they are violently apparent, it cannot without repugnancy and reluctancy diſobey; nor do I know any that neerer concerns her, than obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate, in matters purely Civil. Now whereas there are two Calls to the Miniſtry, the Call and touch of the Spirit within, and the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from without, though it cannot be ſaid that every man of the ſecond qualification is of the firſt, yet in regard that mens faiths are ſeen by their works and lives, and that for orders ſake, the abilities of every man for imployment ſhould be examined, it is but neceſſary and convenient, that there ſhould be an outward and viſible way of calling and admitting unto the Miniſtry. For Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, (which in the main, though not in circumſtantials, ought as neer as could be to be preſerved) hereby ſtands not in ſo much danger, and Peace and Diſcipline the better flouriſh. Not that any man will ſay, a man is the more a Miniſter for the Impoſition of hands, but that it is meerly a Civil ſanction and admiſſion for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſake. And therefore, it is a wonder, why theſe men ſhould ſcruple ſo much at theſe names of Parſons, Vicars and Curats, when they are impoſed meetly by the Municipal Laws of the Country, and relate not to the perſon, but to the maintenance of the man, all theſe three being one Miniſter ſeverally endowed. If this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign could have come to paſs, the good men of the Univerſities might have ſhut up their ſtudy-doors, and have gone to plow, for the next buſineſs we ſhould have heard of, ſhould have been, the words Maſter, Warden, Principal, Preſident, Provoſts, &amp;c. had been alſo Antichriſtian, and the Univerſities, as part of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116380:11"/>
be pulled down, learning which is the root of Civility root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up from amongſt, and Gotthiſh Barbariſm and Tyranny ſuffered to over-maſter us, and all this under that horrible pretence of that pure divine and ineffable Spirit to which men would entitle their own particular humours and imaginations, a courſe ſo horrid in it ſelf that I cannot but ſhrink at it, ſo uncertain that there is no rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on it, ſo dangerous, that it may introduce all confuſion that mankind is capable of. Not but that I believe that God to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones frequently ſheds the rayes of that heavenly Sun, but then they work ſweetly and ſtrongly and in order, and bring forth effects quite contrary to thoſe as muſt neceſſarily follow ſuch pretenſions as we have touched at, theſe being onely mutual flames between God and the ſoul, whereas in Civil things, he leaves us to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſenſe, experience, and the judgement of our reaſon.</p>
            <p>For that which the <hi>Narrator profeſſes of the ſincerity of their Hearts, and the building up of</hi> Sion, I have not much to ſay, if by <hi>Sion,</hi> he mean the fift Monarchy which we have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and for the ſincerity of a mans intentions, when his actions muſt needs centre clearly contrary, is a buſineſs that I underſtand not. Nor can I much agree with him in his laſt obſervation, <hi>That the difference never began to appear ſo effectually in the Houſe, as it did upon ſeeking the Lord, and bringing Bibles in their hands.</hi> What their intentions were I know not, and for the buſineſs it ſelf ſhall not much diſpute it, but only ſay thus much, that if theſe were pretenſions the better to carry on their deſigns, and to engage ſome of the more inconſiderate, there was Hypocriſie enough in it; If they were really intended, it ſeemed they were anſwered but with very unlikely returns; what or whether any members were convinced by ſuch means or no, I cannot tell, nor liſt to enquire. For ſince they are reduced to their firſt matter, I am very willing to ſhake hands with them and bid them farewel.</p>
            <p>They being thus diſſolved, and conſequently the Commonwealth left without tuition, the Power being abſolutely and viſibly in the Army, and the condition of the Nation being ſuch, as that it was neither timely nor convenient to call a Parliament, it was moved to the Lord General both by ſeveral good men, intereſted in the Nation, and Officers of the Army, to aſſume the protection of the three Nations. This burden for the good of them was he willing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116380:12"/>
to undertake, hath received and may it proſper. So that now the Government is eſtabliſhed in a <hi>Lord Protector</hi> and <hi>Triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> as may appear by <hi>a form of Government,</hi> &amp;c. and will in all probability with the mercy of God, conduce to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the quiet and proſperity of this people. But becauſe ſome men may be unſatisfied with the preſent conſtitution, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ſpleen and ignorance make objections againſt it, I ſhall before I take leave of the Reader, fix onely a remark or two; for to ſay all things, and anſwer all objections, muſt be the work of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume and a pen more able.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider how impolitick and dangerous a thing it is for to have a Supreme Legiſlative Power alwayes ſitting, and exerciſing it ſelf. For ſuch great Aſſemblies, like high Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſhould be uſed very ſeldome, or but upon great extremity, otherwiſe they loſe not onely their vertue and vigour; but grow dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and contemptible. Beſides, Aſſemblies of this nature are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make Laws, not to execute them, for being unlimited, they are not ſo fit to judge as inferiour Courts; nor is it reaſon to take away without evident neceſſity from any man, the benefit of the Laws already eſtabliſhed. It is to be added, that the ends of their Calling being principally two, the making of Laws, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Taxes, it is impoſſible to imagine any Nation can be ſo conſtantly and perpetually vicious or ill-ſetled, as to need a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual making of Laws, or ſo wealthy as to be able continually to be Cajol'd into Taxes. Neither is it impoſſible, that men coming to know one another, may make factions; nay, do many exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to keep their Power in exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The Government of a Nation may without force or noiſe be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferred from hand to hand, and the Publick Peace ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whereas if the force of a Nation come once to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within it ſelf, there follows no ſmall danger, if not abſolute ruin to the whole. And therefore 'tis more prudence in any Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to comply with ſuch changes and variations, than by endeavouring the re-eſtabliſhment of the old, or ſetting up of a third to tear the body of the Nation in pieces, by intereſting the ſword in ſuch dangerous diviſions.</p>
            <p>And if a Swallow fall not to the ground without the will of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> we may well ſay, that the mutations of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:116380:12"/>
(which are of ſo vaſt and large concernment to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) muſt have much more of his particular will in it, which when he declares by viſible ſucceſſes, revolutions above the reach of man, and the effects which could not have been produced by any humane Power, it were a ſtrange ſtubborneſs not to comply with them, ſince, as his will is ſecret to himſelf, and above the ſearch of man, ſo his Power is ſuch, that he, who is in his hands, as clay in the hands of the Potter, is not able to ſtand before him. For he ſaid very truly that uttered this, <hi>In ſe ſpuit, qui ſpuit adverſus Olympum.</hi>
