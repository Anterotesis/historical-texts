            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>HEre is an antient Latine Poet contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid;</hi> who bore an high eſteem in that pure age, when the greateſt Wits flouriſh'd, and Poetry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the ſevereſt Judges, ſuch as would not allow of a mediocrity in that Art. His ſtyle is every where conciſe, chaſt, and florid. I cannot any way better match it, then to ſay it may come into compariſon with a Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique of <hi>Virgil:</hi> it treats near upon the ſame ſubject, and amounts to the ſame quantity, or thereabouts, for the number of Verſes. In this compariſon, I would not be thought to depreſſe <hi>Virgil,</hi> for whom I have a deſerved eſteem, but to aſſert <hi>Gratius</hi> into a juſt degree of reputation, among thoſe who are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with what Character they ſhould ſet upon this Poet, who hath not been ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary amongſt us; this cenſure I doubt not will be verify'd to them, when they ſhall take the pains to look over the work it ſelf, which is ſo ſmall as it will not require the expence of much leiſure. <hi>Ovid</hi> likewiſe will avouch
<pb facs="tcp:112839:8"/>
the ſame. The laſt Elegy of his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>De Ponto</hi> is an excellent piece, in which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred all the wits of his age: more durably through the Monuments of his laſting verſes, then if they had been inſerted into a Chronicle to have been preſerv'd in the Capitoll. In that Elegy he ranks this Poet with <hi>Virgil.</hi>

            <p>He ſeems indeed to have come neareſt to him preciſely in Age, as it appears, he doth in matter and ſtyle. And I am confident that there is none who are either active or Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but will be entertain'd with his Muſique, or Art: and thoſe accompliſh'd perſons who have wedded both thoſe qualities ſo rarely competible in one breſt, will be throughly ſenſible of the Harmony of his Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Yet particularly this matter ſeems to be proportion'd to the ſpirits of youth.

Theſe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from thoſe years of purity; and the inſenſible corruption which flows from them would be ſtopp'd. Others enflame the hot ſpirits of young men with roving ambition, love of War, and ſeeds of anger. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Hunting neither remits the mind to ſloth and ſoftneſſe, nor (if it be us'd with moderation) hardens it to inhumanity; but rather enclines men to acquaintance and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe. It is no ſmall advantage to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd to bear hunger, thirſt and wearineſſe from ones Child-hood, to take up a timely habit of quitting ones bed early, and loving to ſit faſt upon a horſe. What innocent and naturall delights are they, when he ſeeth the day breaking forth, thoſe bluſhes and Roſes which Poets and Writers of Romances onely paint, but the Huntſman truly courts? when he heareth the chirping of ſmal birds pearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their dewie boughs, when hedraws in that fragrancy of the Paſtures and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air? How jolly is his ſpirit when he ſuffers it to be imported with the noyſe of Bugle Hornes, and the Baying of Hounds, which leap up and play round about him!
<pb facs="tcp:112839:9"/>
Nothing does more recreate the mind, ſtrengthen the limbs, whet the ſtomack, and clear up the ſpirit when it is overcaſt with gloomy cares, from whence it comes, that theſe delights have merited to be in eſteem in all Ages, and even amongſt barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their Lords, Princes, and higheſt Potentates. Then it is admirable to obſerve the naturall inſtinct of enmity and cunning, whereby one beaſt being as it were confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with man, by whom he is maintain'd, ſerves him in his deſignes upon others. A cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mind is exceedingly ſatisfy'd to ſee the game fly before him, and after that hath withdrawn it ſelfe from his ſight, to ſee the whole line where it hath paſs'd over with all the doublings and croſs-works which the amazed beaſt hath made, recover'd again, and all that maze wrought out by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which he holds with Dogs; this is moſt pleaſant, and as it were a maſter-piece of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Magique; Which in this Author is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſet down in great variety. Afterwards what Triumph is there to return with Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Spoiles, having a good title both to his meat and repoſe. Neither muſt it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that herein there is an eſpeciall need to hold a ſtrict reine over our affections, that
<pb facs="tcp:112839:9"/>
this pleaſure, which is allowable in its ſeaſon, may not entrench upon other domeſticall affairs. We muſt conſider, that it waſts much time, and although it have its own praiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an honeſt recreation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exerciſe; yet it is not of the nobleſt parts of life. There is great danger leſt wee bee tranſported with this paſtime, and ſo our ſelves grow wild, haunting the Woods till wee reſemble the Beaſts which are Citizens of them, and by continual converſation with dogs become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together addicted to Slaughter and Carnage, which is wholly diſhonorable, being a ſervile employment. For as it is the priviledge of man, who is endued with reaſon, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed in the Law of his Creation to ſubdue the Beaſts of the field, ſo to tyrannize over them is plainly brutiſh.</p>
            <p>In reading this preſent Poet, thoſe which have a favour to Hunting will be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to ſee both the Hiſtory and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of it. <hi>Xenophon</hi> hath indeed deſcrib'd the manner of the Greek Hunting: and <hi>Oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> about two Ages after our Poet hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Poem expreſly of this Art, being a great imitator of <hi>Gratius,</hi> as is obſerved by <hi>Vlitius,</hi> who hath likewiſe promis'd to illuſtrate with notes the whole Cycle of the Greek Cynege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb facs="tcp:112839:10"/>
Authours. Now thoſe which are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Artiſans doe not content themſelves that they have attain'd to ſo great perfection in their Art, but are extreamly pleas'd to look back and reflect upon the periods and ſteps whereby that Art hath made its graduall progreſſe; if perchance by comparing the former with the latter even the preſent ſtate of it may be advanc'd. Neither will this be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered only out of writings, it may be much clear'd if we reſort to divers <hi>Baſſi rilievi</hi> of <hi>Trajans</hi> Pillar. With thoſe things which <hi>Perier</hi> hath recover'd out of other Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties touching the ſame ſubject, on which <hi>P. Bellonius</hi> hath ſubjoyned his learned Notes. For later helps, excellent are the pictures and cutts of that famous Florentine Painter and Sculptor <hi>Antonio Tempeſta:</hi> He hath rarely expreſs'd the Armes and Inſtruments with the Game and ſpoiles, and Boſcage worke, and whatſoever elſe belongs to this Art.</p>
            <p>Here it may not be unfit to advertiſe the Reader, that this book though it was before prais'd for its authority and pureneſſe of that antient age, hath likewiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a new ſong, having been never before printed in <hi>England.</hi> Where one may juſtly wonder what may have
<pb facs="tcp:112839:10"/>
been the occaſion that a polite and claſſicall Poet treating of the whole Method of the Hunting in his own age, ſhould have been ſo long unlook'd into, unregarded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought for in our Land, which is ſo great a Miſtreſſe of Hunting, and no ſmall friend to learning: both which will be allowed us by our unpartiall neighbours; or if any ſhould demurre to allow them unto us, I would uſe onely this demonſtration to evince it to him, and as it were lay it before his eyes by leading him to that multitude of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, Chaſes, and Parks which are all over the Land: And in like manner on the other ſide, to thoſe Illuſtrious Univerſities, Schools and Colledges, where ſumptuous Edifices, &amp; large endowments have been eſtabliſh'd for the encouragement of thoſe who ſet themſelves apart to the ſtudy of Arts, and true Wiſdom, ſurpaſſing any other Nation both in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter. Poſſibly the rareneſſe of <hi>Copy's,</hi> and the little mention which hath been made of him through the ſucceſſion of following writers; was the chief occaſion that we little admir'd what we could hadly have notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But there are now ſome eight years ſince this Author hath been ſet out by <hi>Janus Vlitius</hi> a Dutchman: who although he is not of our
<pb facs="tcp:112839:11"/>
Country, yet gives this account of that which mov'd him, being a man of the gown to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with hunting; that while he was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon publique affairs, he went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country to ſpend one winter, in which hee had leaſure; where hee convers'd with ſome young Gentlemen, in whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny twice a week he hunted all that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſo great content, that the ſeaſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe unpleaſant was paſt, before he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd how it went; here he examin'd the difficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſages of <hi>Xenophon, Gratius,</hi> and <hi>Oppian,</hi> which were beſt reſolv'd by evident experience. In all this wee may ſee that hee own's <hi>England</hi> to have been the School from which he took the dictates of thoſe learned Commentaries.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader be adviſ'd of this piece of Dutch Orthography, that <hi>Vlitius</hi> is a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllable, <hi>Vli—ti -us. Vli</hi> being pronounc'd by v. conſonant as we do the <hi>Vly</hi> or <hi>Fly,</hi> a point at the Mouth of the Texell.</p>

            <p>I cannot ſo readily aſſign what is the cauſe that ſince this ſetting him forth, and ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned notes with him, he hath not yet obtain'd a name amongſt us.

ſollicitudes, by reaſon of our civill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. If this Author were read with ſo due attention and diligent inſpection, into thoſe notes as would give a ſufficient under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his work, it would entertain the Reader with great delight. But we do not love to take much pains. Very few will give themſelves the trouble to look upon large diſquiſitions, and turn upon every occaſion to the latter end of a Book to find them. Wee can ſometimes afford to turn our eye upon ſhort marginall Annotations; becauſe they do leſſe check our careere of reading, and the pleaſure of connecting the ſenſe and matter is not ſo much cool'd.</p>
            <p>In this Edition of <hi>Gratius,</hi> I hope there is yet more done to prepare the Poem, that it may be underſtood with eaſe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of attending to the elegancies in it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubled, then intermitted: by adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Tranſlation in equall confort: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall have pleas'd either thoſe that have an affection to ſee our Language enrich'd with the wit of former ages: or on the other ſide, even thoſe men, whoſe inclinations do rather move to look upon the native beauties of every piece. Such men have the ſenſe of the Author in a ſtrict Metaphraſe; the whole 540. Latine verſes being rendred into a like
<pb facs="tcp:112839:12"/>
number of Engliſh. Whenſoever the matter is obſcure (as it is in many places, by reaſon of unuſuall terms) here is the whole account drawn under the eye; ſo that what was gain'd by reading large diſquiſitions, will be deliver'd in the preciſe ſumme. I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on me the pains, and onely the fruit will extend to all that accept it.</p>
            <p>The work of rendring terms peculiar to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Art out of one Language into another is generally difficult, it muſt be done with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; wee hardly know the terms of moſt Arts even in our Mother-Tongue; but here we muſt find them out in both, and meaſure them carefully together, that they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate. This work is not eaſie; but at other times it is impoſſible to render them proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

an art ſomewhat out of the way, wherein the ſtudious or voluptuous (which two divide the Gentry of moſt nations) are wont to tread: nether is the City at all acquainted with it, ſo that little is ſpoken of it, and leſſe written of it, <hi>Virgil</hi> in the third of the Georgiques compriſes all his Cynegeticall inſtructions in ten verſes; here is therefore matter introduced, differing from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſubjects of writing, ſo that it is farre from juſt occaſion of wonder, if an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary matter do prompt unuſuall notions and tearms.

When the Nobles or Gentry are inform'd which way a herd of Dear paſſeth, giving notice to one another, they make a meeting. Every one brings with him a Croſs-bow or Long-bow, and a bundle of ſtaves. Theſe ſtaves have an Iron ſpike at the Bottom, and their head is boared with a cord drawn
<pb facs="tcp:112839:18"/>
through all of them. Their length is about four foot. Being thus provided, they come to the herd, and there caſting themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout into a large ring, they ſurround the Deer, and then every one of them receives a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtand, and there unbinding his fagot, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obvious enough in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation to obſerve upon what ſlight informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and paſſe very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive ſentences often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſons of others, but generally upon their writings. Yet ſome will be found more equall Judges, who taking an accurate ſurvey of that which comes to them to abide their judgement, do not rely on the uncertaine cenſures of other men, nor are contented with a ſuperficiall view, much leſſe imported by groundleſſe paſſions to detract or flatter; but receive all into a breſt adorn'd with wiſedome and candor, ſo that they are not onely able to praiſe or diſpraiſe thoſe works which fall under their cognizance, but can ſhow what thoſe particular excellencies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112839:49"/>
are which they commend, and where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter onely bold negligence affectation or impertinence, there their ſponge leaves a trace for ever indeleble. The hope I have that ſuch ingenuous critiques are not wanting amongſt us, hath made me employ ſome leiſure in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Gratius</hi> to my Country in this dreſſe, that ſo he may be drawn forth from a double obſcurity; both that of his matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other of his fame. The former hath been made facile by the learned <hi>Ulitius,</hi> who could with more aptneſſe and certainty reduce this Author to his genuine ſenſe, (which ſurely the moſt famous of our late Philologers did not ſo throughly reach) becauſe the perplexity was couch'd onely in this, that the ſubject is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented, and the manner of it ſomewhat antiquated, but otherwiſe the phraſe is cleare candid, and perſpicuous. Then for the latter obſcurity which may ſeeme to bee upon his reputation, that will ſuddenly vaniſh away when his naked worth ſhall appeare; I ſay he may ſeeme obſcure becauſe he is more rarely knowne, then his elegant writings may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, yet it is worthy the noting that no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Authour hath made mention of him, but favorably and with a character of honour.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112839:49"/>
And ſurely a great reaſon that hath ſuppreſt the Fame of this Poet, and ſo long mask'd the beauties of his excellent verſes was, that in his owne Age, the manners of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began immediately to decline, &amp; though there were then growing up the moſt choyce witts, yet they were all ſo farre addicted to eaſe, luxury, and the delights of Rome, that they had little Guſto for Excerciſes of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the entertainements of a Country life. Afterwards in tract of time, thoſe who have moſt flouriſhed in Philology, have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected a Sedentary retirement, ſo that they have not been much acquainted with the ſubject of this Poem, nor ſenſible of the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities in it, through which meanes it hath long layn by as it were out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And now I conceive how hard a thing it will be for a Georgicall Poem to emerge after ſo long privacy. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> have been through many Ages born up by the wings of Univerſal Fame. We beare an early reverence to them, even forc'd from us by the generall teſtimony of uninterrupted Antiquity, rather than form'd in us by our own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their Character is ſo far warranted that they are every where ſafely honor'd by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112839:50"/>
thoſe who cannot render any accompt wherein thoſe excellencies lie which they ſo highly celebrate. I ſhall not think him to ſtand in need of meane authorities to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, neither am I worthy to undertake for him: Onely I ſhall as it were point at ſome particular graces of the Poem which have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected mee, and ſhall not ſpare to diſcover wherin the diſadvantages of Tranſlation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And then why may not this Author, like ſome refulgent ſtarre, after long diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, raiſe up into our Hemiſphere his head incircled with its native luſture? Why may he not find the ſame fate with thoſe Philoſophers, Legislators, and Monarches, who returning from their concealements, obtain'd double Veneration? Or if theſe meaſures of honour may bee thought too ambitiouſly ſtrain'd for the reward of rurall Poeſy, why may hee not like his owne Hart diſcover himſelfe with his head new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frayed and burniſhed, full of luſty vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and renew'd into a vivacious youth? We ſhall doe right to our judgement when we can owne the true perfections of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, though commended unto us by no Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this part he removes ſome ſpecious kinds of Horſes, which though they were deſervedly famous, yet were unfit for this employment, either for want of ſpirit, or weakeneſſe of their bodies, or by reaſon of an untractable ſtubbornneſſe, and fiery mettall. Yet he reflects upon the different Chorogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies

of Countries, and allowes for Cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paines and the light mould horſes of a ſoft hoofe which would be unſerviceable in Rocky and Mountainous tracts of ground. In all this Paragraph our Authour ſhowes his wonted curioſity enumerating the moſt eminent ſorts of Horſes, declaring their courage, manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtrength, and keeping; all which hee reduces to the properties required in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; not omitting the advantages of Colours; and when he drawes to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſinuating himſelfe into the prayſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> crownes his worke with a ſplendid Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which is a monument of gratitude to his owne moſt noble Country.</p>

one to aſſign. Which could it be diſcover'd, ſurely an exact Tranſlator might wave all thoſe inconveniences, and make his work ſo compleat as would give full ſatisfaction to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impartial Judge. I may therfore be thought to have had good reaſon to enquire into it.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever antient Hiſtory is rendred into our Vulgar Language, comes under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of all thoſe that can read Engliſh: but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is not ſufficiently acquainted with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to underſtand it readily: for Arts have their ſeverall periods: Ceremonies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are Nationall, and ſmall Chorographies with the Terriers and Boundaries of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are continually remov'd to and fro. Now thoſe which have not their minds through much reading imprinted with the Scene of things as they ſtood in that Age, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may have great naturall parts, yet are apt to meaſure ſuch Authors by a falſe Rule: expecting from them the perfections of Operations in the preſent road of Arts, and an uniformity with the gallantries that are now in faſhion. But when they miſſe of thoſe expectations, the matter will ſeem obſcure, and ſubject to contempt, although it have its due perſpicuity and accompliſhments. Who can
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112839:59"/>
deſervedly tax our Author becauſe he hath not commended Braſill-wood for the making of Spears? or Sugar-cheſt (as we call it) for the making of neat arrowes? Who could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that hee ſhould praiſe the Iriſh Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound? When as yet thoſe places were not diſcover'd by the Romans, or not ſubdu'd. We read not of Fox-hunting, of Tarriers nor other Verminers in him: Theſe ſports were not yet in requeſt with the world. He hath no reaſon to cry up our good hunting Nags, for at that time it is not likely that the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Brittains did train up running horſes after their Fleet Northern hounds. On the other ſide what delight can we find in the Heathens Canon of fabulous Gods? When he comes to treat of the ſorts of Flax, Linnen, and Tow, who can be affected with this diſcourſe but a Hemp-maſter? and then the Marts for Hemp are ſo much alter'd, partly in that the nature of grounds is in tract of time chang'd, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Planters turn'd, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of places broken off by the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government; and partly in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have loſt their antient limits and names; ſo that who can give a right judgement of thoſe inſtructions but an Antiquary? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are but very few ſo much <hi>Curieux,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:112839:60"/>
that they can break through thoſe double bars of obſcurity; ſince learned men think it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to inform themſelves of thoſe Arts which they call illiberall: and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Artiſans have not uſually much leaſure to employ upon univerſall ſtudies. The ſame difficulty of loſt Topography is very much propagated through this Poem in his aſſigning the particular races both of Dogs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which will therefore merit that in the next Chapter the names of Places throughout the Book be clear'd. It is to be conſider'd likewiſe that our Country is not ſtor'd with thoſe harmfull Beaſts of Venery, the Wolfe and Wild-bore. So that we are not ſenſible of his great Care in the choice and ordering of Spears, nor of his proviſion in ſhowing to ſet Engines, and dig pits which men prize in thoſe Countries where Bears and Lyons with ſuch ravenous Beaſts do abound. Again, we ſeem to have a different end in our hunting, which hath introduc'd a different ſtile of hunting. For in <hi>England</hi> till even now ſince the reſpit of theſe Warrs, there were ſo many Foreſts, Chaſes, and Parks; as were not to be match'd in any Kingdome. Theſe were Vivaries for Beaſts (the deſign of their Lords being to preſerve Game) where they were ſafe, not onely by the Pale, or Wall: but under the protection of many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112839:60"/>
ſevere Laws: as if they had been naturaliz'd, enfranchis'd, and Citizens of our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But now how can we approve thoſe directions of Hunting which propound to themſelves rather Victory then Game? That was the condition of thoſe Countries; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſign'd upon Beaſts of prey: and theſe were look'd upon as Bandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This incongruity to our factions may make an Engliſhman the leſſe diſpos'd to delight in it, unleſſe hee inform himſelf of the diverſe ſorts of Hunting, which are, or have been in uſe abroad; And to this I ſhall deliver ſome helps.

               <p>WHen <hi>Rome</hi> was at her higheſt degree of Glory and Empire, it was the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Lieutenants which were ſet over the ſeverall Nations under their State to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up all the rarities which were in their Provinces; ſome after Victories, ſome by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, others by purchaſe: which were upon ſeverall accounts convey'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> for their ſpoiles were ſent to ſet forth their Triumphs as we may ſee in the Cuts of Trajans Pillar. Again, they did often gratifie their friends in furniſhing them with curioſities for publique ſhow's; thus <hi>Flavian</hi> ſent his brother <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ſeven Scotch dogs to grace a Quaeſtors ſhow, which play'd ſo fiercely upon Beaſts, that the Romans admir'd and thought they were convey'd thither in Iron Grates. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is famous, or rather is and will be to all ages infamous, how <hi>Verres</hi> did ſtrip and rob <hi>Sicily</hi> in the time of his Government. Beſides that the moſt incorrupt Prefects over Countries

muſt needs be inrich'd, what with preſents, and what their revenues furniſh'd to them, whereby they might depart honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly whenſoever they were recall'd home by the Supream commands. So that it muſt needs be that in <hi>Italy,</hi> all the treaſures of the known parts of the Univerſe were to be found. If there were curious Linnen in any remote Country, there it was to be ſeen. If a good race of Dogs in the moſt forreign parts, thither they were tranſmitted. If an excellent horſe were bred in <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Numidia,</hi> or <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it muſt be ſent to <hi>Italy:</hi> So that one may juſtly compare <hi>Italy</hi> to a rich Cabinet ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an univerſall collection of what rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the deſpoyled world could afford. This advantage accrued to them from Inferiour Kings and Commonwealths, as to Land-lords from their Vaſſalls. And there muſt needs ariſe another occaſion to encreaſe their gallantry, for Commerce attends Wealth. And ſurely when they had the World as tributary under their power, which was in the reigne of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> under whom our Author flouriſh'd, how great Commerce muſt that immenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew draw after it!

               <p>THe Hunting us'd by the Ancients in the time of our Author, as appeares by this Poem, was much like that way which is at preſent taken with the Raindeare which is ſeldome hunted at force, or with hounds, but onely drawne after with a blood-hound, and foreſtall'd with Netts and Engines. So did they with all beaſts; and therefore a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:112839:79"/>
Dog is never commended by them for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before hee hath by ſignes diſcover'd where the beaſt lyeth in his layre, as by their drawing ſtiffe our Harbourers are brought to give right judgement. Therefore I doe not finde that they were curious in the Muſiquc of their Hounds, or in a compoſition of their Kennell &amp; pack, either for deepeneſſe or lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſweetneſſe of cry like to us. Their huntſmen were inſtructed to ſhout. <hi>Virgil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Georgiques.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ingentem clamore premes ad retia cervum</hi> So that it was onely with that confuſion to bring the Deere to the Netts laid for him.</p>
               <p>But we comfort our Hounds with loud and couragious cryes and noyſes both of Voyce and Horne, that they may follow over the ſame way that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaw the Hart paſſe, without croſſing or coaſting.</p>
               <p>We have no wild-boares in England, yet it may be thought that heretofore wee had, and did not thinke it convenient to preſerve that Game.

Somewhat will not be unworthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing. In an old Poem printed by <hi>Wynkyn de Worde</hi> (whom I have heard to have been
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112839:79"/>
the ſecond that printed in England) in the yeare of the Incarnation of our Lord 1496. in the reigne of Henry the ſeventh, and all the inſtructions of termes for hunting. Amongſt them are ſett downe theſe Verſes.</p>

there is incredible force and boldneſſe, ſo that they are much ſought for in forreign parts; and the King of <hi>Poland</hi> makes uſe of them in his hunting of great beaſts by force: wherefore it may well be intended of the great fierceneſſe which theſe Dogs have in aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaw them play, they thought them ſo wonderfull violent, as that they muſt needs have been <hi>ferreis caveis advecti.</hi> Or, if it will better fit any other ſort of Dogs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I am only not as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what that other ſort of Dogs is, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing it muſt not be underſtood of the Brittiſh Maſtiffes, which for a long time, even from the age of our Poet, had been no ſtrang and unknown novelty to the <hi>Romans.</hi> From the experience of this countrey that <hi>Semifera proles,</hi> or Whelps that come of the commixture of a Bitch with a Dog-Wolfe is verified, called antiently <hi>Lyciſcae,</hi> and this ill quality they find inherent to that ſort of Dogs, that they can by no way of bringing up be reſtrain'd from preying upon Cattell, by which vice they have merited to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed criminall before they be Whelp'd, and there is a Law in that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Modern Authours who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this ſubject.</head>
               <p>ALthough I were very much experienced in any art, and were apt to conceive a good opinion of my owne ability therein, yet being to publiſh a diſcourſe concerning it, I were oblig'd to inform my ſelfe of what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have formerly propos'd in the ſame matter, as far as may conveniently be attain'd: there are ſome who eſteem it glory to be thought to have declin'd any other helps, but their owne witt, which I ſhould charge upon my ſelfe as negligence. It might have been thought ſufficient that this excellent Author hath come out lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> with the learned notes of <hi>Janus Ulitius;</hi> and although I have not ſince that time found the fame of this Poet to have been much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated amongſt us, with whom hunting is in very high eſteem, yet that judicious commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator hath deſerved very highly of him, and withall infallibly rais'd himſelf a monument of late and laſting honour.</p>
               <p>This learned <hi>Ulitius</hi> hath compar'd our Author with the Latine, and Greek writers which have handled this ſubject <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:112839:84"/>
or toucht upon it: ſo that if I ſhould make that my buſineſſe, it would ſeem that I did <hi>in alienam meſſem falcem mittere.</hi> I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce this Poem to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I finde in the modern, both French and Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The chiefe amongſt the French is <hi>La Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie per Iaques de Foüilloux.</hi> This is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Engliſh by Mr <hi>Turbervill:</hi> it was indeed done into very proper Engliſh with great care and judgement, ſome forty yeares ſince: But now the booke is hardly to bee mett with: That diſcourſe too of Hunting that is in <hi>La Maiſon Ruſtique</hi> is but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of this former. There is another in French who may merit the name of an Author with <hi>Foüilloux</hi> his Contemporary under <hi>Charles</hi> the 9. and that is <hi>Iean de Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan,</hi> who hath written a particular treatiſe of <hi>La chaſse du loup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our language there have been divers old writers, that have delivered rather ſome proper termes for hunting, then that have compiled the Art. I read cited <hi>Sir Triſtram,</hi> and the book of <hi>St. Albans;</hi> I have ſeen <hi>Dame Iulians Bernes doctrine in her book of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> But theſe Authors are not to be procured publickly; as they are indeed of leſſe uſe. I ſet a farre higher eſteem upon a late writer,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:112839:85"/>
many of whoſe works are frequently to be had. <hi>Mr. Gervas Markham</hi> may undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be compared with any of the antients, who have written <hi>de Re Ruſtica,</hi> and if his ſtyle be not ſo pleaſant as that of <hi>Pliny,</hi> yet certainly his experiments are more certain and profitable; he hath reported the fruits of his own experience, as in the whole Cycle of Husbandry accurately; ſo in Cynegetiques excellently. The former French Author, and this Engliſh Maſter of Oeconomicall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, I look upon as fountains: With theſe I have been converſant, that ſo I might draw from experienced men, if they delivered any thing which might more largely explicate that upon which <hi>Gratias</hi> may happen to touch. With this preparation I ſhall in the threefollowing Chapters examine the difficult words, and obſcure paſſages as they lie in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this Poem.
