            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>t me add, this Ark was the terror of the Enemies of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Ark came into the battel, the Philistines
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50589:4"/>
were afraid, and said, What shall become of us? wo to us, for God is come down into the camp, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.9. For indeed this Ark was called Jehovah: When the Ark was to move, there was a cry, (<hi>Num.</hi> 35.) Arise O Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered. In a word, the Ark was a pledge and visible symbole of Gods gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with his people; as long as the Ark was safe, they were safe; as long as the Ark was with them, Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was with them, the token of Gods presence was with them; but when the Ark was taken away, that was a sign that God was gone; his protecting, preserving, comforting presence was gone; and therefore no wonder this good old man was so troubled for fear left the Ark of God should be taken prisoner: I call him a good old man; but many learned men think old <hi>Eli</hi> was not a good man; indeed his fault was great in not punishing his two sons; but surely, surely he was a good man; and there are these two reasons to make it out that old <hi>Eli</hi> was a godly man: The one is this, That he took the punishment of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity so patiently, when young <hi>Samuel</hi> had told him what the Lord had intended against him; It is of the Lord (saith he) let him do what seemeth him good. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He was a good man, as appeareth in the Text, his solicitousness what should become of the Ark, and the trembling of his soul left the Ark of God should miscarry.</p>
            <p>Now before I speak to the point of Doctrine, I must further tell you, that this Ark was a type of Jesus Christs for as God spake by the Ark, and from the Ark, so God speaks to us by Christ. And then secondly the Ark was a type of the Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for as the Ark was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>wo Tables of the Law, so the Church of Christ is a preserver of the Scriptures. Thirdly, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50589:4"/>
Ark was a type of the Ordinances of Christ; for as God did communicate himself to his people by the Ark, so God by his Ordinances doth communicate his counsels, his comforts and his graces unto his people. The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God are <hi>Oraculum,</hi> the speaking-place of God, by which he conveys himself to his people.</p>
            <p>The Text now being thus expounded, there are these two excellent conclusions to be learned from it.</p>
            <p>First, When the Ark of God is in danger to be lost, the people of God have thoughtful heads, and trembling hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That a child of God is more troubled, and more solicitous what shall become of the Ark, than what shall become of his wife and children; or his estate; he lays more to heart the danger the Ark of God is in, than the danger his wife, children and estate is in.</p>
            <p>First, When the Ark of God is in danger to be lost, the people of God have thoughtful heads, and trembling hearts.</p>
            <p>But if I may put this doctrine into a gospel dresse, take the doctrine thus: That when the gospel is in danger of losing, when the Ministry is in danger of losing, when gospel ordinances are in danger of being lost, then the people of God have trembling hearts, and careful and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous heads. I do not say when the Ark is lost, for that was death to old <hi>Eli,</hi> he broke his neck, he was so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when the Ark was lost; it cost the life of old <hi>Eli</hi>'s daughter, <hi>Phineas</hi> wife; when the Ark was taken prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, she took no comfort in her child that was newly born, she regarded it not; they told her a man-child was born, that she had a son; but she regarded it not; for said she, The glory is gone, the glory is departed from Israel. Therefore I do not say, when the ark of God is lost, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50589:5"/>
when it is in danger of losing, when the Gospel is in danger, and the Ordinances of God in danger of being lost, then the people of God have trembling hearts and careful heads.</p>

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e people of God have very much trembled; and there are these reasons for it why the people of God are so much troubled when the ark of God is in danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50589:5"/>First, Because of the love that they beat to the ark of God; as God loveth the gates of <hi>Sion</hi> more than all the dwellings of <hi>Jacob</hi>; so the people of God they love the Gospel, they love the Ordinances, they love the Ministry and the faithful Ministers of Jesus Christ above all other things in the world; and therefore saith <hi>David</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 26.8.) O Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth, and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life. Now you know love stirreth up affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. You have heard me tell the story of <hi>Croesus</hi> young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est son to <hi>Croesus,</hi> who when he saw his father ready to be killed, though he never spake all his life time, yet the very love that he did bear to hs Father, burst the strings of his tongue, and he cryed out, O kill not my father, kill not my Father: Such is the love that the Saints of God have to the ark of God, that it must break forth, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be silent, that they cannot but tremble for fear the ark should miscarry; For <hi>Sions</hi> sake they cannot hold their peace, and for <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rusalems</hi> sake they cannot rest, til the Lord make the righteousness thereof to go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The people of God cannot but be troubled when the ark is danger, because of the interest that they have in the ark of God; Now you know interest stirreth up affection; when a mans own house is on fire, or when another mans house is on fire, as you have had a sad and lamentable accident mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

your h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arts with that providence, and indeed it is not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>orgotten: <hi>How</hi> suddenly may we after we have been feasting, be burnt to ashes? Truly it was a very sad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and ought to be laid to heart. Now interest as I said, stirs up affection; how are they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ffected that have an interest in those that were burned! how are they affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with that sad providence! Why now the peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of God have an interest in God; God is the Heaven of a child of God, God is the portion and inheritance of his people; and when he begins to forsake them, they cannot but grieve and be affected: and so the Ordinances of God they are the Jewels, the Treasures of a Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>stian, and he cannot but be troubled for fear of losing the Ordinances. Iesus Christ is the joy of a Christian, and when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from them, they cannot go and be merry at such a time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The people of God cannot but tremble when the ark of God is in danger, because of them m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>schiefs that are coming upon a Nation when the ark of God is lost; Wo be to that Nation when the ark of God is gone from it. The <hi>Trojans</hi> had the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and they had a tradition, that as long as that Image was preserv'd among them, their City should never be conquered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they kept it in a Tower, and called it <hi>Palladium.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> had a Buckler, and they called it <hi>Anselam,</hi> and they had a tradition, that as long as that Buckler was kept safe, <hi>Rome</hi> should never be taken; and they said that Buckler came down from Heaven. But sure I am, when God is present with a Nation to protect them, where the gospel is preserved in purity in a Nation, that Nation cannot but be safe; but when the ark of God is gone, when the gospel is gone, then the <hi>Palladium,</hi> then the <hi>Ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

say, was not premeditated for this assembly. It must not be denied but that the ark of God is in danger to be lost, and that upon this double account.</p>
            <p>First, In reference to the many sins that are in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Let me tell you, There is not one sin for which God hath taken away the ark from any people, but that sin may be found among us: Did the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> lose the Candlestick because she left her first love? and have not we done so? Did the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> lose the Candlestick? You know the gospel is called the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>stick; and was not the gospel removed from them because of their lukewarmness? And are not we guilty of lukewarmness? Did the people of Israel here lose the Ark because they abhorred the offering of God? and do not we do so? are not the sins of the people of Israel among us? Nay, are not the sins of <hi>Germany</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations among us? and can any man that is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God this day, that considers the unthankfulness, the great prophaneness that there is in the Nation, but must confess, Surely the ark is in danger, and God may justly take it away. I will not make a catalogue of our sins, for that is not my purpose; I might tell you of our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth sins, drunkenness, uncl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>anness, bribery and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; I might tell of our Sanctuary sins, the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sabbaths, and so of all our other sins, of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, unfrui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>fulness; you of this place, sirs, God may well take the ark from you; and indeed, it was the great respect I had to you of this Parish, whom I shall ever own, and praise God for, as long as I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ve breath in me; it was my respect I bear to you, would not let me send you home this morning without a Sermon. Is there any of you of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>is Parish or Congregation, that can say, God

may not justly unchurch you, and take away his Gospel from you? You have had it now in three famous succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Dr. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> and my pains in three or four and twenty years among you: Do not your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences tell you now, that God may justly unchurch you, and take away the power of the Ministry? for I count that an unchurching, when we want the power of the Ministry, a soul-searching Ministry, when we want a faithful Minister to go before us; and that's one reason why we may safely say the Ark of God is in great danger of being lost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have another that I may without prejudice say, and that is the abundance of Popish Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits that are in the midst of us, the growing and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Pop<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>th the danger the Ark of God is in? Consider it in these two particulars briefly.</p>
            <p>First, 'Tis a sign you love not the gospel, if you have no love to the Ark; for had you any love to it, you would be troubled more for the danger the Ark is in, then for any outward danger what ever,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50589:9"/>I have read a remarkable story amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>g the Romans, that when any man was accused for his life, all his friends and relations put on mourning garments; and when he went to answer for his life, all his Kindred and Relations followed him in mourning before the King, therein shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love they bore to his person in danger. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, did you love the Ministry of the Gospel, did you love the Ordinances of Christ, you would all put on mourning garments when they are in danger; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nd because you do not, it is a sign you have no love to the gospel. And then again</p>
            <p>Secondly, Tis a sign you have no interest in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; for interest wil stir up affection; 'tis a sign sirs, you are not concerned in the gospel; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>or if it were your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, you would be affected with it; for I said but even now, it is impossible that those that are concerned in the late lamentable fire, (the like hath not happened in <hi>London</hi> since the Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>-powder got fire near the Tower, when so many houses were blown up by the powder; that was a sad, lamentable time indeed; but since that) the like hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> been seen in <hi>London</hi>; and it is impossible but that those that had interest in it, should be aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>cted with it: You have no interest in God, if you are not troubled at the loss of his presence; you have no interest in Christ, and in the Ministers of Christ, if your hearts tremble not, nor fear at the loss of them. Nay, let me say,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a curse of God pronounced against all those that lay not to heart the afflictions of <hi>Joseph</hi>; give me leave to read to you <hi>Amos</hi> 6.6. Wo to them that are at ease in Zion, that trust in the Mountain of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that put far from them the evil day, that lie upon beds of ivory, that eat the Lambs out of the flock. and dance

            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. The second Use is, To beseech you all; being this day unexpected, it is possible my coming may do much good, it may prove a good providence: Let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you then, that you would declare that you are the people of God in deed and in truth, in following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of old <hi>Eli:</hi> Five things I would perswade you to:</p>
            <p>First, That you would believe that the Gospel is not entailed upon <hi>England; England</hi> hath no Letters Patents for the gospel; the gospel is not perpetual and immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; God took away the ark, and forsook <hi>Shiloh</hi>; God took away the ark not onely from the children of Israel, but took away the Temple, unchurched the Jews, unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>; and we know not how soo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he may unchurch us: I do not know any warrant we have to assure our selves that we shall enjoy the gospel anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>r hundred years. I suppose many here know that I have often told you, God knows how to remove his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick, yet not to destroy it; God will never destroy his Candlesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>k, his Church; but God often removes his Church f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>om one Nation to another; he hath removed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s Church out of the East (for <hi>Greece</hi> was once the most famous Church in the world) this place now the Church is gone from; God knows how to remove his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, though he never breaks and destroys it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would likewise perswade you to this, That <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50589:10"/>
Oh the strange and unheard of ingratitude that is in the Land! but I will say no more of that, because I wil speak nothing but what becomes a sober and peaceable Minister; yet I would have you be perswaded of the great danger the Ark of God is in.</p>

            <p>Wo, wo, the sad, lamentable, and woful condition that we shall be in, if the ark of God be taken; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need sit trembling for fear of the ark.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another thing that I would perswade you to, is this, Not to mourn immoderately neither: I would willingly speak some comfort to you, God onely knows when I shal speak again; and therefore before I leave you, I would not send you home comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The first encouraging argument is this, Because God hath done great things already for this Nation, and I argue like <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Another encouragement of hope is from the abundance of praying people in the Nation: There are many that pray to God night and day, that the ark of God may not be lost; and let me assure you one thing this morning, God never did destroy a praying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming people; when God intends to destroy a Natio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, to take away its ark, he takes away the spirit of prayer from that people; where God continues a spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there God will be present, and there God wil continue his ark; you all know if there had been but ten good men in five Cities, God had spared the five Cities for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>he ten mens lakes. Now through mercy there are many hundreds that fear God in this Natio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50589:11"/>
and that do not give God rest night nor day, but cry to God for mercy on the Nation; and who knows but for their sakes God may continue the Gospel to us?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another ground of comfort is this, and I am much affected with it, God hath dealt with <hi>England</hi> not by way of Rule, but by way of Prerogative: For belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we have had Church and Sermon-sins in the midst of us all along Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the first his dayes; we have also been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Nation, and our Ministers have threatned ruine and destruction upon us from year to year; but God hath hitherto saved <hi>England</hi> by way of Prerogative, though we have those sins among us for which he destroyed other Nations; yet God hath spared us, because he will spare us, according to that Text, <hi>I will be graci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> to whom I will be gracious.</hi> God is not tyed to his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, God may make an exemption; and who knows whether God may not make England an exemption from his common Rule?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another ground of comfort is this, God is now a pouring out his Viols upon Antichrist, and all those Wars that are in Christendom, shall end in the ruine of Antichrist: Observe this, and carry it home with you. I say, God is pouring out his Vials upon the Throne of the Beast, and all those Wars that are in Christendom, shall end in the ruine and destruction of Antichrist, both East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n and Western Antichrist; and though some drops of these Vials may drop upon the Reformed Churches, and they may smart for a while, God may severely punish them; yet it is but for a little while, but the Vials shall all be poured upon Antichrist, there shall it rest, there shall it center; indeed the Lord may chastise his people, and scourge all the Reformed Churches before the Vials be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50589:11"/>
all poured out; I say, God may scourge all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, and a sound of persecution may go through them all, which are called drops of these Vials; but the Vials are intended for Antichrist, and shall all end in the ruine of Antichrist, and in the fall of Babylon, which is ground of great consolation to the people of God; and whatsoever becomes of us, yet our children, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children shall see the issue of these Vials poured out at last upon the Whore of Babylon, to the ruine of Antichrist and all his adherents.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, to draw to a conclusion; I am to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you all to contribute your utmost endeavours to keep the ark of God from being lost. Now here I should shew you what the Magistrates must do to keep the ark from being carryed into captivity, and what the Ministers must do, and what the people should do.</p>
            <p>First, What the Magistrates are to do; and not being to speak to them, I shall speak little of them. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are to use their Authority for the setling of the Ark; for the Ark of the Covenant will be like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, alwayes floating upon the top of the waters, till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates that are set over it, will endeavour to settle it. Thus we read of <hi>David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>David</hi> and all his men were gathered together, thirty thousand men, all his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men went in great pomp to the fetching home of the ark; you may read the chapter at your leisure. And in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 2. there you find <hi>Solomon</hi> and all his Nobles with a great deal of pomp fetching home the ark. Oh how should this encourage our Nobles and our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, that they might be solicitous in setling the ark of God. Give me leave to say thus much to Magistrates, You must not do as the <hi>Philistins</hi> did, they had the ark, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50589:12"/>
what did they do with it? why they set it up in the house of <hi>Dagon</hi>; but <hi>Dagon</hi> and the ark will never agree; always when <hi>Dagon</hi> and the false Religion goes in at one door, the ark and the true Religion goes out at the other door: We must nor therefore put the ark and <hi>Dagon</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What must the Ministers do to keep the ark from being lost? Why the Ministers that bear the ark must be ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y, the ark will never prosper upon the should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi>; carry that home with you: it is not your wicked Ministers that can sertle the ark; it is not your prophane, drunken Ministers; no, it must be the godly, sober, pious and religious Ministers. How holy ought they to be that draw near to the God of holiness? So much for the duty of Ministers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What must the people of God do? why there are four things that I will commend to you, and I will commend you to God. First, Do not idolize the ark. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Do not undervalue the ark. Thirdly, Do not pry into the ark. Fourthly, Do not meddle with the ark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you have a call. Fifthly, keep the Covenant of the ark. Briefly of these, and I have done.</p>
            <p>First; do not idolize the ark; that was the sin of the people in the Text, they thought the very presence of the ark would have secured them; and therefore they carryed the ark into the camp; though they did not repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, yet they thought if the ark were in the camp, they were secure; and thus many think, if they can get a good Minister, certainly God wil bless them, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be never so wicked. This is to idolize the ark; there is nothing that will secure a Nation, but repentance and reformation; 'tis not the having the gospel, but the living answerable to the gospel, that wil secure the gospel. Take heed therefore of idoliziog the ark.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50589:12"/>Secondly, We must not undervalue the ark, this was <hi>Michal</hi> her sin; <hi>David</hi> danced before the ark, and <hi>Michal</hi> mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ked him; but said <hi>David,</hi> it is before the Lord, if this be to be vile, I will be more vile still. There are some men b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>gin to say, What need we have any preaching, wil not reading of prayers serve the turn? What need we preach, say others, what need is there of so much preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? will not once a day serve? What needs all this? Oh! but firs, this is so undervalue the ark; and the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ must say, if this be to be vile to preach twice a day, to fast, and pray for the safety of a Nation, we will be more vile still<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We must not pry into the atk; this was the sin of the <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>hshemites,</hi> God destroyed 50000. of them for lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>king into the ark: You must not be curious in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> God hath not revealed: There are great thoughts of heart when God intends lo deliver his people; give me leave to speak plainly to you: There are many that talk of 1666. they think the year of deliverance shal be that year when Antichrist shall be destroyed; and there is a Book printed to prove that Antichrist shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in 1666, and there are strong impressions upon the hearts of many learned men as to the year 1666. some go to the year 1669. for the ruine of Antichrist; some pitch upon a time that's nearer, which I am loth to name to you: But truly my Brethren, if you would have my judgement (and I am glad of this opportunity to tell you so this morning) this is to pry too much into the ark: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that text, and live by it, <hi>tis not for you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o know the times &amp; seasons,</hi> you must not say, <hi>such &amp; such a year</hi>; for when that year is come, you find you are deceiv'd, 'tis the way to make you <hi>atheists,</hi> to believe nothing: Certainly those <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> do no good to the Church, that prescribe <hi>times</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50589:13"/>
and seasons, for when those seasons are come, and we find our selves disappointed, after that we will believe the Minister no more. Give me leave to tell you a story, in the year one thousand, (which I have from ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) wherein it was believed throughout all the Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, that the day of Judgement should begin, and great humiliations and repentance was in all Christian Churches; but when they saw the year end, and the day of Judgement happened not, they al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> fell to their old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, and afterward would believe nothing. 'Tis more dangerous then you imagine, for men to pitch on times and seasons. Gods time is the best time, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, maketh not hast: We must not pry too much into the Ark, lest the punishment of the <hi>Bethsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>mites</hi> be our portion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You must not meddle with the Ark, unless called to it; this was the sin of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> he touched the Ark (you know the story) the Ark was in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; he (good man) meaning no hurt, to keep up the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>k, to touch the Ark, but it neither did him good or the Ark, for he was destroyed himself, making a breach, and hindering the carrying home of the Ark. We have had great disorder heretofore, and God is now punishing us for that disorder: There was abundance of well-meaning men that usurped the Ministerial Office; and (forsooth) they were afraid the Ark was falling, and they laid to their shoulders; but their touching the Ark, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did the Ark, and themselves too, and brought a scandal on the Gospel. If you would have the Gospel settled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>They that are Consecrated must touch the Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly and Lastly, if ever you will preserve the Ark, keep the Laws that the Ark preservs; for in the Ark were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50589:13"/>
the first and second Table of the Law; now these two Tables, the first and second Table of the Law you must keep; keep the Law, and God will keep the Ark; but if you break the Law, you forfeit the Ark. The Ark is called the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi>; keep the Covenant with God, and God will preserve your ark; but if you break your Covenant made with God in your Baptism, and the Covenant renewed at the Sacrament; if you break this Covenant, God will break the ark and you.</p>
            <p>And thus (beloved) I have adventured out of that great affection I bear to you, to give you this morning this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The Lord give a blessing to what hath been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
