            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How be it, I haue no more forgot you in mind then I could or would my own brother: Which thing if for my miſhap it ſhould happen, or haue happened, I beſéech you for that deare fréendſhips ſake, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath béene betwéene your houſe and mine, that you will vtterly cancell, and thinke that my long ſilence, hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther béene occaſioned of my ſundry, and
<pb facs="tcp:16723:5"/>
waightie affaires, then of any other cauſe whatſoeuer, which vnlooked for, haue ſo greatly hindred mee ſince my comming home, that I coulde not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that duetie in effect towards you, which the looue I beare you, and your curteſies bindeth mee to. Wherefore I pray you not onely to accept this as a lawfull excuſe, but as the bare trueth, which dooing, you ſhall increaſe my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes you more and more, Knowe you therefore, that howbeit I haue not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you, I haue not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to note dayly the acccidentes, and all things worthie of memory, that haue happened not onely in this Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo in others abroad, as they haue either béene written or reported vnto vs, as by this my letter, if your lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure permit you to reade it, you may perceiue, which ſhall not ſéeme long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ſince that it containeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſturres happened for the ſpace of two monethes in diuers parts of the world, all thinges of great importance, and worthy to bée read, &amp; noted of you, who doo not followe the example of many others, who ſpend the greater part of their time in reading
<pb facs="tcp:16723:5"/>
of that which hath béene doone many yéeres agoe, and are altogether ignorant of thoſe thinges which dayly happen in this our age. Know you therefore, that twentie dayes after my departure from you, which was vppon the the ſixth day of Aprill laſt, thankes bee giuen to the Lorde, I arriued ſafe and ſound in thys Citie, where I founde Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13, of that name ſomwhat ill at eaſe, but ſo little, that neither he nor any of his fréendes made any account of it, but the third night following being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ninth of the foreſaid moneth, there diſcended a rume downe into his breaſt, with ſuch violence, that in two houres it diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him. Whoſe death, as it was vnto his fréendes altogether vnexpected and ſodaine, ſo was it vnto them all moſt gréeuous, but eſpecially vnto his ſonnes moſt domageable, for it is to be preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that if he had perceiued any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of death in himſelfe, hee woulde ſo haue ordered his affaires, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not after his death haue béene in thoſe troubles, wherein by reading of this my letter, you ſhall perceiue them to be.

Many yéeres ſince it was woont to be but one hall, deuided into ſo many little chambers, with hangings of Tapiſtrie, as there were Cardinals, but conſidering that for want of roome and and ayre, many dyed before the election, there are nowe two great roomes, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into more then thrée ſcore litle cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, each one of them being more then ſixtéene foote ſquare, euery one of them hauing a little cabinet, or cloſet ioyned vnto it, for the Cardinales ſeruing men to be in, before the Chambers there is a long gallerie for the Cardinals to walke in. No Cardinal can bring in more then thrée men, that is to ſay, a Secretarie, a Gentleman, and a Chamberlaine, who ſo long as the election laſteth can not by any meanes come out. All which cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are dreſſed as it followeth.

There is in euery chamber a little table with a Purple Carpet to it, a little woodden lanterne, a little ladder to hang vp the hangings, one high ſtoole, and one lowe, which they carie to the ſcrutine Chamber, a duſt baſket, a Cheſt wyth locke and key, and ſuch other neceſſaries in a Chamber, euerie thinge couered with purple, with the Cardinals armes vpon them to whom they appertaine. Al other Cardinals haue their chambers, &amp; other implementes hanged, and couered with gréene, The order how they are ſerued in the Conclaue, ſo long as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection laſteth is this. Before the gate of the Conclaue, there is a fayre roome, where al the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, that then are in <hi>Rome,</hi> doo ſtande way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the doore by turnes, daie &amp; night or as they are choſen by looue, foure of them alwayes ready to helpe, and doo all ſuch neceſſary buſineſſe as the place, and time requireth, what occaſion ſoeuer happen, chaunging euery two houres.

The order howe the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Sewers doo ſerue the Cardinals their Lords is thus. At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate where as I ſayd before foure Biſhops doo ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, are two Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who are to call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals or Sewers, as they are orderly ſet down in writing in a ſcrowle of Paper, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery night is faſtened vpon the gate, wherein are the names of all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals written as they are drawen by lots, ſo that a man may ſée who ſhall firſt or laſt bée ſerued.

And this is the manner of theyr ſeruice. Firſt euerie Sewer hath very orderly his diſhes placed in the foreſayd two flaſkets, who were firſt made ready by other officers, as by the Cooke, Paſter, Butler, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Comfeter, Fruterer, and ſuch other that belong to keepyng, or dreſſing of meates. Before the ſayd meates goeth that Cardinals Gentleman Vſher that is firſt ſerued, and then two groomes of the ſtable with two ſtaues in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds painted of the Cornutas colour, for ſo that flaſket is called wherin the kitchin meates are caried, after them followeth the Gentleman Steward, with foure or ſixe Gentlemen more, carying of fayre glaſſes in their hands full of diuers ſorts of wines, and very cleare water, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

All the Gentlemen pertaining to that Cardinal attending on them, thus going al in order towards the Conclaue dreſſer, they méete firſt at the firſt doore the Conſeruours, Senatours, or ſherifs gard, then comming to the ſtayers foote, they méete the other garde of Italians and Swizers. And ſo paſſing along the gallerie, they come into a ſeuerall roome where are two little doores, one to go in to ſerue, the other to come out after they haue ſerued, at the entrie of that roome is alſo a garde of Italians and Swizers, which open and ſhut the doores: where ſtande the two Curſors, or gentlemen with bils of names in their hands, who in order call for the Sewer that muſt

There can no wine, nor water be carried in, in any other veſſelles then cléere glaſſes, nor any table cloth, towel, or Napkin, that is not firſt vnfolded, opened, &amp; very well conſidered. All veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels both out of which they eate &amp; drink, of glaſſe, or porcelaine that once goe in, come no more out, for they are the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Ceremonies his fees. The meate that is left, is deuided among the ſeruaunts or officers in the Conclaue, as Barbours, Mazons, Carpenters, Poticaries, Swéepers, &amp; ſuch like. So ſoone as euery Sewer, or ſteward hath

ſerued, he enquireth whether his Lorde will haue any other meate againſt the next time, or not, then taking <hi>Conge,</hi> he goeth out of the other doore, whyleſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come in at the other. And in this order are all Cardinals ſerued morning and night, ſo long as the election laſteth. And all that whyle the Caſtell or Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is very well garded, for at the firſt trench, beſides the ſouldiers that are in <hi>Beluedere,</hi> and thoſe which garde the market place, which are a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, there are ſixe &amp; twentie Swizers way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting day &amp; night, there is a great chaine of yron to croſſe the way, and a little houſe of bordes to ſhield them from the rayne, Aboue the ſayd trench on the left ſide goyng into the Pallace, are eyght peeces of great Artillerie, garded by a band of Swizers, and two other gardes, that alwayes are attendant there.

there is at the left hand a place or houſe couered with bordes, in which is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually a ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Italian ſouldiours, with a going out one both ſides. On the right hand going into the Court, toward <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> tower vnder the gate, which is loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with an yron chaine, is continually another band of Italians, and on the left hand therof is an Altar, that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued where one liſt, couered with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Tapeſtrie, and other ornaments where euery morning all the election while, the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt is celebrated and ſung, by the ſinging men of the Chappell.

The proceſſion being ended, at the ſound of a little bell al men depart, for that is a ſigne, that the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie of that morning is doone, and that there is no Pope choſen, then all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers doo vnarme themſelues. Theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp; ceremonies are vſed euery day, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinals goe into the Conclaue, vntill a Pope bée choſen. The maner how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinals doo chuſe him in the Conclaue, is as it followeth.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>After two maner of wayes the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made. The one is, that euery Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall writeth vpon a ſcrowle, the name of him whom he wiſheth to bee Pope, &amp; after he hath folded it, he carrieth it to the Altar which is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chamber, where the Scrutinie is made, and there ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the maſter of the ceremonies which receiueth the ſayd ſcrowles, &amp; that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall which is founde to haue the moſt ſcrowles, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two thirds of thoſe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be there, he is Pope, this manner is called the chooſing by ſcrutiny, becauſe therby the mind of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinals is ſifted
<pb facs="tcp:16723:13"/>
and knowen. But when in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claue any is founde, that hath none to ſtand with him, then the Cardinals ſtay not to haue their opinions enquired by ſcrutinie, but declare themſelues by their voyces, and then the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlayne, or ſome other of the chéefeſt Cardinals, cauſeth him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſée ſo fauoured by voyces, to ſit vpon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſeate, ſaying vnto him. <hi>Adoro te in Pontificem,</hi> all other Cardinals follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſtriuing who ſhall be foremoſt, leaſt by ſtaying, any be thought to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeued. This is called election by Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, although that he which is choſen by ſcrutinie be alſo adored, which adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather doone for cuſtomes ſake, then for any neceſſitie. Preſently after the election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the newe Popes ſeruantes run to breake two windowes ouer the Court, where the Maſſe or Proceſſion is ſayd, and there the people flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they cry Cardinall <hi>Mont-alto</hi> is choſen Pope, afterwardes commeth one of the Cardnals with the croſſe in his hand, and ſayth thrée times, <hi>Papam habemus.</hi> After that, all the Cardinalles for a good ſpace abide with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Pope,
<pb facs="tcp:16723:14"/>
reioycing with him for his election, then they accompany him to his Pallace, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, euery one retyreth him ſelfe to his owne home. Furthermore you ſhall vnderſtande Sir, that as ſoone as it is noyſed abroad that the Pope is choſen, all the people run to the Pallace where he dwelt béeing Cardinall, and wholy ſpoyle and rob the ſame. In times paſt they were woont to finde there many things of great value, eſpecially houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſtuffe, but now they that haue but the leaſt hope to bée Pope, cauſe theyr ſeruants ſecretely to conuay thence all the beſt, leauing nothing but ſuch things as they care not for looſing. Now to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie vnto you the election of this Pope, I ſay, that in <hi>Sede vacante,</hi> after the death of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> writ to Cardinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> wiſhing him to ſtand to be Pope, for that he deſyred onely to haue him, who at the firſt ſtoode in ſome doubt, thinking that the Kinge did it onely in mockery, but he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it by his Ambaſſadour then reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at Rome, the Cardinall began to perſwade himſelfe that he meant in good earneſt, and endeuoured himſelfe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb facs="tcp:16723:14"/>
to the obtaining thereof, and ſuch were his practizes, that many thought he ſhould be Pope, vntill one morning, the Cardinal <hi>Granuela</hi> in the Conclaue preſented him with a letter from the King, by which he requeſted him at that time to content himſelfe, and to labour no further for that dignitie, and that for a ſpeciall conſideration, marry withall that hée ſhould aſſure himſelfe the next time not to fayle thereof, at the ſight whereof, the Cardinall was greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied, perceiuing that the King went about to delude him, and in thought ſomewhat grieued thereat, anſwered, that he acknowledged himſelfe a ſubiect vnméete to beare ſuch a heauy burthen, howbeit to pleaſure his Maieſtie (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pleaſe he had alwayes ſought) he was mooued to attempt ſuch an enterpriſe, and now ſith that he ſaw that the Kings pleaſure was ſuch, he ſubmitted himſelf wholy to his wil. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cardinall <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uela</hi> thanked him, and requeſted him to agree with him in chooſing the newe Pope, and ſo the next morning <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the 13. of late deceaſſed was choſen. Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> hauing receiued this
<pb facs="tcp:16723:15"/>
ſcornefull repulſe of the King, although that in ſhowe hée ſéemed to haue forgot it, yet inwardly he déepely imprinted it, and his drift was to vſe ſuch meanes whileſt <hi>Gregorie</hi> lyued that after his death, of himſelfe without the ayde of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he might attaine to his purpoſe, and be choſen Pope, which ſecretly he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about, yet not ſo couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that many Cardinals had notice thereof, therefore <hi>Gregorie</hi> beyng dead, and the Cardinales beyng aſſembled in the Conclaue, perceyuing fully <hi>Farneſe</hi> his intent, they vnderſtoode that if the time were detracted, peraduenture hée woulde haue brought it to paſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſodainely they reſolued themſelues to diſappoynt him and chooſe another. Hereupon Cardinal <hi>Eſte, Alexandrino,</hi> and <hi>Ruſticuzzi</hi> with their adherentes, ioyning together by way of ſcrutinie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Cardinall <hi>Mont-alto,</hi> &amp; ſuch was their good fortune, that they not thinking that any others woulde giue their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to their Cardinall comes Cardinall <hi>Medici,</hi> with ſixe voyces to weigh down the ballances on their ſide, and ſo vpon Eaſter day they beyng entred into the

Conclaue, the next morning came Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>de Auguſta,</hi> who entred in, and ſo did Cardinall <hi>Madrucci.</hi> On Tueſday at night, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Wedneſday morning following at ten of the clocke, hee was made Pope, &amp; ſo acknowledged, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored of all the Colledge. Wherby Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> was two wayes deceiued, the one, in not being himſelfe Pope, the other in not hauing any thing to doo in the election of the new, a thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not vnto him many yéeres before, hee hauing made almoſt all the Popes ſince his vncles death, who was <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, hauing alwaies had many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mont-alto</hi> being thus choſen Pope on Wedneſday in Eaſter weeke, which was (according to our computation) the 24. of Aprill, and preſently after his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, (being before called <hi>Felix</hi>) he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf <hi>Syxtus Quintus,</hi> and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he depriued Cardinal <hi>Como</hi> of the office of Secretarie, and gaue it to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Ruſticuzzi</hi> who had it vnder <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. and Cardinall <hi>Alexandrino</hi> had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, which Cardinall <hi>Sant Siſto</hi> had in the conſultation. The Marques
<pb facs="tcp:16723:16"/>
                  <hi>Altemps</hi> was made Gouernour of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> and generall Captaine of both the Popes gardes. The Duke of <hi>Sora</hi> was confirmed generall of the Church. The L. Marques of <hi>Riano</hi> had the roome of <hi>S. Mario Sforza,</hi> who was Lieutenant Generall. The Gouernour of <hi>Rome</hi> was confirmed anew, likewiſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler of the Popes houſhold that was firſt continueth ſtill. Great ioy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes were made at the election of the Pope, but nothing ſo much as was accuſtomed, &amp; that becauſe it is thought the people would rather haue had Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Farneſe.</hi> The Sea was vacant fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene dayes without any exceſſe or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Vppon Thurſday laſt Cardinall <hi>Mondoui</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> by Sea arriued heere, not without great daunger both of weather and Pyrates, and at <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> great contention aroſe betwixt his company &amp; the townes men, there were diſcharged more then an hundred ſhot of Harguebuſſes. Contrary to the opinion of all men, the Lorde <hi>Paulo Giordano Orſino,</hi> Duke of <hi>Braſciano,</hi> came and kiſſed the Popes féete, who entertained him very curteouſly, and with all aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
<pb facs="tcp:16723:16"/>
him to looke to the gouernment of his eſtate, and to the ouerthrowe and rooting out of the baniſhed perſons, or outlawes as we terme them? I layde he did it contrary to the expectation of all men, becauſe you ſhall vnderſtand, that the Pope had not many yéeres agoe a Nephew, a young man of comely ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and perſonage, who viewing on a time a beautifull Damoſell of <hi>Coram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonis de Augubbio,</hi> fell ſo in loue with her, that in ſhort ſpace hée won her and wedded her, but he enioyed her not long for ſhortly after hee was ſlaine with a gunne, and it was thought that Lorde <hi>Paulo</hi> had procured his death, for that not long after hee became very familiar with the Gentlewoman, and meanyng to marrie her, Cardinall <hi>Medici,</hi> who is brother in law to him, and all his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the houſe of <hi>Orſini,</hi> laboured to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope very earneſtly, that he ſhould not ſuffer their kinſman to match with one of ſo baſe fortune, whereupon the Pope at their intreatie ſent for him, and firſt by faire meanes ſought to diſſwade him from his purpoſe, but ſéeing he could doo no good thereby he grew to threatnings,
<pb facs="tcp:16723:17"/>
ſaying, threatning him with exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but Lord <hi>Paulo</hi> nothing terrified nor diſmayed, ſent the Gentlewoman to his houſe in the countrie, and the Pope as ſhe was going thether, cauſed her to be apprehended and put into a monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Nunnes, where ſhe remained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine monthes, notwithſtanding, that at the length Lord <hi>Paulo</hi> found meanes to get her at libertie, and in deſpight of al men maried her, and yet enioieth her. For this cauſe it was thought, that hee would not haue ſubmitted himſelfe vnto the Pope, and truſted him, and that the Pope being now in that ſoueraigntie &amp; dignitie, would haue reuenged the death of his Nephew. But ſée how vaine the iudgements of men are oftentimes, for now there is a mariage intreated of, betwixt the Popes Néece &amp; Lord <hi>Paulo</hi> his ſonne, &amp; it is thought that he ſhall be general Standard bearer of the Church. The ſame day Cardinall <hi>Sforza</hi> had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Pope, and ſhowed himſelfe agréeued of the depriuation of Lorde <hi>Mario</hi> his Vncle, to whom the Pope anſwered, but ſmally to his contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is ſayd that the laſt Popes treaſurer
<pb facs="tcp:16723:17"/>
(a man very well ſéene both in the ciuil and Canon lawes, and one that by fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out diuerſe meanes to inriche the Church, hath cauſed a great ſort to cry out of him) is cloſe priſoner in the caſtle, there to giue account of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A little while agoe there were taken out of the Caſtle great ſummes of mony for the vſe of the <hi>Sea vacante,</hi> which now are reſigned againe. The two thouſande ſouldiers appointed for the Garde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Conclaue are diſcargeded, againe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hauing giuen him beſides his promiſed wages a crowne.</p>
               <p>The Pope hath alreadie bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited a great number, which had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or doone him any pleaſure, when hee was in lowe eſtate and of ſmall abilitie, amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt he hath enriched a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who had ſometimes mended hys ſhooes for nothing, who y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day following for ſodaine ioy, ſet all his olde ſhooes, laſtes, and tooles on fire.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday morning the Lordes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruours, or Sheriffes came to kiſſe the Popes féete, and deſired thrée fauours of him, that is, aboundance, iuſtice, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The Pope ſheweth himſelfe verie thankfull to <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, who made him Cardinal, &amp; therfore hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Cardinall <hi>Alexandrino,</hi> Nepew to <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. that he withall the ſeruaunts and ſuch as belonged to <hi>Pius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 5. ſhoulde come to the Palace, a thing ſurely very commendable in any man, to be mindful in time of proſperitie of his benefactors.</p>

               <p>By letters receyued from <hi>Milan</hi> the 23. of this moneth wée vnderſtande that the viſiter <hi>Reggius,</hi> hath commiſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King to receiue the accounts of Lord <hi>Giorgio Mariques,</hi> without moleſting of his perſon, which hath happened by the interceſſion of the Empreſſe, and the general muſter is appointed to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of May, &amp; that to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiours ſhall be giuen a 100.

               <p>We vnderſtand by letters dated the 20, of this moneth from the Court of the Emperour in <hi>Praga,</hi> theſe newes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing. On Friday laſt the Emperour gaue audience, to the Comiſſaries and Ambaſſadours of diuerſe Princes, as touching the deliuerance of the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> priſoner at <hi>Neuſtat,</hi> but althogh his enemy ſéeke by all meanes poſſible to hinder the ſayd deliuerance, yet it is hoped that in the end he ſhall haue ſome fauour ſhewed him. The Ambaſſador al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Moſcouia</hi> had audience, who was accompanyed into the Pallace by the high Chamberlayne, and many of the chiefeſt Courtiers, and preſented vnto his Maieſtie, a great number of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and fine Armelens, with a furniture of a Goſtone. Of the ſame vncouered of very great value, and brought letters of credite, written in red ſarcenet, he came to confirme and renewe the truce and league that alwayes hath béene betwéen his princes father, and the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> whereupon he had a long diſcourſe
<pb facs="tcp:16723:19"/>
committed this cruell fact, to heape vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie vpon villanie, tooke the faireſt of the two young Ladies, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the other rauiſhed her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and commanding his men, to doo the like vnto the other, and to all the Ladies and gentlewomen that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them, which done, he cauſed them moſt cruelly to be ſlaine, and flong into the ſea. This villanie being heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, was of all men deteſted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be more then barbarous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Venecians</hi> themſelues, who ſought all meanes poſſible to haue him taken, which thing <hi>Emmo</hi> perceiuing, and being gauled with the guilt of his conſcience, he tooke him to his flight, and being come to <hi>Puglia,</hi> perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not to be ſafe there, he licenced two of his Galleys, and with all his bootie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to the value of 200. thouſand Crownes in money &amp; Iewels, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde which was the beſt and faireſt Galley that was ſéene vppon the ſeas theſe many yéeres, ſayling towards the Ile of <hi>Malta,</hi> where he purpoſed to yéeld himſelfe, to the great Maſter of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and order, and there to liue vpon
<pb facs="tcp:16723:20"/>
the praye. The <hi>Venecians</hi> fearing the diſpleaſure of the great <hi>Turke,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent the Captaine of the Gulfe, who is a Noble <hi>Venecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to purſue him with one of the beſt Gallies, and if it might be, eyther a liue or dead to take him, and all his complices, whoſe enterpriſe, the Lorde God ſo fauoured, to the ende ſuch villanie ſhould not long go vnpuniſhed, that in few dayes, not farre from <hi>Puglia</hi> he met with him and without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance tooke him, and all his men, and carried them to <hi>Venice,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth day after being iuſtly by the lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he was publiquely executed and had his head cutte of, and all his goods confiſcated, to a kinſman of his that was with him: but in as much as all the ſouldiers proteſted that he was nothing culpable, and rather had ſought by all meanes and reaſons, to diſwade him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that crueltie, they did nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him to perpetuall priſon. At the firſt, when the great <hi>Turke</hi> heard of this he ſéemed to be very angry, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue (beſides an infinit ſumme of money, <hi>Emmo</hi> and all the ſouldiers) and Gallies furniſhed in his owne handes.
<pb facs="tcp:16723:20"/>
The <hi>Venecians</hi> foorthwith, ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours vnto him with <hi>Emmo</hi> his head, excuſing themſelues as well as they could, and that it was a thing they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſted, and were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of, offering any reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to appeaſe him, but he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his anger, demaunded great and vnreaſonable ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but now as we heare by theſe laſt letters, he is much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and ſéemes to yéelde to any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conditions, to which he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue condiſcended, were he in any good eſtate with that mightie enemie of his, the great <hi>Perſian,</hi> with whom theſe thrée yéeres ſpace he hath had continuall warre, and hath loſt verie much, who euen at this time troubles him greatly, and that is the reaſon that hee was ſo ſoone appeaſed with the <hi>Venecians.</hi> So that nowe it were an eaſie thing for the Chriſtian Princes (if there were any zeale of Chriſt in them, and that ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and malice did not raigne among them) vniting themſelues together, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to ouerthrowe him, and frée ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſandes of Chriſtian ſoules that liue in miſerable bondage, which if they
<pb facs="tcp:16723:21"/>
doo not but continue ſtill, in ſéeking to vndoo and deuour one another. You ſhall ſée one day thoſe two mightie States, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies both to the name of Chriſt, ioyne together &amp; fall vpon vs, as they did vpon the Princes of <hi>Greece.</hi> Pardon me good ſir, if I haue gone from my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for nothing maketh mee ſpeake but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great deſire I haue, that that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Chriſtians, ſhould once be ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by thoſe that might (if they would) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, hauing the euerliuing Lord to their guide, as they might haue, if they woulde followe that good <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Buloin,</hi> that gathered a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> power out of <hi>England, Fraunce, Italie,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Holy Land. But nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to it, I ſay that with the ſame letters, we heare that <hi>S. Barberico,</hi> who was newly choſen Procurator of <hi>S. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> which is one of the greateſt dignities in that Signorie, went to the Senate, accompanyed with thrée hundreth noble men, all in their Senatours roabes, which made a rare and goodly ſhowe, and to moſt of them he made a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous banquet. The Prouiſor of <hi>Firme Land</hi> was come to the citie, his office is
<pb facs="tcp:16723:21"/>
alſo of great credite among them. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of the houſe of <hi>Contarini,</hi> euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Rialto</hi> (which is a place in <hi>Venice</hi> as the <hi>Royall Exchange</hi> in <hi>London</hi>) ſhot at another Noble man with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, who being taken, was foorthwith baniſhed the citie, and all the States thereof, on paine of a thouſand crownes, and to looſe his life if he be taken, and howbeit many ſue for hym, yet can no fauour be obtained, vntill ten yéeres be expired, and if his father die in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, his goods ſhalbe confiſcated.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Ceneda,</hi> was ready to take his iourney from <hi>Venice</hi> to come hether. The Patriarke of <hi>Aquileia</hi> was looked for there. The Souldiers were preſt before to be ſent into <hi>Candia</hi> to the gariſons, they began now to take their pay, and to be ſent away vnder diuers Coronels, and Captaines. This is al we heard from thence with the laſt letters.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Rome,</hi> from the day aboueſayd to the 18. of May. Vpon Saturday laſt, there was a publique conſiſtorie held, in which the Cardinals <hi>Mondoni, Terra-noua,</hi> and <hi>Gioyeuſe,</hi> made their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to receiue their Hats, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb facs="tcp:16723:22"/>
by 32. Cardinals, and a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of other Lords, Barrons, &amp; nobles al on horſebacke. The Cardinals, <hi>Eſte, Ramboglietto, Sirletto,</hi> &amp; <hi>Medici</hi> were not there. They were moſt courteouſly &amp; honorably receiued, and entertained of the Pope, who gaue them their Hattes, and made them full Cardinales. The Popes when they made any Cardinals that is not preſent, they vſe this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Firſt to ſend them a red Cap where they are, and then the firſt time after they come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and enter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie, they giue them the Hat. Theſe thrée cardinals were made by <hi>Gregory,</hi> but they had neuer bin at <hi>Rome</hi> before.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Medici</hi> had audience of the Pope, and tolde him that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Toſcana</hi> his brother, deſired to come and kiſſe his féete, and doo his duetie to his holineſſe, but that he deſired to haue audience, and to be receiued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings Hall, the Pope anſwered him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at more leyſure he woulde talke of it, and gaue him an anſwere.</p>
               <p>On Munday in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Conſiſtorie, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of <hi>Monſier Fautino,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>Coſcenza</hi> was committed to Abbot <hi>Paſtorius,</hi> the Church of <hi>Concordia</hi> in

                  <hi>Friuli,</hi> to a gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Quirini</hi>: that of <hi>Salmona</hi> to a Fryer, Chaplaine to the Cardinall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragona.</hi> Likewiſe, two Churches in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> (named by Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi>) were prouided of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Paſtors. The ſame day, and in the ſayd Conſiſtorie, the Pope declared as Legates, theſe Prelates folowing: Cardinall <hi>Saluia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> to be ſent to <hi>Bologna la graſſa.</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Colonna</hi> to <hi>Campagna</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Geſualdo</hi> to <hi>Marca d' Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Spinola</hi> to <hi>Perugia,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Canano</hi> to <hi>Romagna.</hi> And the Pope nominated his aboue named nephew, Cardinall <hi>Mont-alto,</hi> gyuing him his owne Hat, his Armes, and hys name, with ſeuen thouſande Crownes reuenues at the firſt daſh. On the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, the ſealing beeing ended, Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> departed hence to <hi>Grotta ferrata,</hi> there to ſolace and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelfe, and it is thought that he is greatly diſcontented. The day before <hi>Mounſier Fieſco</hi> caryed a hat and a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſword to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and a Roſe vnto the Dutcheſſe, (which is a ceremonie vſed of Popes in honouring of Princes,) for that the Duke and hys

Vpon wedneſday <hi>Signior Bon compagno,</hi> brother to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> came hether, who for ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate grudge was not permitted to come during his brothers life. There went to méete him out of the Gates, theſe men folowing: the Duke of <hi>Sora</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe, the Cardinalles <hi>San ſiſto</hi> hys ſonne, and <hi>Vaſta villani</hi> his Nephewe, with certain others, who conducted him to Cardinall <hi>San ſiſto</hi> his houſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be ſéene how variably y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whéele of Fortune turneth, for if he had beene permitted to come whilſt his brother li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he ſhould haue béene receiued of the Cardinalles and Lordes of the Courte, and with great triumphe brought into the Pallace. Neither will I forget to tel you the cauſe, why the Pope his brother would not ſée him. The cauſe was this.
<pb facs="tcp:16723:23"/>
Before <hi>Gregory</hi> came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popedome, he was a very poore Cardinall, and main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained his ſonne Lord <hi>Giacomo</hi> (as well as he coulde) at ſtudie in <hi>Padua,</hi> who in time of vacation, alwaies repayred to his Vncles houſe in <hi>Bologna,</hi> where he was very ill intreated of his Aunte, and by her oftentimes miſuſed in termes &amp; ſpéeches, as calling him aſſe, dolt, prieſts baſtarde, with the like, which ſpéeches (as you knowe) with vs are counted ſpightfull and intollerable. This poore youth, ſometimes gaue his father intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thereof by letters, who writte to his Brother, and tolde him that he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled (ſéeing he had the gouernment of his wife) he would ſuffer it, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him that if he wold not redreſſe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would be ſo mindfull of him, as hee ſhould repent it. But his brother, who not onely loued but honoured his wyfe, durſt neuer let her vnderſtande thereof, though ſecretely to winne his Nephew, he nowe and then beſtowed ſome ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding money on him, who alwayes dyd commende him to his father, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie after he was choſen Pope, ſent for his ſonne Lorde <hi>Giacomo,</hi> cauſing hym

you ſhall finde that there is not at thys day, any Court in the worlde, in whych fortune ſheweth more then in thys her power, ſith that you ſee that many which within theſe two monethes, ſat in the higheſt part of her turning whéele, are now thrown downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loweſt of them was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only talke while theyr proſperity laſted, towards them onely were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes of all men bent, &amp; now there is no more account made of them then of any other, and within a ſhort while their memory will faile ſo, as if they had neuer béene.

<pb facs="tcp:16723:28"/>
ſhould know it, and tooke great delyght in telling it. And this it is. <hi>Mont-alto</hi> is a little village in <hi>Marca d' Ancona</hi> hid in an vnpleaſant valley, at the ſide of the mount <hi>Appennine,</hi> and becauſe the countrey is ſo obſcure, I can not deſcribe it better, ſaue that it is a little village at the roote of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines, there diſtant from the noble citie of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> ten miles. In that place was this preſent Pope borne after this ſort. There dwelt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fellow named <hi>Pietro,</hi> who for his lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtature and ſmal perſonage, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Peretto,</hi> which is aſmuch to ſay, as little <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; alſo little <hi>Peare.</hi> His birth &amp; ſtocke was ſo baſe, &amp; his liuing ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hils of <hi>Fermo</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe, he was glad to kéepe the ſwine of one <hi>Sig.

ſelfe as long as her milke laſted. Which boy commyng to the age of thrée yéeres, the father not being able to kéepe him, he gaue him and recommended him to the Baker of the towne, who was a very poore man himſelfe, for there were no more then fowre or fiue houſes in the village, to whome he did bake, who for Gods ſake tooke him, and ſo the poore childe lyued a great whyle by that ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der almes, and croommes of breade, or péeces that the poore women which came thether to bake, woulde nowe and then giue him. His attyre was a long time of a courſe ſhyrt ragged and torne, his bed was an Aſhheape which was raked out of the Ouen, whereon he was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lye, leaſt he ſhoulde die for colde, and this poore life led he, till he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 8. yéeres olde, at which time there came thether by chaunce a gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Maleſpini</hi> (who hath at this day two ſonnes liuing, men of great fame and credite, the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called <hi>Sig.
