            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Well then, if you will hear the reſt which are not of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall come to what we think a fatal Exception; we ſay this Indictment of High-Treaſon being againſt a Subject born, ought to have had the words in it, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Supremum naturalem Ligeuni Dominum ſuum;</hi> according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe in the 7th Report. <hi>Fol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Septimo.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It is <hi>Contra Ligeantiae ſuae Debitum,</hi> is it not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>That won't help it, My Lord, for all that is applicable to an Alien Born: And ſo is the Caſe in my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> 144. where it is ſaid, That
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66404:3"/>
if an Indictment of Treaſon be againſt an Alien, you muſt not put in the word <hi>naturalem,</hi> if you do, it will be faulty, becauſe he owes but a Local Allegiance to the King of <hi>England;</hi> and not a natural one. Now we ſay, there are none of theſe Priſoners but are Subjects born, and the conſtant Form in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s Time, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, was to put in the word <hi>Naturalem Dominum,</hi> and they cannot ſhew me any of thoſe Preſidents. without it. There was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Caſe to look into this matter, and ſearch all the Preſidents. I have look'd into my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Entries, and all the Preſidents; I have ſeen my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Indictment, and all the others in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and thoſe of the Traitors in the Powder-Plot, and thoſe of the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and <hi>Tuckers</hi> own Indictment it ſelf; all along it is <hi>Naturalem Dominum ſuum;</hi> and the reaſon for it is, he that is Alien born, you never put in <hi>naturalem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſuum,</hi> becauſe he owes a double Allegiance; one Natural, to his own King under whoſe Dominion he was born, and the other Local, to the King in whoſe Dominions he reſides, for he is bound to obſerve the Laws of the place where he lives: And if he violate them, he does break the Allegiance that he owes to the Government where he lives, upon account of the Protection he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys under it. But if he be born a Subject of the King of <hi>England,</hi> he has but one natural Liege-Lord; and he being an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> born, the King ſtands in that Relation to him, as he does to all his Native Subjects, but not to Foreigners; and therefore it was thought requiſite to be, and has always been inſerted into Indictments of Treaſon againſt Subjects born. And my Lord, we think the very Reſolution of the Court, afterwards affirm'd in the Houſe of Lords that Revers'd <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Attainder, went upon this Opinion, That the Law required <hi>naturalem Ligeum Dominum</hi> to be put in. There the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was, that <hi>Contra Debitum Legeanciae ſuae</hi> was omitted; To which it was Objected, that there was <hi>Dominum Supremum Naturalem,</hi> which was Equivalent: No, it was anſwered, both were requiſite, becauſe every act charg'd in the Indictment ought to be laid againſt the Duty of his Allegian<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. Now in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments of Treaſon, there are certain words that are eſſential, becauſe of their Relation between the King and his People. There are certain Forms of words, which if the conſtant practice has been to make uſe of them, the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Error. Thoſe uſual Forms ought to be obſerv'd, and the want of them will be a fatal Exception; ſo we think it would be in this Caſe, as much as if the word <hi>proditorie</hi> had been left out; or as if in a Caſe of Felony and Burglary, the words <hi>Felonicè,</hi> and <hi>Burglariter</hi> had been left out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we take the Practice, and Preſidents to be the Rule of Law in the Caſe; and I have look'd over a great many Preſidents, beſides thoſe that Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> has Cited; and I never ſaw any one Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of an Indictment of Treaſon againſt a Subject born without the word <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalem;</hi> and all the Caſes cited by Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> are full in the point. <hi>Courteer</hi>'s Caſe in my Lord <hi>Hobbart,</hi> 271. where 'tis ſaid, that if there be an Indictment againſt a Subject born, it muſt be <hi>Contra naturalem Dominum;</hi> if againſt an Alien, <hi>naturalem</hi> muſt be left out. To ſay <hi>Contra Legiantiae ſuae De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buum</hi> will not do, it is not enough, for that may be ſaid againſt an Alien, becauſe he owes a Local Allegiance, tho' not a Natural one. And I take it, upon this difference, this Indictment is not good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do not know how far you will think it proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this matter before the Tryal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Attorney.</hi> I think you had as good ſpeak to it now as at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; tho' I muſt confeſs it is not ſo proper in point of practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Well, My Lord, then we will ſpeak to it now. The Objection is, That the word <hi>naturalem Dominum</hi> is not in the Indictment; which they ſay is contrary to the uſual Form: As to the Preſidents, there are a great many where it has been, and I am ſure a great many where it has not been; and I am ſure for this Six, Seven or Eight Years laſt paſt, it has always been omitted: And, with Submiſſion to your Lordſhip, it is not at all neceſſary: If there be words in the indictment which ſhew, that what he did was againſt the Duty of his Allegiance to his Lawful and Undoubted Lord (which are the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66404:4"/>
words in this Indictment). It is true, if he be not a Subject born, <hi>naturalem</hi> cannot be in, becauſe that is contradictory to the Obedience which he owes, for it is not a Natural Obedience that he owes, but a Local; but if a Man be a Subject born, and commits Treaſon againſt the Allegiance that he ows, that is againſt his natural Allegiance; for whatſoever he does againſt his Allegiance, he does againſt his natural Allegiance, and ſo there's no need to put in the word <hi>naturalem;</hi> becauſe he owes no other Allegiance but that; it is ſufficient if that be put in which ſhews its being againſt his Allegiance. If they could ſhew that a Subject born has two Allegiances, one that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the other that is not natural; then if you would proſecute him you muſt ſhew, whether it was againſt his Natural, or againſt his other Allegiance. But when he has none but a natural Allegiance, certainly againſt his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without putting in natural, will be well enough. It is true where there is no natural Allegiance, it muſt be wrong if you put it in, becauſe you put in that Allegiance which he does not owe; but where he is a Subject born, to put in natural Liege-Lord there is no ground at all for it; there are words enow that ſhew it was againſt his Allegiance to his Lawful and Undoubted Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower,</hi> how does it appear, that theſe Men are Subjects born? The matter you go upon does not appear upon the Indictment, and you are not to go off from that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Every man is preſum'd to be ſo, unleſs the contrary appears.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You quote <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, and the other Caſes that are there put; thoſe are all Caſes of Aliens; there is Dr. <hi>Lopez</hi>'s Caſe; He being an Alien comes into <hi>England,</hi> and commits High Treaſon: Why, ſay they, how ſhall we Indict this man? We cannot ſay it is <hi>Contra Naturalem Dominam ſuam;</hi> for he owes no Natural Allegiance to the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> How ſhall we do to frame a good Indictment againſt this man? They conſidered of this; and they ſaid it will be a good Indictment, to charge him with High-Treaſon, or any one elſe, leaving out the word <hi>Naturalem:</hi> For if it appear he has committed an Offence againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, and againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, which is High-Treaſon, that's enough. Now as to <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Caſe, it was Reverſed for want of the Concluſion, <hi>contra Debitum Ligeantiae ſuae.</hi> Thoſe words are material; for let the Offence be never ſo much againſt the Perſon of the King, as to Aſſaſſinate him, or Levy War againſt him, yet ſtill if it be not againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, as it cannot be if he owes him none, it is not High-Treaſon. And therefore if it be againſt his Allegiance, whether that Allegiance be Natural, or Local, it is all one, it's enough to make it High-Treaſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>In that Caſe in <hi>Dyer,</hi> they ſhew where it was a fault to put the word in, but they can ſhew no Caſe where it has been adjudged to be a fault to leave the word out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt it would be a fault to have that in, <hi>Contra Naturalem Dominum ſuum,</hi> where there is only a Local Allegiance due.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It is no matter whether the one or the other do appear, it is High-Treaſon be it the one or the other, if it be againſt the Duty of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>

               <p>That would be ill, becauſe then you had laid it more ſpecially, and otherwiſe than really it is, and reſtrained it where you ought not to do it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>How then, my Lord, ſhall it appear that he only ow'd a Local Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It may be given in Evidence, That he is an Alien born.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>He ought to be acquitted, for you have Indicted him of a Crime againſt his Natural Allegiance, when he owes no ſuch. But Allegiance generally comprehends all ſorts of Allegiance, Natural, and Local.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Well, you ſhall have them all in time. My Lord, here is another Objection, and that's this; here is one fact that they have laid, and that is the Second Overt Act in this Indictment, that they Conſented and Agreed that Fourty Men (Whereof theſe Four were to be Four) but do not lay it to be done Trayterouſly. They ſay <hi>Conſenſerunt Agreaverunt &amp; Aſſenſerunt,</hi> but not <hi>proditorie;</hi> and I never ſaw an Indictment that laid an expreſs Overt Act, without Repeating the Word again. If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pleaſes, the Words in the Indictment are thus; as to the firſt Overt Act, it is laid in this manner, <hi>Et ad execrabilem Aſſaſſinationem illam exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quend.</hi> at ſuch a time and ſuch a place <hi>proditorie tractaverunt propoſuerunt &amp; Conſultaverunt devijs modis &amp; medijs et &amp;c,</hi> and then comes this which we except againſt; <hi>&amp; Conſenſerunt Agreaverunt &amp; Aſſencerunt quod Quadragin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Homines &amp;c.</hi> Now this is a plain Diſtinct Act, and there is no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie</hi> to it; and if ever they can ſhew me any Indictment, in which an Overt Act was laid, of which they gave any Evidence, and it had not the Word <hi>proditorie</hi> in it I am very much miſtaken. I am ſure, I never ſaw any ſuch. And it is not enough to ſay, that the nature of the thing is ſuch, as that it cannot but be a Treaſonable Act; but they muſt alledg it to be ſo, by the expreſs uſe of that Word, which the Law has appointed to expreſs this Crime by. In the Caſe of an Indictment for Felony, if it be not ſaid Felony, it is not good. They are not to Diſcribe that by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, which is a particular Crime fixt by Law, they muſt uſe the <hi>Verba Artis,</hi> the terms of Art, and no other: If your Lordſhip pleaſes it may be read.</p>

               <p>Well, you need read no further for our Objection. We ſay, there wants the Word <hi>Proditorie:</hi> For there are two Overt Acts, the one is, that they Trayerouſly did Conſult of the ways and means, how to Kill the King, and that Overt Act we agree to be well laid: But then it ſays they Conſented, and agreed that there ſhould be Forty Men, whereof theſe Four ſhould be Four, but does not ſay they Trayterouſly agreed are not theſe Diſtinct Acts?</p>

               <p>Surely, My Lord, they are diſtinct Acts, for this part of the Indictment upon which Sir <hi>Bartholomew</hi> grounds his Objection, is that Overt Act of which the Liſt in Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s caſe was urg'd by the Kings Councel, and agreed by the Court to be an Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Jury againſt Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> came in, and deliver'd in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, as it is in his Tryal, then afterwards the Court went on thus.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the Objection is, that <hi>proditorie</hi> is not in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed into that Particular Clauſe of the Indictment, which ſhews there Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agrement that there ſhould be Forty Men, whereof the Four nam'd in the Indictment were to be Four. Now your Lordſhip Obſerves how the Indictment Runs, it is for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death and Deſtruction of the King; and it ſetsforth for this purpoſe, that to effect this Compaſſing and Imagination, they <hi>Proditorie tractaverunt &amp; Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt de vijs medijs &amp; Modis,</hi> how they ſhould Kill the King. Now that which Imediatley follows after is, the particular method, and means that were agreed upon, that is, that there ſhould be Forty Men. Now this is the ſtrangeſt ſuggeſtion that ever was, when we have ſet forth, that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly they Did ſo agree of the ways and means, and then ſet forth the particular means that here muſt be <hi>proditorie</hi> again to that. This is ſuch a Conſtruction as I cannot but admire how it could come into any ones head. It is part of the ſentence; for the other part, as we have laid it, is not Compleat before: It may be it might be ſufficient without ſetting forth the particular way, and means, but when it is ſet forth, it is part of the ſentence, and Refers to the firſt beginning.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> ſays, that when we have Alledg'd that they did Trayterouſly treat, propoſe, and Conſult of the means and ways of Killing the King, there we have done the ſentence and made that one Overt Act. Now how is the ſentence done? The next Word is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction Copulative, <hi>&amp; Conſenſerunt, &amp;c.</hi> And what is the uſe of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction Copulative? But to Convey the Force of the Words in a Former ſentence to the ſentence following, and to prevent the Repetition of every Word in the ſubſequent ſentence that was in the precedent: But it is plain, they are both one and the ſame Overt Act, and theſe ſubſequent Words are only an Explanation, more particularly of the Overt Act ſetforth in the precedent Words.</p>

               <p>In anſwer to that, that has been ſaid, if they ſhew me any precedent, where an Indictment has been for High Treaſon, ſetting forth ſeveral Overt Acts, and not the Word <hi>proditorie</hi> ſet to every Overt Act, then they anſwer my Objection. If the Word <hi>Quod</hi> had come in, that would have made them diſtinct to be ſure; and I think they are as diſtinct Acts now; ſuppoſe they had Concluded at the end of the word <hi>Interficerent</hi> that had been a good Overt Act, I am ſure they will agree that: And if it be ſo, then the other is a good Overt Act too. For it is a diſtinct thing from that which was a perfect ſentence before; and it either requires a likewiſe or the Word <hi>Proditorie</hi> muſt be repeated. They have not ſo much as ſaid <hi>ſimiliter Conſenterunt</hi> or <hi>ſimili modo</hi> ther is an <hi>(&amp;)</hi> indeed, but that does not ſo Couple the ſentences together, as not to make them diſtinct Acts.

Then when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you ſay the Perſon accuſed did Wound him, or Impriſon him, or Conſult and agree to Aſſaſſinate Him, or did actually Aſſaſſinate Him, theſe are but ſo many Overt Acts of Compaſſing the Death, and you having firſt ſaid that he did <hi>Proditorie</hi> compaſs and imagin the King's Death, you have thereby ſhewn that you charge him with a greater Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence then Felony (which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays is the uſe of the word <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,)</hi> and that being thus done, I do not apprehend it to be neceſſary that you ſhould ad <hi>Proditorie</hi> to all the reſt of the following particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they

               <p>Then, my Lord, here is another Thing. It is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether there be any Overt Act preſented by the Jury at all. The Indictment ſay's, <hi>Juratores pro Domino Rege preſentant,</hi> that they as falſe Traytors did Compaſs the Death of the King, and the Slaughter of his Subjects, and they did Meet, and Conſult, and Agree how to do it, <hi>Et ijdem Chriſtopherus Knightley</hi> and the reſt, to fulfil their ſaid Trayterous Intentions and Imaginations did. Afterwards the tenth of <hi>February</hi> Buy Arms and Horſes. Now our Objection is, that it does not appear, that any one of theſe Overt Acts are the preſentment of the Jury; With Submiſſion they ought to have begun it again, either with a <hi>Quodque,</hi> or ſomething that ſhould have referred it to the firſt, <hi>Juratores preſentant,</hi> or elſe they muſt have begun quite again, with a <hi>Juratores Ulterius preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> and not have coupled them as this is with an <hi>ulterius preſentant,</hi> and not have Coupled them as this is with an <hi>Et.</hi> The moſt forms begin with an <hi>Ulterius preſentant,</hi> but here we find no Overt Act is ſo Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. They might preſent part, and not preſent the other part, for any thing that does appear. Every Thing ought to be laid poſitively, as the Jury's. <hi>Dictum,</hi> it may be onely the Clerks ſaying, and not the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for any thing that do's appear. Your Lordſhip remembers the Caſe of the King and <hi>Trobridge: Trobridge</hi> upon a Writ of Error to Reverſe a Judgment for Erecting and Continuing a Cottage againſt the form of the Statute, now <hi>Contra formam Statuti</hi> was in the begining of the Indictment; but not in the Concluſion; to the Erecting, but not to the Continuing. And tho there was there <hi>Juratores, Ulterius dicunt,</hi> it was not <hi>ſuper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ſuum,</hi> and they did not ſay, he did continue it againſt the Statute, and there being no formal, preſentment that he maintain'd the Cottage notwithſtanding the Act, <hi>Et</hi> did no ſo Couple it to the firſt part, as to make it a good preſentment. So we ſay in this Caſe, this is a fault, and different from all the Common Forms; there ought to be a Direct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of each Overt Act, and not Coupled by an <hi>Et.</hi> For <hi>Et</hi> will not do it; for it is a Diſtinct Overt Act every one, and ſhould have been <hi>Et Quod Conſultaverunt, quodque Agreaverunt,</hi> that a certain number ſhould do ſo and ſo, and to be ſure, it ſhould have been ſo at the laſt Overt Act, which is onely, <hi>Et ijdem Chriſtophorus Knightley</hi> did Buy Arms and Horſes. Now this laſt <hi>Et,</hi> being a looſe Conjunction <hi>Copulative,</hi> in common Sence ought to Refer to that which they had agreed upon, for that is laſt mention'd there, and the natural Sence leads thither, and not to the begining of the Bill <hi>Juratores preſentant quod.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66404:6"/>
our Anſwer is, That the firſt <hi>Quod</hi> governs all that relates to that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It may be if there were two diſtinct Treaſons in the Indictment, when you come to ſet forth the Second Treaſon, you ſhould ſay <hi>Jurato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ulterius preſentant</hi> the Second Treaſon; but the Overt Acts to prove the ſame Treaſon, are all parts of that Treaſon, and make but one Species of Treaſon, which is the imagining the Death of the King. There's the Treaſon; and to bring it to paſs, they did ſo, and ſo: This, my Lord, muſt be part of the finding of the Jury as well as the Treaſon it ſelf, of which theſe are the Overt Acts. But then if you will lay the levying of War in the ſame Indictment, then it may be you muſt ſay <hi>Juratores ulterius preſentant quod,</hi> &amp;c. But it had been a ſtrange Abſurdity to ſay, <hi>Juratores ulterius preſentant</hi> ſuch and ſuch Overt Acts: For the Overt Act is not a further Indictment, but only a ſetting forth that which is Evidence, upon which they found the Indictment for Treaſon.</p>

               <p>What the Indictment ſays, is a direct Affirmation as can be all along in the Preſentment of the Jury, that the Priſoner and others did compaſs and imagine the Death of the King, and to bring it about, they did conſult together, and did agree to make uſe of ſuch and ſuch Means, and were to have a Party of 40 Men, and they bought Arms and Horſes. Now it does not repeat <hi>quodque,</hi> or <hi>ulterius preſentant quod,</hi> to every one of thoſe Sentences, that they did ſo and ſo, and that they did ſo and ſo. Now I would feign know the Difference between ſaying, and they did ſuch a thing, and ſaying, and that they did ſuch a thing. That's all the Difference that they think to overturn this Indictment for. The omitting of a <hi>Juratores ulterius preſentant,</hi> certainly is nothing; for the firſt Preſentment runs through the whole Indictment, and there does not need an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterius.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly there ſhould have been a <hi>Quodque</hi> at leaſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No indeed, I think it is better as it is, than as you would have had it; becauſe the firſt <hi>Quod</hi> goes through the whole, That in Order thereunto he did ſo and ſo, would you have it ſaid <hi>&amp; quod</hi> in Order thereunto he did ſo and ſo, but that may be good Senſe, I think it is not ſo good as the other. This Indictment is for one ſort of Treaſon, and that is, for compaſſing the Death of the King; and it is, I think, more proper to have but one <hi>Quod,</hi> than to have more; for it makes the whole Indictment more entire. As to the <hi>Juratores ulterius preſentant,</hi> that is never proper, where the <hi>Species</hi> of Treaſon is the ſame: For indeed if there had been two diſtinct Treaſons, the one for compaſſing the Death of the King, and the other for levying of War, in that Caſe you muſt bring it in by <hi>ulterius preſentant:</hi> becauſe they are two ſeveral Offences, tho' comprisd in one Bill, and they are in Law as two Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And ſo it is in the Caſe that you mention'd of Cottages: It is one Offence to erect a Cottage, and another Offence to continue a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and they are to have ſeveral Puniſhments; and becauſe they were jumbled them both together in one Indictment, that Indictment was held to be nought: For by Law, the Indictment for erecting a Cottage, ought to conclude <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> and then the Jury muſt begin again, <hi>&amp; ulterius preſentant quod</hi> the Cottage was continu'd againſt the Form of the Statute; becauſe they are ſeveral Offences. But here the High Treaſon is but one, and the ſame Offence, and the other things are but Overt Acts to manifeſt this Treaſon, the compaſſing the Death of the King; and truly I think it is better as it is.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>I have ſeen ſeveral Precedents of Indictments, where the ſeveral Overt Acts were to the ſame High Treaſon, but ſtill they had each an <hi>ulterius preſentant.</hi>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; This is an Indictment of High-Treaſon that is found againſt four Perſons; but the particular Treaſon againſt the Priſoner at the Bar is for compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King, and endeavouring to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government, and enſlave the Nation to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King: And the Indictment ſets forth, that the Priſoner at the Bar did for this purpoſe meet and conſult with ſeveral falſe Traytors to the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66404:9"/>
of the way, manner, and means how, and the time and place when and where to Aſſaſſinate the King; and at length they agreed that forty Horſemen ſhould go together, and ſet upon the King in his Coach, as he returned from Hunting; ſome to attack the Coach, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſet upon the Guards. The Indictment does further charge him with getting Horſes and Arms, and particularly with carrying a Liſt of the Aſſaſſinators from one to another. Theſe are the particular things char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Indictment, and to this Indictment he has pleaded Not guilty; if we prove the Fact, Gentlemen, we don't doubt your Juſtice.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; The Priſoner at the Bar, <hi>Charles Cranburne,</hi> is indicted for High-Treaſon, in compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment to prove the Priſoner guilty are, That he was at ſeveral Meetings and Conſultations about the manner of putting this Deſign in Execution; at which Meetings it was agreed, That there ſhould be about forty Horſemen in Number prepare'd, and arm'd for that purpoſe, and they did provide Horſes and Arms for that very thing, and did agree to put it in execution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Evidence that you will hear produc'd againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar will be of this Nature. You will hear from the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, or the Beginning of <hi>January,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> did come over from <hi>France</hi> from the late King <hi>James,</hi> to whom he was an Officer in his Guards, with a Commiſſion for attacking the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or levying War upon his Perſon. He came over about that time, and ſeveral Troopers of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Guards, to aſſiſt him in that barbarous Conſpiracy. When Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> came over, he did acquaint with this Deſign ſeveral Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> that he thought proper to be Accomplices with him in it, particularly Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and ſeveral others whoſe Names you will hear of, and they had ſeveral Meetings about it the Beginning of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, at the <hi>Nagg's Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Places where they conſulted in what manner they might attempt and accompliſh this Bloody Deſign.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will hear, that at theſe Meetings it was propos'd, that they ſhould do it by Ambuſcade as the King came from <hi>Richmond</hi> a Hunting, whither he uſed to go upon <hi>Saturdays:</hi> Others were for doing it on this ſide the Water. And ſo their Opinions being divided, it was thought neceſſary to find out and ſettle which was the beſt Place; and in order thereunto they employ'd Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>King</hi> (who was executed) to view the Ground, and accordingly they went, and pitch'd upon the Lane between <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnam Green</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as the moſt convenient Place: And having ſo done, they came back and gave an Account to thoſe that had appointed to meet 'em, to hear the Succeſs of their Expedition, to the <hi>Nagg's Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and in that Place you will find by the Evidence, that thoſe Perſons, who were the Heads of the Conſpiracy, undertook to find their ſeveral Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, for whom they would undertake that would go with them, and be concern'd in this Deſign. Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to furniſh about 20. He had the Command of the Troopers that came from <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe other Officers that came thence, were under him. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was to furniſh 7, <hi>Chernock</hi> was to furniſh 8, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was to furniſh 5 Horſes and 3 Men, and, I think, <hi>Lowick</hi> was to furniſh ſome more: In the whole Number they reckon'd there ſhould be about 40.</p>
               <p>It will appear, Gentlemen, that the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was one of the Men that Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> undertook to get, and engage in this Deſign; and accordingly Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> did acquaint Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> with it; and he did undertake to be one, and to be ready to go with him, and be concerned in this Aſſaſſination. You will find he was acquainted with it about the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> the Day before the firſt time that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66404:10"/>
to aſſault the King: Then he did undertake and agree to prepare himſelf againſt the next Day. The next Day which was the 15th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> they had ſeveral Meetings, and they were making Preparation in order to go out. It happen'd by great Providence his Majeſty did not go abroad that Day, and thereupon they diſpers'd themſelves; but they had Meetings afterwards, at which Meetings the Priſoner was preſent, with Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs, La Rue,</hi> and ſeveral others that were concerned in the Conſpiracy, particularly the 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> the Day before the ſecond time they were to have put this in Execution. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> being at the Sun-Tavern, with ſeveral other Gentlemen, and they reſolving to have it executed the next Day, if the King went abroad. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> ſent for <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and <hi>Keys</hi> that was executed, and <hi>Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Sherborn,</hi> four of thoſe that he had undertaken for, (of whom, I ſay, <hi>Cranburne,</hi> the Prifoner at the Bar, was one) and then he acquainted 'em that they were reſolv'd to go on with it the next Day. And then they agreed to be in a readineſs accordingly. The next Day the Priſoner with ſome others met at Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s, where they were preparing to go out and attack the King, and they had ſeveral Diſcourſes about the Ways and and Means of doing it; and particularly Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> at that time ſaid, that he had a very good Gun that held about 6 or 8 Bullets, and that Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraſs</hi> was to have, who was to attack the Coach, and ſhoot into the Coach: Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> was there preſent at that time, and Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> was employ'd particularly by Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> to carry a Liſt that <hi>Porter</hi> writ of the Names of ſeveral Men that were to act in it under him, and this he was to carry to <hi>Chernock. Porter</hi> writ it and gave it him, and he carry'd it with Directions to bring it back with the Liſt of the Names of Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>'s Men. <hi>Cranburne</hi> did accordingly at that time carry the Liſt of the Names to Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and brought it back with an additional Liſt, from Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> of his Men.</p>
               <p>At that time you will hear farther, when <hi>Cranburne</hi> brought the Liſt, he brought an Account that he heard the King did certainly go abroad: for Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> had Intelligence ſo from Chambers, who lay at <hi>Kenſington</hi> to get Intelligence: At which there was very great rejoycing among all that were preſent at that time, hoping they ſhould have an Opportunity to put this execrable Deſign in Execution; and ſo they prepar'd all of 'em to go out. There were ſeveral Inns in <hi>Turnam</hi> Green and <hi>Brentford,</hi> and therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and they were to be plac'd, two or three in an Inn, that they might be ready to get together when time ſhould ſerve. It happen'd the King did not go abroad that Day neither, there being ſome Diſcovery of this Deſign, and ſo they did diſperſe themſelves, as apprehending it was diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will appear by ſeveral Witneſſes, that the Priſoner at the Bar was engag'd in this Horrid Treaſonable Deſign, and was to have acted a Part in it. We will call our Witneſſes that will make the Particulars out to you, and we do not queſtion but you'll do what is right. Firſt, call Capt. <hi>Porter, (who was ſworn.)</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, if you pleaſe, Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> give the Court and the Jury an Account what you know of this wicked intended Aſſaſſination, and what ſhare the Priſoner at the Bar had in it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Porter.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, before this wicked Aſſaſſination was on foot, the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburne,</hi> was employ'd by me to buy Arms. I us'd to give him Money to go to the Brokers to buy Arms at ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and he brought a Sword-Cutler to me, of whom I bought about 20 Swords. And when Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and this buſineſs was reſolv'd upon, I acquainted him with the Deſign, and promis'd to mount him. He never was at any of the Meetings with Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> or Sir <hi>William Parkyns;</hi> but he went to look for a Horſe, and was ready both <hi>Saturdays</hi> to go along with me. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d I ſent him with a Meſſage to Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> for the Note for the two Horſes, which he had promiſed me to furniſh me with, out of his five that he was to furniſh; he came back again, and told me that there was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66404:10"/>
a Meſſenger came and ſaid that the King did go out, and he knew where to have the two Horſes; that Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was affraid we ſhould not have the full number of Men, and deſired me to ſend him the Names of my Men; I did write a Liſt of the Names of my Men, and I went afterwards to the <hi>Blew-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> whither he was to come to me; he did ſo, and he brought back the Liſt of my Men, with the Liſt of Mr. <hi>Charnocks</hi> Men writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten underneath it, and at the ſame time News was brought that the King did not go abroad that day.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this may be a very material part of our Defence, and therefore we muſt inquire a little the more into it. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, that he was in a Room with Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Charnock,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkins;</hi> and he came out into another Room, where was Mr. <hi>Cranburn, Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Keys:</hi> and there he ſays, after he had been there ſome time, <hi>Gunn</hi> came in, I deſire to know, whether <hi>Gunn</hi> was there when he firſt came in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. <hi>Porter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>To the beſt of my Remembrance, he came in afterwards, but I cannot poſitively tell, for I was in and out ſeveral times.</p>

               <p>At the time that you Communicated this Deſign to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> what ſaid he to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. <hi>Porter.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>When I firſt Communicated the thing to him, I told him there was a thing on Foot for the Service of King <hi>James,</hi> and deſired him to go along with me.</p>

               <p>He asked me, what kind of Service it was? I told him Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was come over, and I told the whole Deſign of the Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that it was intended to take him off, as he came from <hi>Richmond</hi> from Hunting.</p>

               <p>It is too long a Story to tell you all that I know of this Matter; but, if you pleaſe, I will tell you what concerns the Priſoner at the Bar. I am heartily ſorry that I have occaſion to appear againſt him, as I wou'd be truly againſt any Body: But ſince I am here upon my Oath, I muſt declare the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and I hope I ſhall not declare any thing but what is Truth. Upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 15th. of <hi>February,</hi> the Day that the Deſign was to have been put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt His Majeſty, and all that were in the Coach with him, and againſt his Guards, I went to Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Norfolk-ſtreet,</hi> to inform my ſelf, whether they reſolved on that Day to go out upon the Deſign; and I found by Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> that they did reſolve it, and I ſtay'd there a while, till ſuch time as Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> came in; I did not know whence he came then, but, as I was informed afterwards, he came from <hi>Kenſington</hi> to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and his Boots were dirty; and Mr <hi>Chernock</hi> told me he had ſent a Meſſenger to Mr. <hi>Porter, And,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if you will ſtay a little time, I ſhall have an Anſwer.</hi> The Meſſenger came back, and told him, That Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> din'd at the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden.</hi> I did not go to Dine with him, but went home, where I ſaw Mr. <hi>King</hi> at my Lodging, who told me, that the King did not go out that Day. I told him, I heard he did not: I found by Mr. <hi>Chamber</hi>'s coming back, and that we had no notice from Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> that it was concluded the King did not go out as it was ſuppoſed he ſhou'd have gone. When I had din'd at my Lodging, I went to the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> to

Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and there were Four, or Five, or Six People with him; there was one Mr. <hi>Sherborn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kendrick,</hi> and Two People that I never ſaw before, and another Perſon, but I can't tell now who he was. When we had been there a little while, comes in this unfortunate Man at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburn;</hi> I don't know where he had been; but by his coming in ſo late, I ſuppoſe he had not din'd, and he ordered the Drawer to get him ſome Coſtelets. This is all that I can ſay as to that Day: I had ſeen Captain <hi>Porter</hi> twice or thrice between that, and the 22d. and he deſired me to be at home on <hi>Friday</hi> Night, between Eight and Nine, and he wou'd ſend to me: He did ſend, and I was from home. But when I came, I was informed his Servant had been to ſpeak with me; and in the Morning, about Eight or Nine a Clock, <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. he ſent his Servant to me to tell me his Maſter would ſpeak with me at his Lodgings. I went to his Lodgings, and he then lay in <hi>Maiden-Lane,</hi> at one <hi>Brown</hi>'s a Surgeon's: When I came in, he was in Bed; and he told me in <hi>French, Tonts Parties ſont Preſts.</hi> All Parties are ready. I underſtood all along that there were Three Parties to be engag'd; one to attack the King's Coach, and the Two others the Guards; Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to head the firſt, and <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the reſt. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> aroſe and dreſs'd himſelf, and in came Mr. <hi>Cranburn;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> went out to him into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Room, and what he ſaid I can't tell: But ſoon after came in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraſs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Key,</hi> and Mr <hi>King,</hi> and then he takes Pen, Ink, and Paper.</p>

               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and writes down a Liſt of his Party, and puts me down firſt. Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> ask'd me if I was the Captain, and I made him ſome Anſwer, but what in particular I cannot tell; I think I told him, I knew of the thing before the moſt did: But I can remember particularly that Liſt was given to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> to carry to Mr. <hi>Chernock;</hi> upon what Account it was, I cannot tell; but I concluded, that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was to be acquainted with thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that <hi>Porter</hi> was ſure off: And Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> at that time told me that he was diſappointed of ſome People, and deſired me to get him ſome other Men in their rooms; and he ſent particularly to one that Mr. <hi>King</hi> propoſed; and I did go, and brought him to the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi> where Captain <hi>Porter</hi> told me he was to Dine; and the Gentleman I went to, told me he wou'd meet me at the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden.</hi> When I came back to Mr. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Lodgings, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> and I, went in a Coach to the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden;</hi> and when we had been there a little while, Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> came back to give an Account of the Errand Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> had ſent him upon, and he brings this Liſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>This was <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 22d. of <hi>February;</hi> and he told Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> there was a Liſt of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Men at the bottom of that Liſt, and I took the Liſt in my Hand, and there was Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Liſt of Six or Seven, or thereabouts, of his Party, and at the bottom of it was <hi>R. C.</hi> I think, for <hi>Robert Chernock.</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> takes Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> from the Company into another Room, and I went after them, and he told Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> in my hearing, that the King did not go out that Day. There is one thing I forgot, which now I recollect, and I am upon my Oath to tell the Truth, and the whole Truth: When I was at Mr. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Lodging, he told me the King was to go out; and that Mr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the Orderly Man, had ſent word, That the King reſolv'd to go out between Ten and Eleven.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Who ſaid ſo?</p>

               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> told me ſo at Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, I ſay I had forgot it, but it occurs to my memory now, that he told me there before we went to the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi> that the King did go out that Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 10 and 11; for Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> the Orderly man had been with Mr. <hi>Chernock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> to let them know ſo much. And afterwards when he came back with the Liſt of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Men, to Captain <hi>Porter</hi> at the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in the <hi>Spring-Garden;</hi> there was at the foot of that Liſt, a Liſt of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s men in another hand. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe writ by himſelf, but that I cannot ſwear whoſe hand it was, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> took him into another Room, and then <hi>Cranburn</hi> told him the King did not go out, and I believe it was then between 11 and 12 a Clock, and he alſo told Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was apprehenſive the thing was Diſcovered, and therefore deſired him to have a care of himſelf, for he himſelf was reſolv'd not to lie at home that Night; I think my Lord, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> did ſend back Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> I cannot be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive whether he did or not, but I believe he did, becauſe I am ſure Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> did tell Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would ſpeak with him, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> made anſwer, Why ſhould he deſire me to go to him, when he knows I am under ſome Ill Circumſtances, and he can better come to me? and I believe Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> did ſend Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> once again to Mr. <hi>Chernock.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> did not go to Mr. <hi>Chernock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> nor did Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> come to him, therefore they ſtay'd there and din'd; and after Dinner, or a little before Dinner, <hi>Keyes</hi> the Trumpeter, came up, and told us that my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment of the Guards was return'd from <hi>Richmond,</hi> foaming: <hi>Keyes</hi> wen down ſtairs again to learn Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as I thought, and came up and told us he ſaw the King's Coaches newly return'd to the <hi>Mews,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was by all the time; I think this was before Dinner, and then we went to Dinner.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you again, don't ſpeak any thing that is material but what you can be poſitive in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>I am poſitive as to the thing, and that it was the 22th. of <hi>February,</hi> but I cannot be poſitive as to all the Circumſtances: After Dinner there was the uſual Healths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Jacobite Healths to King <hi>James</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Reſtoration, and the like; and after that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think it was Mr <hi>Porter</hi> took an Orange in his hand and ſqueez'd it, I am ſure one in the Company did, and drank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſomething to the Rotten Orange, I cannot very well remember juſt now what it was; but I wou'd be cautions of ſaying any thing but what is Truth, but if your Lordſhip will give me leave to recollect my ſelf, I will tell you what it was—Oh! it was to the ſqueezing of the Rotten Orange, and the Health went round, and Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was in the Company, and drank the Health, but being diſappointed and fruſtrated of the Deſign by the King's not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad that Day, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> being caution'd by Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to take care of himſelf, and being told that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> wou'd not lye at home that Night: and the Guards returning in that manner, they were all apprehenſive that the Thing had taken Air, and the deſign of Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the King was Diſcovered, and therefore Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> concluded of going out of Town; ſeveral Healths were drink round, and I think about Two a Clock he went out of Town, and then the Company broke up. This is what I can ſay as to the Priſoner, and I hope I have ſaid nothing but what is Truth.</p>

               <p>No, Sir, not a word of any ſuch thing. Mr. <hi>King</hi> was by, and Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> was by, and I think Mr. <hi>Keyes</hi> was by, and he writ a Liſt of his Party, putting me down Firſt, and Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> ſaid to me, You are Captain, and he gave it to Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to carry it to Mr. <hi>Chernock;</hi> what the particular Meſſage was, I cannot be poſitive: Indeed I don't very well remember the Meſſage, but the Liſt was carry'd to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and to the beſt of my Memory it was to give Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> an Account what men he was ſure of; for Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> told me of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſappointments he had had, of Perſons that had promis'd him and fail'd.</p>

               <p>Yes, I ſay you told Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> bid you caution him to take care of himſelf, and that he wou'd go that way, for Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and he, deſired to ſee him; and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid it was an unreaſonable thing for Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to deſire it, becauſe they knew he was under Circumſtances that it was not proper for him to go, and he wondered rather they would not come to him.</p>

The next day that we were to do the Buſineſs, we met at the <hi>Blue-Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and finding the King did not go abroad that <hi>Saturday,</hi> we dined there at the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi> and talk'd over again of Aſſaſſinating the King, and the Priſoner was by at the ſame time, they were all mightily concerned the King did not go that <hi>Saturday;</hi> but when we had dined there, we had no further Diſcourſe about the Aſſaſſination that day, but every body was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare againſt the next <hi>Saturday.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Was that agreed upon then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Pendergraſs.</speaker>
               <p>Yes it was, by all the Company; ſo we parted that day. Some time the next Week I met Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ask'd me if I had a Horſeman's Sword; I told him no: Says he to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> let Captain <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> have one of the Horſemens Swords that you have got. Says Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to me, if you will come to my Houſe you ſhall make choice of one your ſelf, for I have ſeveral at home. Said I, Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> I cannot go that way, but I'll take one of your Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if ſo be you'll leave it at my Lodgings: He ſaid he would do it, and did; he left it at my Lodgings in <hi>Suffolk-Street,</hi> which Sword I have ſtill. The day following I met him, and he ask'd me if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Sword; I ſaid I had it; and he ſaid, it was very well. After this I did not ſee Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> till <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> at which time I came to Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings between Nine and Ten a Clock in the Morning, and the Priſoner at the Bar was there, and I heard Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> give him a Meſſage to go to Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> for ſome Horſes, I know not how many. The Priſoner went, and in ſome time after, came back again, and brought an account that the King went out that <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> ſo every body was to get ready: And Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> deſired that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> would ſend a Liſt of his Men; upon which Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> wrote a Liſt of his Men, and gave it to the Priſoner to carry it to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and bid him meet him at the <hi>Blue-Poſts;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and M. <hi>De la Rue</hi> and I took Coach, and went down to <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and when we came to the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi> there were ſome Perſons that I think Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> had appointed to come there; the Priſoner comes thither, and brought the Liſt back, with a Liſt of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Men underneath. I know not who the Men were, for I ſaw it only on the one ſide of the Table, in Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Hand; at the ſame time the Priſoner brought an account, that the King did not go abroad that day, and preſently after we had the ſame account from other Hands; and Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and I went out of Town, and we heard no more of it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we have done with our Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>VVell, then what ſay you to it for the Priſoner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, what we have to ſay on behalf of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in this Reſpect is this, here are but three VVitneſſes produced, and as to one of them, <hi>De la Rue,</hi> there is no Evidence that he gives Your Lordſhips and the Jury, that affects this matter, but only that there was a Liſt given by Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and carried by the Priſoner to Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> and ſo brought back again. But he does not recollect, nor ſwear to any Meſſage that was ſent from <hi>Porter</hi> by the Priſoner to Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock:</hi> Now, my Lord, the bare carrying of a Note of Names will be no Evidence of Treaſon. M. <hi>De la Rue</hi> does not ſwear to any Privity of the Priſoner, what the Liſt was for, nor to the Delivery of the Liſt, which is the Overt Act in the Indictment, nor upon what account this Liſt was written, or ſent, or brought back again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any VVord that proceeded from Captain <hi>Porter</hi> to him upon giving the Liſt, or any VVord when it was brought back again. So that as to <hi>De la Rue</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, we muſt ſubmit it to the Memories and Recollection of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the Jury, we think he only proves a Plot in general, of which there is no peradventure, every Body is ſatisfied, that there was ſuch a horrible Conſpiracy: thoſe that have been condemned and executed for it, have own'd it, and ſo it can never be doubted, but he does not ſay any thing to affect the Priſoner at the Bar; for as to the drinking of Healths, and being preſent when thoſe Healths were drank, tho' it be an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66404:15"/>
Evidence of Diſaffection to the Government, or too much good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Complaiſance to the Company a Man is in, yet that Diſaffection, or Evil Temper, or Complaiſance, we hope are no Evidences of Treaſon. It is plain the Priſoner did depend very much upon Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> he was in truth his Servant to go of his Errands, and expected an Office from him, God knows when; but it does not appear by any particular Action, that he did any thing that can be Treaſon, upon M. <hi>De la Rue</hi>'s Evidence. Then as to what Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> ſays, I muſt confeſs his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence comes home: For he ſays there was a Deſign of the Aſſaſſination, and ſome Agreement of the Priſoner to it; but I muſt beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Favour to obſerve, upon Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi>'s Evidence, if that ſtand alone, it will be but one Witneſs, and then we are ſafe by the Purview of this Act of Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and by the Law, before the making of that Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Then, as to Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> I muſt beg leave to ſay, If our Witneſſes are come that were abſent at the other Tryal, and they prove what is in my Inſtructions, it well be very much Queſtionable, whether there be any Credibility due to his Teſtimony: Then if you take off his Teſtimony, there is only the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs;</hi> and if he be to be believed, to which I have nothing to ſay at preſent, in the Caſe of a Man's Life, upon an Indictment of Treaſon, where the Law requires two credible Witneſſes, his ſingle Teſtimony is not ſufficient to convict the Priſoner. We beg leave to call our Witneſſes, and then we ſhall leave it to your Lordſhip, and the Jury.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>As to the particular Overt-Act laid in the Indictment, the carrying about the Liſt, only M <hi>De la Rue</hi> ſpeaks to it, and Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> has given it an Anſwer, and I ſhall not repeat it.</p>

               <p>I would have you recollect your ſelf; as we ſtood againſt the Rails in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> when we came down from the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi> after the Deſign miſcarry'd, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and they, might thank themſelves if it were diſcovered; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I never communicated a Word of this thing to any of my Party.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we have one piece of Evidence to offer againſt the Teſtimony of Captain <hi>Porter:</hi> He ſays, That he ſent <hi>Cranburn</hi> with <hi>Gunn</hi> from the Cock-pit to ſee for Hackney-Horſes, and that <hi>Cranburn</hi> came to him to the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern, and there they had ſome Diſcourſe about exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Deſign the next Day; and being ask'd who was by, when he communicated the Deſign to <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and particularly, Whether Mr. <hi>Gunn</hi> was by? he ſays he came in afterwards, but was not there at the time of the Communication about the Deſign. Now we ſhall prove that <hi>Gunn</hi> came in with the Priſoner, and was with him all the time, and there was no ſuch Diſcourſe happen'd.</p>

               <p>Did you leave Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> with him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gunn.</speaker>
               <p>I think Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was with him then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>But upon your Oath, was you in Company with Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern, when Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> came firſt in?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>B. Shower.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, our Inference from this Evidence is thus; Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, that upon <hi>Fryday</hi> the 21th. of <hi>February</hi> he was with <hi>Cranburn</hi> at the <hi>Sun Tavern,</hi> and out of one Room into another he came to Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and talk'd with him of this Deſign, and after that <hi>Gunn</hi> came in to the Room, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was over: Now this man ſwears he went from the Cock-pit with Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> he was with him in the Room at firſt when Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> came in; ſome time afterwards he went to his own Houſe, and left Captain <hi>Porter</hi> with Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and came back again, and they came away together: Now we ſay, theſe two are inconſiſtent; for Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> ſwears that <hi>Gunn</hi> was not there till after the Communication was over. L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi> As he remembers.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Nay, I think he was poſitive he came in afterwards.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>As I remember he was not poſitive, but call Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> again.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you do underſtand for what Crime this Priſoner at the Bar is Indicted: It is for High-Treaſon in deſigning and compaſſing the Death of the King, which was to be effected by an Aſſaſſination, in the moſt Barbarous and wicked manner, that any attempt of that nature can poſſibly be made, being to ſurpriſe the King, and murder him in his Coach.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion Gentlemen is, whether this Priſoner be Guilty of this Crime or no; there have been three Witneſſes produced that have given evidence againſt him; Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>De la Rue,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi> and they do all tell
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66404:17"/>
you, that there was ſuch a deſign on Foot to Aſſaſſinate the King, as he came from Hunting at <hi>Richmond,</hi> after he came on this ſide the Water, in the Lane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi> There were Diverſe Perſons Ingaged in this Deſign, which Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was come from <hi>France,</hi> to promote and manage Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> as it does appear upon his Evidence, was a Perſon that was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Ingaged, and at that time was hearty in the Proſecution of it.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you he was a Man that he had had a long acquaintance with, and had Imployed him and deſigned to imploy as an Officer under him, in caſe a Revolution happened, which it ſeems about that time, and ſome time before it was expected. Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> was to have been a Cap, and I think he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote <hi>Cranburn</hi> to be his Quarter Maſter; and he ſent him to buy Arms; and preparations were made for that buſineſs; but that is not the thing that we are now upon, the matter that now properly falls under our Conſideration, is this, the coming over of Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Febuary</hi> laſt, upon which as it ſeems Mr <hi>Porter</hi> was Engaged, and having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and there being Horſes to be furniſht to attack the King and his Guards about <hi>Turnham green.</hi> This Man <hi>Cranburn,</hi> was a Perſon that was ingaged to be one of the Horſe-Men that were to make the attack, and he tells you that he did Imploy him to provide Horſes and Swords, and to prepare the Piſtols, and that he did Engage in it, and particularly that the deſign was to be Executed on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and that he was then ready to go with Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> but on that <hi>Saturday</hi> the King did not go abroad, whereby the deſign was Diſappointed for that time: Afterwards there was a meeting at the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where he met with Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> and others of them, and there comes to that Tavern Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> and others, and they were in an other Room, and Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſays he came to them, and did Diſcourſe about purſuing the deſign the very next Day, which was agreed, and <hi>Cranburn</hi> was ready to go the next Day.</p>
               <p>Then he tells you farther, that the next day being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. The ſecond time that this Aſſaſſination was to have been Executed, upon the deſire of Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> who was a Perſon alſo that was Ingaged in this deſign. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> writes a Liſt of the Men he could bring, and ſent it by <hi>Cranburn</hi> to <hi>Charnock; Cranburn</hi> carries the Liſt to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and brings it back again with an Addition of the names of Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Men underneath.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> is called, and he Swears to that very Circumſtance, that Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was ſent by Captain <hi>Porter</hi> with a Liſt to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and brought it back again from Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> with an Addition of other Names.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> tells you, that he was with this Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, the fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> and there was a diſcourſe of going in purſuance of this deſign the next day, and the Priſoner agreed to it, which he is poſitive in: he tells you, that when they were diſappointed the <hi>15th,</hi> being at the Blew-Poſts, they then agreed to purſue it the next <hi>Saturday; Cranburn</hi> was one of them that agreed.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>De la Rue</hi> informs you that Healths were drank to the late King, and the late Queen, and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as they called him, and then at length, as the Concluding health, Captain <hi>Porter</hi> or ſome of them in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, having an Orange in his Hand, ſqueezed it, and drank a Health to the ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rotten Orange, which was Pledged by all, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> as is proved by both Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>De la Rue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now Gentlemen I muſt leave it to you, whether this is not Evidence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove this Man Guilty of the Treaſon; whereof he is Indicted, that is of Deſigning and Intending the Aſſaſſination of the King, and being engaged as a Party to execute this Deſign, when ever there was an Opportunity</p>
               <p>The Council inſiſt upon it, on the behalf of the Priſoner, that what Captain <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſays is not Evidence: In the firſt place they urge that he is not a Man of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, for they have mentioned that he uſed to be Diſguiſed, and wear a Vizard Mask, and go abroad under odd Circumſtances, and therefore his Reputation they hope is not good enough to make him a Credible Witneſs againſt the Priſoner: Now the Priſoners Witneſs being produced, ſays he never knew him go in any Diſguiſe or wear a Vizard Mask, but once he wore a Patch, becauſe he was under ſome Ill Circumſtances about a Riot in <hi>Drury-Lane;</hi> every body underſtands what the meaning of that was, his drinking of Healths at a Riotous aſſembly, upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and he being under ſome Proſecution for that, occaſioned him to wear that Diſguiſe, but it was not done to Injure any Perſon, or do any miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66404:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But then ſay they he is miſtaken in his Evidence, of the meeting at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the day before the laſt, that this deſign was to have been executed, for whereas he ſays, that <hi>Gunn</hi> was not there when he came to them, yet <hi>Gunn</hi> was in the Company at that time, and whereas he Swears poſitively that they diſcourſed of going upon the ſame deſign to Aſſaſſinate the King the next day, as was agreed the <hi>Saturday</hi> before; <hi>Gunn</hi> heard no ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Gunn</hi> is called, and he tells you he did come to the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi> at that time, with <hi>Cranburn</hi> and Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> he came into the Room, and he heard no ſuch diſcourſe. They did open it indeed that <hi>Gunn</hi> had been there all the while, and if ſo then, if there had been ſuch a diſcourſe he muſt have heard it. <hi>Gunn</hi> has been Examined, and does tell you he was not there all the while, but went out and was abſent for ſometime, about half a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>They have made a Queſtion whether Captain <hi>Porter</hi> came in, when <hi>Gunn</hi> was there, he ſays truly he thinks that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> did come into the Room while he was there, before he went out, but he cannot tell certainly, he was there ſometime, while he was there. Then Captain <hi>Porter</hi> was called again, and Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> does ſay he knows <hi>Gunn</hi> was there, but whether he were there at the time he came in, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay poſitively; but <hi>Gunn</hi> ſays Captain <hi>Porter</hi> was goeing in and out ſeveral times, as <hi>Porter</hi> ſays himſelf; and <hi>Gunn</hi> was abſent for ſome part of the time. So that I cannot ſee any ſort of Contradiction between the Evidence that <hi>Porter</hi> gives, and the Evidence that <hi>Gunn</hi> gives; the one is uncertain, and ſo is the other as to that Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>But Gentlemen, they would infer that if there was any ſuch Diſcourſe while <hi>Gun</hi> was there, it muſt be of neceſſity that <hi>Gunn</hi> muſt have heard it; but it is not neceſſary the diſcourſe ſhould be when <hi>Gunn</hi> was there: Captain <hi>Porter</hi> Swears po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that there was ſuch a diſcourſe of going the next day to purſue the deſign, and he ſays he thinks <hi>Gunn</hi> was not preſent at that time when the diſcourſe was, and <hi>Gunn</hi> ſays he was abſent ſome part of the time.</p>
               <p>And ſo I muſt leave it to you, upon the whole matter, if Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, did Conſent and agree to Act in this Bloody and wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, then you are to find him Guilty; if you are not ſatisfied of that upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you have heard, or you think there is any Inconſiſtency, or Incoherence in the Teſtimony on the one ſide, and the other; and that there is good Reaſon to disbelieve the Evidence againſt the Priſoner, Then you are to acquit him. You have heard your Evidence, and you had beſt conſider of it.</p>

                  <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſes to favour me with one Word for the Priſonor at the Bar; I ſhall not trouble your Lordſhip with any thing that was urged by the Gentlemen that were of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Yeſterday, but I ſhall Rely upon ſomething that has not yet been ſpoken to. My Lord, they have not laid any Time or Place where the Conſent or Agreement was for the Forty Men that were to ſet upon the King and his Guards: There is a Time laid before where they met and diſcourſed of the Ways and Means how to Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Kill the King; but when it comes to the <hi>Aſſencerant, Conceſſerunt &amp; Aggreaverunt;</hi> with Submiſſion, this being another Act; there ought to be another Time and Place laid, and for that I ſhall Cite your Lordſhip two or three Caſes; for Men may meet and Propoſe and Diſcourſe and Conſult of ſuch Things, though they be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66404:20"/>
very Ill Things, and yet that may not be Treaſon. It's the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement that is the Treaſon, and ſo 'twas held in Captain <hi>Blagues</hi> Caſe about Taking the <hi>Tower:</hi> They may meet at one Time and Place, and at another Time and Place they may agree, in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 68. <hi>B.</hi> and 69 <hi>Pl.</hi> 28. a Man was Indicted for Murder, that he at ſuch a Place in and upon the Perſon that was Murdered in <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumferit &amp; ipſum,</hi> the Perſon that was Murdered, <hi>cum Quodam Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello,</hi> of ſuch a Price, <hi>percuſſit;</hi> and he does not ſhew the place where he ſtruck him, nor had the Indictment the Words, <hi>ad tunc &amp; Ibidem,</hi> and therefore the Court held it void: So it is likewiſe Ruled in <hi>Goodrick's</hi> Caſe, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in <hi>Noy</hi> 114. there are theſe Words, Note, It was Moved in Diſcharge of a Reſcue, the Return was, that they, <hi>viz. A.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66404:20"/>
the Indictment now before your Lordſhip in <hi>Reginald Tuckers</hi> Caſe: The Indictment was, that he and <hi>Thomas Place</hi> apud <hi>Bridgwater, in Com. Somerſett. praedict.

This is in <hi>Bendlowes</hi> Reports, Publiſh't by Serjeant <hi>Rowe, fol.</hi> 55. <hi>placito</hi> 91. So in Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe <hi>Plowd. Com.</hi> 385. the Indictment is laid much after the ſame manner, and many other Indictments, which at preſent I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to trouble your Lordſhip with; and this being one of a new Form and of the Firſt Impreſſion, I hope your Lordſhip will hold it inſufficient. And my Lord, when they go farther, and ſay, <hi>Et Quilibet eorum proditorie ſuper ſe ſuſcepit eſſe unum,</hi> there is no place or time alledged where that was done, which of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhould be mentioned: For it is a conſtant Rule in our Books, that what is Iſſuable ought to have a place where it may be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now this is Iſſuable, and the moſt material thing in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, is for compaſſing the King's Death. The <hi>Overt</hi> Acts are that <hi>Chriſtopher Knightley</hi> the Priſoner, and Two others, did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to kill the King; and afterwards did agree how to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Forty Horſemen <hi>Quorum,</hi> theſe ſhou'd be Four, and every one of them did agree to be one; then comes the other <hi>Overt</hi> Act of Providing Arms for them. Now ſuppoſe they ſhould not prove the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Providing Arms; then, my Lord, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to one of the other <hi>Overt</hi> Acts, that theſe Four did Conſult and Agree to Kill the King; or that theſe Four did agree, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to do it, as is laid in the Indictment; and it is plain they muſt fail of proof of either of theſe, for by the not Proſecuting any one of the Name of <hi>Chriſtopher Knightley,</hi> but preferring a new Indictment, againſt one <hi>Alexander Knightley,</hi> it appears that <hi>Chriſtopher Knightley</hi> was not there, and the proving theſe Three others making a Conſult and Agreement, is not a proof of the ſame <hi>Overt</hi> Act, that is laid in the Indictment as it ought to be by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66404:21"/>
the late Act; unleſs they can prove that a Conſult of Three is a Conſult of Four: and if it be anſwered, that it is alledged, that <hi>Quilibet eorum ſuper ſe ſuſcepit,</hi> then will that come to be Iſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the moſt material part of the Indictment; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a place ought to have been laid where it ſhould be Tryed; this, my Lord, is a diſtinct Sentence of it ſelf, it is in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and though you take it away the ſenſe of what remains is perfect and intire, and conſequently this Sentence is or ſhou'd be intire of it ſelf, and therefore ought certainly to be expreſt. Beſides, if your Lordſhip pleaſes, it is not poſitively laid, what theſe Perſons ſeverally undertook, to be there is indeed mention made before of Forty Horſemen, agreed upon to ſet upon the King, then comes the <hi>Parentheſis, Quorum Iidem Chriſtophorus Knightley, Robertus Lowick, Ambroſius Rookwood &amp; Carolus Cranburn forent Quatuor &amp; quilibet eorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie ſuper ſe ſuſcepit eſſe unum:</hi> It is perhaps expreſt fully enough by the word <hi>Quorum,</hi> that it was agreed theſe ſhou'd be Four of the Forty Horſemen; but there wants the repetition of the word <hi>Quorum,</hi> to expreſs what they ſeverally engaged to be; and the word <hi>&amp;</hi> cannot joyn and connect the Sentences: For <hi>forent</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcepit</hi> Differ not only in Number but alſo in Mood and Tenſe, and the ſenſe is not neceſſarily coherent; for it might be true, that the Majority of the Company might agree, theſe ſhou'd be Four, and yet they themſelves might not ſeverally Ingage therein, and one or ſome of them might undertake it, and yet the Company not agreed to it; and it cannot be mended by Intendment. There was <hi>Vaux</hi>'s Caſe, in the 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 44. He was Indicted for Murder, for perſwading a Man to take <hi>Cantharedes;</hi> it was laid, That he <hi>Perſwadebat eundem Nicholaum Recipere &amp; Bibere Quendam potem mixtum cum Quodam veneo vocat Cantharedes;</hi> and the Indictment ſays, <hi>Quod proedictas Nicholaas Neſciens proedictum potem cum Veneno proedicto flore in toxicatum ſed fidem ad Hibens Dicte perſwaſioni Willielmi Reſepit &amp; Bibit;</hi> but does not ſay, <hi>veneum proedictum,</hi> but yet it adds, <hi>Per quod praedictus Nicholaas imediate poſt Receptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem veneni proedicti,</hi> Languiſh'd and Dyed here, one wou'd think was a ſufficient Implication, that he took and drank the Poiſon; but it was Rul'd, that none of theſe words were ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Indictment; for the matter of the Indictment ought to be plain, expreſs, and certain, and ſhall not be maintained by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Implication, and therefore for want of thoſe words the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment was held inſufficient, and the Man again Indicted for that Offence, and there ſeems much more in-certainty in this Indictment, and therefore I humbly pray your Lordſhip that it may be Quaſh't.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, we think the Objection is fully put, and therefore we deſire to have their Anſwer to it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>We think, my Lord, this Objection will receive a very plain Anſwer. The Indictment ſets forth, that at ſuch a Place the Priſoner at the Bar did imagine and compaſs the Death of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66404:21"/>
King: There is a particular place where the imagining was, and that they to accompliſh that Treaſon, in compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King, did amongſt others <hi>poſtea eidem due anno apud parochiam praedictam,</hi> Meet and Conſult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So there's the ſame place ſet forth again, wherein they did Meet and Conſult of the Ways and Means, and Time and Place, when, where, and how to Aſſaſſinate the King: And immediately it follows, <hi>&amp; Conce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt &amp; agreaverunt, &amp;c.</hi> that Forty Men, whereof they were to be Four, and every one of them undertook to be One, ſhould do ſo and ſo. Now, my Lord, ſay they, It is not ſaid that the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there ſhould be Forty Men to do it, was at the ſame Time and Place where they did Meet and Conſult about the Ways and Means: But my Lord, with Submiſſion, it is very plain, that the Agreement for Forty Men, and the particular Agreement for them to be of the Number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but the effect of the Conſultation that is mention'd juſt before: For it is ſaid, they Conſulted how they ſhou'd do it, and they agreed to do it in this manner; the particular manner is ſet forth immediately afterthat, it is ſaid they did Conſult of the Manner, ſo that, my Lord, it is part of the former Sentence; a particularizing of what they did agree upon at that Conſultation; but it is no diſtinct <hi>Overt</hi> Act: If it had been a diſtinct <hi>Overt</hi> Act, then the Caſes that have been Cited by the Council, do ſhow, that there ſhou'd be a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time and place mentioned for every <hi>Overt</hi> Act, but this is only a part of that <hi>Overt</hi> Act, that was mentioned generally before: This tells you particularly what the means were they did agree upon, and the Sentence is not compleat till you have gone over this; ſo that, my Lord, with Submiſſion, it had been very Improper when they agreed at ſuch a Time and Place, of the means and ways how it ſhou'd be effected, then to ſet forth, that it was at the ſame time and Place where they did Conſult of the Ways and Means, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proper; for it is not laid at firſt, that there was any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way propoſed, but only in general, they Conſulted of the Ways and Means; therefore, my Lord, all this that Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> has ſaid, will not be pertinent to this Caſe; it is impoſſible to have been otherwiſe; it is but a part of the Sentence; and it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat till you have gone over the ſeveral particulars, as to the Caſe of a <hi>Reſcus,</hi> that is, the Offence upon which the matter is to be grounded; the <hi>Verbaravit</hi> and <hi>Vulneravit</hi> are not the Offence but the Reſmeing; but where there is not one Sentence compleat, till you come to the end of theſe words, there it muſt be all taken together; ſo it is here, they Conſulted of the Way, and agreed this to be the Way, which they ſet forth in particular: It is join'd to the former part of the Sentence, and the whole is not compleat without it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>With Submiſſion, my Lord, I ſay it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again: Indeed if you wou'd make it like the Caſe, as Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> wou'd have it, that Forty Men did agree to it, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men did it, it were neceſſary to name Time and Place, as it is in the Caſe of Murder; that he did agree to Murder him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Knock't him on the Head, there you ſhou'd lay Time and Place where he agreed, and where he did the Act, for there is an Act done; but in this Caſe there is no Act done, but only an Agreement that Forty ſhou'd do it, whereof theſe Four were to be part of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Now, they cry, you do not ſay what theſe Four were to be for; Yes, we do, the Forty were to do ſuch an Act, and theſe were to be Four of that Forty, and every one of them undertook to be one, ſo that it cannot be expreſt otherwiſe then it is; for what they ſay of the Indictments being not in the ſame Form that other Indictments are, that will be no Argument at all; for it does not follow, that there muſt be one expreſt Form of Indictments, of right there are divers Forms of Indictments, and all of them good, becauſe Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be framed, according to the particular Caſe, and they cannot put me an Inſtance of ſuch a particular Caſe as this. As to that of the miſtake of the name of <hi>Knightley.</hi> that unqueſtionably can be no Objection at all; for how does it appear to the Court, that this againſt the ſame Perſon that was before Indicted by the Name of <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> there may be another <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>

                     </gap>or ought they know: But I will ſuppoſe, that the Conſult was proved not as it is laid, that they were to be Four; but only that they were to be Three of them, it would be well enough againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, if he be proved to be one.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, we have here laid a time and place for the Treaſon alledged in the Indictment, and alſo for the Two <hi>Overt</hi> Acts, how, when, and where it was to be done, and the providing of Arms for it; and for this particular of the Forty Men, that they wou'd have us put the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> to that is but part of the <hi>Overt</hi> Act, which was before alledged for the firſt <hi>Overt</hi> Act mentioned, is the Meeting and Conſulting, and there we lay both Time and Place; that on ſuch a Day, and at ſuch a Place, they did meet and Conſult of the way and manner how to do ſuch an Act: And then we continue on the Sentence, by particularizing how it was to be effected; that they did agree there ſhou'd be Forty Horſemen to do it, whereof they were to be Four; this is but a part of the <hi>Overt</hi> Act, which is the Conſulting and Agreeing upon the ways and means; this particular means agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon, being but the Reſult and Effect of the Conſultation before; ſo that we conceive there is no want of time or place, upon which to take Iſſue in this Caſe.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I think with ſubmiſſion, there is nothing in their Objection, and I take it to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a full Anſwer already; yet I would ask one thing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66404:22"/>
of the Gentlemen of the other ſide had the Sentence run without the Words <hi>de iis modis &amp; mediis, &amp;c.</hi> which follow after the word <hi>conſultavit,</hi> and before the words <hi>&amp; aggreavit;</hi> in this manner, That they did then and there Trayterouſly treat, propoſe, conſult and agree, that 40 Horſemen, or thereabouts, with Guns, and ſo forth. If then there had been any Colour to think it neceſſary, that it ſhou'd be laid in this manner, That they did then and there Trayterouſly treat, and then and there Trayterouſly propoſe, and then and there Trayterouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and did then and there Trayterouſly agree: and if not, then I wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to tell me why <hi>then and there</hi> is more neceſſary to one Verb <hi>did agree,</hi> than it is to all the reſt, in ſence and common ſpeaking. The only uſe of a Conjunction Copulative, is to derive the force of ſome Words in a Sentence foregoing, down to a Sentence following, to avoid repetition: And here, though after the Conſultation be put many Words that relate to that matter by way of Parentheſis; yet the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> ſtill does referr to all the Verbs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being joyned by the Conjunction Copulative; it does not vary the Caſe at all, the putting in that Parentheſis; it is notwithſtanding but as one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: and the ſuppoſing that the Parentheſis ſtood out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes it very plain, there can be no Colour to ſay there wanted a Repetition of the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> to every Verb.</p>

                  <p>With ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips Judgment, there is no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer made to this Objection: I do agree, if there had been ſeveral Verbs and no other Words had intervened, that an <hi>Et</hi> wou'd have Coupled all together, and you need not have repeated <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> to every one: But here is a Fact after the Verbs that makes one compleat, intire Sentence; and if this of the 40 Men were left out, it had been a good Sentence, that they did propoſe and treat how, where and when; that's a Sentence of it ſelf, the Conſulting and the Treating of the Ways and Means: But then they ſay, And they did agree and aſſent that 40 ſhou'd do it; now there is no neceſſity for the interpreting of theſe words, That they ſhou'd conſult and agree at the ſame place and time; there is no neceſſity to conjoyn this Agreement for the 40 Men with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation; they might propoſe and conſult at one time and place, and not agree, and afterwards agree at another time and place; it is not a Specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, as they call it, a ſpecifick Account of the Conſultation, nor a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Effect of it, ſo as to make it neceſſary to joyn them together; they might meet and conſult at one time and place; and at another time and place they might agree that 40 ſhou'd do it; and therefore when you ſay at one time and place they did conſult and propoſe, and afterwards they did agree; it is not neceſſarily imply'd, that it muſt be at the ſame time and place; and when it is not neceſſarily imply'd, we think it neceſſary in Indictments, for Certainty-ſake, to have <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> inſerted again.</p>

                     </gap> does not make it neceſſary that this ſhou'd be like them; and that it is no Argument that it ought to be ſo here. My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, tells us, That by Precedents the Law is known, and that Indictments of Treaſon are of all things the moſt curiouſly Penn'd; and it is common to inferr the Law is ſo, becauſe uſually it is ſo in the Precedents of Indictments. <hi>Mr. Sollicitor</hi> ſays likewiſe, That there may be a <hi>Chriſtopher Knightley</hi> beſides an <hi>Alexander;</hi> but I cannot take that for an Anſwer to the Exception I urge, which is the want of <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> at the <hi>Quorum,</hi> and the <hi>Quilibet</hi> for the <hi>Quilibet</hi> may come to be in Queſtion as the moſt material part of the Indictment, becauſe the Agreement of the Four upon the meeting of the Four is alledg'd as an Overt-Act: Now, with ſubmiſſion, they muſt prove the Aſſembly of the whole Four,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66404:23"/>
or they do not prove the Overt-Act expreſsly laid; then as to the <hi>Quilibet ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> which is the moſt material part, it has no time nor place.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>No ſure, we do not need to prove all Four, for it is a diſtinct Offence in each; and if any one undertook, it is well enough againſt him; and for the time and place, we tell you, it is part of the former Sentence, and makes but an intire one.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Mompeſſon.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the Reſidue of the Verbs, if they had been omitted, it had been good Sence; but this is a perfect intire Sentence of itſelf, when it tells you what they conſulted and treated off, as in the Caſe of the <hi>Reſcous</hi> that I put; if it had ſtopt there, it had been a good Sentence without the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraverunt.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>Reſcous</hi> is the Offence in that Caſe, the other is diſtinct: But here, in this Caſe, nothing can be plainer than that all is one Act, as we have laid it, That at ſuch a time and place they did conſult and treat of the Ways and Means; but then there is no Agreement mentioned till after we have ſaid they did conſult of the Ways and Means, and did agree that this ſhou'd be the Way: This is certainly one intire Sentence that ſhows what the Agreement was upon the Conſultation as the Reſult of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
                  <p>As to what Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> ſays, That we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem,</hi> unleſs the ſence of the Words implies a Neceſſity that the Conſultation and the Agreement ſhould be at one time and place. My Lord, there can be nothing in that, for it does not ariſe from the Neceſſity of the thing one way or t'other; but we take it as an intire Sentence, and that the whole Matter is ſufficiently connected and laid to one time and place, though it might be divided, it muſt be taken, as alledged, to be one intire Fact, or elſe it Recurrs to the ſame Objection, that <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> muſt as well be put to every Verb; for 'tis poſſible they might propoſe at one time and place, and conſult at another, and debate at another, as well as agree at another: So that nothing is to be argued from the Neceſſity of the thing more in one Caſe than the other; for one Man might propoſe it in one place, and the reſt might then ſhake their heads at it, and then they might again meet and conſult at another place, and afterwards agree at a third: But when it is ſaid <hi>then and there</hi> they did meet, conſult and agree, it cannot be underſtood but that the Agreement was at the ſame time and place with the meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>But this can be no Anſwer that Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> gives now, for Propoſing, and Conſulting, and Treating, and Debating, are all of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, for one Man's propoſing to another; and the other's propoſing to him, is Conſulting, Treating and Debating; but now Conſulting and Agreeing are different things.</p>

                  <p>But your Lordſhip wont ſuffer them to give Evidence of that part that is Vitious.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes; it comes within the firſt Words of the Time and Place laid; they may give Evidence of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe this is but a ſetting forth the Manner agreed upon for the Execution of the Deſign that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſulted and treated off; it is comprehended in the former Words; and if they had omitted this out of the Indictment, the Indictment had been never the worſe; there had been a ſufficient Overt-Act alledged to prove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing and Imagining the Death of the King; for if People at ſuch a place and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66404:24"/>
time meet, and propoſe the way and means how to effect it, do you think the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wou'd not be good enough without laying the particular means agreed upon? Certainly it had been well enough if this had been omitted. Do you think they cannot give in Evidence this as a Proof of the Overt Act? Certainly they may.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>The Queſtion will be, my Lord, then upon the whole, Whether the Concluſion of the Indictment, <hi>contra legiantiae ſuae Debitum,</hi> ſhall be taken Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively to every Fact, and if ſo, then there ought to be time and place alledg'd to every Fact.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Suppoſe you lay ſeveral Overt Acts, and prove but one yet he is to be found Guilty of the High Treaſon, which is the Imagination, and Compaſſing the Death of the King, which is the Crime laid in the Indictment; then ſuppoſe this was left out of the Indictment they might give it in Evidence as a Proof of the Overt Act, that is well laid for time and place; and therefore though it be expreſs'd, and not ſo fully and particularly laid, we cannot quaſh the Indictment for it, becauſe the Indictment would have been good, though that had been omitted.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
                  <p>That is certainly true, it is no Cauſe for quaſhing the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>The Indictments againſt the Regicides were for Compaſſing the Death of the King, and they gave in Evidence that he was put to Death, though they charg'd in the Indictment only the Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay ſure, That is an Overt Act with a Witneſs, the Indictment was not laid for Murdering the King, but for Compaſſing his Death, which is the Treaſon according to the Act of Parliament of 25th, <hi>Ed.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> and as an Overt Act they gave the cutting off his Head in Evidence.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>The Indictment ſays, they Compaſs'd and Imagined the Kings death, and they agreed to do it in this manner; if this be not all one intire Sentence I know not what is</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>As to your Caſe, Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> which you quote out of <hi>Dyer,</hi> it is poſſible a man may make an Aſſault at one time, and at another time make an Aſſault and give a ſtroke, but this is all one Act, it does but ſpecifie what was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſulted off and propoſed.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray, do you think a man may Demurr upon a Common Action of Battery where, 'tis ſaid firſt, at ſuch a time and place, <hi>Inſultum fecit &amp; verberavti, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neravit,</hi> becauſe there is not a place ſet to every word.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Mompeſſon.</speaker>
                  <p>Indictments ought to be very curiouſly Penn'd, and what is good in an Action will not be good in an Indictment, with ſubmiſſion.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Mr. Mompeſ.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>You cannot quaſh the Indictment at this time, that is not poſſible, becauſe the Indictment is good as to the reſt, ſuppoſing this was not ſo well as it might be.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Mompeſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lord, I am in your Lordſhips Judgment, whether they ſhall be admitted to give in Evidence this particular thing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>They may certainly give in Evidence, the Agreement to have 40 men to kill the King, as a proof of the Conſultation, Agreement and Conſent to kill the King; and the Conſenting to have 40 Horſemen is an Evidence of their treating, propoſing and conſulting to kill the King. Then for your Objection of <hi>Quilibet ſuſcepit</hi> to be one, that is well enough, it is all ſtill but one Sentence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>One of which is it, for they have not laid in the Indictment what it is, whether it be one of the Four, or one of the Forty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether it be one of the Four, or the Forty is not material, for cannot one be found Guilty and the reſt Acquitted? the one is not charg'd with the Act of the other, but they are ſeveral Offences, and each muſt anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all Indictments. Offences are ſeveral. Suppoſe an Indictment of Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and it is laid in the Indictment that Four did Conſpire, can't you prove that two Conſpired? no Queſtion you may. It is not certainly neceſſary that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhou'd be proved to have Conſpired. Suppoſe it were alledged that Four did beat a man, and does not ſay <hi>Quilibet eorum</hi> beat him, you may give in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that one did beat him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>No Queſtion of that in Caſe of a Battery, but in the Caſe of a Conſpiracy there muſt be more than one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I will ask you even in an Action of Conſpiracy, where the very Giſt of the Action is Conſpiring together, cannot two be found Guilty and the reſt Acquitted? In Riots there muſt be Three or more It may be you'll lay Ten, but it is ſufficient; I hope, if you prove it upon any Three of them.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>The Difference is betwixt Contracts and Crimes, for Contracts they are joynt, but Crimes they are in their own Nature ſeveral.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, my Lord, though they be out of time, yet this is not to the Abatement of the Indictment; but to the Evidence; how do they know, but we will give it in Evidence that <hi>Chriſtopher Knightly</hi> was one.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>If in an Outlawry againſt divers they leave out theſe words, <hi>Nec eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aliquis comperuit,</hi> that is every day held to be nought, and for that Reaſon we ſay, the <hi>Quilibet eorum ſuſcepit</hi> is neceſſary too, and without being laid cannot be given in Evidence, and if it be laid, it ought to have time and place.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, this is an Indictment of High Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Robert Lowick,</hi> Priſoner at the Bar, and the Indictment does charge him with compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King, and endeavouring to ſubvert the Government, and inſlave this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and bring it under <hi>French</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Slavery, and the Indictment ſets forth that <hi>Robert Lowick,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, the Tenth of <hi>February,</hi> met ſeveral falſe Traitors, and there conſulted and treated how to aſſaſſinate his Majeſty; and agreed, that 40 Horſemen to get together, ſome to attack the Guards, while others were to aſſaſſinate the King in his Coach; and the Indictment charges him likewiſe, with getting together Horſes and Arms for this purpoſe, to this he hath pleaded Not Guilty. We will call our Evidence, and prove the Fact againſt him, and we do not doubt but you will do your Duty.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that are ſworn, this is an Indictment of High Treaſon, in conſpiring and compaſſing the Death and Deſtruction of the King, the nature of our Evidence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>You will hear Gentlemen by the Witneſſes that about <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> laſt a Conſpiracy and Deſign was ſet on foot to aſſaſſinate the King, and accordingly to accompliſh it, there were ſeveral perſons ſent over from <hi>France</hi> by the late King <hi>James,</hi> who were part of his Guards, and particularly Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to be the Head of them; he was a Lieutenant of the Guards there, and he was ſent over in <hi>January</hi> laſt, and there were a great many Troopers ſent over, who were to be under his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, particularly Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> who will give you an account, that he was ſent over by order of King <hi>James,</hi> and he was told particularly King <hi>James</hi> had a Service for him to do in <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66404:28"/>
and he hop'd it might be an opportunity to advance him. He was to obſerve the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and by what Token he ſhould know him; he was to meet him in <hi>Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and he was told he might find him there twice a week in the Square, about ſix a Clock after it was dark; and that he might know him, he told him, he would have his White Handerchief hanging out of his Pocket, accordingly Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> came over, and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> came with him, and they came and did meet with Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and they, together with Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and ſeveral others here in <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> did enter into Conſultation how to effect it; there were ſeveral Meetings about it, and you will find the Priſoner at the Bar was at ſeveral Meetings to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and they did undertake, among them, to provide ſo many Men as might make about the Number of 40, which they thought ſufficient for the execuion of this Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you will hear that the Priſoner at the Bar did treat with ſeveral perſons to be ingaged in it; particularly, about the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> he ſent to one <hi>Bertram,</hi> and askt him, if he would be ingaged in a Deſign for King <hi>James</hi>'s Service that was quickly to be executed, without asking of Queſtions, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I think he undertook he would; ſo about the 14th <hi>February</hi> he met him again, and that was the day before the firſt time they intended to attack the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then being ſo near the time when it was to be executed, he thought it proper to acquaint him with the thing he had ingag'd him in, and he did acquaint him, that the next morning they were to be ready to attack the King and his Guards, and bid him be ſure to get his Boots and other things ready for that purpoſe, and he gave him a Guinea in order to it. <hi>Bertram,</hi> it ſeems, on the 15th of <hi>February</hi> did not come, and the King it ſeems did not go abroad that day, ſo they were diſappointed at that time; but the <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> met him, and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> complained that he had not come upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> according as he had undertaken; and he told him it would have been the ſame thing, he would have diſappointed them if the King had been in the Field.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you ſhall find, that as he thus engaged Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> ſo he was to provide ſeveral others; and he did declare, that at his own Charge he had got 2 or 3, he complained of it as a Hardſhip put upon him, that whereas Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had 6 <hi>s.</hi> a day Subſiſtance, and was only to take care of himſelf, he, Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> had at his own Charges ingaged and provided ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66404:28"/>
You will find Gentlemen that Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> who was tried Yeſterday, had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meetings about it, with Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harris;</hi> they did think it to be a barbarous thing: but however they were reſolved to obey Orders, and the Priſoner in particular ſaid he wou'd obey Orders, tho he thought it a very wicked thing.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you will find by the Evidence how the Matter was carried on; the Priſoner was to be engaged in it, and did not only imbarque himſelf in Perſon, but engaged others, and did treat with them about it. We ſhall call our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who will give you a full account of it, and then we ſhall leave it with you, who we queſtion not will do Juſtice: Firſt call <hi>George Harris;</hi> who appeared and was ſworn.</p>

                  <p>On the fourteenth of <hi>January,</hi> New Stile, I was ordered to wait King <hi>James</hi> at Dinner; after Dinner was over, I was called in, where was Coll. <hi>Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> at the ſame time, and King <hi>James</hi> told me he was very ſenſible of the good Service I had done him; and now he had an opportunity of doing ſomething for me: I was to go into <hi>England,</hi> and there to be ſubſiſted, and I was to follow the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay;</hi> the King told me I ſhou'd find Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> with a White Hanker cheif hanging out of his Pocket, on Mondays and Thurſdays between the Hours of ſix and ſeven in the Evening, and that was the ſign I was to know him by, and he ordered me to go to Mr. <hi>Caroll,</hi> that is Secretary to the late Queen, and Coll. <hi>Parher</hi> went along with me, and he ordered me ten <hi>Lewedóres,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> as much, which Mr. <hi>Caroll</hi> gave us; and if that were not ſufficient, or if we were Wind-bound at <hi>Calice,</hi> we had Orders to apply to the Preſident of <hi>Calice</hi> to be furniſh'd with what we wanted: Accordingly we went, and the Wind not ſerving when we came to <hi>Calice,</hi> we were forc'd to ſtay there, and our Charges were paid to our Landlady by the Preſident of <hi>Calice,</hi> according to the Order we received at St. <hi>Germains;</hi> when the Wind ſerved fair we went on Board, and came to <hi>Rumney-Marſh,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Houſe, and from thence he furniſh'd us with a Couple of Horſes, and we came the Sandy-way to one Mr. <hi>Tucker</hi>'s, and from thence to Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi>'s, and from thence to <hi>Graves-end,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London:</hi> We came up in the Night-Tide, and being late when we came to Town. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Night we lay at an Inn at the lower-end of <hi>Gracious-ſtreet;</hi> the next Day we went to look for Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> but not finding him in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> according to what King <hi>James</hi> told us, I admired at it; but one Mr. <hi>Birken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> meeting my Comrade the next day, ſaid Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> deſired to ſee us, and appointed us to meet him, which we did that Night, where Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> ask'd us how the King and Queen, Prince and Princeſs did; he told us at that time he had no Money for us, but in a few Days we ſhou'd have Money; and accordingly he ſent us Money. We had five Guineas but it was at twice, two Guineas at one time and three at another, and this was for a Months Subſiſtence at Five Shillings a Day, Guineas going then at Thirty Shillings. And afterwards when Major <hi>Holmes</hi> delivered the Horſe, upon Saturday the fifteenth, we had another Guinea that made up what we had to be ſix Shillings a Day when we had Horſes, and five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Day when we had none: and as for Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> the firſt Saturday which was deſigned for the Aſſaſſination, I happened to be at Mr. <hi>Counter</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> a Confectioners; and there I ſee Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> come in.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Counter</hi> had Lodgings there, and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> came in there, but I cannot ſay he ſtaid there any time, I think he went out preſently afterwards. The next Week I met Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> in <hi>Red-Lion-Fields</hi> and diſcourſed with him there about this Matter, and I told him what a barbarous and inhumane thing it was that we ſhou'd be the Murderers of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that it wou'd render us odious to the World, and that we ſhould be a continual Reproach to our Selves; he did agree it was ſo: But in concluſion Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> ſaid he would obey Orders, and he ſaid Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> he was ſure wou'd not do it without Orders. That Day when we were walking out we met Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and Major <hi>Holmes</hi> riding in the High-way up towards <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and we ſpoke to him, for Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> told me the Thing was diſcovered, and his Name was given up, and other Gentlemens, and I think another; and ſo he told me that one <hi>Harriſon</hi> had told him of it, and forewarn'd him that Night from lying in his Lodging; and he told him that he believed it wou'd not be ſafe for the reſt to lye in their Lodgings, or to that effect.</p>

                  <p>We were talking of Murdering the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and not only that, but I do believe that Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> is ſo ſenſible that what I ſay is true, and he is a Man of ſo much Conſcience and Honour, that he will not contradict any thing that I affirm or have ſaid here. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Two and Twentieth we dined at the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> a Tavern or a Cook's Shop, at the end of <hi>Red-Lyon-Street.</hi> I was much in a Sweat, and he ask'd me what made me ſo? I told him I had been getting Captain <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Party ready; and I told him laughing, that Captain <hi>Rookwood</hi> ſaid I ſhou'd be his <hi>Ayd du Camp,</hi> and ſo I was getting the Men together: ſays he to me, you may very well do it, for you have Six Shillings a day, and I have nothing. Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> you know what I ſay to be true, I know not why you lift up your hands; but you did tell me I might very well do it, having Six Shillings a day, and you had nothing, and yet brought a couple of Men at your own Charge, and that their Horſes could not be diſcharged unleſs you went. Theſe were his Words, my Lord, or to this effect.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66404:33"/>
I am of Counſel in this caſe for the Priſoner at the Bar, and we do hope here is not Evidence ſufficient to convict him of High Treaſon, the Queſtion is not whether there was a Plot or a Conſpiracy to Aſſaſſinate the King, or to prepare for an Invaſion, but all that you are to conſider, Gentlemen, is, whether the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> be ſufficient to convince you, that he did deſign to Seize and Aſſaſſinate the King; there are three Witneſſes produc'd, but we think this laſt Witneſs, <hi>Fiſher,</hi> his Teſtimony does not hurt him in the leaſt. We know your Lordſhip will Declare and Direct the Jury, that the Evidence in a caſe of Treaſon ought to be plain, not only with reſpect to the Fact, that it was done; but alſo of ſuch Facts as are the Evidences of a man's intentions, and thoſe are not to be Conſtrued by Strains and Intendments, or Implications; unleſs they be ſuch as Evidently, Naturally, and to common Underſtanding expreſs the Intention, it cannot be good Evidence in Treaſon: Now we ſay that Captain <hi>Fiſher</hi> has ſaid nothing at all that will affect the Priſoner, for al that he ſays is, that the Eighth of <hi>February</hi> he ſaid he was ready to ſerve his Maſter to the utmoſt of his Power, and any words as well as theſe may be Conſtrued to make a Man Guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Intentions; for it might be a Recollection of Favours Received, or it might be a Grateful intent to ſerve him upon particular occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that is no Evidence upon this Indictment. Suppoſe it was to ſerve him upon the ſuppoſed intended Invaſion, yet with ſubmiſſion, that is not Eviednce of the Overt Act laid here; here is no Overt Act mentioned of preparing Arms, or Incouraging Men, or Seducing the King's Subjects in order to the better reſtoring of the late King <hi>James,</hi> or the expected Landing of the French, or the like All that's laid to the Priſoner's charge, is the Compaſting the King's Death, and a Deſign to Aſſaſſinate him in his Coach, and in order to the Aſſaſſination, he was to buy Armes and Horſes; now all that he ſays is quite of another Nature, of a quite different Strain, and has no tendency to this matter, and nothing he ſays that <hi>Lowick</hi> ſhou'd ſay, but is applicable the other way, and tends more Naturally to the Invaſion, then to the Aſſaſſination. Your Lordſhip obſerves there was ſome notice taken of what Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> ſhou'd ſay, concerning the Act of Parliament, that he would not talk with above one at a time; how far when life is concern'd ſuch looſe diſcourſe ought to be inforc'd before a Jury I muſt leave to your Lordſhip; tho a Man may be Innocent, yet he may be Cautious, and the more Innocent, perhaps the more Cautious; but that is applicable to the Invaſion too, and has no Relation to the Treaſon in this Indictment more than any other. It ſhows he was more wary then others were, but it is not applicable to the Fact that he now ſtands charged with. Then the whole of the Evidence depends upon the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bertram,</hi> and we think they are not two Witneſſes to one thing, and what they ſay muſt be ſtrained, and intended and preſumed, to make Evidence of Treaſon; for what Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſays about the Diſcourſes between him and the late King <hi>James,</hi> about Receiving Orders from Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and his paſſage over from <hi>France,</hi> and the ſeveral Stages he and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> travel'd, and the Diſcourſes between Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and him; Your Lordſhip will acquaint the Jury that is no Evidence to affect Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> what <hi>Berkenhead</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi> agreed upon does any way affect Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> for thoſe things may be all true and yet Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> innocent of what he ſtands charged with in this Indictment; he ſays, that upon the firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> he ſaw Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> at the Confectioners, but he cannot ſay he ſtaid there at all, there was not a word ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> that he remembers then, but what he ſays that ſeems to touch, and the only thing that touches Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> in all this Evidence is, that that upon <hi>Monday, Tueſday, Wedneſday</hi> or <hi>Thurſday,</hi> it is a pretty large time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fifteenth and the Twenty ſecond, he was talking with Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> about the Barbarity of this buſineſs, and that <hi>Lowick</hi> after all, ſaid he would obey Orders; now with ſubmiſſion, my Lord, to make that to have Relation to the Aſſaſſination muſt be by a forc'd ſtrain'd Intendment; he does not Declare what the Orders were, nay, he does not affirm there were any Orders for the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66404:34"/>
but only that he would obey Orders; here's no Order by Writing, no Order by Parole that Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> declared he would obey: as to what <hi>Lowick</hi> declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Intention of Riding out and Seizing the King in his Coach; that cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Order that he was to obey to Aſſaſſinate the King, that Order does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there are no footſteps of it in all the Evidence, ſo that there is nothing in that Teſtimony that will hurt Mr. <hi>Lowick:</hi> Then upon the Two and Twentieth when they Dined together, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſays, that there was a Diſcourſe of two Men, but it does not appear, nor does the Witneſs give any account what thoſe two Men were to be for; 'tis true two Men he was to get Diſcharg'd, but that is not Evidence that theſe Men were to make a Part of thoſe Forty, neither the words before nor the words after can have that Conſtruction; nay it does not appear it was for any purpoſe at all, now in the caſe of Life, where a Man ſtands at the Bar, we hope ſuch an Evidence ſhall not be Conſtrued to make a Proof of a Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intention, that theſe were to Aſſaſſinate the King, or to make part of the Forty that were to do it, when it does not appear they were there, nor who they were, nor any ſort of Notice taken or given upon what account they were, Provided. And then as to Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Evidence, it is Palpable that his Evidence and whatſoever he ſays cannot amount to make one Witneſs to prove an Overt Act within this Statute, and that there muſt be two Witneſſes the Law requires; what does Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> ſay to prove any Man Guilty of Treaſon, but only by Intendment, Thought or Suſpicion? It is true, Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Evidence would be good enough to commit a Man upon Suſpicion for Treaſon, but to Convict him it cannot be; he ſays that in the begining of <hi>February</hi> he ſpoke to him and, told him he would imploy him in a buſineſs that would be for his Advantage, but he muſt ask no Queſtions; this is very dark, for the meaning of it does not appear what was intended by it; it might be one thing as well as another, it might be to imploy him in his Family, or it might be to ſend him of a Journey, or it might be the taking of a Farm, but to apply that as an Evidence of a charge of High Treaſon, that we think is very hard, and we hope your Lordſhip will think ſo too; but then he comes and tells you further of a Diſcourſe upon the Fourteenth, of his Riding out ſuddenly, and that the King was to be ſeized in his Coach, but he does not ſay that he was to ſeize him, nor that he would be concern'd in it, nor that he knew of it, nor did Declare at what time it was to be done, nor any thing certain whether it was a Prophecy, or a Dream, or a Story that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated again, or what it was; there is no Connection between the Riding out ſuddenly and the other words of ſeizing the King in his Coach; then he ſays he gave him a Guinea to buy him neceſſaries, the Man acknowledges Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> ſeveral times had given him in Charity Money, Cloaths and other things, and gave his Wife a Guinea, as you obſerve, in Charity, but he gave him this Guinea on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to buy him neceſſaries, and it is hard that a Man's Charity to a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to a Townſman, to an ancient acquaintance of Twenty Years ſtanding, to a Perſon that he had been familiar with formerly, and known to have lived well, ſhould be miſ interpreted and ſtrain'd, to make it a giving him Money as Subſiſtance, and a Reward for the doing ſuch a Miſchievous Bloody Act; We ſay his Charity to this Man formerly is inconſiſtent with the Suppoſition that he cou'd be Privy to ſuch a Barbarous Deſign now, and we hope the Jury will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Character that that very Man has given to my Client, for the ſame Witneſs gives you an account of his Behaviour all along, that he was not given to Raſh and Barbarous Actions, nor Guilty of any Malicious thing, nay, that he prevented Miſchief and the Killing of People in cold Blood. We muſt leave it to the Jury's Conſideration, and your Lordſhips Direction. All theſe things that they ſay may be true, and <hi>Lowick</hi> be not Guilty, and the acquitting of Mr. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> will be no Reflection upon the Witneſſes, nor any diſcredit to the Teſtimony that has been given of this Conſpiracy, but we hope 'tis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice to this Man, the Witneſſes not coming up to the Proof of what is laid in the Indictment. We muſt beg your Lordſhips patience a little
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66404:34"/>
longer, and call ſome Witneſſes to give you an account how long they have known Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and what his real Character is; they will tell you he is a peaceable good Man, and ſhew you that his Temper and Inclination was rather to a ſober quiet Life than to lead him to ſuch action, and that they cannot think him likely to be tempted to be concerned in ſuch a Deſign; and then we muſt leave it to the Jury.

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>You went to Diſcharge them, for the King did not go abroad that day.</p>

                  <p>He Swears this, and that's as to him; but then as to <hi>Bertram,</hi> what Deſign was that, that you were to ingage <hi>Bertram</hi> in for his Advantage, and he was to ask no Queſtions?</p>

                  <speaker>Lowick.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, He is a poor Man, and my Countryman, and I have at all times, from time to time, for this ſeven Years, helped to Subſiſt him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that he will not deny, and I have ſeveral times given him both Cloths and Mony.</p>

                  <p>Then I would ask you again, When he came to your Lodging on <hi>Friday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> and you told him the King was to be ſeized in his Coach, and ſaid that we were to Ride out very ſuddenly, and you appointed him to meet the next Morning; and becauſe he did not meet you blamed him, and ſaid it would have been the ſame thing, if the King had been in the Field? Look you, I would have you give anſwer to this if you can.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I muſt beg leave to Anſwer to the Objection that the Counſel for the Priſoner have made, that there are not two Witneſſes to prove the Overt-Act laid in the Indictment, and ſo the Law is not ſatisfied. In Anſwer to that, I deſire your Lordſhips favour to obſerve how the Evidence is, and then we ſhall ſee whether there are not plainly two Poſitive Witneſſes of the Overt-Act, by agreeing to Aſſaſſinate the King. The firſt Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> Your Lordſhip obſerves that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> gives an account that Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> was at Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Lodgings the firſt day that it was to have been Executed; and that afterwards between the Fifteenth and the two and twentieth, thoſe being the firſt and ſecond Days that this was to be done, when he and <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and the Priſoner <hi>Lowick,</hi> were walking together in <hi>Red Lion Fields;</hi> and there had ſome Diſcourſe about the intended Aſſaſſination, and the Barbarity and Bloodineſs of it, and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> were averſe to it. Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> ſaid he would obey Orders, and he was ſure Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would not do it unleſs he had direct Orders for it, that was twice Repeated by him, as <hi>Harris</hi> Swears: and afterwards Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> tells you that the Two and Twentieth he Dined with Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> obſerved that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> came in in a great Sweat, and asked him how it happened, he ſaid he had been about to get ready <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Party that were to ſeize the King, for he was to have one Party. Says Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> to him, you need not Grudge to do it, you have ſix Shillings a day, I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66404:35"/>
have nothing; and yet I, at my own Charge, am to provide two. This is as Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence as well can be of his being privy to the Deſign; and his ingaging People at his own Charge, ſhows a great deal of forwardneſs and Zeal in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the Buſineſs. My Lord, I think this is poſitive and plain Evidence, and not only made out by Inferrences and Conſtructions, as Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> ſays, but plain poſitive Proof. The firſt day he was with ſeveral of them, and when they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the thing afterwards, he declared he would obey Orders; and what could thoſe Orders be but for what they were Diſcourſing of, and nothing was Diſcourſed of but this Deſign they were ingaged in, and this was to juſtifie the thing, and take off the apprehenſion of the Barbarity of it: this is <hi>Harris</hi>'s Teſtimony. The next Witneſs is <hi>Bertram,</hi> and he tells you that the Fifth of <hi>February</hi> the Priſoner ſent for him, and when he came to him, he asked if he would Ingage in a Buſineſs that might be for his Advantage, and ask no Queſtions: ſo at that time he did not acquaint him what the thing was, but that ſhows it was a thing that was to be kept Secret at that time, in regard he did not think fit to acquaint him at the firſt Inſtance. But the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> when he met him again, the day before the firſt time that it was to be put in Execution; <hi>Bertram</hi> Swears he told him that they were to Ride out the next Morning, that muſt be <hi>Lowick</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> for there was no Body elſe there; and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was to be ſeized in his Coach. Was it poſſible the Priſoner could be ignorant of it? When he ingaged him to go upon a Deſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking Queſtions; ſent for him the day before, acquainted him they were to Ride out the next Morning, and that the King was to be ſeized in his Coach, and bid him be ready againſt next Morning, and gave him a Guinea at that time; the Witneſs ſays it was for Neceſſaries, but he does not pretend that it was for Charity, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. And that muſt be for Neceſſaries for that purpoſe that they were then Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, when he deſired him to be ready the next day, and gives him Mony to buy him Neceſſaries: What can that be, but Neceſſaries for what he was to be ready for? And then he did not come the next day, and he tells you why, becauſe he thought it a very wicked and unlawful thing, and ſo he diſappointed him; and the next time <hi>Lowick</hi> Chid him, and told him he would have ſerved him ſo if the King had been in the Field. This is plain, though I believe <hi>Bertram</hi> does Speak as tenderly as he can, being his Friend and old Acquaintance, and is willing to ſay as little as he can of him; ſo that I believe no body thinks but what <hi>Bertram</hi> ſays againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is true, and what he Swears is plain and poſitive. To ſhow that <hi>Lowick</hi> did ingage in the Deſign, he acquainted him with it the Fourteenth, by telling him the King was to be ſeized, and they were to Ride out, and he was to be ready the next day.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this Priſoner at the Bar, <hi>Robert Lowick,</hi> is Indicted of High Treaſon, for Compaſſing and Imagining the Death and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King by an Aſſaſſination; you have heard what Evidence has been given upon this Indictment. And in the firſt place, It is proved to you that there was a Deſign to Aſſaſſinate the King; which was to be carried on under the Conduct and Management of Sir <hi>George Barclay.</hi> The Queſtion that you are now to Conſider of, is whether the Priſoner at the Bar was concerned or ingaged in the Proſecution of that Deſign. There have been two Witneſſes produced, who have given their Evidence, and have been very ſtrictly Examined, and Obſervations have been made upon the Teſtimony they have given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:66404:36"/>
The firſt Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> and he gives you ſome account of the Original of this Deſign. He tells you how he was at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and Introduced to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who did expreſs a great kindneſs for him, and told him that he had an Opportunity of doing ſomething for him that would be for his Advantage: and that he and one <hi>Hare,</hi> who was preſent at that time, ſhould go into <hi>England</hi> (for it ſeems they were both together Introduced by Collonel <hi>Parker)</hi> and ſhould be Subſiſted in <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon Directions were given them what Courſe they were to take; which was to go to <hi>Calice,</hi> and to each of them ten <hi>Lewedores</hi> were given for their Charges, and they were acquainted that if it happened that they ſhould lie there ſo long for want of a Wind to bring them over hither that their Money was ſpent, Proviſion ſhould be made for their ſupply there. They had farther Directions, that when they came into <hi>England</hi> they ſhould apply themſelves to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and follow his Orders, with Inſtructions how to find him; being told that Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would be walking in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> every <hi>Monday,</hi> and every <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night, about the hours of ſix or ſeven a Clock, and that they ſhould know him by a White Handkerchief that was to hang out of his Pocket.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> further tells you, That they did come to <hi>Calice</hi> in order to Embark for <hi>England,</hi> and there they happened to ſtay a conſiderable time, even ſo long that their Mony would not defray their Expences there, and they found it true as it was promiſed them; for the Preſident of <hi>Calice</hi> paid the Reckoning for them at the place where they Lodged; and afterwards they came into <hi>England,</hi> and landed in <hi>Kent,</hi> and came to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi> About the latter end of <hi>January Old Stile</hi> (for it ſhould ſeem it was the 14. <hi>New Stile,</hi> which is the 4. <hi>Old Stile,</hi> they were of St. <hi>Germaines)</hi> he tells you that he did go the firſt <hi>Monday,</hi> after their arrival, into <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> to look after Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> but then miſt him. But afterwards his Companion, Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> met with one <hi>Berkenhead,</hi> and complaining that they had not met with Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> according to the Directions they had abroad: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by the means of <hi>Berkenhead,</hi> they were brought to the Speech of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> who gave them reception, and owned that he had Authority to Subſiſt them; but ſaid he had not then Mony, but ſhortly ſhould, and when he had they ſhould be ſure to receive their Subſiſtence. He tells you, that after this, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> gave them Subſiſtence Mony, paying them at the Rate of five Shillings a day when they had no Horſes, and when they had, ſix Shillings a day: ſo they put themſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under his Command and Conduct. He has given you an Account what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he had with Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> from whom he diſcovered what the Deſign was in which he was to be ingaged. And the Deſign to Aſſaſſinate the King was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be put in Execution on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15. of <hi>February,</hi> at which day Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> and others, being at Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Lodgings; Sir <hi>George</hi> ſaid they were his <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> and afterwards Careſt them, and ſaid they were Men of Honour, and told them that they were to Attack the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Guards; but it ſeems the King not going abroad that day, they loſt that Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Then Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> began to be a little troubled, and concerned, when he underſtood the meaning of his being under Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Conduct. And he ſays that after that firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15. and before the next <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. he met with <hi>Lowick, Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Bernarde,</hi> and he was complaining of his being ingaged in ſuch a Deſign as this was. He called it then the Murder of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſaid it was a Barbarous thing, and he did not like it, nor <hi>Rookwood</hi> neither; but as for Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> whether he diſliked it or no, I know not, but he made Anſwer to him I will obey Orders: ſays he Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> has Orders for it, or otherwiſe he would not do it.</p>
                  <p>Then you are told further, that after this, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> Dined with <hi>Lowick</hi> at a Cooks at the end of <hi>Red Lion Street,</hi> and being there together, <hi>Harris</hi> being in a Sweat, and was asked the reaſon by <hi>Lowick,</hi> he ſaid he had been giving of Orders for the getting ſome Men together that were to go under <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Lowick</hi> told him he might very well do it, for he had Pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> a day; but ſays he, I am to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt two Men, and have nothing at all. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> wiſhed him to go to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and Complain of it to him, but he ſaid he would not; but it ſeems, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then underſtood by them that the King did not go abroad that day, <hi>Lowick</hi> ſaid he muſt go and Diſcharge the two Men, and went about it. This is the Sum and Subſtance of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Lowick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66404:36"/>
The next Witneſs is <hi>Bertram,</hi> and he tells you that ſometime before the Fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> which was, as I told you, the very firſt day that they did deſign to aſſaſſinate the King, Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> ſent for him, and told him, that he would put you upon a Buſineſs that ſhall be for his Advantage, if he would undertake it without asking any Queſtions, this was ſometime before, but the certain Day <hi>Bertram</hi> does not remember; but he tells you farther, that on <hi>Friday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> he was with <hi>Lowick</hi> at his Lodgings, and he ſaid unto him, that the King, he did believe, was to be ſeized in his Coach, and we are to ride out ſuddenly, and then he gave him a Guinea to buy him Neceſſaries, and withal, bid him meet him at the <hi>Purl-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Hart-ſtreet</hi> next Morning; and <hi>Bertram</hi> tells you, he had underſtood what this Deſign was, for he had it before from <hi>Chernock,</hi> and did forbear to go the next Morning, becauſe he did diſlike it. After this Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> met him and chid him for diſappointing of him, in not meeting him as he directed, for ſays he, it would have been the ſame thing if the King had been in the Field: This is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Evidence that <hi>Bertram</hi> has given againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Bertram,</hi> being croſs-examined on the behalf of the Priſoner, ſays he hath known him a great while, and that he is a Man of a peaceable and fair Diſpoſition, very charitable, and that he has given him Money before, and particulary a Guinea to his Wife in his abſence.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I might have mentioned the Evidence of <hi>Fiſher</hi> to you, but that is but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, and does not come home to the Caſe, but being given it may be mention'd, and that is, about the Eighth of <hi>February, Fiſher</hi> had ſome Diſcourſe with <hi>Lowick,</hi> and it ſeems there was notice taken of the intended Invaſion, and <hi>Lowick</hi> ſaid he would ſerve his Maſter faithfully; and that the Witneſs thought was meant of the late King; and he ſaid at another time, that he would not diſcourſe with above one at a time, becauſe of the late Act of Parliament that was then a paſſing, relating to High-Treaſon, that required two Witneſſes. Now, <hi>I</hi> ſay, this is not any Proof againſt the Priſoner, but it is a Circumſtance that may ſhew his Inclination to the late King.</p>
                  <p>The Council for the Priſoner have inſiſted upon the Inſufficiency of the Evidence that has been given on behalf of the King, and have ſaid, that the late Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament requires two Witneſſeſſes, which is true, but not two Witneſſes to any one Overt-Act; but if there be two Witneſſes, one to one and another to another Overt-Act, that is ſufficient; but they ſay that it is not ſo in this Caſe. In the firſt place they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Evidence that is given by <hi>Harris,</hi> they ſay it is ſhort, that muſt be left to your conſideration; whether the Evidence that is given by <hi>Harris,</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> does prove to your ſatisfaction, that he conſented and agreed to the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination of the King, you are to weigh the Evidence, when it is ſworn that when <hi>Harris, Rookwood,</hi> and the Priſoner were walking in <hi>Red Lyon Fields,</hi> and talking of this horrid Deſign, and <hi>Harris</hi> complained that it was a barbarous thing to murther the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as they call'd him, you muſt conſider what Anſwer <hi>Lowick</hi> did make about obeying of Orders, then his ſubſiſting of Men at his own charge without Pay, and complaining of his having no Pay, and his diſcharging them the laſt day that the Aſſaſſination was intended, that <hi>I</hi> muſt leave to you, whether or no this is not an Evidence, if you believe the Witneſs, to ſatisfie you that he was engaged in this Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Then Gentlemen he has alſo been deſired to give an Anſwer to this Queſtion, and to tell upon what Deſign he was to employ <hi>Bertram</hi> that ſhould be for his advantage; but he was to ask no Queſtions, and afterwards whether he did tell him the King was to be ſeized in his Coach, and they were to ride out ſuddenly and bid him meet him the next Morning, and when he did not meet him, he ſaid it would have been the ſame thing if the King had been in the Field. If this be an Evidence of Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi>'s engaging in and agreeing and conſenting to the Deſign, then here will be another Witneſs againſt the Priſoner beſides <hi>Harris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you are to judge of this matter and of the Evidence. It is true, we are not to put, in the caſe of a Mans Life, any forced and violent Conſtructions upon any Words or Diſcourſes; but if the Evidence be plain and clear, tho he did not ſay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words, that he did deſign to aſſaſſinate or kill the King; yet, if upon the whole Diſcourſe that paſt between them it appears plainly, clearly, and ſatisfactorily to you that he did conſent and agree to this Deſign, or was engaged in it, here's another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſay, to prove him guilty, beſides <hi>Harris,</hi> you are to conſider the whole Evidence, the ſubject matter of Diſcourſe, and if you are ſatisfied, <hi>I</hi> ſay, that he was engaged in ſuch a Deſign by the Proof of <hi>Bertram,</hi> as well as of <hi>Harris,</hi> then there are two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which is as much as the Law requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66404:37"/>
But, indeed, the Council have called ſeveral Witneſſes to prove that the Priſoner has lived very peaceably and quietly; one Woman ſays ſhe has known him Twelve Years, and that he lodged at her Houſe, and that he was a Man of great Temper and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and not diſorderly, but had a general good Eſteem and Character: And then there is another, Mrs. <hi>Moſely,</hi> that proves the like, and ſays, ſhe has known him theſe Twenty Years, and ſhe ſays no Man has a better Character: And Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> hath ſaid that he was not of a raſh or bloody Temper.</p>
                  <p>Now Gentlemen, I muſt leave it to you upon the Evidence that you have heard, there are theſe Witneſſes that have been produced, and there are theſe Circumſtances that appear in the Caſe; if you are ſatisfied upon this Evidence that has been given, that the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> did conſent to and engage himſelf in that Deſign of aſſaſſinating the King, then you are to find him guilty; if you are not ſatisfied, you are to find him not guilty; you have heard your Evidence, and had beſt conſider of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then an Officer was ſworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew, and ſtaid out about half an hour, and then returned.</p>

                  <p>You the Priſoners at the Bar, <hi>Robert Lowick, Ambroſe Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Charles Cranburn,</hi> you have been indicted, and upon full and clear Evidence have been convicted of High-Treaſon; a Treaſon that was advanc'd to the higheſt degree both of Malice and Miſchief againſt the King and Kingdom; you deſign'd to aſſaſſinate the King with an intent to ſubvert the State, and by the introducing of a foreign Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the antient Liberty and Conſtitution of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our French and Popiſh Enemies, by whom you were imployed in this bloody Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, did very well know, that the Wiſdom and Courage of his preſent Majeſty has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued this Kingdom from that Slavery and Oppreſſion which they often threatened to bring upon us; they knew that under his Government we have been protected in the enjoyment of our Religion, Laws and Liberty for ſeveral Years, and that his Majeſty is the Head of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and the Protector and Preſerver of the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that upon the Preſervation of his Life and the Safety of his Perſon, the Good and Happineſs of multitudes of People do depend, which the French King's Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has been ready to take hold of any opportunity to enſlave and oppreſs.</p>
                  <p>Your being engaged in ſuch a horrid Deſign againſt ſo precious a Life, and to be the bloody Inſtruments to give that diſmal Stroke, which would have brought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Deſolation upon ſo many Men, renders you worthy to undergo a greater and more ſevere Puniſhment than by the Law of <hi>England</hi> can be inflicted; but that there is no greater provided for ſuch Criminals, is to be imputed to the antient Honeſty and Integrity of Engliſh Men, who, when they fram'd this Conſtitution of Government, never imagin'd <hi>England</hi> ſhould produce ſuch degenerate Wretches, as would endeavour by Plots and Contrivances to betray their Country to a foreign Yoak, and ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Fellow-Subjects to the ſlaviſh Dominion of Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Your Crime being ſo great it is now high time for you ſeriouſly to reflect upon it; and tho you deſerve to ſuffer the greateſt of Puniſhments, yet I have that Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for your Perſons, that I wiſh heartily you would make uſe of that Opportunity which is now put into your Hands, to repent. And ſince you are adjudg'd by the Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live here, that you will make preparation to appear at another Tribunal, where you muſt have another Tryal, and without an hearty and ſincere Repentance, receive a more ſevere Sentence. I hope this Calamity, and the Judgment that is to fall upon you, will be an Admonition to you to take better advice in the laſt part of your time which is left you, than you have done in the whole courſe of your Lives, and that you will be wiſer than to follow the Direction of thoſe Guides whoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Doctrines have ſo far perverted and corrupted you, as to engage you in ſuch a bloody Deſign. I ſhall leave you to make that Preparation for another World, which is proper for Men in your condition, and pronounce the Judgment of the Court, which the Law hath appointed and the Court does award;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all of you be conveyed from hence to the Priſon from whence you came, and from thence every one of you is to be drawn upon a Hurdle to the place of Execution, where you are to be hanged by your Necks, and to be cut down while you are alive, your Privy Members are to be cut off, and your Bowels to be cut out of your Bodies and burnt in your view, your Heads are to be cut off, and your Bodies to be divided into four parts, and your Heads and Quarters are to be diſpoſed where his Majeſty ſhall appoint. And I pray God to have Mercy on all your Souls.</hi>
