            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>That won't help it, My Lord, for all that is applicable to an Alien Born: And Å¿o is the CaÅ¿e in my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> 144. where it is Å¿aid, That
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66404:3"/>
if an Indictment of TreaÅ¿on be againÅ¿t an Alien, you muÅ¿t not put in the word <hi>naturalem,</hi> if you do, it will be faulty, becauÅ¿e he owes but a Local Allegiance to the King of <hi>England;</hi> and not a natural one. Now we Å¿ay, there are none of theÅ¿e PriÅ¿oners but are Subjects born, and the conÅ¿tant Form in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s Time, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, was to put in the word <hi>Naturalem Dominum,</hi> and they cannot Å¿hew me any of thoÅ¿e PreÅ¿idents. without it. There was occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Tucker</hi>'s CaÅ¿e to look into this matter, and Å¿earch all the PreÅ¿idents. I have look'd into my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Entries, and all the PreÅ¿idents; I have Å¿een my Lord of <hi>EÅ¿Å¿ex</hi>'s Indictment, and all the others in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and thoÅ¿e of the Traitors in the Powder-Plot, and thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and <hi>Tuckers</hi> own Indictment it Å¿elf; all along it is <hi>Naturalem Dominum Å¿uum;</hi> and the reaÅ¿on for it is, he that is Alien born, you never put in <hi>naturalem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Å¿uum,</hi> becauÅ¿e he owes a double Allegiance; one Natural, to his own King under whoÅ¿e Dominion he was born, and the other Local, to the King in whoÅ¿e Dominions he reÅ¿ides, for he is bound to obÅ¿erve the Laws of the place where he lives: And if he violate them, he does break the Allegiance that he owes to the Government where he lives, upon account of the Protection he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys under it. But if he be born a Subject of the King of <hi>England,</hi> he has but one natural Liege-Lord; and he being an <hi>EngliÅ¿hman</hi> born, the King Å¿tands in that Relation to him, as he does to all his Native Subjects, but not to Foreigners; and therefore it was thought requiÅ¿ite to be, and has always been inÅ¿erted into Indictments of TreaÅ¿on againÅ¿t Subjects born. And my Lord, we think the very ReÅ¿olution of the Court, afterwards affirm'd in the HouÅ¿e of Lords that Revers'd <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Attainder, went upon this Opinion, That the Law required <hi>naturalem Ligeum Dominum</hi> to be put in. There the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was, that <hi>Contra Debitum Legeanciae Å¿uae</hi> was omitted; To which it was Objected, that there was <hi>Dominum Supremum Naturalem,</hi> which was Equivalent: No, it was anÅ¿wered, both were requiÅ¿ite, becauÅ¿e every act charg'd in the Indictment ought to be laid againÅ¿t the Duty of his Allegian<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>e. Now in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments of TreaÅ¿on, there are certain words that are eÅ¿Å¿ential, becauÅ¿e of their Relation between the King and his People. There are certain Forms of words, which if the conÅ¿tant practice has been to make uÅ¿e of them, the omiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Error. ThoÅ¿e uÅ¿ual Forms ought to be obÅ¿erv'd, and the want of them will be a fatal Exception; Å¿o we think it would be in this CaÅ¿e, as much as if the word <hi>proditorie</hi> had been left out; or as if in a CaÅ¿e of Felony and Burglary, the words <hi>FelonicÃ¨,</hi> and <hi>Burglariter</hi> had been left out.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we take the Practice, and PreÅ¿idents to be the Rule of Law in the CaÅ¿e; and I have look'd over a great many PreÅ¿idents, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> has Cited; and I never Å¿aw any one PreÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of an Indictment of TreaÅ¿on againÅ¿t a Subject born without the word <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalem;</hi> and all the CaÅ¿es cited by Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> are full in the point. <hi>Courteer</hi>'s CaÅ¿e in my Lord <hi>Hobbart,</hi> 271. where 'tis Å¿aid, that if there be an Indictment againÅ¿t a Subject born, it muÅ¿t be <hi>Contra naturalem Dominum;</hi> if againÅ¿t an Alien, <hi>naturalem</hi> muÅ¿t be left out. To Å¿ay <hi>Contra Legiantiae Å¿uae De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buum</hi> will not do, it is not enough, for that may be Å¿aid againÅ¿t an Alien, becauÅ¿e he owes a Local Allegiance, tho' not a Natural one. And I take it, upon this difference, this Indictment is not good.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do not know how far you will think it proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this matter before the Tryal.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Attorney.</hi> I think you had as good Å¿peak to it now as at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; tho' I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s it is not Å¿o proper in point of practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Well, My Lord, then we will Å¿peak to it now. The Objection is, That the word <hi>naturalem Dominum</hi> is not in the Indictment; which they Å¿ay is contrary to the uÅ¿ual Form: As to the PreÅ¿idents, there are a great many where it has been, and I am Å¿ure a great many where it has not been; and I am Å¿ure for this Six, Seven or Eight Years laÅ¿t paÅ¿t, it has always been omitted: And, with SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to your LordÅ¿hip, it is not at all neceÅ¿Å¿ary: If there be words in the indictment which Å¿hew, that what he did was againÅ¿t the Duty of his Allegiance to his Lawful and Undoubted Lord (which are the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66404:4"/>
words in this Indictment). It is true, if he be not a Subject born, <hi>naturalem</hi> cannot be in, becauÅ¿e that is contradictory to the Obedience which he owes, for it is not a Natural Obedience that he owes, but a Local; but if a Man be a Subject born, and commits TreaÅ¿on againÅ¿t the Allegiance that he ows, that is againÅ¿t his natural Allegiance; for whatÅ¿oever he does againÅ¿t his Allegiance, he does againÅ¿t his natural Allegiance, and Å¿o there's no need to put in the word <hi>naturalem;</hi> becauÅ¿e he owes no other Allegiance but that; it is Å¿ufficient if that be put in which Å¿hews its being againÅ¿t his Allegiance. If they could Å¿hew that a Subject born has two Allegiances, one that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the other that is not natural; then if you would proÅ¿ecute him you muÅ¿t Å¿hew, whether it was againÅ¿t his Natural, or againÅ¿t his other Allegiance. But when he has none but a natural Allegiance, certainly againÅ¿t his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without putting in natural, will be well enough. It is true where there is no natural Allegiance, it muÅ¿t be wrong if you put it in, becauÅ¿e you put in that Allegiance which he does not owe; but where he is a Subject born, to put in natural Liege-Lord there is no ground at all for it; there are words enow that Å¿hew it was againÅ¿t his Allegiance to his Lawful and Undoubted Lord.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower,</hi> how does it appear, that theÅ¿e Men are Subjects born? The matter you go upon does not appear upon the Indictment, and you are not to go off from that.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You quote <hi>Calvin</hi>'s CaÅ¿e, and the other CaÅ¿es that are there put; thoÅ¿e are all CaÅ¿es of Aliens; there is Dr. <hi>Lopez</hi>'s CaÅ¿e; He being an Alien comes into <hi>England,</hi> and commits High TreaÅ¿on: Why, Å¿ay they, how Å¿hall we Indict this man? We cannot Å¿ay it is <hi>Contra Naturalem Dominam Å¿uam;</hi> for he owes no Natural Allegiance to the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> How Å¿hall we do to frame a good Indictment againÅ¿t this man? They conÅ¿idered of this; and they Å¿aid it will be a good Indictment, to charge him with High-TreaÅ¿on, or any one elÅ¿e, leaving out the word <hi>Naturalem:</hi> For if it appear he has committed an Offence againÅ¿t the Laws of the Kingdom, and againÅ¿t the Duty of his Allegiance, which is High-TreaÅ¿on, that's enough. Now as to <hi>Tucker</hi>'s CaÅ¿e, it was ReverÅ¿ed for want of the ConcluÅ¿ion, <hi>contra Debitum Ligeantiae Å¿uae.</hi> ThoÅ¿e words are material; for let the Offence be never Å¿o much againÅ¿t the PerÅ¿on of the King, as to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate him, or Levy War againÅ¿t him, yet Å¿till if it be not againÅ¿t the Duty of his Allegiance, as it cannot be if he owes him none, it is not High-TreaÅ¿on. And therefore if it be againÅ¿t his Allegiance, whether that Allegiance be Natural, or Local, it is all one, it's enough to make it High-TreaÅ¿on.</p>

If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip pleaÅ¿es, the Words in the Indictment are thus; as to the firÅ¿t Overt Act, it is laid in this manner, <hi>Et ad execrabilem AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inationem illam exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quend.</hi> at Å¿uch a time and Å¿uch a place <hi>proditorie tractaverunt propoÅ¿uerunt &amp; ConÅ¿ultaverunt devijs modis &amp; medijs et &amp;c,</hi> and then comes this which we except againÅ¿t; <hi>&amp; ConÅ¿enÅ¿erunt Agreaverunt &amp; AÅ¿Å¿encerunt quod Quadragin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Homines &amp;c.</hi> Now this is a plain DiÅ¿tinct Act, and there is no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie</hi> to it; and if ever they can Å¿hew me any Indictment, in which an Overt Act was laid, of which they gave any Evidence, and it had not the Word <hi>proditorie</hi> in it I am very much miÅ¿taken. I am Å¿ure, I never Å¿aw any Å¿uch. And it is not enough to Å¿ay, that the nature of the thing is Å¿uch, as that it cannot but be a TreaÅ¿onable Act; but they muÅ¿t alledg it to be Å¿o, by the expreÅ¿s uÅ¿e of that Word, which the Law has appointed to expreÅ¿s this Crime by. In the CaÅ¿e of an Indictment for Felony, if it be not Å¿aid Felony, it is not good. They are not to DiÅ¿cribe that by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, which is a particular Crime fixt by Law, they muÅ¿t uÅ¿e the <hi>Verba Artis,</hi> the terms of Art, and no other: If your LordÅ¿hip pleaÅ¿es it may be read.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>Then the Jury againÅ¿t Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> came in, and deliver'd in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, as it is in his Tryal, then afterwards the Court went on thus.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the Objection is, that <hi>proditorie</hi> is not in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed into that Particular ClauÅ¿e of the Indictment, which Å¿hews there Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agrement that there Å¿hould be Forty Men, whereof the Four nam'd in the Indictment were to be Four. Now your LordÅ¿hip ObÅ¿erves how the Indictment Runs, it is for CompaÅ¿Å¿ing and Imagining the Death and DeÅ¿truction of the King; and it Å¿etsforth for this purpoÅ¿e, that to effect this CompaÅ¿Å¿ing and Imagination, they <hi>Proditorie tractaverunt &amp; ConÅ¿ulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt de vijs medijs &amp; Modis,</hi> how they Å¿hould Kill the King. Now that which Imediatley follows after is, the particular method, and means that were agreed upon, that is, that there Å¿hould be Forty Men. Now this is the Å¿trangeÅ¿t Å¿uggeÅ¿tion that ever was, when we have Å¿et forth, that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouÅ¿ly they Did Å¿o agree of the ways and means, and then Å¿et forth the particular means that here muÅ¿t be <hi>proditorie</hi> again to that. This is Å¿uch a ConÅ¿truction as I cannot but admire how it could come into any ones head. It is part of the Å¿entence; for the other part, as we have laid it, is not Compleat before: It may be it might be Å¿ufficient without Å¿etting forth the particular way, and means, but when it is Å¿et forth, it is part of the Å¿entence, and Refers to the firÅ¿t beginning.</p>

Now how is the Å¿entence done? The next Word is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction Copulative, <hi>&amp; ConÅ¿enÅ¿erunt, &amp;c.</hi> And what is the uÅ¿e of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction Copulative? But to Convey the Force of the Words in a Former Å¿entence to the Å¿entence following, and to prevent the Repetition of every Word in the Å¿ubÅ¿equent Å¿entence that was in the precedent: But it is plain, they are both one and the Å¿ame Overt Act, and theÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿equent Words are only an Explanation, more particularly of the Overt Act Å¿etforth in the precedent Words.</p>

               <p>In anÅ¿wer to that, that has been Å¿aid, if they Å¿hew me any precedent, where an Indictment has been for High TreaÅ¿on, Å¿etting forth Å¿everal Overt Acts, and not the Word <hi>proditorie</hi> Å¿et to every Overt Act, then they anÅ¿wer my Objection. If the Word <hi>Quod</hi> had come in, that would have made them diÅ¿tinct to be Å¿ure; and I think they are as diÅ¿tinct Acts now; Å¿uppoÅ¿e they had Concluded at the end of the word <hi>Interficerent</hi> that had been a good Overt Act, I am Å¿ure they will agree that: And if it be Å¿o, then the other is a good Overt Act too. For it is a diÅ¿tinct thing from that which was a perfect Å¿entence before; and it either requires a likewiÅ¿e or the Word <hi>Proditorie</hi> muÅ¿t be repeated. They have not Å¿o much as Å¿aid <hi>Å¿imiliter ConÅ¿enterunt</hi> or <hi>Å¿imili modo</hi> ther is an <hi>(&amp;)</hi> indeed, but that does not Å¿o Couple the Å¿entences together, as not to make them diÅ¿tinct Acts.

Now our Objection is, that it does not appear, that any one of theÅ¿e Overt Acts are the preÅ¿entment of the Jury; With SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion they ought to have begun it again, either with a <hi>Quodque,</hi> or Å¿omething that Å¿hould have referred it to the firÅ¿t, <hi>Juratores preÅ¿entant,</hi> or elÅ¿e they muÅ¿t have begun quite again, with a <hi>Juratores Ulterius preÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> and not have coupled them as this is with an <hi>ulterius preÅ¿entant,</hi> and not have Coupled them as this is with an <hi>Et.</hi> The moÅ¿t forms begin with an <hi>Ulterius preÅ¿entant,</hi> but here we find no Overt Act is Å¿o Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. They might preÅ¿ent part, and not preÅ¿ent the other part, for any thing that does appear. Every Thing ought to be laid poÅ¿itively, as the Jury's. <hi>Dictum,</hi> it may be onely the Clerks Å¿aying, and not the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for any thing that do's appear. Your LordÅ¿hip remembers the CaÅ¿e of the King and <hi>Trobridge: Trobridge</hi> upon a Writ of Error to ReverÅ¿e a Judgment for Erecting and Continuing a Cottage againÅ¿t the form of the Statute, now <hi>Contra formam Statuti</hi> was in the begining of the Indictment; but not in the ConcluÅ¿ion; to the Erecting, but not to the Continuing. And tho there was there <hi>Juratores, Ulterius dicunt,</hi> it was not <hi>Å¿uper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Å¿uum,</hi> and they did not Å¿ay, he did continue it againÅ¿t the Statute, and there being no formal, preÅ¿entment that he maintain'd the Cottage notwithÅ¿tanding the Act, <hi>Et</hi> did no Å¿o Couple it to the firÅ¿t part, as to make it a good preÅ¿entment. So we Å¿ay in this CaÅ¿e, this is a fault, and different from all the Common Forms; there ought to be a Direct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entment of each Overt Act, and not Coupled by an <hi>Et.</hi> For <hi>Et</hi> will not do it; for it is a DiÅ¿tinct Overt Act every one, and Å¿hould have been <hi>Et Quod ConÅ¿ultaverunt, quodque Agreaverunt,</hi> that a certain number Å¿hould do Å¿o and Å¿o, and to be Å¿ure, it Å¿hould have been Å¿o at the laÅ¿t Overt Act, which is onely, <hi>Et ijdem ChriÅ¿tophorus Knightley</hi> did Buy Arms and HorÅ¿es. Now this laÅ¿t <hi>Et,</hi> being a looÅ¿e Conjunction <hi>Copulative,</hi> in common Sence ought to Refer to that which they had agreed upon, for that is laÅ¿t mention'd there, and the natural Sence leads thither, and not to the begining of the Bill <hi>Juratores preÅ¿entant quod.</hi>

               <p>The Indictment Å¿etsforth, that they Commited Å¿uch, and Å¿uch TreaÅ¿on; Their objection is that <hi>Quodque</hi> is not put in to every overt Act, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66404:6"/>
our AnÅ¿wer is, That the firÅ¿t <hi>Quod</hi> governs all that relates to that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. It may be if there were two diÅ¿tinct TreaÅ¿ons in the Indictment, when you come to Å¿et forth the Second TreaÅ¿on, you Å¿hould Å¿ay <hi>Jurato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ulterius preÅ¿entant</hi> the Second TreaÅ¿on; but the Overt Acts to prove the Å¿ame TreaÅ¿on, are all parts of that TreaÅ¿on, and make but one Species of TreaÅ¿on, which is the imagining the Death of the King. There's the TreaÅ¿on; and to bring it to paÅ¿s, they did Å¿o, and Å¿o: This, my Lord, muÅ¿t be part of the finding of the Jury as well as the TreaÅ¿on it Å¿elf, of which theÅ¿e are the Overt Acts. But then if you will lay the levying of War in the Å¿ame Indictment, then it may be you muÅ¿t Å¿ay <hi>Juratores ulterius preÅ¿entant quod,</hi> &amp;c. But it had been a Å¿trange AbÅ¿urdity to Å¿ay, <hi>Juratores ulterius preÅ¿entant</hi> Å¿uch and Å¿uch Overt Acts: For the Overt Act is not a further Indictment, but only a Å¿etting forth that which is Evidence, upon which they found the Indictment for TreaÅ¿on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>What the Indictment Å¿ays, is a direct Affirmation as can be all along in the PreÅ¿entment of the Jury, that the PriÅ¿oner and others did compaÅ¿s and imagine the Death of the King, and to bring it about, they did conÅ¿ult together, and did agree to make uÅ¿e of Å¿uch and Å¿uch Means, and were to have a Party of 40 Men, and they bought Arms and HorÅ¿es. Now it does not repeat <hi>quodque,</hi> or <hi>ulterius preÅ¿entant quod,</hi> to every one of thoÅ¿e Sentences, that they did Å¿o and Å¿o, and that they did Å¿o and Å¿o. Now I would feign know the Difference between Å¿aying, and they did Å¿uch a thing, and Å¿aying, and that they did Å¿uch a thing. That's all the Difference that they think to overturn this Indictment for. The omitting of a <hi>Juratores ulterius preÅ¿entant,</hi> certainly is nothing; for the firÅ¿t PreÅ¿entment runs through the whole Indictment, and there does not need an <hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No indeed, I think it is better as it is, than as you would have had it; becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t <hi>Quod</hi> goes through the whole, That in Order thereunto he did Å¿o and Å¿o, would you have it Å¿aid <hi>&amp; quod</hi> in Order thereunto he did Å¿o and Å¿o, but that may be good SenÅ¿e, I think it is not Å¿o good as the other. This Indictment is for one Å¿ort of TreaÅ¿on, and that is, for compaÅ¿Å¿ing the Death of the King; and it is, I think, more proper to have but one <hi>Quod,</hi> than to have more; for it makes the whole Indictment more entire. As to the <hi>Juratores ulterius preÅ¿entant,</hi> that is never proper, where the <hi>Species</hi> of TreaÅ¿on is the Å¿ame: For indeed if there had been two diÅ¿tinct TreaÅ¿ons, the one for compaÅ¿Å¿ing the Death of the King, and the other for levying of War, in that CaÅ¿e you muÅ¿t bring it in by <hi>ulterius preÅ¿entant:</hi> becauÅ¿e they are two Å¿everal Offences, tho' comprisd in one Bill, and they are in Law as two Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And Å¿o it is in the CaÅ¿e that you mention'd of Cottages: It is one Offence to erect a Cottage, and another Offence to continue a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and they are to have Å¿everal PuniÅ¿hments; and becauÅ¿e they were jumbled them both together in one Indictment, that Indictment was held to be nought: For by Law, the Indictment for erecting a Cottage, ought to conclude <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> and then the Jury muÅ¿t begin again, <hi>&amp; ulterius preÅ¿entant quod</hi> the Cottage was continu'd againÅ¿t the Form of the Statute; becauÅ¿e they are Å¿everal Offences. But here the High TreaÅ¿on is but one, and the Å¿ame Offence, and the other things are but Overt Acts to manifeÅ¿t this TreaÅ¿on, the compaÅ¿Å¿ing the Death of the King; and truly I think it is better as it is.</p>

               <p>May it pleaÅ¿e your LordÅ¿hip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; This is an Indictment of High-TreaÅ¿on that is found againÅ¿t four PerÅ¿ons; but the particular TreaÅ¿on againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar is for compaÅ¿Å¿ing and imagining the Death of the King, and endeavouring to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government, and enÅ¿lave the Nation to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King: And the Indictment Å¿ets forth, that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar did for this purpoÅ¿e meet and conÅ¿ult with Å¿everal falÅ¿e Traytors to the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66404:9"/>
of the way, manner, and means how, and the time and place when and where to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King; and at length they agreed that forty HorÅ¿emen Å¿hould go together, and Å¿et upon the King in his Coach, as he returned from Hunting; Å¿ome to attack the Coach, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Å¿et upon the Guards. The Indictment does further charge him with getting HorÅ¿es and Arms, and particularly with carrying a LiÅ¿t of the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inators from one to another. TheÅ¿e are the particular things char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Indictment, and to this Indictment he has pleaded Not guilty; if we prove the Fact, Gentlemen, we don't doubt your JuÅ¿tice.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaÅ¿e your LordÅ¿hip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; The PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, <hi>Charles Cranburne,</hi> is indicted for High-TreaÅ¿on, in compaÅ¿Å¿ing and imagining the Death of the King. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment to prove the PriÅ¿oner guilty are, That he was at Å¿everal Meetings and ConÅ¿ultations about the manner of putting this DeÅ¿ign in Execution; at which Meetings it was agreed, That there Å¿hould be about forty HorÅ¿emen in Number prepare'd, and arm'd for that purpoÅ¿e, and they did provide HorÅ¿es and Arms for that very thing, and did agree to put it in execution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Evidence that you will hear produc'd againÅ¿t the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner at the Bar will be of this Nature. You will hear from the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es, that about <hi>ChriÅ¿tmas</hi> laÅ¿t, or the Beginning of <hi>January,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> did come over from <hi>France</hi> from the late King <hi>James,</hi> to whom he was an Officer in his Guards, with a CommiÅ¿Å¿ion for attacking the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or levying War upon his PerÅ¿on. He came over about that time, and Å¿everal Troopers of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Guards, to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him in that barbarous ConÅ¿piracy. When Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> came over, he did acquaint with this DeÅ¿ign Å¿everal PerÅ¿ons in <hi>England,</hi> that he thought proper to be Accomplices with him in it, particularly Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and Å¿everal others whoÅ¿e Names you will hear of, and they had Å¿everal Meetings about it the Beginning of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, at the <hi>Nagg's Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Places where they conÅ¿ulted in what manner they might attempt and accompliÅ¿h this Bloody DeÅ¿ign.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will hear, that at theÅ¿e Meetings it was propos'd, that they Å¿hould do it by AmbuÅ¿cade as the King came from <hi>Richmond</hi> a Hunting, whither he uÅ¿ed to go upon <hi>Saturdays:</hi> Others were for doing it on this Å¿ide the Water. And Å¿o their Opinions being divided, it was thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary to find out and Å¿ettle which was the beÅ¿t Place; and in order thereunto they employ'd Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>King</hi> (who was executed) to view the Ground, and accordingly they went, and pitch'd upon the Lane between <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnam Green</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, as the moÅ¿t convenient Place: And having Å¿o done, they came back and gave an Account to thoÅ¿e that had appointed to meet 'em, to hear the SucceÅ¿s of their Expedition, to the <hi>Nagg's Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and in that Place you will find by the Evidence, that thoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons, who were the Heads of the ConÅ¿piracy, undertook to find their Å¿everal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, for whom they would undertake that would go with them, and be concern'd in this DeÅ¿ign. Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to furniÅ¿h about 20. He had the Command of the Troopers that came from <hi>France,</hi> and thoÅ¿e other Officers that came thence, were under him. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was to furniÅ¿h 7, <hi>Chernock</hi> was to furniÅ¿h 8, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was to furniÅ¿h 5 HorÅ¿es and 3 Men, and, I think, <hi>Lowick</hi> was to furniÅ¿h Å¿ome more: In the whole Number they reckon'd there Å¿hould be about 40.</p>
               <p>It will appear, Gentlemen, that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was one of the Men that Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> undertook to get, and engage in this DeÅ¿ign; and accordingly Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> did acquaint Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> with it; and he did undertake to be one, and to be ready to go with him, and be concerned in this AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination. You will find he was acquainted with it about the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> the Day before the firÅ¿t time that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66404:10"/>
to aÅ¿Å¿ault the King: Then he did undertake and agree to prepare himÅ¿elf againÅ¿t the next Day. The next Day which was the 15th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> they had Å¿everal Meetings, and they were making Preparation in order to go out. It happen'd by great Providence his MajeÅ¿ty did not go abroad that Day, and thereupon they diÅ¿pers'd themÅ¿elves; but they had Meetings afterwards, at which Meetings the PriÅ¿oner was preÅ¿ent, with Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s, La Rue,</hi> and Å¿everal others that were concerned in the ConÅ¿piracy, particularly the 21Å¿t of <hi>February,</hi> the Day before the Å¿econd time they were to have put this in Execution. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> being at the Sun-Tavern, with Å¿everal other Gentlemen, and they reÅ¿olving to have it executed the next Day, if the King went abroad. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿ent for <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and <hi>Keys</hi> that was executed, and <hi>Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Sherborn,</hi> four of thoÅ¿e that he had undertaken for, (of whom, I Å¿ay, <hi>Cranburne,</hi> the Prifoner at the Bar, was one) and then he acquainted 'em that they were reÅ¿olv'd to go on with it the next Day. And then they agreed to be in a readineÅ¿s accordingly. The next Day the PriÅ¿oner with Å¿ome others met at Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s, where they were preparing to go out and attack the King, and they had Å¿everal DiÅ¿courÅ¿es about the Ways and and Means of doing it; and particularly Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> at that time Å¿aid, that he had a very good Gun that held about 6 or 8 Bullets, and that Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraÅ¿s</hi> was to have, who was to attack the Coach, and Å¿hoot into the Coach: Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> was there preÅ¿ent at that time, and Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> was employ'd particularly by Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> to carry a LiÅ¿t that <hi>Porter</hi> writ of the Names of Å¿everal Men that were to act in it under him, and this he was to carry to <hi>Chernock. Porter</hi> writ it and gave it him, and he carry'd it with Directions to bring it back with the LiÅ¿t of the Names of Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>'s Men. <hi>Cranburne</hi> did accordingly at that time carry the LiÅ¿t of the Names to Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and brought it back with an additional LiÅ¿t, from Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> of his Men.</p>
               <p>At that time you will hear farther, when <hi>Cranburne</hi> brought the LiÅ¿t, he brought an Account that he heard the King did certainly go abroad: for Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> had Intelligence Å¿o from Chambers, who lay at <hi>KenÅ¿ington</hi> to get Intelligence: At which there was very great rejoycing among all that were preÅ¿ent at that time, hoping they Å¿hould have an Opportunity to put this execrable DeÅ¿ign in Execution; and Å¿o they prepar'd all of 'em to go out. There were Å¿everal Inns in <hi>Turnam</hi> Green and <hi>Brentford,</hi> and therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and they were to be plac'd, two or three in an Inn, that they might be ready to get together when time Å¿hould Å¿erve. It happen'd the King did not go abroad that Day neither, there being Å¿ome DiÅ¿covery of this DeÅ¿ign, and Å¿o they did diÅ¿perÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, as apprehending it was diÅ¿cover'd.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will appear by Å¿everal WitneÅ¿Å¿es, that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar was engag'd in this Horrid TreaÅ¿onable DeÅ¿ign, and was to have acted a Part in it. We will call our WitneÅ¿Å¿es that will make the Particulars out to you, and we do not queÅ¿tion but you'll do what is right. FirÅ¿t, call Capt. <hi>Porter, (who was Å¿worn.)</hi>

               <p>My Lord, before this wicked AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination was on foot, the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburne,</hi> was employ'd by me to buy Arms. I us'd to give him Money to go to the Brokers to buy Arms at Å¿econd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and he brought a Sword-Cutler to me, of whom I bought about 20 Swords. And when Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was reÅ¿olv'd upon, I acquainted him with the DeÅ¿ign, and promis'd to mount him. He never was at any of the Meetings with Capt. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> or Sir <hi>William Parkyns;</hi> but he went to look for a HorÅ¿e, and was ready both <hi>Saturdays</hi> to go along with me. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d I Å¿ent him with a MeÅ¿Å¿age to Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> for the Note for the two HorÅ¿es, which he had promiÅ¿ed me to furniÅ¿h me with, out of his five that he was to furniÅ¿h; he came back again, and told me that there was

a MeÅ¿Å¿enger came and Å¿aid that the King did go out, and he knew where to have the two HorÅ¿es; that Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was affraid we Å¿hould not have the full number of Men, and deÅ¿ired me to Å¿end him the Names of my Men; I did write a LiÅ¿t of the Names of my Men, and I went afterwards to the <hi>Blew-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> whither he was to come to me; he did Å¿o, and he brought back the LiÅ¿t of my Men, with the LiÅ¿t of Mr. <hi>Charnocks</hi> Men writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten underneath it, and at the Å¿ame time News was brought that the King did not go abroad that day.</p>

               <p>I told him there was a DeÅ¿ign on foot, and I would tell him more when I Å¿aw him next; and I deÅ¿ir'd him to get the Swords from the Sword-Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and the PiÅ¿tols clean and ready. And I met him afterwards, and told him of the DeÅ¿ign, and that we intended to do it on Saturday the fifteenth; and he ingaged to be ready and make one. On the Friday before the twenty Å¿econd he went with me to the Cock-pit, and there we met with one Mr. <hi>Gun,</hi> and I askt him if he knew where any good Hackney-HorÅ¿es might be had? He Å¿aid he believed he did; and I Å¿ent <hi>Cranburn</hi> with him, and he came back, and told me he had found two or three out in <hi>Bloomsbury.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, this may be a very material part of our Defence, and therefore we muÅ¿t inquire a little the more into it. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> is pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿ay, that he was in a Room with Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Charnock,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkins;</hi> and he came out into another Room, where was Mr. <hi>Cranburn, Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Keys:</hi> and there he Å¿ays, after he had been there Å¿ome time, <hi>Gunn</hi> came in, I deÅ¿ire to know, whether <hi>Gunn</hi> was there when he firÅ¿t came in?</p>

               <p>At the time that you Communicated this DeÅ¿ign to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> what Å¿aid he to you?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is too long a Story to tell you all that I know of this Matter; but, if you pleaÅ¿e, I will tell you what concerns the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar. I am heartily Å¿orry that I have occaÅ¿ion to appear againÅ¿t him, as I wou'd be truly againÅ¿t any Body: But Å¿ince I am here upon my Oath, I muÅ¿t declare the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and I hope I Å¿hall not declare any thing but what is Truth. Upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 15th. of <hi>February,</hi> the Day that the DeÅ¿ign was to have been put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againÅ¿t His MajeÅ¿ty, and all that were in the Coach with him, and againÅ¿t his Guards, I went to Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Norfolk-Å¿treet,</hi> to inform my Å¿elf, whether they reÅ¿olved on that Day to go out upon the DeÅ¿ign; and I found by Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> that they did reÅ¿olve it, and I Å¿tay'd there a while, till Å¿uch time as Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> came in; I did not know whence he came then, but, as I was informed afterwards, he came from <hi>KenÅ¿ington</hi> to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and his Boots were dirty; and Mr <hi>Chernock</hi> told me he had Å¿ent a MeÅ¿Å¿enger to Mr. <hi>Porter, And,</hi> Å¿ays he, <hi>if you will Å¿tay a little time, I Å¿hall have an AnÅ¿wer.</hi> The MeÅ¿Å¿enger came back, and told him, That Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> din'd at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden.</hi> I did not go to Dine with him, but went home, where I Å¿aw Mr. <hi>King</hi> at my Lodging, who told me, that the King did not go out that Day. I told him, I heard he did not: I found by Mr. <hi>Chamber</hi>'s coming back, and that we had no notice from Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> that it was concluded the King did not go out as it was Å¿uppoÅ¿ed he Å¿hou'd have gone. When I had din'd at my Lodging, I went to the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66404:13"/>
Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and there were Four, or Five, or Six People with him; there was one Mr. <hi>Sherborn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kendrick,</hi> and Two People that I never Å¿aw before, and another PerÅ¿on, but I can't tell now who he was. When we had been there a little while, comes in this unfortunate Man at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cranburn;</hi> I don't know where he had been; but by his coming in Å¿o late, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e he had not din'd, and he ordered the Drawer to get him Å¿ome CoÅ¿telets. This is all that I can Å¿ay as to that Day: I had Å¿een Captain <hi>Porter</hi> twice or thrice between that, and the 22d. and he deÅ¿ired me to be at home on <hi>Friday</hi> Night, between Eight and Nine, and he wou'd Å¿end to me: He did Å¿end, and I was from home. But when I came, I was informed his Servant had been to Å¿peak with me; and in the Morning, about Eight or Nine a Clock, <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. he Å¿ent his Servant to me to tell me his MaÅ¿ter would Å¿peak with me at his Lodgings. I went to his Lodgings, and he then lay in <hi>Maiden-Lane,</hi> at one <hi>Brown</hi>'s a Surgeon's: When I came in, he was in Bed; and he told me in <hi>French, Tonts Parties Å¿ont PreÅ¿ts.</hi> All Parties are ready. I underÅ¿tood all along that there were Three Parties to be engag'd; one to attack the King's Coach, and the Two others the Guards; Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to head the firÅ¿t, and <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Rookwood,</hi> the reÅ¿t. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> aroÅ¿e and dreÅ¿s'd himÅ¿elf, and in came Mr. <hi>Cranburn;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> went out to him into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Room, and what he Å¿aid I can't tell: But Å¿oon after came in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraÅ¿s,</hi> Mr. <hi>Key,</hi> and Mr <hi>King,</hi> and then he takes Pen, Ink, and Paper.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Who took that?</p>

               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and writes down a LiÅ¿t of his Party, and puts me down firÅ¿t. Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> ask'd me if I was the Captain, and I made him Å¿ome AnÅ¿wer, but what in particular I cannot tell; I think I told him, I knew of the thing before the moÅ¿t did: But I can remember particularly that LiÅ¿t was given to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> to carry to Mr. <hi>Chernock;</hi> upon what Account it was, I cannot tell; but I concluded, that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was to be acquainted with thoÅ¿e Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons that <hi>Porter</hi> was Å¿ure off: And Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> at that time told me that he was diÅ¿appointed of Å¿ome People, and deÅ¿ired me to get him Å¿ome other Men in their rooms; and he Å¿ent particularly to one that Mr. <hi>King</hi> propoÅ¿ed; and I did go, and brought him to the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts,</hi> where Captain <hi>Porter</hi> told me he was to Dine; and the Gentleman I went to, told me he wou'd meet me at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden.</hi> When I came back to Mr. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Lodgings, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> and I, went in a Coach to the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden;</hi> and when we had been there a little while, Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> came back to give an Account of the Errand Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> had Å¿ent him upon, and he brings this LiÅ¿t.</p>

               <p>This was <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 22d. of <hi>February;</hi> and he told Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> there was a LiÅ¿t of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Men at the bottom of that LiÅ¿t, and I took the LiÅ¿t in my Hand, and there was Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s LiÅ¿t of Six or Seven, or thereabouts, of his Party, and at the bottom of it was <hi>R. C.</hi> I think, for <hi>Robert Chernock.</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> takes Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> from the Company into another Room, and I went after them, and he told Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> in my hearing, that the King did not go out that Day. There is one thing I forgot, which now I recollect, and I am upon my Oath to tell the Truth, and the whole Truth: When I was at Mr. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Lodging, he told me the King was to go out; and that Mr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the Orderly Man, had Å¿ent word, That the King reÅ¿olv'd to go out between Ten and Eleven.</p>

               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> told me Å¿o at Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, I Å¿ay I had forgot it, but it occurs to my memory now, that he told me there before we went to the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts,</hi> that the King did go out that Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 10 and 11; for Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> the Orderly man had been with Mr. <hi>Chernock<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> or Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> to let them know Å¿o much. And afterwards when he came back with the LiÅ¿t of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Men, to Captain <hi>Porter</hi> at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in the <hi>Spring-Garden;</hi> there was at the foot of that LiÅ¿t, a LiÅ¿t of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s men in another hand. I Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e writ by himÅ¿elf, but that I cannot Å¿wear whoÅ¿e hand it was, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> took him into another Room, and then <hi>Cranburn</hi> told him the King did not go out, and I believe it was then between 11 and 12 a Clock, and he alÅ¿o told Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was apprehenÅ¿ive the thing was DiÅ¿covered, and therefore deÅ¿ired him to have a care of himÅ¿elf, for he himÅ¿elf was reÅ¿olv'd not to lie at home that Night; I think my Lord, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> did Å¿end back Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> I cannot be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itive whether he did or not, but I believe he did, becauÅ¿e I am Å¿ure Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> did tell Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would Å¿peak with him, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> made anÅ¿wer, Why Å¿hould he deÅ¿ire me to go to him, when he knows I am under Å¿ome Ill CircumÅ¿tances, and he can better come to me? and I believe Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> did Å¿end Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> once again to Mr. <hi>Chernock.</hi>

                  </hi> nor did Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> come to him, therefore they Å¿tay'd there and din'd; and after Dinner, or a little before Dinner, <hi>Keyes</hi> the Trumpeter, came up, and told us that my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment of the Guards was return'd from <hi>Richmond,</hi> foaming: <hi>Keyes</hi> wen down Å¿tairs again to learn Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as I thought, and came up and told us he Å¿aw the King's Coaches newly return'd to the <hi>Mews,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was by all the time; I think this was before Dinner, and then we went to Dinner.</p>

               <p>I am poÅ¿itive as to the thing, and that it was the 22th. of <hi>February,</hi> but I cannot be poÅ¿itive as to all the CircumÅ¿tances: After Dinner there was the uÅ¿ual Healths<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the Jacobite Healths to King <hi>James</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the ReÅ¿toration, and the like; and after that<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> I think it was Mr <hi>Porter</hi> took an Orange in his hand and Å¿queez'd it, I am Å¿ure one in the Company did, and drank<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Å¿omething to the Rotten Orange, I cannot very well remember juÅ¿t now what it was; but I wou'd be cautions of Å¿aying any thing but what is Truth, but if your LordÅ¿hip will give me leave to recollect my Å¿elf, I will tell you what it wasâOh! it was to the Å¿queezing of the Rotten Orange, and the Health went round, and Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was in the Company, and drank the Health, but being diÅ¿appointed and fruÅ¿trated of the DeÅ¿ign by the King's not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad that Day, and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> being caution'd by Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to take care of himÅ¿elf, and being told that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> wou'd not lye at home that Night: and the Guards returning in that manner, they were all apprehenÅ¿ive that the Thing had taken Air, and the deÅ¿ign of AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the King was DiÅ¿covered, and therefore Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> concluded of going out of Town; Å¿everal Healths were drink round, and I think about Two a Clock he went out of Town, and then the Company broke up.

Mr. <hi>King</hi> was by, and Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> was by, and I think Mr. <hi>Keyes</hi> was by, and he writ a LiÅ¿t of his Party, putting me down FirÅ¿t, and Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> Å¿aid to me, You are Captain, and he gave it to Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to carry it to Mr. <hi>Chernock;</hi> what the particular MeÅ¿Å¿age was, I cannot be poÅ¿itive: Indeed I don't very well remember the MeÅ¿Å¿age, but the LiÅ¿t was carry'd to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and to the beÅ¿t of my Memory it was to give Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> an Account what men he was Å¿ure of; for Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> told me of Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diÅ¿appointments he had had, of PerÅ¿ons that had promis'd him and fail'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. De la Rue.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I Å¿ay you told Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> bid you caution him to take care of himÅ¿elf, and that he wou'd go that way, for Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and he, deÅ¿ired to Å¿ee him; and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿aid it was an unreaÅ¿onable thing for Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to deÅ¿ire it, becauÅ¿e they knew he was under CircumÅ¿tances that it was not proper for him to go, and he wondered rather they would not come to him.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the 13th of <hi>February</hi> laÅ¿t, I came out of <hi>HampÅ¿hire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿ent for me to come to Town, and I met him that day at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> and there he told me of the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ination that was to be done on <hi>Saturday</hi> following: The next day we dined at the <hi>RoÅ¿e-Tavern,</hi> where the PriÅ¿oner dined with us, and we talk'd of the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, that was <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi> and we were to be in readineÅ¿s the next day to aÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, as he was coming from <hi>Richmond;</hi> but Å¿ome Company coming in afterwards; we left off the DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e and talk'd no more that Night. The next day that we were to do the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, we met at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and finding the King did not go abroad that <hi>Saturday,</hi> we dined there at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts,</hi> and talk'd over again of AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inating the King, and the PriÅ¿oner was by at the Å¿ame time, they were all mightily concerned the King did not go that <hi>Saturday;</hi> but when we had dined there, we had no further DiÅ¿courÅ¿e about the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination that day, but every body was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare againÅ¿t the next <hi>Saturday.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Was that agreed upon then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. PendergraÅ¿s.</speaker>
               <p>Yes it was, by all the Company; Å¿o we parted that day. Some time the next Week I met Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ask'd me if I had a HorÅ¿eman's Sword; I told him no: Says he to Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> let Captain <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> have one of the HorÅ¿emens Swords that you have got. Says Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> to me, if you will come to my HouÅ¿e you Å¿hall make choice of one your Å¿elf, for I have Å¿everal at home. Said I, Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> I cannot go that way, but I'll take one of your Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, if Å¿o be you'll leave it at my Lodgings: He Å¿aid he would do it, and did; he left it at my Lodgings in <hi>Suffolk-Street,</hi> which Sword I have Å¿till. The day following I met him, and he ask'd me if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Sword; I Å¿aid I had it; and he Å¿aid, it was very well. After this I did not Å¿ee Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> till <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> at which time I came to Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings between Nine and Ten a Clock in the Morning, and the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar was there, and I heard Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> give him a MeÅ¿Å¿age to go to Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> for Å¿ome HorÅ¿es, I know not how many. The PriÅ¿oner went, and in Å¿ome time after, came back again, and brought an account that the King went out that <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> Å¿o every body was to get ready: And Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> Å¿aid, that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> deÅ¿ired that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> would Å¿end a LiÅ¿t of his Men; upon which Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> wrote a LiÅ¿t of his Men, and gave it to the PriÅ¿oner to carry it to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and bid him meet him at the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and M. <hi>De la Rue</hi> and I took Coach, and went down to <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and when we came to the <hi>Blue-PoÅ¿ts,</hi> there were Å¿ome PerÅ¿ons that I think Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> had appointed to come there; the PriÅ¿oner comes thither, and brought the LiÅ¿t back, with a LiÅ¿t of Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Men underneath. I know not who the Men were, for I Å¿aw it only on the one Å¿ide of the Table, in Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Hand; at the Å¿ame time the PriÅ¿oner brought an account, that the King did not go abroad that day, and preÅ¿ently after we had the Å¿ame account from other Hands; and Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and I went out of Town, and we heard no more of it.</p>

But he does not recollect, nor Å¿wear to any MeÅ¿Å¿age that was Å¿ent from <hi>Porter</hi> by the PriÅ¿oner to Mr. <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock:</hi> Now, my Lord, the bare carrying of a Note of Names will be no Evidence of TreaÅ¿on. M. <hi>De la Rue</hi> does not Å¿wear to any Privity of the PriÅ¿oner, what the LiÅ¿t was for, nor to the Delivery of the LiÅ¿t, which is the Overt Act in the Indictment, nor upon what account this LiÅ¿t was written, or Å¿ent, or brought back again<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or any VVord that proceeded from Captain <hi>Porter</hi> to him upon giving the LiÅ¿t, or any VVord when it was brought back again. So that as to <hi>De la Rue</hi>'s TeÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, we muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit it to the Memories and Recollection of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and the Jury, we think he only proves a Plot in general, of which there is no peradventure, every Body is Å¿atisfied, that there was Å¿uch a horrible ConÅ¿piracy: thoÅ¿e that have been condemned and executed for it, have own'd it, and Å¿o it can never be doubted, but he does not Å¿ay any thing to affect the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar; for as to the drinking of Healths, and being preÅ¿ent when thoÅ¿e Healths were drank, tho' it be an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66404:15"/>
Evidence of DiÅ¿affection to the Government, or too much good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ComplaiÅ¿ance to the Company a Man is in, yet that DiÅ¿affection, or Evil Temper, or ComplaiÅ¿ance, we hope are no Evidences of TreaÅ¿on. It is plain the PriÅ¿oner did depend very much upon Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> he was in truth his Servant to go of his Errands, and expected an Office from him, God knows when; but it does not appear by any particular Action, that he did any thing that can be TreaÅ¿on, upon M. <hi>De la Rue</hi>'s Evidence. Then as to what Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> Å¿ays, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence comes home: For he Å¿ays there was a DeÅ¿ign of the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination, and Å¿ome Agreement of the PriÅ¿oner to it; but I muÅ¿t beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips Favour to obÅ¿erve, upon Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi>'s Evidence, if that Å¿tand alone, it will be but one WitneÅ¿s, and then we are Å¿afe by the Purview of this Act of Parliament.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Then, as to Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> I muÅ¿t beg leave to Å¿ay, If our WitneÅ¿Å¿es are come that were abÅ¿ent at the other Tryal, and they prove what is in my InÅ¿tructions, it well be very much QueÅ¿tionable, whether there be any Credibility due to his TeÅ¿timony: Then if you take off his TeÅ¿timony, there is only the Evidence of Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s;</hi> and if he be to be believed, to which I have nothing to Å¿ay at preÅ¿ent, in the CaÅ¿e of a Man's Life, upon an Indictment of TreaÅ¿on, where the Law requires two credible WitneÅ¿Å¿es, his Å¿ingle TeÅ¿timony is not Å¿ufficient to convict the PriÅ¿oner. We beg leave to call our WitneÅ¿Å¿es, and then we Å¿hall leave it to your LordÅ¿hip, and the Jury.</p>

               <p>As to the particular Overt-Act laid in the Indictment, the carrying about the LiÅ¿t, only M <hi>De la Rue</hi> Å¿peaks to it, and Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> has given it an AnÅ¿wer, and I Å¿hall not repeat it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Phipps.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we have one piece of Evidence to offer againÅ¿t the TeÅ¿timony of Captain <hi>Porter:</hi> He Å¿ays, That he Å¿ent <hi>Cranburn</hi> with <hi>Gunn</hi> from the Cock-pit to Å¿ee for Hackney-HorÅ¿es, and that <hi>Cranburn</hi> came to him to the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern, and there they had Å¿ome DiÅ¿courÅ¿e about exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the DeÅ¿ign the next Day; and being ask'd who was by, when he communicated the DeÅ¿ign to <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and particularly, Whether Mr. <hi>Gunn</hi> was by? he Å¿ays he came in afterwards, but was not there at the time of the Communication about the DeÅ¿ign. Now we Å¿hall prove that <hi>Gunn</hi> came in with the PriÅ¿oner, and was with him all the time, and there was no Å¿uch DiÅ¿courÅ¿e happen'd.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, our Inference from this Evidence is thus; Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿ays, that upon <hi>Fryday</hi> the 21th. of <hi>February</hi> he was with <hi>Cranburn</hi> at the <hi>Sun Tavern,</hi> and out of one Room into another he came to Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and talk'd with him of this DeÅ¿ign, and after that <hi>Gunn</hi> came in to the Room, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was over: Now this man Å¿wears he went from the Cock-pit with Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> he was with him in the Room at firÅ¿t when Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> came in; Å¿ome time afterwards he went to his own HouÅ¿e, and left Captain <hi>Porter</hi> with Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and came back again, and they came away together: Now we Å¿ay, theÅ¿e two are inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent; for Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿wears that <hi>Gunn</hi> was not there till after the Communication was over. L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi> As he remembers.</p>

               <p>Nay, I think he was poÅ¿itive he came in afterwards.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you do underÅ¿tand for what Crime this PriÅ¿oner at the Bar is Indicted: It is for High-TreaÅ¿on in deÅ¿igning and compaÅ¿Å¿ing the Death of the King, which was to be effected by an AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination, in the moÅ¿t Barbarous and wicked manner, that any attempt of that nature can poÅ¿Å¿ibly be made, being to Å¿urpriÅ¿e the King, and murder him in his Coach.</p>
               <p>The QueÅ¿tion Gentlemen is, whether this PriÅ¿oner be Guilty of this Crime or no; there have been three WitneÅ¿Å¿es produced that have given evidence againÅ¿t him; Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>De la Rue,</hi> and Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s,</hi> and they do all tell
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66404:17"/>
you, that there was Å¿uch a deÅ¿ign on Foot to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, as he came from Hunting at <hi>Richmond,</hi> after he came on this Å¿ide the Water, in the Lane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi> There were DiverÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons Ingaged in this DeÅ¿ign, which Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was come from <hi>France,</hi> to promote and manage Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> as it does appear upon his Evidence, was a PerÅ¿on that was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Ingaged, and at that time was hearty in the ProÅ¿ecution of it.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you he was a Man that he had had a long acquaintance with, and had Imployed him and deÅ¿igned to imploy as an Officer under him, in caÅ¿e a Revolution happened, which it Å¿eems about that time, and Å¿ome time before it was expected. Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> was to have been a Cap, and I think he deÅ¿ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote <hi>Cranburn</hi> to be his Quarter MaÅ¿ter; and he Å¿ent him to buy Arms; and preparations were made for that buÅ¿ineÅ¿s; but that is not the thing that we are now upon, the matter that now properly falls under our ConÅ¿ideration, is this, the coming over of Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Febuary</hi> laÅ¿t, upon which as it Å¿eems Mr <hi>Porter</hi> was Engaged, and having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t in this <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and there being HorÅ¿es to be furniÅ¿ht to attack the King and his Guards about <hi>Turnham green.</hi> This Man <hi>Cranburn,</hi> was a PerÅ¿on that was ingaged to be one of the HorÅ¿e-Men that were to make the attack, and he tells you that he did Imploy him to provide HorÅ¿es and Swords, and to prepare the PiÅ¿tols, and that he did Engage in it, and particularly that the deÅ¿ign was to be Executed on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and that he was then ready to go with Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> but on that <hi>Saturday</hi> the King did not go abroad, whereby the deÅ¿ign was DiÅ¿appointed for that time: Afterwards there was a meeting at the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where he met with Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> and others of them, and there comes to that Tavern Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> and others, and they were in an other Room, and Captain <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿ays he came to them, and did DiÅ¿courÅ¿e about purÅ¿uing the deÅ¿ign the very next Day, which was agreed, and <hi>Cranburn</hi> was ready to go the next Day.</p>
               <p>Then he tells you farther, that the next day being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. The Å¿econd time that this AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination was to have been Executed, upon the deÅ¿ire of Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> who was a PerÅ¿on alÅ¿o that was Ingaged in this deÅ¿ign. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> writes a LiÅ¿t of the Men he could bring, and Å¿ent it by <hi>Cranburn</hi> to <hi>Charnock; Cranburn</hi> carries the LiÅ¿t to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and brings it back again with an Addition of the names of Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Men underneath.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> is called, and he Swears to that very CircumÅ¿tance, that Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> was Å¿ent by Captain <hi>Porter</hi> with a LiÅ¿t to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and brought it back again from Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> with an Addition of other Names.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>PendergraÅ¿s</hi> tells you, that he was with this Mr. <hi>Cranburn,</hi> the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, the fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> and there was a diÅ¿courÅ¿e of going in purÅ¿uance of this deÅ¿ign the next day, and the PriÅ¿oner agreed to it, which he is poÅ¿itive in: he tells you, that when they were diÅ¿appointed the <hi>15th,</hi> being at the Blew-PoÅ¿ts, they then agreed to purÅ¿ue it the next <hi>Saturday; Cranburn</hi> was one of them that agreed.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>De la Rue</hi> informs you that Healths were drank to the late King, and the late Queen, and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as they called him, and then at length, as the Concluding health, Captain <hi>Porter</hi> or Å¿ome of them in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, having an Orange in his Hand, Å¿queezed it, and drank a Health to the Å¿queez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rotten Orange, which was Pledged by all, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> as is proved by both Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>De la Rue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now Gentlemen I muÅ¿t leave it to you, whether this is not Evidence Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove this Man Guilty of the TreaÅ¿on; whereof he is Indicted, that is of DeÅ¿igning and Intending the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination of the King, and being engaged as a Party to execute this DeÅ¿ign, when ever there was an Opportunity</p>
               <p>The Council inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon it, on the behalf of the PriÅ¿oner, that what Captain <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Å¿ays is not Evidence: In the firÅ¿t place they urge that he is not a Man of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, for they have mentioned that he uÅ¿ed to be DiÅ¿guiÅ¿ed, and wear a Vizard Mask, and go abroad under odd CircumÅ¿tances, and therefore his Reputation they hope is not good enough to make him a Credible WitneÅ¿s againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner: Now the PriÅ¿oners WitneÅ¿s being produced, Å¿ays he never knew him go in any DiÅ¿guiÅ¿e or wear a Vizard Mask, but once he wore a Patch, becauÅ¿e he was under Å¿ome Ill CircumÅ¿tances about a Riot in <hi>Drury-Lane;</hi> every body underÅ¿tands what the meaning of that was, his drinking of Healths at a Riotous aÅ¿Å¿embly, upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and he being under Å¿ome ProÅ¿ecution for that, occaÅ¿ioned him to wear that DiÅ¿guiÅ¿e, but it was not done to Injure any PerÅ¿on, or do any miÅ¿chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66404:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But then Å¿ay they he is miÅ¿taken in his Evidence, of the meeting at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> the <hi>21Å¿t</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the day before the laÅ¿t, that this deÅ¿ign was to have been executed, for whereas he Å¿ays, that <hi>Gunn</hi> was not there when he came to them, yet <hi>Gunn</hi> was in the Company at that time, and whereas he Swears poÅ¿itively that they diÅ¿courÅ¿ed of going upon the Å¿ame deÅ¿ign to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King the next day, as was agreed the <hi>Saturday</hi> before; <hi>Gunn</hi> heard no Å¿uch diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e. <hi>Gunn</hi> is called, and he tells you he did come to the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi> at that time, with <hi>Cranburn</hi> and Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> he came into the Room, and he heard no Å¿uch diÅ¿courÅ¿e. They did open it indeed that <hi>Gunn</hi> had been there all the while, and if Å¿o then, if there had been Å¿uch a diÅ¿courÅ¿e he muÅ¿t have heard it. <hi>Gunn</hi> has been Examined, and does tell you he was not there all the while, but went out and was abÅ¿ent for Å¿ometime, about half a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>They have made a QueÅ¿tion whether Captain <hi>Porter</hi> came in, when <hi>Gunn</hi> was there, he Å¿ays truly he thinks that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> did come into the Room while he was there, before he went out, but he cannot tell certainly, he was there Å¿ometime, while he was there. Then Captain <hi>Porter</hi> was called again, and Cap. <hi>Porter</hi> does Å¿ay he knows <hi>Gunn</hi> was there, but whether he were there at the time he came in, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Å¿ay poÅ¿itively; but <hi>Gunn</hi> Å¿ays Captain <hi>Porter</hi> was goeing in and out Å¿everal times, as <hi>Porter</hi> Å¿ays himÅ¿elf; and <hi>Gunn</hi> was abÅ¿ent for Å¿ome part of the time. So that I cannot Å¿ee any Å¿ort of Contradiction between the Evidence that <hi>Porter</hi> gives, and the Evidence that <hi>Gunn</hi> gives; the one is uncertain, and Å¿o is the other as to that CircumÅ¿tance.</p>
               <p>But Gentlemen, they would infer that if there was any Å¿uch DiÅ¿courÅ¿e while <hi>Gun</hi> was there, it muÅ¿t be of neceÅ¿Å¿ity that <hi>Gunn</hi> muÅ¿t have heard it; but it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary the diÅ¿courÅ¿e Å¿hould be when <hi>Gunn</hi> was there: Captain <hi>Porter</hi> Swears po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itively that there was Å¿uch a diÅ¿courÅ¿e of going the next day to purÅ¿ue the deÅ¿ign, and he Å¿ays he thinks <hi>Gunn</hi> was not preÅ¿ent at that time when the diÅ¿courÅ¿e was, and <hi>Gunn</hi> Å¿ays he was abÅ¿ent Å¿ome part of the time.</p>
               <p>And Å¿o I muÅ¿t leave it to you, upon the whole matter, if Mr. <hi>Cranburn</hi> the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, did ConÅ¿ent and agree to Act in this Bloody and wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign, then you are to find him Guilty; if you are not Å¿atisfied of that upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you have heard, or you think there is any InconÅ¿iÅ¿tency, or Incoherence in the TeÅ¿timony on the one Å¿ide, and the other; and that there is good ReaÅ¿on to disbelieve the Evidence againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner, Then you are to acquit him. You have heard your Evidence, and you had beÅ¿t conÅ¿ider of it.</p>

And my Lord, when they go farther, and Å¿ay, <hi>Et Quilibet eorum proditorie Å¿uper Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿cepit eÅ¿Å¿e unum,</hi> there is no place or time alledged where that was done, which of neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity Å¿hould be mentioned: For it is a conÅ¿tant Rule in our Books, that what is IÅ¿Å¿uable ought to have a place where it may be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now this is IÅ¿Å¿uable, and the moÅ¿t material thing in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, is for compaÅ¿Å¿ing the King's Death. The <hi>Overt</hi> Acts are that <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Knightley</hi> the PriÅ¿oner, and Two others, did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ult to kill the King; and afterwards did agree how to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Forty HorÅ¿emen <hi>Quorum,</hi> theÅ¿e Å¿hou'd be Four, and every one of them did agree to be one; then comes the other <hi>Overt</hi> Act of Providing Arms for them. Now Å¿uppoÅ¿e they Å¿hould not prove the laÅ¿t, <hi>viz.</hi> the Providing Arms; then, my Lord, they muÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ort to one of the other <hi>Overt</hi> Acts, that theÅ¿e Four did ConÅ¿ult and Agree to Kill the King; or that theÅ¿e Four did agree, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to do it, as is laid in the Indictment; and it is plain they muÅ¿t fail of proof of either of theÅ¿e, for by the not ProÅ¿ecuting any one of the Name of <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Knightley,</hi> but preferring a new Indictment, againÅ¿t one <hi>Alexander Knightley,</hi> it appears that <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Knightley</hi> was not there, and the proving theÅ¿e Three others making a ConÅ¿ult and Agreement, is not a proof of the Å¿ame <hi>Overt</hi> Act, that is laid in the Indictment as it ought to be by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66404:21"/>
the late Act; unleÅ¿s they can prove that a ConÅ¿ult of Three is a ConÅ¿ult of Four: and if it be anÅ¿wered, that it is alledged, that <hi>Quilibet eorum Å¿uper Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿cepit,</hi> then will that come to be IÅ¿Å¿ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the moÅ¿t material part of the Indictment; and conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a place ought to have been laid where it Å¿hould be Tryed; this, my Lord, is a diÅ¿tinct Sentence of it Å¿elf, it is in a <hi>ParentheÅ¿is,</hi> and though you take it away the Å¿enÅ¿e of what remains is perfect and intire, and conÅ¿equently this Sentence is or Å¿hou'd be intire of it Å¿elf, and therefore ought certainly to be expreÅ¿t. BeÅ¿ides, if your LordÅ¿hip pleaÅ¿es, it is not poÅ¿itively laid, what theÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons Å¿everally undertook, to be there is indeed mention made before of Forty HorÅ¿emen, agreed upon to Å¿et upon the King, then comes the <hi>ParentheÅ¿is, Quorum Iidem ChriÅ¿tophorus Knightley, Robertus Lowick, AmbroÅ¿ius Rookwood &amp; Carolus Cranburn forent Quatuor &amp; quilibet eorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie Å¿uper Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿cepit eÅ¿Å¿e unum:</hi> It is perhaps expreÅ¿t fully enough by the word <hi>Quorum,</hi> that it was agreed theÅ¿e Å¿hou'd be Four of the Forty HorÅ¿emen; but there wants the repetition of the word <hi>Quorum,</hi> to expreÅ¿s what they Å¿everally engaged to be; and the word <hi>&amp;</hi> cannot joyn and connect the Sentences: For <hi>forent</hi> and <hi>Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cepit</hi> Differ not only in Number but alÅ¿o in Mood and TenÅ¿e, and the Å¿enÅ¿e is not neceÅ¿Å¿arily coherent; for it might be true, that the Majority of the Company might agree, theÅ¿e Å¿hou'd be Four, and yet they themÅ¿elves might not Å¿everally Ingage therein, and one or Å¿ome of them might undertake it, and yet the Company not agreed to it; and it cannot be mended by Intendment.

                  <p>We think, my Lord, this Objection will receive a very plain AnÅ¿wer. The Indictment Å¿ets forth, that at Å¿uch a Place the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar did imagine and compaÅ¿s the Death of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66404:21"/>
King: There is a particular place where the imagining was, and that they to accompliÅ¿h that TreaÅ¿on, in compaÅ¿Å¿ing and imagining the Death of the King, did amongÅ¿t others <hi>poÅ¿tea eidem due anno apud parochiam praedictam,</hi> Meet and ConÅ¿ult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So there's the Å¿ame place Å¿et forth again, wherein they did Meet and ConÅ¿ult of the Ways and Means, and Time and Place, when, where, and how to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King: And immediately it follows, <hi>&amp; Conce Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt &amp; agreaverunt, &amp;c.</hi> that Forty Men, whereof they were to be Four, and every one of them undertook to be One, Å¿hould do Å¿o and Å¿o. Now, my Lord, Å¿ay they, It is not Å¿aid that the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there Å¿hould be Forty Men to do it, was at the Å¿ame Time and Place where they did Meet and ConÅ¿ult about the Ways and Means: But my Lord, with SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, it is very plain, that the Agreement for Forty Men, and the particular Agreement for them to be of the Number<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> is but the effect of the ConÅ¿ultation that is mention'd juÅ¿t before: For it is Å¿aid, they ConÅ¿ulted how they Å¿hou'd do it, and they agreed to do it in this manner; the particular manner is Å¿et forth immediately afterthat, it is Å¿aid they did ConÅ¿ult of the Manner, Å¿o that, my Lord, it is part of the former Sentence; a particularizing of what they did agree upon at that ConÅ¿ultation; but it is no diÅ¿tinct <hi>Overt</hi> Act: If it had been a diÅ¿tinct <hi>Overt</hi> Act, then the CaÅ¿es that have been Cited by the Council, do Å¿how, that there Å¿hou'd be a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time and place mentioned for every <hi>Overt</hi> Act, but this is only a part of that <hi>Overt</hi> Act, that was mentioned generally before: This tells you particularly what the means were they did agree upon, and the Sentence is not compleat till you have gone over this; Å¿o that, my Lord, with SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, it had been very Improper when they agreed at Å¿uch a Time and Place, of the means and ways how it Å¿hou'd be effected, then to Å¿et forth, that it was at the Å¿ame time and Place where they did ConÅ¿ult of the Ways and Means, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proper; for it is not laid at firÅ¿t, that there was any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way propoÅ¿ed, but only in general, they ConÅ¿ulted of the Ways and Means; therefore, my Lord, all this that Mr. <hi>MompeÅ¿Å¿on</hi> has Å¿aid, will not be pertinent to this CaÅ¿e; it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have been otherwiÅ¿e; it is but a part of the Sentence; and it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat till you have gone over the Å¿everal particulars, as to the CaÅ¿e of a <hi>ReÅ¿cus,</hi> that is, the Offence upon which the matter is to be grounded; the <hi>Verbaravit</hi> and <hi>Vulneravit</hi> are not the Offence but the ReÅ¿meing; but where there is not one Sentence compleat, till you come to the end of theÅ¿e words, there it muÅ¿t be all taken together; Å¿o it is here, they ConÅ¿ulted of the Way, and agreed this to be the Way, which they Å¿et forth in particular: It is join'd to the former part of the Sentence, and the whole is not compleat without it.</p>

                  <p>With SubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, my Lord, I Å¿ay it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again: Indeed if you wou'd make it like the CaÅ¿e, as Mr. <hi>MompeÅ¿Å¿on</hi> wou'd have it, that Forty Men did agree to it, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men did it, it were neceÅ¿Å¿ary to name Time and Place, as it is in the CaÅ¿e of Murder; that he did agree to Murder him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Knock't him on the Head, there you Å¿hou'd lay Time and Place where he agreed, and where he did the Act, for there is an Act done; but in this CaÅ¿e there is no Act done, but only an Agreement that Forty Å¿hou'd do it, whereof theÅ¿e Four were to be part of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Now, they cry, you do not Å¿ay what theÅ¿e Four were to be for; Yes, we do, the Forty were to do Å¿uch an Act, and theÅ¿e were to be Four of that Forty, and every one of them undertook to be one, Å¿o that it cannot be expreÅ¿t otherwiÅ¿e then it is; for what they Å¿ay of the Indictments being not in the Å¿ame Form that other Indictments are, that will be no Argument at all; for it does not follow, that there muÅ¿t be one expreÅ¿t Form of Indictments, of right there are divers Forms of Indictments, and all of them good, becauÅ¿e Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be framed, according to the particular CaÅ¿e, and they cannot put me an InÅ¿tance of Å¿uch a particular CaÅ¿e as this. As to that of the miÅ¿take of the name of <hi>Knightley.</hi> that unqueÅ¿tionably can be no Objection at all; for how does it appear to the Court, that this againÅ¿t the Å¿ame PerÅ¿on that was before Indicted by the Name of <hi>ChriÅ¿topher,</hi> there may be another <hi>ChriÅ¿topher</hi>

                     </gap>or ought they know: But I will Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that the ConÅ¿ult was proved not as it is laid, that they were to be Four; but only that they were to be Three of them, it would be well enough againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, if he be proved to be one.</p>

If then there had been any Colour to think it neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that it Å¿hou'd be laid in this manner, That they did then and there TrayterouÅ¿ly treat, and then and there TrayterouÅ¿ly propoÅ¿e, and then and there TrayterouÅ¿ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ult, and did then and there TrayterouÅ¿ly agree: and if not, then I wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire them to tell me why <hi>then and there</hi> is more neceÅ¿Å¿ary to one Verb <hi>did agree,</hi> than it is to all the reÅ¿t, in Å¿ence and common Å¿peaking. The only uÅ¿e of a Conjunction Copulative, is to derive the force of Å¿ome Words in a Sentence foregoing, down to a Sentence following, to avoid repetition: And here, though after the ConÅ¿ultation be put many Words that relate to that matter by way of ParentheÅ¿is; yet the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> Å¿till does referr to all the Verbs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being joyned by the Conjunction Copulative; it does not vary the CaÅ¿e at all, the putting in that ParentheÅ¿is; it is notwithÅ¿tanding but as one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: and the Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that the ParentheÅ¿is Å¿tood out<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> makes it very plain, there can be no Colour to Å¿ay there wanted a Repetition of the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> to every Verb.</p>

                  <p>With Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to your LordÅ¿hips Judgment, there is no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer made to this Objection: I do agree, if there had been Å¿everal Verbs and no other Words had intervened, that an <hi>Et</hi> wou'd have Coupled all together, and you need not have repeated <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> to every one: But here is a Fact after the Verbs that makes one compleat, intire Sentence; and if this of the 40 Men were left out, it had been a good Sentence, that they did propoÅ¿e and treat how, where and when; that's a Sentence of it Å¿elf, the ConÅ¿ulting and the Treating of the Ways and Means: But then they Å¿ay, And they did agree and aÅ¿Å¿ent that 40 Å¿hou'd do it; now there is no neceÅ¿Å¿ity for the interpreting of theÅ¿e words, That they Å¿hou'd conÅ¿ult and agree at the Å¿ame place and time; there is no neceÅ¿Å¿ity to conjoyn this Agreement for the 40 Men with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ultation; they might propoÅ¿e and conÅ¿ult at one time and place, and not agree, and afterwards agree at another time and place; it is not a Specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, as they call it, a Å¿pecifick Account of the ConÅ¿ultation, nor a neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary Effect of it, Å¿o as to make it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to joyn them together; they might meet and conÅ¿ult at one time and place; and at another time and place they might agree that 40 Å¿hou'd do it; and therefore when you Å¿ay at one time and place they did conÅ¿ult and propoÅ¿e, and afterwards they did agree; it is not neceÅ¿Å¿arily imply'd, that it muÅ¿t be at the Å¿ame time and place; and when it is not neceÅ¿Å¿arily imply'd, we think it neceÅ¿Å¿ary in Indictments, for Certainty-Å¿ake, to have <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> inÅ¿erted again.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, <hi>Mr. Sollicitor</hi> Å¿ays, That as to other Precedents, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap> does not make it neceÅ¿Å¿ary that this Å¿hou'd be like them; and that it is no Argument that it ought to be Å¿o here. My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s CaÅ¿e, tells us, That by Precedents the Law is known, and that Indictments of TreaÅ¿on are of all things the moÅ¿t curiouÅ¿ly Penn'd; and it is common to inferr the Law is Å¿o, becauÅ¿e uÅ¿ually it is Å¿o in the Precedents of Indictments. <hi>Mr. Sollicitor</hi> Å¿ays likewiÅ¿e, That there may be a <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Knightley</hi> beÅ¿ides an <hi>Alexander;</hi> but I cannot take that for an AnÅ¿wer to the Exception I urge, which is the want of <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> at the <hi>Quorum,</hi> and the <hi>Quilibet</hi> for the <hi>Quilibet</hi> may come to be in QueÅ¿tion as the moÅ¿t material part of the Indictment, becauÅ¿e the Agreement of the Four upon the meeting of the Four is alledg'd as an Overt-Act: Now, with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, they muÅ¿t prove the AÅ¿Å¿embly of the whole Four,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66404:23"/>
or they do not prove the Overt-Act expreÅ¿sly laid; then as to the <hi>Quilibet Å¿uÅ¿ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> which is the moÅ¿t material part, it has no time nor place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>No Å¿ure, we do not need to prove all Four, for it is a diÅ¿tinct Offence in each; and if any one undertook, it is well enough againÅ¿t him; and for the time and place, we tell you, it is part of the former Sentence, and makes but an intire one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. MompeÅ¿Å¿on.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the ReÅ¿idue of the Verbs, if they had been omitted, it had been good Sence; but this is a perfect intire Sentence of itÅ¿elf, when it tells you what they conÅ¿ulted and treated off, as in the CaÅ¿e of the <hi>ReÅ¿cous</hi> that I put; if it had Å¿topt there, it had been a good Sentence without the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraverunt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>ReÅ¿cous</hi> is the Offence in that CaÅ¿e, the other is diÅ¿tinct: But here, in this CaÅ¿e, nothing can be plainer than that all is one Act, as we have laid it, That at Å¿uch a time and place they did conÅ¿ult and treat of the Ways and Means; but then there is no Agreement mentioned till after we have Å¿aid they did conÅ¿ult of the Ways and Means, and did agree that this Å¿hou'd be the Way: This is certainly one intire Sentence that Å¿hows what the Agreement was upon the ConÅ¿ultation as the ReÅ¿ult of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
                  <p>As to what Sir <hi>Bartholomew Shower</hi> Å¿ays, That we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem,</hi> unleÅ¿s the Å¿ence of the Words implies a NeceÅ¿Å¿ity that the ConÅ¿ultation and the Agreement Å¿hould be at one time and place. My Lord, there can be nothing in that, for it does not ariÅ¿e from the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of the thing one way or t'other; but we take it as an intire Sentence, and that the whole Matter is Å¿ufficiently connected and laid to one time and place, though it might be divided, it muÅ¿t be taken, as alledged, to be one intire Fact, or elÅ¿e it Recurrs to the Å¿ame Objection, that <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> muÅ¿t as well be put to every Verb; for 'tis poÅ¿Å¿ible they might propoÅ¿e at one time and place, and conÅ¿ult at another, and debate at another, as well as agree at another: So that nothing is to be argued from the NeceÅ¿Å¿ity of the thing more in one CaÅ¿e than the other; for one Man might propoÅ¿e it in one place, and the reÅ¿t might then Å¿hake their heads at it, and then they might again meet and conÅ¿ult at another place, and afterwards agree at a third: But when it is Å¿aid <hi>then and there</hi> they did meet, conÅ¿ult and agree, it cannot be underÅ¿tood but that the Agreement was at the Å¿ame time and place with the meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ult.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>But this can be no AnÅ¿wer that Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> gives now, for PropoÅ¿ing, and ConÅ¿ulting, and Treating, and Debating, are all of the Å¿ame Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, for one Man's propoÅ¿ing to another; and the other's propoÅ¿ing to him, is ConÅ¿ulting, Treating and Debating; but now ConÅ¿ulting and Agreeing are different things.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Cowper.</speaker>
                  <p>So is PropoÅ¿ing and ConÅ¿ulting; One may propoÅ¿e, but there muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t Two to conÅ¿ult: there is that nice Difference between them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir B. Shower.</speaker>
                  <p>Every one muÅ¿t agree for himÅ¿elf, and that muÅ¿t be certainly laid with Time and Place, let the PropoÅ¿al and ConÅ¿ultation be what it will.</p>

                  <p>It is a nice CaÅ¿e as you wou'd have it, but I think it is very natural as the King's Councel put it at firÅ¿t; they lay the ConÅ¿ultation of the Ways and Means how it Å¿hou'd be done, and then they conclude that thus it Å¿hall be done: all which makes but one intire thing.</p>

                  <p>The QueÅ¿tion will be, my Lord, then upon the whole, Whether the ConcluÅ¿ion of the Indictment, <hi>contra legiantiae Å¿uae Debitum,</hi> Å¿hall be taken DiÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively to every Fact, and if Å¿o, then there ought to be time and place alledg'd to every Fact.</p>

                  <p>Pray, do you think a man may Demurr upon a Common Action of Battery where, 'tis Å¿aid firÅ¿t, at Å¿uch a time and place, <hi>InÅ¿ultum fecit &amp; verberavti, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neravit,</hi> becauÅ¿e there is not a place Å¿et to every word.</p>

                  <p>Indictments ought to be very curiouÅ¿ly Penn'd, and what is good in an Action will not be good in an Indictment, with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>

                  <p>You cannot quaÅ¿h the Indictment at this time, that is not poÅ¿Å¿ible, becauÅ¿e the Indictment is good as to the reÅ¿t, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing this was not Å¿o well as it might be.</p>

                  <p>Then, my Lord, I am in your LordÅ¿hips Judgment, whether they Å¿hall be admitted to give in Evidence this particular thing.</p>

                  <p>They may certainly give in Evidence, the Agreement to have 40 men to kill the King, as a proof of the ConÅ¿ultation, Agreement and ConÅ¿ent to kill the King; and the ConÅ¿enting to have 40 HorÅ¿emen is an Evidence of their treating, propoÅ¿ing and conÅ¿ulting to kill the King. Then for your Objection of <hi>Quilibet Å¿uÅ¿cepit</hi> to be one, that is well enough, it is all Å¿till but one Sentence.</p>

                  <p>One of which is it, for they have not laid in the Indictment what it is, whether it be one of the Four, or one of the Forty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether it be one of the Four, or the Forty is not material, for cannot one be found Guilty and the reÅ¿t Acquitted? the one is not charg'd with the Act of the other, but they are Å¿everal Offences, and each muÅ¿t anÅ¿wer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf in all Indictments. Offences are Å¿everal. SuppoÅ¿e an Indictment of ConÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and it is laid in the Indictment that Four did ConÅ¿pire, can't you prove that two ConÅ¿pired? no QueÅ¿tion you may. It is not certainly neceÅ¿Å¿ary that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one Å¿hou'd be proved to have ConÅ¿pired. SuppoÅ¿e it were alledged that Four did beat a man, and does not Å¿ay <hi>Quilibet eorum</hi> beat him, you may give in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that one did beat him.</p>

                  <p>No QueÅ¿tion of that in CaÅ¿e of a Battery, but in the CaÅ¿e of a ConÅ¿piracy there muÅ¿t be more than one.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I will ask you even in an Action of ConÅ¿piracy, where the very GiÅ¿t of the Action is ConÅ¿piring together, cannot two be found Guilty and the reÅ¿t Acquitted? In Riots there muÅ¿t be Three or more It may be you'll lay Ten, but it is Å¿ufficient; I hope, if you prove it upon any Three of them.</p>

                  <p>BeÅ¿ides, my Lord, though they be out of time, yet this is not to the Abatement of the Indictment; but to the Evidence; how do they know, but we will give it in Evidence that <hi>ChriÅ¿topher Knightly</hi> was one.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, you will hear that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar did treat with Å¿everal perÅ¿ons to be ingaged in it; particularly, about the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> he Å¿ent to one <hi>Bertram,</hi> and askt him, if he would be ingaged in a DeÅ¿ign for King <hi>James</hi>'s Service that was quickly to be executed, without asking of QueÅ¿tions, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I think he undertook he would; Å¿o about the 14th <hi>February</hi> he met him again, and that was the day before the firÅ¿t time they intended to attack the King<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and then being Å¿o near the time when it was to be executed, he thought it proper to acquaint him with the thing he had ingag'd him in, and he did acquaint him, that the next morning they were to be ready to attack the King and his Guards, and bid him be Å¿ure to get his Boots and other things ready for that purpoÅ¿e, and he gave him a Guinea in order to it. <hi>Bertram,</hi> it Å¿eems, on the 15th of <hi>February</hi> did not come, and the King it Å¿eems did not go abroad that day, Å¿o they were diÅ¿appointed at that time; but the <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> met him, and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> complained that he had not come upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> according as he had undertaken; and he told him it would have been the Å¿ame thing, he would have diÅ¿appointed them if the King had been in the Field.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you Å¿hall find, that as he thus engaged Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> Å¿o he was to provide Å¿everal others; and he did declare, that at his own Charge he had got 2 or 3, he complained of it as a HardÅ¿hip put upon him, that whereas Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> had 6 <hi>s.</hi> a day SubÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and was only to take care of himÅ¿elf, he, Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> had at his own Charges ingaged and provided Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>

                  <p>On the fourteenth of <hi>January,</hi> New Stile, I was ordered to wait King <hi>James</hi> at Dinner; after Dinner was over, I was called in, where was Coll. <hi>Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> at the Å¿ame time, and King <hi>James</hi> told me he was very Å¿enÅ¿ible of the good Service I had done him; and now he had an opportunity of doing Å¿omething for me: I was to go into <hi>England,</hi> and there to be Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ted, and I was to follow the Orders of Sir <hi>George Barclay;</hi> the King told me I Å¿hou'd find Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> with a White Hanker cheif hanging out of his Pocket, on Mondays and ThurÅ¿days between the Hours of Å¿ix and Å¿even in the Evening, and that was the Å¿ign I was to know him by, and he ordered me to go to Mr. <hi>Caroll,</hi> that is Secretary to the late Queen, and Coll. <hi>Parher</hi> went along with me, and he ordered me ten <hi>LewedÃ³res,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> as much, which Mr. <hi>Caroll</hi> gave us; and if that were not Å¿ufficient, or if we were Wind-bound at <hi>Calice,</hi> we had Orders to apply to the PreÅ¿ident of <hi>Calice</hi> to be furniÅ¿h'd with what we wanted: Accordingly we went, and the Wind not Å¿erving when we came to <hi>Calice,</hi> we were forc'd to Å¿tay there, and our Charges were paid to our Landlady by the PreÅ¿ident of <hi>Calice,</hi> according to the Order we received at St. <hi>Germains;</hi> when the Wind Å¿erved fair we went on Board, and came to <hi>Rumney-MarÅ¿h,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s HouÅ¿e, and from thence he furniÅ¿h'd us with a Couple of HorÅ¿es, and we came the Sandy-way to one Mr. <hi>Tucker</hi>'s, and from thence to Mr. <hi>CroÅ¿s</hi>'s, and from thence to <hi>Graves-end,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London:</hi> We came up in the Night-Tide, and being late when we came to Town. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Night we lay at an Inn at the lower-end of <hi>Gracious-Å¿treet;</hi> the next Day we went to look for Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> but not finding him in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> according to what King <hi>James</hi> told us, I admired at it; but one Mr. <hi>Birken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> meeting my Comrade the next day, Å¿aid Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> deÅ¿ired to Å¿ee us, and appointed us to meet him, which we did that Night, where Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> ask'd us how the King and Queen, Prince and PrinceÅ¿s did; he told us at that time he had no Money for us, but in a few Days we Å¿hou'd have Money; and accordingly he Å¿ent us Money. We had five Guineas but it was at twice, two Guineas at one time and three at another, and this was for a Months SubÅ¿iÅ¿tence at Five Shillings a Day, Guineas going then at Thirty Shillings. And afterwards when Major <hi>Holmes</hi> delivered the HorÅ¿e, upon Saturday the fifteenth, we had another Guinea that made up what we had to be Å¿ix Shillings a Day when we had HorÅ¿es, and five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Day when we had none: and as for Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> the firÅ¿t Saturday which was deÅ¿igned for the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination, I happened to be at Mr. <hi>Counter</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> a Confectioners; and there I Å¿ee Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> come in.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Counter</hi> had Lodgings there, and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> came in there, but I cannot Å¿ay he Å¿taid there any time, I think he went out preÅ¿ently afterwards. The next Week I met Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> in <hi>Red-Lion-Fields</hi> and diÅ¿courÅ¿ed with him there about this Matter, and I told him what a barbarous and inhumane thing it was that we Å¿hou'd be the Murderers of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that it wou'd render us odious to the World, and that we Å¿hould be a continual Reproach to our Selves; he did agree it was Å¿o: But in concluÅ¿ion Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿aid he would obey Orders, and he Å¿aid Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> he was Å¿ure wou'd not do it without Orders. That Day when we were walking out we met Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and Major <hi>Holmes</hi> riding in the High-way up towards <hi>IÅ¿lington,</hi> and we Å¿poke to him, for Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> told me the Thing was diÅ¿covered, and his Name was given up, and other Gentlemens, and I think another; and Å¿o he told me that one <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> had told him of it, and forewarn'd him that Night from lying in his Lodging; and he told him that he believed it wou'd not be Å¿afe for the reÅ¿t to lye in their Lodgings, or to that effect.</p>

On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Two and Twentieth we dined at the <hi>CaÅ¿tle,</hi> a Tavern or a Cook's Shop, at the end of <hi>Red-Lyon-Street.</hi> I was much in a Sweat, and he ask'd me what made me Å¿o?

Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> you know what I Å¿ay to be true, I know not why you lift up your hands; but you did tell me I might very well do it, having Six Shillings a day, and you had nothing, and yet brought a couple of Men at your own Charge, and that their HorÅ¿es could not be diÅ¿charged unleÅ¿s you went.

                  <p>Major <hi>Lowick;</hi> and he told me it was well, and deÅ¿ired me to ask no more QueÅ¿tions: I did not, but it went on till the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> when he deÅ¿ired me to be at his Lodgings at Twelve a Clock. I was Å¿o, about that time, but he was not within, and I Å¿taid till he came in, and he took me up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chamber, and told me he believed they Å¿hou'd Ride out in Å¿ome little time; and he told me he believed the King was to be Å¿eiz'd in his Coach; and he gave me a Guinea to buy me NeceÅ¿Å¿aries.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaÅ¿e your LordÅ¿hip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66404:33"/>
I am of CounÅ¿el in this caÅ¿e for the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, and we do hope here is not Evidence Å¿ufficient to convict him of High TreaÅ¿on, the QueÅ¿tion is not whether there was a Plot or a ConÅ¿piracy to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, or to prepare for an InvaÅ¿ion, but all that you are to conÅ¿ider, Gentlemen, is, whether the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againÅ¿t Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> be Å¿ufficient to convince you, that he did deÅ¿ign to Seize and AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King; there are three WitneÅ¿Å¿es produc'd, but we think this laÅ¿t WitneÅ¿s, <hi>FiÅ¿her,</hi> his TeÅ¿timony does not hurt him in the leaÅ¿t. We know your LordÅ¿hip will Declare and Direct the Jury, that the Evidence in a caÅ¿e of TreaÅ¿on ought to be plain, not only with reÅ¿pect to the Fact, that it was done; but alÅ¿o of Å¿uch Facts as are the Evidences of a man's intentions, and thoÅ¿e are not to be ConÅ¿trued by Strains and Intendments, or Implications; unleÅ¿s they be Å¿uch as Evidently, Naturally, and to common UnderÅ¿tanding expreÅ¿s the Intention, it cannot be good Evidence in TreaÅ¿on: Now we Å¿ay that Captain <hi>FiÅ¿her</hi> has Å¿aid nothing at all that will affect the PriÅ¿oner, for al that he Å¿ays is, that the Eighth of <hi>February</hi> he Å¿aid he was ready to Å¿erve his MaÅ¿ter to the utmoÅ¿t of his Power, and any words as well as theÅ¿e may be ConÅ¿trued to make a Man Guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable Intentions; for it might be a Recollection of Favours Received, or it might be a Grateful intent to Å¿erve him upon particular occaÅ¿ions<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but that is no Evidence upon this Indictment. SuppoÅ¿e it was to Å¿erve him upon the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed intended InvaÅ¿ion, yet with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, that is not Eviednce of the Overt Act laid here; here is no Overt Act mentioned of preparing Arms, or Incouraging Men, or Seducing the King's Subjects in order to the better reÅ¿toring of the late King <hi>James,</hi> or the expected Landing of the French, or the like All that's laid to the PriÅ¿oner's charge, is the CompaÅ¿ting the King's Death, and a DeÅ¿ign to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate him in his Coach, and in order to the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination, he was to buy Armes and HorÅ¿es; now all that he Å¿ays is quite of another Nature, of a quite different Strain, and has no tendency to this matter, and nothing he Å¿ays that <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿hou'd Å¿ay, but is applicable the other way, and tends more Naturally to the InvaÅ¿ion, then to the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination. Your LordÅ¿hip obÅ¿erves there was Å¿ome notice taken of what Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿hou'd Å¿ay, concerning the Act of Parliament, that he would not talk with above one at a time; how far when life is concern'd Å¿uch looÅ¿e diÅ¿courÅ¿e ought to be inforc'd before a Jury I muÅ¿t leave to your LordÅ¿hip; tho a Man may be Innocent, yet he may be Cautious, and the more Innocent, perhaps the more Cautious; but that is applicable to the InvaÅ¿ion too, and has no Relation to the TreaÅ¿on in this Indictment more than any other. It Å¿hows he was more wary then others were, but it is not applicable to the Fact that he now Å¿tands charged with. Then the whole of the Evidence depends upon the TeÅ¿timony of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bertram,</hi> and we think they are not two WitneÅ¿Å¿es to one thing, and what they Å¿ay muÅ¿t be Å¿trained, and intended and preÅ¿umed, to make Evidence of TreaÅ¿on; for what Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> Å¿ays about the DiÅ¿courÅ¿es between him and the late King <hi>James,</hi> about Receiving Orders from Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and his paÅ¿Å¿age over from <hi>France,</hi> and the Å¿everal Stages he and Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> travel'd, and the DiÅ¿courÅ¿es between Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> and him; Your LordÅ¿hip will acquaint the Jury that is no Evidence to affect Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> what <hi>Berkenhead</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi> agreed upon does any way affect Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> for thoÅ¿e things may be all true and yet Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> innocent of what he Å¿tands charged with in this Indictment; he Å¿ays, that upon the firÅ¿t <hi>Saturday</hi> he Å¿aw Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> at the Confectioners, but he cannot Å¿ay he Å¿taid there at all, there was not a word Å¿poken by Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> that he remembers then, but what he Å¿ays that Å¿eems to touch, and the only thing that touches Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> in all this Evidence is, that that upon <hi>Monday, TueÅ¿day, WedneÅ¿day</hi> or <hi>ThurÅ¿day,</hi> it is a pretty large time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fifteenth and the Twenty Å¿econd, he was talking with Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> about the Barbarity of this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and that <hi>Lowick</hi> after all, Å¿aid he would obey Orders; now with Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, my Lord, to make that to have Relation to the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination muÅ¿t be by a forc'd Å¿train'd Intendment; he does not Declare what the Orders were, nay, he does not affirm there were any Orders for the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66404:34"/>
but only that he would obey Orders; here's no Order by Writing, no Order by Parole that Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> declared he would obey: as to what <hi>Lowick</hi> declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Intention of Riding out and Seizing the King in his Coach; that cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Order that he was to obey to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, that Order does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there are no footÅ¿teps of it in all the Evidence, Å¿o that there is nothing in that TeÅ¿timony that will hurt Mr. <hi>Lowick:</hi> Then upon the Two and Twentieth when they Dined together, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> Å¿ays, that there was a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of two Men, but it does not appear, nor does the WitneÅ¿s give any account what thoÅ¿e two Men were to be for; 'tis true two Men he was to get DiÅ¿charg'd, but that is not Evidence that theÅ¿e Men were to make a Part of thoÅ¿e Forty, neither the words before nor the words after can have that ConÅ¿truction; nay it does not appear it was for any purpoÅ¿e at all, now in the caÅ¿e of Life, where a Man Å¿tands at the Bar, we hope Å¿uch an Evidence Å¿hall not be ConÅ¿trued to make a Proof of a TreaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intention, that theÅ¿e were to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, or to make part of the Forty that were to do it, when it does not appear they were there, nor who they were, nor any Å¿ort of Notice taken or given upon what account they were, Provided. And then as to Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Evidence, it is Palpable that his Evidence and whatÅ¿oever he Å¿ays cannot amount to make one WitneÅ¿s to prove an Overt Act within this Statute, and that there muÅ¿t be two WitneÅ¿Å¿es the Law requires; what does Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> Å¿ay to prove any Man Guilty of TreaÅ¿on, but only by Intendment, Thought or SuÅ¿picion? It is true, Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Evidence would be good enough to commit a Man upon SuÅ¿picion for TreaÅ¿on, but to Convict him it cannot be; he Å¿ays that in the begining of <hi>February</hi> he Å¿poke to him and, told him he would imploy him in a buÅ¿ineÅ¿s that would be for his Advantage, but he muÅ¿t ask no QueÅ¿tions; this is very dark, for the meaning of it does not appear what was intended by it; it might be one thing as well as another, it might be to imploy him in his Family, or it might be to Å¿end him of a Journey, or it might be the taking of a Farm, but to apply that as an Evidence of a charge of High TreaÅ¿on, that we think is very hard, and we hope your LordÅ¿hip will think Å¿o too; but then he comes and tells you further of a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e upon the Fourteenth, of his Riding out Å¿uddenly, and that the King was to be Å¿eized in his Coach, but he does not Å¿ay that he was to Å¿eize him, nor that he would be concern'd in it, nor that he knew of it, nor did Declare at what time it was to be done, nor any thing certain whether it was a Prophecy, or a Dream, or a Story that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated again, or what it was; there is no Connection between the Riding out Å¿uddenly and the other words of Å¿eizing the King in his Coach; then he Å¿ays he gave him a Guinea to buy him neceÅ¿Å¿aries, the Man acknowledges Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿everal times had given him in Charity Money, Cloaths and other things, and gave his Wife a Guinea, as you obÅ¿erve, in Charity, but he gave him this Guinea on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e to buy him neceÅ¿Å¿aries, and it is hard that a Man's Charity to a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to a TownÅ¿man, to an ancient acquaintance of Twenty Years Å¿tanding, to a PerÅ¿on that he had been familiar with formerly, and known to have lived well, Å¿hould be miÅ¿ interpreted and Å¿train'd, to make it a giving him Money as SubÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and a Reward for the doing Å¿uch a MiÅ¿chievous Bloody Act; We Å¿ay his Charity to this Man formerly is inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the SuppoÅ¿ition that he cou'd be Privy to Å¿uch a Barbarous DeÅ¿ign now, and we hope the Jury will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider the Character that that very Man has given to my Client, for the Å¿ame WitneÅ¿s gives you an account of his Behaviour all along, that he was not given to RaÅ¿h and Barbarous Actions, nor Guilty of any Malicious thing, nay, that he prevented MiÅ¿chief and the Killing of People in cold Blood. We muÅ¿t leave it to the Jury's ConÅ¿ideration, and your LordÅ¿hips Direction. All theÅ¿e things that they Å¿ay may be true, and <hi>Lowick</hi> be not Guilty, and the acquitting of Mr. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> will be no Reflection upon the WitneÅ¿Å¿es, nor any diÅ¿credit to the TeÅ¿timony that has been given of this ConÅ¿piracy, but we hope 'tis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing JuÅ¿tice to this Man, the WitneÅ¿Å¿es not coming up to the Proof of what is laid in the Indictment. We muÅ¿t beg your LordÅ¿hips patience a little

longer, and call Å¿ome WitneÅ¿Å¿es to give you an account how long they have known Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and what his real Character is; they will tell you he is a peaceable good Man, and Å¿hew you that his Temper and Inclination was rather to a Å¿ober quiet Life than to lead him to Å¿uch action, and that they cannot think him likely to be tempted to be concerned in Å¿uch a DeÅ¿ign; and then we muÅ¿t leave it to the Jury.

                  <p>The PriÅ¿oner has Å¿omething to Å¿ay for himÅ¿elf my Lord, but we muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit to your LordÅ¿hips ConÅ¿ideration, and the Juries, whether there be any Evidence but what is dark and Å¿avours of SuÅ¿picion only; SuÅ¿picious it is, but whether there be any Evidence that is plain and direct as the Law requires in CaÅ¿es of High TreaÅ¿on, we muÅ¿t leave it to your ConÅ¿ideration, for we apprehend there is none.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I muÅ¿t beg leave to AnÅ¿wer to the Objection that the CounÅ¿el for the PriÅ¿oner have made, that there are not two WitneÅ¿Å¿es to prove the Overt-Act laid in the Indictment, and Å¿o the Law is not Å¿atisfied. In AnÅ¿wer to that, I deÅ¿ire your LordÅ¿hips favour to obÅ¿erve how the Evidence is, and then we Å¿hall Å¿ee whether there are not plainly two PoÅ¿itive WitneÅ¿Å¿es of the Overt-Act, by agreeing to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King. The firÅ¿t WitneÅ¿s is Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> Your LordÅ¿hip obÅ¿erves that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> gives an account that Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> was at Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Lodgings the firÅ¿t day that it was to have been Executed; and that afterwards between the Fifteenth and the two and twentieth, thoÅ¿e being the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd Days that this was to be done, when he and <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and the PriÅ¿oner <hi>Lowick,</hi> were walking together in <hi>Red Lion Fields;</hi> and there had Å¿ome DiÅ¿courÅ¿e about the intended AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination, and the Barbarity and BloodineÅ¿s of it, and Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> were averÅ¿e to it. Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿aid he would obey Orders, and he was Å¿ure Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would not do it unleÅ¿s he had direct Orders for it, that was twice Repeated by him, as <hi>Harris</hi> Swears: and afterwards Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> tells you that the Two and Twentieth he Dined with Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> obÅ¿erved that Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> came in in a great Sweat, and asked him how it happened, he Å¿aid he had been about to get ready <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Party that were to Å¿eize the King, for he was to have one Party. Says Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> to him, you need not Grudge to do it, you have Å¿ix Shillings a day, I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66404:35"/>
have nothing; and yet I, at my own Charge, am to provide two. This is as PoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence as well can be of his being privy to the DeÅ¿ign; and his ingaging People at his own Charge, Å¿hows a great deal of forwardneÅ¿s and Zeal in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner to the BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s. My Lord, I think this is poÅ¿itive and plain Evidence, and not only made out by Inferrences and ConÅ¿tructions, as Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> Å¿ays, but plain poÅ¿itive Proof. The firÅ¿t day he was with Å¿everal of them, and when they DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿ed of the thing afterwards, he declared he would obey Orders; and what could thoÅ¿e Orders be but for what they were DiÅ¿courÅ¿ing of, and nothing was DiÅ¿courÅ¿ed of but this DeÅ¿ign they were ingaged in, and this was to juÅ¿tifie the thing, and take off the apprehenÅ¿ion of the Barbarity of it: this is <hi>Harris</hi>'s TeÅ¿timony. The next WitneÅ¿s is <hi>Bertram,</hi> and he tells you that the Fifth of <hi>February</hi> the PriÅ¿oner Å¿ent for him, and when he came to him, he asked if he would Ingage in a BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s that might be for his Advantage, and ask no QueÅ¿tions: Å¿o at that time he did not acquaint him what the thing was, but that Å¿hows it was a thing that was to be kept Secret at that time, in regard he did not think fit to acquaint him at the firÅ¿t InÅ¿tance. But the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> when he met him again, the day before the firÅ¿t time that it was to be put in Execution; <hi>Bertram</hi> Swears he told him that they were to Ride out the next Morning, that muÅ¿t be <hi>Lowick</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> for there was no Body elÅ¿e there; and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was to be Å¿eized in his Coach. Was it poÅ¿Å¿ible the PriÅ¿oner could be ignorant of it? When he ingaged him to go upon a DeÅ¿ign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking QueÅ¿tions; Å¿ent for him the day before, acquainted him they were to Ride out the next Morning, and that the King was to be Å¿eized in his Coach, and bid him be ready againÅ¿t next Morning, and gave him a Guinea at that time; the WitneÅ¿s Å¿ays it was for NeceÅ¿Å¿aries, but he does not pretend that it was for Charity, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. And that muÅ¿t be for NeceÅ¿Å¿aries for that purpoÅ¿e that they were then DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿ing of, when he deÅ¿ired him to be ready the next day, and gives him Mony to buy him NeceÅ¿Å¿aries: What can that be, but NeceÅ¿Å¿aries for what he was to be ready for? And then he did not come the next day, and he tells you why, becauÅ¿e he thought it a very wicked and unlawful thing, and Å¿o he diÅ¿appointed him; and the next time <hi>Lowick</hi> Chid him, and told him he would have Å¿erved him Å¿o if the King had been in the Field. This is plain, though I believe <hi>Bertram</hi> does Speak as tenderly as he can, being his Friend and old Acquaintance, and is willing to Å¿ay as little as he can of him; Å¿o that I believe no body thinks but what <hi>Bertram</hi> Å¿ays againÅ¿t the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner is true, and what he Swears is plain and poÅ¿itive. To Å¿how that <hi>Lowick</hi> did ingage in the DeÅ¿ign, he acquainted him with it the Fourteenth, by telling him the King was to be Å¿eized, and they were to Ride out, and he was to be ready the next day.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, <hi>Robert Lowick,</hi> is Indicted of High TreaÅ¿on, for CompaÅ¿Å¿ing and Imagining the Death and DeÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King by an AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination; you have heard what Evidence has been given upon this Indictment. And in the firÅ¿t place, It is proved to you that there was a DeÅ¿ign to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King; which was to be carried on under the Conduct and Management of Sir <hi>George Barclay.</hi> The QueÅ¿tion that you are now to ConÅ¿ider of, is whether the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar was concerned or ingaged in the ProÅ¿ecution of that DeÅ¿ign. There have been two WitneÅ¿Å¿es produced, who have given their Evidence, and have been very Å¿trictly Examined, and ObÅ¿ervations have been made upon the TeÅ¿timony they have given.</p>

The firÅ¿t WitneÅ¿s is Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> and he gives you Å¿ome account of the Original of this DeÅ¿ign. He tells you how he was at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and Introduced to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who did expreÅ¿s a great kindneÅ¿s for him, and told him that he had an Opportunity of doing Å¿omething for him that would be for his Advantage: and that he and one <hi>Hare,</hi> who was preÅ¿ent at that time, Å¿hould go into <hi>England</hi> (for it Å¿eems they were both together Introduced by Collonel <hi>Parker)</hi> and Å¿hould be SubÅ¿iÅ¿ted in <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon Directions were given them what CourÅ¿e they were to take; which was to go to <hi>Calice,</hi> and to each of them ten <hi>Lewedores</hi> were given for their Charges, and they were acquainted that if it happened that they Å¿hould lie there Å¿o long for want of a Wind to bring them over hither that their Money was Å¿pent, ProviÅ¿ion Å¿hould be made for their Å¿upply there. They had farther Directions, that when they came into <hi>England</hi> they Å¿hould apply themÅ¿elves to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and follow his Orders, with InÅ¿tructions how to find him; being told that Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> would be walking in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> every <hi>Monday,</hi> and every <hi>ThurÅ¿day</hi> Night, about the hours of Å¿ix or Å¿even a Clock, and that they Å¿hould know him by a White Handkerchief that was to hang out of his Pocket.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> further tells you, That they did come to <hi>Calice</hi> in order to Embark for <hi>England,</hi> and there they happened to Å¿tay a conÅ¿iderable time, even Å¿o long that their Mony would not defray their Expences there, and they found it true as it was promiÅ¿ed them; for the PreÅ¿ident of <hi>Calice</hi> paid the Reckoning for them at the place where they Lodged; and afterwards they came into <hi>England,</hi> and landed in <hi>Kent,</hi> and came to <hi>RocheÅ¿ter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi> About the latter end of <hi>January Old Stile</hi> (for it Å¿hould Å¿eem it was the 14. <hi>New Stile,</hi> which is the 4. <hi>Old Stile,</hi> they were of St. <hi>Germaines)</hi> he tells you that he did go the firÅ¿t <hi>Monday,</hi> after their arrival, into <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> to look after Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> but then miÅ¿t him. But afterwards his Companion, Mr. <hi>Hare,</hi> met with one <hi>Berkenhead,</hi> and complaining that they had not met with Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> according to the Directions they had abroad: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by the means of <hi>Berkenhead,</hi> they were brought to the Speech of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> who gave them reception, and owned that he had Authority to SubÅ¿iÅ¿t them; but Å¿aid he had not then Mony, but Å¿hortly Å¿hould, and when he had they Å¿hould be Å¿ure to receive their SubÅ¿iÅ¿tence. He tells you, that after this, Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> gave them SubÅ¿iÅ¿tence Mony, paying them at the Rate of five Shillings a day when they had no HorÅ¿es, and when they had, Å¿ix Shillings a day: Å¿o they put themÅ¿elves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under his Command and Conduct. He has given you an Account what DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e he had with Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> from whom he diÅ¿covered what the DeÅ¿ign was in which he was to be ingaged. And the DeÅ¿ign to AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King was firÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be put in Execution on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15. of <hi>February,</hi> at which day Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> and others, being at Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Lodgings; Sir <hi>George</hi> Å¿aid they were his <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aries,</hi> and afterwards CareÅ¿t them, and Å¿aid they were Men of Honour, and told them that they were to Attack the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Guards; but it Å¿eems the King not going abroad that day, they loÅ¿t that Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Then Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> began to be a little troubled, and concerned, when he underÅ¿tood the meaning of his being under Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Conduct. And he Å¿ays that after that firÅ¿t <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15. and before the next <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. he met with <hi>Lowick, Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Bernarde,</hi> and he was complaining of his being ingaged in Å¿uch a DeÅ¿ign as this was. He called it then the Murder of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Å¿aid it was a Barbarous thing, and he did not like it, nor <hi>Rookwood</hi> neither; but as for Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> whether he diÅ¿liked it or no, I know not, but he made AnÅ¿wer to him I will obey Orders: Å¿ays he Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> has Orders for it, or otherwiÅ¿e he would not do it.</p>
                  <p>Then you are told further, that after this, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> Dined with <hi>Lowick</hi> at a Cooks at the end of <hi>Red Lion Street,</hi> and being there together, <hi>Harris</hi> being in a Sweat, and was asked the reaÅ¿on by <hi>Lowick,</hi> he Å¿aid he had been giving of Orders for the getting Å¿ome Men together that were to go under <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Lowick</hi> told him he might very well do it, for he had Pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> a day; but Å¿ays he, I am to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t two Men, and have nothing at all. Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> wiÅ¿hed him to go to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and Complain of it to him, but he Å¿aid he would not; but it Å¿eems, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then underÅ¿tood by them that the King did not go abroad that day, <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿aid he muÅ¿t go and DiÅ¿charge the two Men, and went about it. This is the Sum and SubÅ¿tance of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s Evidence againÅ¿t Mr. <hi>Lowick.</hi>
                  </p>

The next WitneÅ¿s is <hi>Bertram,</hi> and he tells you that Å¿ometime before the Fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> which was, as I told you, the very firÅ¿t day that they did deÅ¿ign to aÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate the King, Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿ent for him, and told him, that he would put you upon a BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s that Å¿hall be for his Advantage, if he would undertake it without asking any QueÅ¿tions, this was Å¿ometime before, but the certain Day <hi>Bertram</hi> does not remember; but he tells you farther, that on <hi>Friday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> he was with <hi>Lowick</hi> at his Lodgings, and he Å¿aid unto him, that the King, he did believe, was to be Å¿eized in his Coach, and we are to ride out Å¿uddenly, and then he gave him a Guinea to buy him NeceÅ¿Å¿aries, and withal, bid him meet him at the <hi>Purl-HouÅ¿e</hi> in <hi>Hart-Å¿treet</hi> next Morning; and <hi>Bertram</hi> tells you, he had underÅ¿tood what this DeÅ¿ign was, for he had it before from <hi>Chernock,</hi> and did forbear to go the next Morning, becauÅ¿e he did diÅ¿like it. After this Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> met him and chid him for diÅ¿appointing of him, in not meeting him as he directed, for Å¿ays he, it would have been the Å¿ame thing if the King had been in the Field: This is the Å¿um and Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Evidence that <hi>Bertram</hi> has given againÅ¿t him.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Bertram,</hi> being croÅ¿s-examined on the behalf of the PriÅ¿oner, Å¿ays he hath known him a great while, and that he is a Man of a peaceable and fair DiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, very charitable, and that he has given him Money before, and particulary a Guinea to his Wife in his abÅ¿ence.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I might have mentioned the Evidence of <hi>FiÅ¿her</hi> to you, but that is but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantial, and does not come home to the CaÅ¿e, but being given it may be mention'd, and that is, about the Eighth of <hi>February, FiÅ¿her</hi> had Å¿ome DiÅ¿courÅ¿e with <hi>Lowick,</hi> and it Å¿eems there was notice taken of the intended InvaÅ¿ion, and <hi>Lowick</hi> Å¿aid he would Å¿erve his MaÅ¿ter faithfully; and that the WitneÅ¿s thought was meant of the late King; and he Å¿aid at another time, that he would not diÅ¿courÅ¿e with above one at a time, becauÅ¿e of the late Act of Parliament that was then a paÅ¿Å¿ing, relating to High-TreaÅ¿on, that required two WitneÅ¿Å¿es. Now, <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay, this is not any Proof againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner, but it is a CircumÅ¿tance that may Å¿hew his Inclination to the late King.</p>
                  <p>The Council for the PriÅ¿oner have inÅ¿iÅ¿ted upon the InÅ¿ufficiency of the Evidence that has been given on behalf of the King, and have Å¿aid, that the late Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament requires two WitneÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es, which is true, but not two WitneÅ¿Å¿es to any one Overt-Act; but if there be two WitneÅ¿Å¿es, one to one and another to another Overt-Act, that is Å¿ufficient; but they Å¿ay that it is not Å¿o in this CaÅ¿e. In the firÅ¿t place they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againÅ¿t the Evidence that is given by <hi>Harris,</hi> they Å¿ay it is Å¿hort, that muÅ¿t be left to your conÅ¿ideration; whether the Evidence that is given by <hi>Harris,</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> does prove to your Å¿atisfaction, that he conÅ¿ented and agreed to the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ination of the King, you are to weigh the Evidence, when it is Å¿worn that when <hi>Harris, Rookwood,</hi> and the PriÅ¿oner were walking in <hi>Red Lyon Fields,</hi> and talking of this horrid DeÅ¿ign, and <hi>Harris</hi> complained that it was a barbarous thing to murther the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as they call'd him, you muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider what AnÅ¿wer <hi>Lowick</hi> did make about obeying of Orders, then his Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting of Men at his own charge without Pay, and complaining of his having no Pay, and his diÅ¿charging them the laÅ¿t day that the AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿ination was intended, that <hi>I</hi> muÅ¿t leave to you, whether or no this is not an Evidence, if you believe the WitneÅ¿s, to Å¿atisfie you that he was engaged in this DeÅ¿ign.</p>
                  <p>Then Gentlemen he has alÅ¿o been deÅ¿ired to give an AnÅ¿wer to this QueÅ¿tion, and to tell upon what DeÅ¿ign he was to employ <hi>Bertram</hi> that Å¿hould be for his advantage; but he was to ask no QueÅ¿tions, and afterwards whether he did tell him the King was to be Å¿eized in his Coach, and they were to ride out Å¿uddenly and bid him meet him the next Morning, and when he did not meet him, he Å¿aid it would have been the Å¿ame thing if the King had been in the Field. If this be an Evidence of Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi>'s engaging in and agreeing and conÅ¿enting to the DeÅ¿ign, then here will be another WitneÅ¿s againÅ¿t the PriÅ¿oner beÅ¿ides <hi>Harris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you are to judge of this matter and of the Evidence. It is true, we are not to put, in the caÅ¿e of a Mans Life, any forced and violent ConÅ¿tructions upon any Words or DiÅ¿courÅ¿es; but if the Evidence be plain and clear, tho he did not Å¿ay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s Words, that he did deÅ¿ign to aÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inate or kill the King; yet, if upon the whole DiÅ¿courÅ¿e that paÅ¿t between them it appears plainly, clearly, and Å¿atisfactorily to you that he did conÅ¿ent and agree to this DeÅ¿ign, or was engaged in it, here's another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, I Å¿ay, to prove him guilty, beÅ¿ides <hi>Harris,</hi> you are to conÅ¿ider the whole Evidence, the Å¿ubject matter of DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, and if you are Å¿atisfied, <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay, that he was engaged in Å¿uch a DeÅ¿ign by the Proof of <hi>Bertram,</hi> as well as of <hi>Harris,</hi> then there are two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es, which is as much as the Law requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66404:37"/>
But, indeed, the Council have called Å¿everal WitneÅ¿Å¿es to prove that the PriÅ¿oner has lived very peaceably and quietly; one Woman Å¿ays Å¿he has known him Twelve Years, and that he lodged at her HouÅ¿e, and that he was a Man of great Temper and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and not diÅ¿orderly, but had a general good EÅ¿teem and Character: And then there is another, Mrs. <hi>MoÅ¿ely,</hi> that proves the like, and Å¿ays, Å¿he has known him theÅ¿e Twenty Years, and Å¿he Å¿ays no Man has a better Character: And Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> hath Å¿aid that he was not of a raÅ¿h or bloody Temper.</p>
                  <p>Now Gentlemen, I muÅ¿t leave it to you upon the Evidence that you have heard, there are theÅ¿e WitneÅ¿Å¿es that have been produced, and there are theÅ¿e CircumÅ¿tances that appear in the CaÅ¿e; if you are Å¿atisfied upon this Evidence that has been given, that the PriÅ¿oner Mr. <hi>Lowick,</hi> did conÅ¿ent to and engage himÅ¿elf in that DeÅ¿ign of aÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inating the King, then you are to find him guilty; if you are not Å¿atisfied, you are to find him not guilty; you have heard your Evidence, and had beÅ¿t conÅ¿ider of it.</p>

                  <p>Our French and PopiÅ¿h Enemies, by whom you were imployed in this bloody Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿e, did very well know, that the WiÅ¿dom and Courage of his preÅ¿ent MajeÅ¿ty has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cued this Kingdom from that Slavery and OppreÅ¿Å¿ion which they often threatened to bring upon us; they knew that under his Government we have been protected in the enjoyment of our Religion, Laws and Liberty for Å¿everal Years, and that his MajeÅ¿ty is the Head of the ProteÅ¿tant IntereÅ¿t, and the Protector and PreÅ¿erver of the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that upon the PreÅ¿ervation of his Life and the Safety of his PerÅ¿on, the Good and HappineÅ¿s of multitudes of People do depend, which the French King's Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has been ready to take hold of any opportunity to enÅ¿lave and oppreÅ¿s.</p>

                  <p>Such as your LordÅ¿hip thinks proper to be admitted to them may have DiÅ¿courÅ¿e with them in private, if the Keeper be in the Room, but no others but Å¿uch as your LordÅ¿hip Å¿hall allow; for we know what has been the effect of a Liberty of acceÅ¿s to Å¿ome PriÅ¿oners.</p>
