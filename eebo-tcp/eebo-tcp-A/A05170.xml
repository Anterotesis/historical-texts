            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. 122. V. 3,4,5.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is builded as a <hi>Citie</hi> that is at <hi>vnitie</hi> in it selfe, (<hi>or compacted together</hi>). For thither the <hi>Tribes</hi> goe vp, euen the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the Lord, to the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> to giue thankes vnto the Name of the Lord. For there are the <hi>Seats</hi> (or the <hi>Thrones</hi>) of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; euen the <hi>Thrones</hi> of the house of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SOme are of opinion this <hi>Psalme</hi> was made by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and deliuered to the Church to be sung, when the <hi>Arke</hi> of God was caried vp to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8786:3"/>
when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was setled by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> to bee the special Seate both of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> The people were bound thrice a yeere, at <hi>Easter, Pentecost,</hi> and the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> to come vp and worship at <hi>Ierusalem. Deut.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Deut. 16.16.</note> And some thinke this <hi>Psalme</hi> was prophetically made to sing by the way; to sing when they went vp by the steps to the Temple. And t'was fit. For they came vp with ioy. And ioy is apt to set men a singing. And at ioy the Psalme begins.<note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I was glad when they said vnto mee, We will goe into the house of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatsoeuer the vse of this <hi>Psalme</hi> was in any speciall Seruice, certaine it is, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> stands here in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the <hi>Citie,</hi> and in type and figure for the <hi>State, and the Church of Christ.</hi> My Text lookes vpon both; and vpon the duetie which the <hi>Iewes</hi> did then, and which <hi>wee</hi> now doe owe to both. The <hi>Temple</hi> the Type of the <hi>Church,</hi> that's for God's seruice. No Temple but for that.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8786:3"/>
The <hi>Citie</hi> the Type of the <hi>State,</hi> that's for the peoples peace. No happy <hi>State</hi> but in that.</p>
            <p>Both the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>State, God's</hi> house and the <hi>Kings,</hi> both, are built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pillars.</hi> And it is not long since I told you out of <hi>Psalm.</hi> 75.<note place="margin">Psalm. 75.4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> that there are many times of exigence, in which if God doe not beare vp the <hi>Pillars,</hi> no strength which the <hi>Pillars</hi> haue in and of themselues can support the weight that lies vpon them: Be they <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi>; or <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi> Therefore here to ease the <hi>Pillars</hi> God hath built vp <hi>Buttresses</hi> (if men doe not pull them downe) to stay the maine walles of both buildings. The <hi>Buttresse</hi> and support of the <hi>Temple</hi> is <hi>Religion.</hi> God will not blesse the house, if men doe not honour and serue him in it. The <hi>Buttresse</hi> and stay of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> is <hi>Iustice.</hi> God will not blesse the State, if <hi>Kings</hi> and Magistrates doe not execute iudgement; If the widdow and the fatherlesse haue cause to crie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8786:4"/>
out against the Thrones of Iustice.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Commonwealth, Gods</hi> house, the Temple, and the <hi>Kings</hi> house, the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> are met in my Text. And they would euer meet, and in loue no question, did not some distempered spirits breathe sower vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For the <hi>Church</hi> cannot dwell but in the <hi>State.</hi> Ye neuer read that she fled out of the State into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but when some <hi>Dragon</hi> persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">Apoc.. 12.6.</note> And the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> cannot flourish without the <hi>Church.</hi> For where the Church is not to teach true Religion, States are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, out of necessitie of some, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a false. And a false is not a helpe to make a Kingdome flourish. But when they dwell together; when the Church, the <hi>House of Grace</hi> is a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inmate to the State, which is a <hi>wise fabricke of Nature</hi>; then in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there's meeting: The people goe vp to blesse, and praise the Name of the Lord. And then in the State ther's mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8786:4"/>
To settle the Thrones of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make firme the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> And then, and neuer but then, <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that is, both State and Church <hi>is as a Citie that is at vnitie in it selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text is nothing but a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued praise of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And not of the particular, materiall <hi>Ierusalem</hi> alone, but of any State, of any Church, that is as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> then was, and that doth as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> then did. This praise of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> both <hi>formall</hi> in it selfe, and <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi> to vs, is set downe in three things. And they seuer the Text into three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> partes. For, first here's the vnity of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> 'tis <hi>builded as a Citie at vnitie in it selfe.</hi> Secondly, the Religion of it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>For thither the Tribes goe vp, euen the Tribes of the Lord, to the Testimony of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, to giue thankes vnto the name of the Lord.</hi> Thirdly, the Gouernment of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> both spirituall and temporall; <hi>For there are the seates of Iudgement, euen the seates of the house of Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:8786:5"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The first commendation of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is from the vnitie and concord that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is in it. 'Tis like a Citie that is <hi>compacted together.</hi> That's for the buildings; no desolation in the midst of it, saith <hi>S. Basil.</hi>

               </note> 'Tis like a Citie <hi>at vnitie in it selfe.</hi> That's for the Inhabitants. For the beautie and artificiall ioyning of the houses is expressed but as a type of this vnitie. When men dwell as neere in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as their houses stand in place.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great ornament of a Citie, that the buildings bee faire; that they stand not scattering, as if they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid each of other. But wheresoeuer 'tis so, the Citie is beholding to vnitie for it. Let the <hi>Citizens</hi> breake their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie once, they'l spend so much in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels that they cannot build the Citie. No other times but when the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are at peace can build; nor no other time can keep them from waste.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But what? Hath God care of <hi>houses?</hi> out of question not, but for the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>

               <hi>Psalm.</hi> 113. loues not man for his house, nor no Citie for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> will not let mee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for an instance. For here so long as the Inhabitants serued God, and were at vnitie, what Citie like <hi>Ierusalem? The Citie of the great King, S. Mat.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">S. Matth. 5.35.</note> 
               <hi>The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the whole earth, Thren.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Thren. 2.15.</note> But when they fell from God to Idols, from vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to heart-burnings among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, what then became of <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> what? why iust that which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our foretold,<note place="margin">S.

together. And <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe might best call it so. For before <hi>Dauids</hi> time <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> were two Cities. The <hi>Iewes</hi> dwelt in <hi>Salem</hi>;<note place="margin">Iud. 19.10.</note> but the Fort of <hi>Sion</hi> was yet held by the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">2.

But then a Citie most compacted together. The Buildings, and the Cities ioyne. <hi>Beniamin</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> dwell there together. Nothing then but vnitie.</p>

But then <hi>he will diuide them in Iacob, and scatter them in Israel, Gen.</hi> 49.<note place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note> Nay scatter <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> it selfe for them.</p>
            <p>And my <hi>Text</hi> hath it not simply, <hi>like a Citie at vnity,</hi> but at vnity <hi>together</hi> or <hi>in it selfe.</hi> And this the better to resist for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine malice.

But when the Ambition of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States will admit nor safe, nor honourable peace, then there's most need <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should bee at peace and vnitie in it selfe.

            <p>Thus it was with <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of old when she lost her vnitie. For faction within the walles was a helpe to <hi>Titus,</hi> and his siege without.

            <p>Now there is <hi>Coagmentatio duplex,</hi> a double buckling and knitting of the State together. And if either faile, the vnity is broken. The one is of the <hi>Members</hi> of the State with their <hi>Head,</hi> especially the most honourable which are neerest. The other is of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one with another.

            <p>And it is very obserueable, that in all that large discourse of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vnitie of the <hi>Body</hi> and the

               <hi>Members,</hi> hee conceiues at full, how Corruption can vnnaturalize Nature it selfe.

            <p>Well he can conceiue that. But he doth not so much as suppose, that any members would bee at oddes with the <hi>Head</hi>: No, God forbid. The <hi>Head</hi> can compose other members, and settle their peace in the <hi>Body</hi>; but if any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell the <hi>Head,</hi> all vnitie is gone. And yet though the <hi>Apostle</hi> cannot suppose so much vnnaturalnesse that any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should quarrell the <hi>Head</hi>; not the <hi>Tongue,</hi> as vnruly as it is, yet he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry direct, that there is an office, which the <hi>Head</hi> owes the <hi>Body,</hi> &amp; all the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> to the very meanest, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this vnitie.

But be the one neuer so true; and be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer so perfect, they come short of preseruation, if that body be not at vnity in it selfe. The <hi>Church,</hi> take it <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi> cannot stand well, if it bee not compacted together into a holy vnity in faith and charitie.

            <p>The vulgar reads it, Ierusalem is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Citie, <hi>cuius participatio in id ipsum,</hi> whose participation is vpon the same thing; And that reading is warranted by the 70. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Well; both State and Church owe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> much to vnitie; and therefore very little to them that breake the peace of

now: This I am sure of, This Psalme calls vpon vs for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem, vers.</hi> 6.

               <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is very right now. At vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Religious. Oh that it had knowne the day of its visitation, and continued so, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">S. Luk. 19.12.</note> For at this time
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8786:11"/>
the Tribes went vp to the Temple. It begins well: for to the Temple, to the Church, to the consecrated place of Gods seruice, is one of the best iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes men of all sorts can make. And you may giue a shrewd guesse at the deuotion of the time, by the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Church. And this their publike comming to worship at the Temple was Gods expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.17.</note> Therfore assembling and meeting at publike seruice in the Church is no <hi>humane Institution,</hi> but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himselfe.

            <p>Why, but what are they to doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when they come there? What? Why <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was right here too.

they come to Church. Yet if any man bee ignorant, my Text will informe him; men are there now to doe as they did then, <hi>to giue thanks to the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 70. and the vulgar haue it. To <hi>confesse</hi> to the name of the Lord. It comes all to one. For bee the word <hi>Thanke</hi> or <hi>Confesse,</hi> it stands here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue of the whole <hi>Liturgie,</hi> of all the publike externall Seruice of God; All which if it bee not accompanied with the inward seruice of the heart is worth nothing. So they went to the <hi>Temple,</hi> as we must goe to the <hi>Church,</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, To pray, To worship, To praise, To giue thanks to God, which euen vnder the Law was preferred <hi>before Sacrifice it selfe, Psalm</hi> 50.<note place="margin">Psal. 50.13,14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor may the wisedome of the world thinke, that to <hi>pray,</hi> and to <hi>giue thankes</hi> to God, are <hi>void actions.</hi> For what euer worldlings thinke, the Church doth great seruice to the State while it prayes. And it is no hard thing to

And wee come vp empty handed, else it were not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible so many Churches should lye so ruinous as they doe. Will you giue me leaue to tell you the reason of this? 'Tis in my Text. When this deuotion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8786:15"/>
was on foote, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was at vntie in it selfe. For so goes the Text. <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> at vnitie, and then <hi>ascenderunt,</hi> then they ascend by multitudes, and their deuotion with them.</p>
            <p>And this falls in vpon the <hi>Persons</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that went vp to serue the Lord. And they were the <hi>Tribes.</hi> Not all the <hi>Tribes, Families,</hi> and <hi>Kinreds</hi> of the earth. No: For the many by <hi>Idolatry</hi> had made themselues strangers to the true God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But <hi>Tribus Domini,</hi> the Tribes of the Lord, they went vp, all of them.</p>
            <p>The 12. <hi>Tribes</hi> from the <hi>Patriarks</hi> the seede of <hi>Iacob,</hi> were then Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar seruants. They were made so in the Couenant. The Testimony of it was the Law. So this honour to bee the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the Lord, God's people, was reserued in the band of Religion. If they had not beleeued, and serued God, they had not beene his. They might haue been <hi>Tribes,</hi> if you will, without seruing in the Temple; but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8786:16"/>
not <hi>Domini,</hi> not of the Lord, but by that seruice. And they might haue beene in some kinde of <hi>vnitie,</hi> but not <hi>in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> not in the Lord, but by that vnion. And they might haue been builded as a <hi>Citie,</hi> but not <hi>ad Dominum,</hi> to the Lord's honour, and their owne saluation, but by that faith And which was the honour of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> then in all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>'s time, and <hi>Salomon</hi>'s too, All the <hi>Tribes</hi> went vp; All, not a Recusant Tribe, or Person among them.</p>

true; That while they seeke to tye all Christians to <hi>Rome,</hi> by a <hi>diuine precept,</hi> their Ambition of Soueraignty is one and a maine cause, that <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> euen the whole <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> is not at v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in it selfe this day.</p>
            <p>Now beside the honour &amp; seruice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> done to God, the people had many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits by comming vp, and meeting at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Many, but one more especially.

            <p>And surely 'twas in a blessed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; that Gods house and the Kings stood together at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (if I mistake not) vpon the East, and the <hi>Palace of Salomon</hi> vpon the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the same Mountaine: to shew that their seruants and seruice must goe together too: that no man might thinke himselfe the farther from <hi>God</hi> by seruing the <hi>King,</hi> nor the farther from the <hi>King</hi> by seruing <hi>God.</hi> The Kings power is Gods ordinance: and the Kings command must bee Gods glory: and the honour of the Subiect is obedience to both.

Religion, &amp; Gods seruice, to frequent the Temple, if he doe not, in the course of his life, exercise and obey <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudgement.</hi> And this Lesson Religion euer teacheth.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8786:19"/>
haue. And 'tis not for nothing, that they are called <hi>Seates.</hi> For Iudgement was euer giuen in publike <hi>sitting.</hi> And there's good reason for it.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And so wee are come to the last, the great Circumstance of the Text, <hi>the House of Dauid</hi>: the Guide, and the Ground too, vnder God, of that vnitie which blesses <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The <hi>house,</hi> that is, not the house onely, but the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All <hi>Regall and Iudiciary power</hi> was seated by God himselfe in <hi>Dauid</hi> and his Posterity,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 7.10. &amp; Psal. 89.36.</note> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. That Hee, as King ouer his people, might take care, both that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> might be <hi>at vnitie in it selfe</hi>: and <hi>that the Tribes of the Lord might goe thither to giue thankes to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8786:22"/>
Name of the Lord</hi>: that all the seruants of God among that people might knowe, that God had committed them to the trust of <hi>Dauid</hi>: that they might not promise themselues succour from <hi>God,</hi> otherwise then as they liued in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Dauid</hi>: that they might not thinke to alter the gouernement, or the succession, but rest dutifully where God had placed them. And therfore when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> rent ten Tribes from the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but distraction and misery fel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that people euer after, as appeares in the story.</p>
            <p>This to the letter strictly. Now to the sense at large, as both Church and State haue subordination to the house of <hi>Dauid.</hi> For <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that's at vnitie vnder <hi>Dauid.</hi> And the Tribes they go vp to the Testimony vnder <hi>Dauid.</hi> And the <hi>Seats</hi> of iudgement, they haue their seueral ministrations, but all with reference, all in obedience to the house of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:8786:23"/>Now in a State the <hi>King, obtinet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum fundamenti,</hi> is alwayes fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. All inferiour powers of Nobles, Iudges, and Magistrates rest on him. And yet the holy Ghost doth not say in my Text, that the Seates of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are vpon the foundation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> but vpon the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And the reason is plaine: because there is one and the same <hi>foundation</hi> of the King and his people, that is, God and Christ. But when the house of the King is built vpon God as <hi>Dauid</hi>'s was, then 'tis to the people <hi>&amp; domus, &amp; fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum,</hi> both an house, and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their houses.</p>
            <p>And that you may see the trueth of this, looke into the Story of all States, and you shall neuer finde a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap vpon the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> to make it shake, but the houses of all the Subiects in the Kingdome shooke with it. And this is an euident Argument, that the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> is a <hi>Foundation,</hi> when such a mighty building as a State, is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8786:23"/>
shaken with it. And therefore there's no man that loues his owne house, but hee must loue the <hi>Kings,</hi> and labour, and studie to keepe it from shaking.</p>
            <p>And if you marke the Text, here's <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des super Sedem,</hi> one <hi>Throne,</hi> or <hi>Seat</hi> vpon another. And all well-ordered States are built so by <hi>Sub &amp; Super,</hi> by <hi>Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> The intermediate Magistrates haue their subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either to other, and all to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> But the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> that's both, <hi>Sub &amp; Super</hi>; vnder the rest in the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>; for so the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reade it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, vpon the house of <hi>Dauid</hi>; so the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> vnder, as <hi>Foundation.</hi> But ouer the rest in the <hi>administration</hi> and the <hi>gouernment.</hi> For they which are vpon him, must not bee aboue him. A <hi>primacie,</hi> or <hi>superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> or what you will aboue the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> in his owne Kingdome, is a dangerous, and an ill construction of <hi>Super Domum Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The house of <hi>Dauid</hi> a <hi>Foundation</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8786:24"/>
then: and my Text warrants both it and mee. I haue no will to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any forme of gouernement, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any State: Yet this my Text bids me say for the honour of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall Gouernment.</hi> The <hi>Seates</hi> of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it are permanent. And I doe not remember that euer I read <hi>Seates of Iudgement</hi> so fixed, as vnder <hi>Regall power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not by this denie, but that there may bee the City in peace, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of iustice in other formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urenment, somtimes asmuch, somtimes more. But there are <hi>Iudicia,</hi> not <hi>Sedes,</hi> Iudgement, not Seats of it. And Iustice there may be; but it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinues not halfe so steddy. The Factions of an <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> how often haue they diuided the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into ciuil warres, and made that City which was at vnitie in it selfe, wade in her owne blood? And for a <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> or popular Gouernment, <hi>Fluctus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli, fluctus maris,</hi> The waues and the Gulfes of both are alike. None but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8786:24"/>
God can <hi>rule the raging of the Sea, and the madnes of the people, Psal.</hi> 65.<note place="margin">Psal. 65.7.</note> And no safety or settlednes, till there bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne <hi>in domum Dauid,</hi> to a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> againe.</p>
            <p>I'le goe no whither but to my Text and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for instance. That peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had a <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> ouer them, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wise and a great <hi>Senate</hi>; the chiefe of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in their Lawes of the other Tribes. If any greater difficulty arose, God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp Iudges and Deliuerers to fight their Battailes. This people were well, a man would thinke, for point of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, very well.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calu. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> And yet <hi>Caluin</hi> obserues, and 'tis true, though they had then Iustice and Iudgement among them, yet they were but <hi>suspensa Iudicia, &amp; varie mutata,</hi> Iustice with suspence &amp; often changes. And which is more, that people restles and vnquiet euen with the Ordinance of God himselfe till they had a King, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.</note> So after the disobedience of <hi>Saul,</hi> (which can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8786:25"/>
cast euen Kings out of Gods fauour) that State was settled vpon the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> then a <hi>Foundation,</hi> and a settled one too, as Mortality hath any. The whole frame of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, vnderstood here by the <hi>Seats of Iudgement</hi> rests vpon the strength of his <hi>house.</hi> Vpon his <hi>house?</hi> therefore it must bee built and settled, els 'tis not <hi>domus,</hi> not a house. When 'tis built, it must bee furnished, &amp; plentifully too; els 'tis not fit to bee <hi>domus Dauidis,</hi> the Kings house. If any disaster hath been, it must bee repayred; els <hi>Domus lacera</hi> a House vpon props, can be no <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Iustice to friends at home, or vpon enemies abroad. And there can hardly bee a greater miserie to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to haue the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> weake.</p>
            <p>Well then; would you haue the <hi>house</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> as <hi>Dauids</hi> was now at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> A built, A furnished, A strong, An honourable <hi>House?</hi> I know you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8786:25"/>
would. You are a Noble and a most Loyall People. Why then I will not take vpon mee to teach, but onely to remember you of the way. The way is; —Am I out? No sure. The way is, To set <hi>Dauid</hi> once vpon his owne feet; to make him see the strength of the <hi>house</hi> which God hath giuen him.; to fill him with ioy and contentment in his peoples loue; to adde of your. oyle to make him a cheerefull countenance, now that <hi>God hath anointed him with the oyle of gladnes ouer you</hi>; that in a free Estate he may haue leisure from Home-Cares, euery way to intend the good and welfare of his people; and to blesse God for them, and them in God.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Dauid,</hi> God hath blessed him with many royall Vertues. And aboue the rest with the knowledge that his <hi>House</hi> is a <hi>foundation.</hi> A <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his people, and of all the iustice that must preserue them in vnitie, and in happines. But 'tis <hi>Domus eius, His House</hi> still, euen while 'tis your <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:8786:26"/>
And neuer feare him, for God is with him. Hee will not depart from Gods seruice; nor from the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care of his people; nor from wise managing of his treasure: He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vndermine his owne <hi>house,</hi> nor giue his people iust cause to bee iealous of a shaking <hi>foundation.</hi> And here in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God and his blessed Angels, as well as of you, which are but dust &amp; ashes, I discharge the true thoughts of my heart, and flatter not. And now my <hi>Dread Soueraigne,</hi> vpon you it lyes to make good the thoughts of your most deuoted Seruant.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue seen as short a <hi>Mapp,</hi> as I could draw of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Shee was famous for her <hi>vnitie,</hi> and blessed too, when it was <hi>within her selfe.</hi> Shee was famous for her <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; deuout too, when <hi>all the Tribes went vp to the Arke of the Testimonie, to giue thankes to the name of the Lord.</hi> Shee was famous for <hi>Iustice,</hi> and successfull too, both at home, and against forreigne enemies,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8786:26"/>
when the <hi>Seates</hi> of Iudgement Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall and Ciuill were all, as their seuerall natures beare, founded vpon the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of ours is now <hi>at vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it selfe.</hi> And I see here <hi>Capita Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buum,</hi> the Heads and Leaders of the Tribes, and People of the Lord, come vp, and present in his Temple. I would to God they were all here, that with one heart, and one mouth, wee might all pray vnto God for all his blessings to come down, and dwell in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi>; and to rest vpon this great and honourable <hi>Councell</hi> now ready to sit.</p>
            <p>You are come vp to begin at the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Lord. The <hi>Arke</hi> was wholly Ceremoniall; that's not here. But the <hi>Testimonie of Israel,</hi> the Law, yea and a better Law then that, the Law of Grace and of Christ, that's here. Here it is, and open ready to teach <hi>the feare of the Lord,</hi> which is <hi>the beginning of all wisedome, Psal.</hi> 111.<note place="margin">Psal. 111.10.</note> In this Law you
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8786:27"/>
can read nothing but seruice to <hi>God,</hi> &amp; obedience to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And so you find them ioyned, 1. <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1. S. Pet. 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>Feare God, and honour the King.</hi> And 'tis a strange Fallacie in Religion for any man to <hi>dishonour</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and to make that a proofe that he <hi>feares God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Temple and the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you are come vp. When God would giue <hi>Moses</hi> more speciall direction, hee declared himselfe from the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> which was on the <hi>Arke. Exod.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Exod. 25.22.</note> The <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> was wholly Ceremoniall, as the Arke was on which it stood; that is; the <hi>Seate</hi> Ceremonie, but the <hi>Mercy</hi> substance. And though the <hi>Seate</hi> bee gone with <hi>Moses,</hi> yet I hope God hath not left, will neuer leaue, to appeare in <hi>Mercy</hi> to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and this wise <hi>Councell.</hi> If hee appeare in <hi>mercy,</hi> I feare nothing. If hee appeare other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there will bee cause to feare all things. And the way to haue God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in <hi>mercy</hi> is for both King and People, not only to come to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8786:27"/>
that's but the outside of Religion, but also to obey the Law, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudgement</hi> went out from God late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it was fierce. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands strong men, which might haue bin a wall about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hath the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence</hi> swept away? But his <hi>mercy</hi> soon ouertooke his <hi>Iudgement</hi>: For when did the eye of man behold so strange and sodain abatement of so great <hi>Mortalitie?</hi> A great argument, that hee will now appeare in <hi>Mercie.</hi> And I cannot tell which hath got the better in the vie, <hi>Your Honour,</hi> or <hi>Your Religion,</hi> that you haue made such hast to bring the <hi>Tribes</hi> to the <hi>Temple, to giue thanks to the name of the Lord</hi> for this.</p>
            <p>The first Lesson of this dayes Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer is <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note> There's the Story of <hi>Iethro</hi>'s counsell to <hi>Moses,</hi> for assistance of inferiour Officers. This was not the beginning of that great and parliamentary Councell, which after continued successefull in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8786:28"/>
State of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For that was set after by GOD himselfe,<note place="margin">Numb 11.16.</note> 
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. yet I make no great doubt, but that the ease, which <hi>Moses</hi> found by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, made him apt to see what more hee needed; and so farre at least occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned the setling of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take the <hi>omen</hi> of the day, and the <hi>Seruice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to blesse it. That our <hi>Dauid</hi> may be as happy in this, and all other <hi>Sessions</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as their <hi>Moses</hi> was in his <hi>Councell</hi> of the <hi>Elders.</hi> That the King and his people may now, and at all like times, meete in loue, consult in wisedome, manage their Counsell with temper, entertaine no priuate businesse to make the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like suffer; And when their consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ended, part in the same loue that should euer bring King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together.</p>
            <p>And let vs all pray, That our <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which did neuer but flourish when it was at vnitie in it selfe, may now and euer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8786:28"/>
continue in that <hi>vnitie,</hi> and so bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer successefull both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. That in this vnitie the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the Lord, euen all the Families and Kinreds of his people may come vp to the Church, to pray, and prayse, and giue thanks vnto him. That no <hi>Tribe</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> for any pretences (for they are no better) may absent themselues from the Church and Testimony of the Lord: That the <hi>Seates of Iudgement</hi> Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill of all sorts, may not onely be set, but set firmely, to administer the iustice of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> vnto his people. That all men may reuerence and obey the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who it selfe vpon God, is the foundation of all these blessings. That God would mutually blesse <hi>Dauid,</hi> and this People. That so the People may haue cause to giue thankes to God for <hi>Dauid</hi>; And that <hi>Dauid</hi> may haue cause to take ioy in the loue and loyalty of of his people; and blesse God for both.
