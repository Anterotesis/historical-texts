            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4271:16"/>
beene, or to reckon up a tedious Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, (being so numerous) of their first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and abettors: Neither in how many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells they have beene convinced, and utterly exploded, which would take up more time than needeth: fince we know by our <hi>Saviours</hi> owne words, that there should be false Prophets and Teachers even to the end of the World: onely I will give you a briefe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter what (for the most part) one of these Innovators in Religion is:</p>
            <p>An Hypocrite, and of all Actors the worst; as personating him whom he is not, but would seeme to be: double fac't, double hearted: In outward appearance boasting fadnesse and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Whilit within hee is all pleasure and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity; and for no other cause, but that hee can so craftily delude, and cunningly deceive. In his demisse lookes you may read the Characters of Religion, which the more he seemeth to Profosse, he is the further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the practice: A smooth face, a rugged mind, a sheeps habite, a wolves heart: a simple and straight garment, a double and large conscience: His heart convinc't by his mouth, his mouth by his actions: Hee riseth early to goe into the Temple, and that God whom in heart he despiseth, he there seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adoreth: where hee more regards who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what he doth, than considers with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe what he ought to doe: his heart not being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4271:16"/>
aware whither his eyes wander. He exclaimes ofthe want of charity in others, but expresseth no part thereof in himselfe: His seat in the Church is, where he may be the most seene: In the time of the Sermon he drawes out his tables to take the Notes, but still noting who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves him to take them. At every place of Scripture cited, he turnes over the leaves of his Booke, more pleased with the motion of the leaves, than the matter of the Text: For hee folds downe the leaves, though he finds not the place: his eye being still fixt on his paper, or the Pulpit: Hee lifts up the whites of his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, when hee meditates on the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did pleasures of the earth; his body being in Gods Church, when his minde is in the divels Chappell. If he heare a strange Preacher, he at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming down, as raptur'd with his Doctrine, salutes him with a cringe, and demands his name with a congie; and offers that person his Hat, whose profession he casts at his heeles: but if he can winde him up to his owne Tone, he will Echo to him in the same Tune.</p>
            <p>When he takes occasion to speake of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his former life, he will seeme to weepe, not for his former wantonnesse, but his present weaknesse: not that he hath a will to act, but that he hath no ability to performe: not for the many sinnes of his youth, but that hee cannot so freely commit them in his age. Other mens

errors he will sharply reproove, but his owne vices secretly retaine: If he give to the poore, it is not that they should pray for him, but that thereby he may make a prey of others: He both prayes and gives, but neither of them without company; because he thinks, if God should not take notice of his workes, hee can be sure to bring witnesse of them. If he prove so rich as to raise an Hospitall out of his private usury, it is not for any vertue, but rather vaine glory; as being onely built for such as hee hath before begger'd. Hee will transforme a Gnat into a Cammell, and a Fly into an Elephant: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres his owne superstitions before the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reverent Ceremonies, and will sooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a white sheete, than endure a surplesse. He prescribes his owne Lawes, and directs his faith by his owne Liturgy: standing whilst others bowe, and sitting whilst others kneele. To his Acquaintance present he is a <hi>Gnato,</hi> to those that are absent an <hi>Aristarchus:</hi> he weepeth at the side of his friend, when his heart wisheth him in his grave. Hee salutes cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he intends churlishly: and to conclude with these full attributes belonging unto him: though he be held a Saint by his owne Sect, he proveth his neighbours calamity, the poyson of honesty, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weales canker, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches corrosive, an eye sore by day, a stumbling block by night, a Taper smoky in the burning,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4271:17"/>
noysome in the extinguishing, faulty in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, false in his oath; who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>he seems much to favour, ought then most especially to be feared.</p>
            <p>I forbeare to speake of any forraigne Vipers, onely to shew you the Spiders bred under our owne roofes, &amp; the Snakes bedded in our native Earth, many new and upstart Schismaticall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have lately troubled the peace of the Church; all different among themselves, onely agreeing in this, that they unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to disturbe the common quiet. The Father of one sect, a learned <hi>Button-maker</hi> well known, the founder of another, a commenting <hi>Cobler,</hi> &amp;c. And now we have 2 Prophesying <hi>Weavers</hi> (upon whose stupidity or madnesse this present discourse isframed) in durance, whose ridiculous absurdities I shall presently acquaint you with: Onely this I faine would know, were there no Ecclesiasticall government, what rubricke should stand? or how, or after what manner would they have <hi>God</hi> served? One sect beleeves wee have a Saviour, but counts it superstition to have his name reverenc't, and bow'd unto: Some approove of no Sacraments at all, others allow of Sacraments, but hold, that to kneele before the Table or Altar when the Blessed Supper of the Lord is to be received, is meerely Idolatrous: Notwithstanding the Church with godly and mature consideration hath injoyned it. Some cavell at the manner of the standing of
<pb facs="tcp:4271:18"/>
the Table. Others would sit at the Lords board with their backes toward the Wall, as they eate in their houses, or drinke in the Tavernes. (yea, and no doubt, with their heads covered too) One fect challengeth the liberty of all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality and pleasure: Others will allow no commendable exercises or lawfull recreations. But if you observe them generally, and withall consider them judicially, it will easily appeare, that as they altogether impugne the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches authority, so cunningly and cautelous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they would trench upon the high Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, some are not more piously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to repaire Churches and Temples, than others are divelishly minded to see them ruind and demolisht. Some will heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but they cannot endure to be present at Common Prayer: Others could be content to heare divine Service, but abhorre it if it be said in a Popish Surplesse: Nay, there are divers who make a conscience to heare sermons, yet they will heare but such and such a man as pleaseth their owne fancies and affections. But if any of these Predicants shall affect novelty, or singularity, to introduce any innovating points of Doctrine, deviating from the true and Orthodoxe way of the mother Church, he shall be sure to bee most highly applauded, and the place wherein he lectureth or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4271:18"/>
to be much thronged. And if he shal stand out against Conformity in Religion, and for that cause be questioned, and therefore silenc't; then there are private collections, gifts, presents, and contributions, and all these to maintaine him in his perverse obstinacies. Againe, one loves the Bible, but it must be bound without the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> for that they hold as an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Insomuch, that many from Schisme grow unto Atheisme, and in devising new and unheard of waies how to worship God, grow into that stupidity, to acknowledge no God at all, and from hearts of flesh, they are growne to have hearts of Iron and Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.</p>
            <p>As for those that hate Churches, and love to have their conventieles in private houses, or in VVoods and Groves; to whom may I better compare them than to the Idolatrous <hi>Iewes?</hi> who leaving the glorious Temple of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Baal-peo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi> and divers others of the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in Groves and the high places. But amongst all these diversities of opinions, if every man (having no super-eminent power over him, to curbe his presumed and refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory liberty) should follow his owne private humour, what manner of Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth should wee have amongst us? VVould not all grow into confusion and disorder, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4271:19"/>
returne into that stupidity of ignorance which swayed in the VVorld before the true Religion was first propagated, and after received at the last it must necessarily come to mutiny, if not massacre: for as there is no greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or more invented hatred prosecuted, then when familiar friends fall at oddes, or naturall brothers grow into dissention: so there can no greater hatred, or inveterate malice arise, then when Christian brethren of a reformed Church, having distanced themselves from all Papall superstitions, shall inconsiderately and indiscreetly, I may rather say, foolishly and madly fall into these sottish and ridiculous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraes, to betray weaknesse in themselves, and beget distraction in others: being indeede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than meere illusions of the Divell; the former Ages having beene troubled with the like, as no question, the future shall be. But I come now to the persons themselves, the one <hi>Richard Farnham</hi> a <hi>Weaver</hi> in White-Chappell, the other <hi>Iohn Bull,</hi> a <hi>Weaver,</hi> late dwelling in the Parish of St. <hi>Butolphs Algate.</hi>

               <head>The Examination of <hi>Richard Farnham</hi> Weaver, taken <hi>April</hi> the 16. 1636.</head>
               <p>THe said examinate saith, and constantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that hee hath the very spirit of God, which revealeth unto him all secrets what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: and that he is moreover Anointed, and can predict and foretell whatsoever is to come. Hee saith also, that there shall be a great pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and a Famine, and that he shall see them, and be delivered from them, as having no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to hurt him. He likewise affirmeth, that he must first be slaine, and after that rise againe, and after that be made King of that very <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> in which King <hi>David</hi> and King <hi>Salomon</hi> once reigned. He saith also that he himselfe is one of those two witnesses spoken of in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> the 11 <hi>Chapter,</hi> beginning at the third <hi>Verse,</hi> and that his brother <hi>Bull</hi> is another also; and shall be a Priest at the same time when he is made a King. Now the words of the <hi>Text</hi> on which they ground these idle fancies are these: <hi>But I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesie one thousand, two hundred, and threescore dayes cloathed in sackecloth.</hi>

These are the two Olive-trees, and two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, standing before the God of the earth.</p>
               <p>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths, and devoureth their enemies: for if any man would hurt them, thus must he be killed.</p>
               <p>These have power to shut Heaven, that it raine not in the dayes of their Prophesying, and have power over waters to turne them into blood, and to Smile the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they will.</p>
               <p>And when they have finished their Testimony, the beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall make warre against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
               <p>And their corpses shall lie in the streets of the great City, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4271:20"/>
againe; and after that his resurrection, he shall reigne there as a Priest. And these two persist in their obstinacies, and are at this time priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the one in <hi>New-gate,</hi> the other in <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well:</hi> now the blind and besotted ignorance of these poore and sencelesse Mechanicks I leave to the consideration of any indifferent Reader. But you have not yet heard all: for such is the presumption of <hi>Farnham,</hi> and the inflexible confidence in his owne innocency, that to any reverent Divine, or other well-minded Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who come modestly to disswade him from these refractory absurdities, he will say, that his desire is, nay, rather his earnest request is; that as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into a Den of Lions, so he may be also; to prove himselfe to be a true Prophet, and a chosen vessell of the Lord: for as their mouthes were shut up against <hi>Daniel,</hi> so likewise it shall happen to him: for they shall neither have strength nor power to hurt or damage him.</p>
               <p>They further hold themselves to have such power over the Elements, that at their prayer they can command the clouds to showre downe raine upon the earth, and at their prayer too they can restraine those timely and seasonable drops which refresh it.</p>
               <p>Here too it is further to be observed, that they are simple Tradesmen, who never look't upon any University, or scarcely have beene
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4271:21"/>
acquainted with a Grammar Schoole: who onely can read English, though yet know not how to speake it truely. Yet these poore fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes confidently beleeve, that the Spirit of God shall so aboundantly fall upon them, that like the Apostles they shall be able to speake all Tongues and Languages: But especially, when they shall come to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they shall be inspired with the <hi>Holy Tongue,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same in which the Patriarchs and Prophets spake, and prophesied.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in all their conference with such as sometimes for novelties sake come to visite them, they constantly affirme, and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, that no mortall man of what estate or condition foever, can have the least power to harme them: Or if it please the Almighty to suffer them to discipline or chastise their bodies, yet over their lives they shall have no power at all, either to hazard them, or take them away. But whosoever shall intend, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any such violence against them, their hate towards them shall be turned upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so that they shall prove their owne executioners, such as was <hi>Iudas,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the life of his Lord and Maister. But let the Reader here take notice (in this) how ignorantly and sottishly they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themselves, affirming in this place, that no man shall have the least power to insidiate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4271:21"/>
their lives, or bring them to any untimely and remarkable death: When before in <hi>Farnhams</hi> examination by divers learned Commissioners, appoynted to that purpose, Hee (with the other contested, that he must be first slaine, and after rise againe, and be crowned King of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> And <hi>Bull</hi> in his examination attested, That he should be also first slaine at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> where Christ suffered, and after live againe, and like <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonne <hi>Eleazar,</hi> reigne an High Priest there; which something seemes to smell of the Sect of the <hi>Thraskites</hi> and <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might leave these, and come to a third, namely a woman, now prisoner in Bridewell, the weaknesse of whose Sexe can bee no excuse or priviledge for her horrible blasphemies, which indeede, almost want pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, and yet we may see how farre the Divell can worke with his owne servants. I might set downe with her name <hi>Margret Tennis,</hi> her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; the which, for modesties sake I will forbeare to speake of; it beeing such incredible, and scarce heard-of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, able not onely to make the eares to tingle, but the heart to tremble: which as it hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors mee to write, so, I make no question, but whosoever shall peruse it, it will trouble him to read, and therefore I forbeare to publish it, in regard that 'tis almost unbeleeveable, that any

such Monster should have being upon the face of the earth; at least, he may well, and that just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, suspect that the words which she spake, came from the mouth of a <hi>Iew,</hi> but no <hi>Christian.</hi> But at this present she is either mad, or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits madnesse, wishing with my heart, that shee may both returne to her wits, and to true repentance: And as of her, so also I speake of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I could wish to have an inspection into their owne follies, and having gone so far astray, to retyre themselves into the true sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest of Kings saith: <hi>Hee that keepeth his mouth and his tongue, hee keepeth his soule from affliction, and else where. It is a mans honour to cease from strife, but every foole will bee meddling. There bee some that speake words like the pricking of a sword, but the tongue of a wise-man is health: The beginning of strife is as one that openeth the waters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ere the contention be meddled with, leave off. He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and hee that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. The froward heart findeth no good, and hee that hath a naughty tongue falleth into evill.</hi>

               <p>There is no question to be made, but that he who is the Father of Lyes, is also the founder of controversies, who is the Divell: neither is his inveterate malice against mankinde disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in publicke hostility onely, (as when
