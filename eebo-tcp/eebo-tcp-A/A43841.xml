            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE,</head>
            <p>THe Sun has run its courſe nine times
through the Zodiack, ſince theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
paſſed betwixt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and
my ſelf. He was pleaſed to be the
Aggreſſor; and he alſo ſounded the Retreat:
far be it from me to invite and Re-aſsume ſuch
grinning trouble. I ſhall ever imbrace my own
reſt and quiet, in making a Golden Bridge for
ſuch an impetuous Adverſary; laying hold on
any generous overture, whereby I may both ſave
my credit and my pains; that I may the better
purſue (without diſtraction) my calmer and
more profitable Studies. I had indeed given him
ſome fraternal advice, in order to the peace of
the Church. But his reſtleſs and diſtemper'd
Stomach, turn'd this wholeſome Doſe into Foam
and Choler. He made himſelf ready for
War: And preſently ſnatches up his angry Pen,
made of a<note n="*" place="margin">Homo Hiſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſae, &amp; lividae mentis. <hi>Jerom. P. 213.</hi>
               </note> Porcupines Quil, to
gore me for my Charity. As if it
had been provocation enough, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to ſee one inch farther than his
<pb facs="tcp:62157:3"/>
Eyes could reach; or once to ſuppoſe, that his
daring Judgment; could any way ſtag or warp with
errour and fallibility; ſo as to need advice and
counſel. Hence it is, that his Strain is lofty and
Magiſterial. Had another let fall one drop of
ſuch corroding Vitriol, he muſt immediately have

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>that he dealt in proud wrath.</hi> So that
it is not the leaſt thing obſervable in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
we may divine of what ſpirit theſe Men
are of; and with what Scorpions we had ſmarted,
if Providence had not delivered us from ſuch
<hi>Aegyptian,</hi> tyrannical Task-maſters. Herein
indeed they are like to the Diſciples of Chriſt,
when their dark ſide was towards us,—they are
ſtill aſpiring to be greateſt; and ready to call down
Fire from Heaven upon thoſe that ſtand in their
way. I hope that I have not requited him with
his ſcornful and ſlighting Rhetorick. Better
to fall ſhort in anſwering his Arguments, and
remain in his debt, than pay him in his own Coin,
and ſtrive who ſhall be the proudeſt ſinner. I
have not ſo learn'd Chriſt—to revile when I

in a worſe condition, than he that gets the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:
He is the greater and more forlorn Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
He deſerves no other Garland than one
made of Nettles and Hemlock. He merits little
better, that makes a loud profeſſion of Chriſt,
ſeems to ingroſs Religion, and monopolize all
<pb facs="tcp:62157:3"/>
Piety; yet neither ſhews Meekneſs, Humilty,
Self-denial, Obedience, Love, or any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Grace in his Life: pretending more than
ordinary kindneſs to the Husband; yet rending
and mangling his Spouſe the Church into more
parts than the Levite did his Concubine. With
the Heretical Crow (ſo <hi>Proſper</hi> calls that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
Bird) they run out of the Ark, and
will not return: they leave it deſolate; and
their deluded Hearts feed upon Carkaſſes; thoſe
Inventions that float upon the Surges of their
own Brains: For never were Men more guilty
of what they condemn in others. They declaim
againſt Innovations, Superſtition, and Will-worſhip:
And yet their own darling-diſcipline,
with the whole Compages of their affected Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(eſpecially as to the manner of them) is
little elſe but a Cento and Miſcellany of the ſame.
As ſingular, as their looks, garb and utteranee.
What poor Sacrifices are theſe to Atone a moſt
wiſe and heart-ſearching God? to win upon, and
ingage the Judgments of ſuch Men, as know
that a reaſonable Service is required at their
hands? The more united we are in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
the more we throng and flock together to
Gods Houſe, the more God will be glorified;
we comforted and confirmed; and the greater awe
and terror will be upon our Adverſaries. Theſe
Men have, and do make St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Complaint to
be juſtly ours, Epiſt. 147. <hi>Husbands and Wives
can agree together to lye in the ſame Bed:
<pb facs="tcp:62157:4"/>
Parents and Children, to live in the ſame
Houſe: yet</hi> Domum Dei non habent unam,
<hi>they cannot agree to go together to the ſame
Place of Worſhip.</hi> We may ask with St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
amazement, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A better account muſt be given of publiſhing
theſe Papers, after they had ſo long been thrown
aſide as waſt Papers; devoted either to Moths,
or the Oven; eſpecially ſince Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his
laſt ſeemed unwilling they ſhould ſee the Light:
And I did heartily comply with him. It was no
ſmall joy, that he did ſuperſede his trouble of
writing: I ſtill wiſh it may not only be a Truce,
but a laſting Reſolution; for he is indefatigable
in raiſing Clouds of polemick duſt; and makes
Books faſter than I can read them. I do not ſay
this in the words of the Father,—<hi>Decolorare
famam,</hi>—to faſten any blot upon his Name;
but to gratifie and applaud my own happineſs,
in being delivered from ſo importunate and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
an Author.</p>
            <p>1. Did I ſtand at his Elbow, I would whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
to him,—That the Iſſues and Products of
his Head would be more lively and maſculine; if
his retentive faculty were more coſtive and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous:
If he teem'd with the deliberation of
the Elephant; rather than ſlip his burden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it come to maturity. Thoſe Animals
that are moſt pregnant, have the moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Births.</p>
            <p>2. Had he taken as much pains to edifie and
<pb facs="tcp:62157:4"/>
ſave Souls; to teach Men Piety, Obedience, and
Loyalty; to preſs Men to Vnity, Peace, and
mutual Love; as he has in making Parties;
diſtracting and dividing Mens minds; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
the Church and State with his <hi>Aetna</hi>-Granadoes
and Eructations, his Name might
have been imbalm'd with a fragrant ſavour in
the Ages to come.</p>
            <p>3. Since he hath told us almoſt in every Book
he hath printed, for above twenty years paſt,
how infirm he is in his bodily health; and that he
is daily dropping into his Grave: If I durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to be his Counſellor, I would mind him of
ſpending the remainder of his time in writing
Books of Heavenly Devotions; that ſo, laying
aſide the Sword, and taking up the Trowel, he
may make ſome ſatisfaction to the Church for thoſe
wounds and breaches, he hath either made, or kept
open in her Bowels; And alſo Antidote the Souls,
whom he hath poiſoned with his vexatious Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
before all the Sands of his Glaſs be run
out, and he go hence to give up his Account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an All-ſeeing and Impartial Judge!</p>
            <p>Though I had eſcaped thus out of his Talons,
and there was a kind of ſtipulation betwixt us, to
let down the Flood-gates, and ſhut the Gates of
<hi>Janus;</hi> yet as if (to uſe his own words) he had
pin'd me faſt to a Wall, where he might inflict
the Correction of as many Stripes as he pleas'd,
without either reſiſtance or repercuſſion from me:
He tells the World in print,—<hi>what Toys I
<pb facs="tcp:62157:5"/>
had written.</hi> And in ſeveral other Books,—
as alſo in the laſt I have ſeen, (for being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
in the Country, and overgrown with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian
Moſs, I converſe with few that are new)
he acquaints his Readers how unſatisfactory my
endeavours have been; though he anſwers neither
one Chapter, or Page, in the whole Book, that
ſo much offends him: Let equal Judges blame
me, if I have tranſgreſſed againſt his fourth
Letter, or my Anſwer to the ſame: For he hath
confuted his own Reaſons, and firſt brake the
Condition of a Hypothetical Compact: Since he
goes on to reproach our Mother, and all her duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
Sons, is not this enough to force a dumb Child
to ſpeak,—<hi>Semper ego Auditor tantum, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamne
reponam?</hi> I muſt do him right. He
ſtrikes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> through my Loins alone; but with the
ſame Dart wounds my Betters. As if I ſhould
have this allay in my fall,—to have good
company. It matters not what we ſay; for, as
if we were meer Shrimps and Striplings to this
<hi>Goliah;</hi> whiffling Currs to this Majeſtick Lyon,
—he holds on his way, without once ſtooping
or looking aſide to any Reaſonings of ours: And
(which is as great blemiſh to his Ingenuity) he
gathers up the vomit and Venom of all the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Incendiaries that have peſtered the
Church ſince the breaking forth of this Schiſm:
He puts his Paint and Varniſh upon them; and
then obtrudes theſe weather-beaten Superannu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Wares, for freſh Merchandiſe; as if they
<pb facs="tcp:62157:5"/>
had never been blown upon before. He rallies
thoſe Troops which have been routed and baffled;
and furbiſhes thoſe Arguments which have been
anſwered again, and again, by the Divines and
Worthies of our Church: So that there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be an end of theſe Diſputes, if there be ſuch
a Circulation in the management of them. If
they revive and riſe again, as oft as they are
overthrown and diſarm'd; and with the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s
Head, grow as faſt as they are cut off. No
need of new Anſwers to ſuch Books. But as
Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> did prudently tranſcribe an Anſwer
to Mr. <hi>Creſcy</hi>'s <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi> out of our own
reformed Champions; ſo 'tis enough to confute
and retund the force of ſuch Rapſody's, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
what others have ſaid already. Old Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
muſt be rebuk'd and cur'd by old Remedies.
I fear that thoſe who re-inforce old Cavils, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking notice what others have ſaid to evade
them, do either delight in wrangling, or which
is worſe,—<hi>with-hold the Truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Book it ſelf, I leave it to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions
of thoſe that are concern'd in an
Anſwer, if it deſerve any; yet I cannot forbear
ſome few Strictures or Remarks.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Circumſtance of time, when it
came forth; even then, when we were almoſt
overwhelmed with fears from our common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
He had pleaded before for a Licenſe and
Diſpenſation: As if the printing ſuch a Book
<pb facs="tcp:62157:6"/>
would be againſt Law and Conſcience. But
when he perceived an <hi>Interim,</hi> the Laws were
huſh'd and ſilent; Conſcience (with the Lord
Chancellors Gown) was quickly thrown behind
the door: And when we were weak and ſore,
ready to fall a Prey to the <hi>Roman</hi> Fowler, he
help'd forward our miſery, by laying his Loyns
upon us too. So that if the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>
be not ſtrong enough,—<hi>The People of the
Land are ready to weaken the Hands of
the People of</hi> Juda, Ezra. 4. 4. He accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> as to the occaſion of the
late War. Both of them agree to father the
Brat upon ſome ſpeculative Diſputes and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
concerning ſome Doctrinal Points; that
they might the better undervalue the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
and diſgrace the Divines of thoſe Times.
So he had rather promote the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by ſhattering our Power, than miſs of his Will
in ſeeing our ruine. I hope that God, who
has been a Bulwork to his People; a Wall of
Braſs, and a Wall of Fire about his Church,
will ſtill infatuate the Counſels and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
both of <hi>Manaſſey</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and
preſerve his own <hi>Juda.</hi> How can we depend
upon their Kindneſs? that with the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi>
will carry it far in our Proſperity;
but if <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſet upon us, will joyn their
Forces with him, and diſown us in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62157:6"/>
2. He does not onely magnify the power of
the People (and this is ominous, at leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious)
as if the Patronage of Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
were wholly in them—but he ſays too—
<hi>That neither Magiſtrates, nor Biſhops can ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
Miniſters once ordain'd.</hi> What intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is this upon the Kings Eccleſiaſtical power?
as if it were leſs now, than it was once in the
Kings of <hi>Juda.</hi> This ſeems to me not onely to
be contrary to <hi>Titus 1. 11. Whoſe mouths muſt
be ſtopped;</hi> but to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf in his
Book of Confirmation, pag. 87. <hi>Miniſters caſt
out by the Magiſtrate are bound to obey him;
and to give place to others (if his error tend
not to the deſtruction of the Church)</hi> and
<hi>beſtow their labours in ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
or <hi>in ſome other kind at home.</hi> His
mind changes with the Moon; yet he is conſtant
to his firſt Hypotheſis—his endeavour to pull
down the Fabrick of our Church, which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
built, that it is the wonder of all Lands.
None can juſtly be offended at it, only ſeditious
and factious Sectaries at home: Jeſuits abroad,
and he that ſpawn'd them both; are vex'd, and
gnaſh with their Teeth, to ſee her proſperity. But
mauger all their attempts, If our ſins do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh
the ſame; it will appear, to be rooted in
Adamant, and built upon ſuch a Rock, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the winds, or tempeſts of thoſe men united
together: nor the Floods and Waves from the
Dragon himſelf, ſhall ever overturn, or drown
<pb facs="tcp:62157:7"/>
it, when we know not what to do; yet we will
truſt on that God, whoſe outgoings are ſeen in
the Mount.</p>
            <p>3. How Tragically does be cry out, againſt
the Tranſlation of ſome Texts, in the Epiſtles,
Goſpels, and Pſalmes? as if they had never
been obſerv'd before: whereas he might alſo
have taken notice—that Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Fuller,</hi> and others, have given a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Account, how theſe places may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd.
He that had one dram of Candor, would
have ſate quiet at the ſeet of the <hi>Gamaliels,</hi>
without vexing the People, with ſuch needleſs
ſcruples. If he have a mind to trouble himſelf,
with more various Readings of Scripture; his
Friend Mr. <hi>Capell</hi> will lead him a dance, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſuch Meanders, that he will not eaſily extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelf, out of them. What if Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had two Bibles? In the one <hi>Job's</hi> Wife ſaid
—<hi>Curſe God and dy.</hi> In the other, <hi>Bleſs God
and die.</hi> In the one—<hi>Chriſt ſaid to the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
—no man eat Fruit of thee hereafter, for
the time of Figgs was not yet.</hi> In another
—<hi>for then was the time of Figgs.</hi> Will he
burn theſe Bibles? yet he would have the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
utterly caſhier'd, and rejected; becauſe of
ſome divers Tranſlations; which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory:
for they are not <hi>Secundum idem;</hi>
or in the ſame reſpect.</p>
            <p>4. How does he ſtrain ſome things in the
Act for uniformity, and alſo in the Liturgy;
<pb facs="tcp:62157:7"/>
until the very Blood follow? As if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſtand with a flaming Sword in his
hand: Either to keep ſome tender minded men,
out of the Vineyard, and Paradiſe of our Church;
I have too much cauſe to juſtify what I ſay: Or
elſe to Affright, Puzzle, and Perplex, thoſe
that have entred already; that they may drive
more heavily: Proceed with Trepidation; and
carry on the Lords work, with leſs expedition.
Whereas ſome grains of Charity, in taking words
and things in the beſt ſenſe they are capable of,
(as every honeſt man ought to do) might have
prevented and ſpoiled the greateſt part of his
Book. When the Covenant was juſtly charged to
be unlawful, from the very articulate ſound of
the words: with what tenderneſs, and ſoftneſs
was it ſens'd? What Salvo's were invented to
Palliate the Vlcer? But in our caſe; how are
words, and ſentences wreſted, and tenter'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Grammar, and intention of them? that
ſnares may be ſpread upon <hi>Miſpeh,</hi> to keep men
from going to the Houſe of the Lord; will the
great God thank theſe Mormo-makers another
day? <hi>Quam ſapiens argumentatrix ſibi vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ignorantia humana</hi> in the words of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi>
How fond and wiſe do they ſeem to
themſelves, that by a Carnal kind of ſubtilty doe
affect to be accounted the diſputers of this World.
I may well call ſuch wiſdome, carnal (how An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
and Seraphick ſoever it appear) from the
authority of the great Apoſtle, <hi>1 Cor. 3. 3.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62157:8"/>
               <hi>whereas there are among you Envying, Strife,</hi>

are ye not Carnal?</hi> will nothing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
ſome ſupercilions Humoriſts, but that the
whole frame of our Church and Religion muſt
be taken aſunder, Ravell'd, and Cancell'd, to
pleaſe them? Why did they not Petition the
King and Parliament, to erect a ſcruple Office?
or a ſtanding Committee? that might aſſoil their
growing doubts? And by ſome <hi>Scolia</hi> upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and their own Arts, give the meaning
of every Paragraph, and word in both? They
are now ſo mudded by theſe mens ſtrugling, and
trampleings; that like <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phyſicks—they
are <hi>Edita, &amp; non Edita,</hi> dark and Aenigmatical;
until they are clear'd, by the Lamp of ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening
Commentary. That common ſenſe,
which ſatisfies many thouſands of their Brethren;
will not ſerve their nice, and ſqueamiſh ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs.
But as if there were ſome Snake lurking
in the Graſs; and ſome inviſible knot in the
Bulruſh; every leaf, every ſprig of Graſs muſt
be turn'd, and ſhaken: every little feavouriſh
doubt muſt be Excuſs'd. As if a new Targum,
Miſna, or Paraphraſe, muſt be calculated on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for the Meridian of their ſwimming heads;
And none muſt do this, but the firſt Authors,
and Legiſtators—<hi>Magnus Revocetur ab orcis

Hammers, were once abated; there wight be
hope, that the Temple of God would riſe: If
<pb facs="tcp:62157:8"/>

mount towards Heaven. What could hinder

               <head>Mr. BAXTER'S
Firſt Letter,
Directed thus.</head>
               <head>To the AUTHOR of the
Perſwaſive to Conformity.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE vehemency and importunity of
your Call for an Account to the
World of the Reaſons of my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Practiſe, have ſufficiently
made me willing of the Work; and put me
upon craving your aſſiſtance in it, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
me theſe few Queſtions. 1. Whether
you know of any one that will Licenſe it, if
I ſhould write it? or can procure me ſo great
a favour, and who it is? 2. Or whether you
think it lawful to print it unlicenſed, contrary
to the Law of the Land? 3. Whether you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62157:10"/>
think it lawful by my Reaſons, which you call
for, to write that which the Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Laws forbid, under the Name of <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>appugning</hi> the <hi>Church-Government?</hi>
4. Whether you know how I
may be kept out of Goale when I have done:
(I hear you are now Miniſter of the Place,
whence a Letter was ſent, which occaſioned
my laſt impriſonment, where I am virtually
ſtill, being adjudged to go to <hi>New-gate,</hi>
when I am apprehended?) 5. Or if a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and (in probability) thereby Death,
be that you deſire, whether you think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſuffer ſo much and die, to ſatisfie your
deſire, and do that Work? 6. Whether you
know of any Printer and Bookſeller, who
would Print and Publiſh ſuch a Book, and
who they are? The <hi>Savoy</hi> Papers which you
talk of, were written by the Warrant of the
Kings Commiſſion, and publiſhed (ſome of
them; for others were never publiſhed) by
poor Scriveners that had the Copies, to get
Money, (without my knowledge, and to our
injury, in a Time when the Act againſt Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not made.) 7. Whether you think
if I ſhould write ſuch a Book, that the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane
Party would not be much more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and angry, than if I had ſaid nothing?
8. Whether I ſhould be called ſo earneſtly to
do that which will give ſo great offence againſt
the New Conformity, when that which you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62157:10"/>
mention, which was done by Commiſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Old Conformity, could never have
an Anſwer? And is it not as eaſie with you to
contemn another in ſtead of anſwering it, as
that? I crave your Anſwer, eſpecially to the
firſt Queſtions, becauſe your Importunity
would force me into a hope, that at laſt I have
met with the Man (though unknown) that
will procure me the liberty of writing and
publiſhing an Account of my Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For Charity forbiddeth me, till conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to charge you with ſuch vile <hi>Inhumanity</hi>
and <hi>Impudency,</hi> as publickly to call to a Man
for that which you take both for <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility,</hi>
and to reproach him for not print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when you know the Preſs is ſhut up from
him; and know, that it were like to be his
death, or ruine; eſpecially when you appeal
in defenſe of the Reaſonableneſs and Equity
of your Demand, and when you are a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the Goſpel, and as much wiſer and
better than the Non-conformiſts, as your
Book importeth. Craving your Anſwer, I
reſt, your greatly obliged Servant, if you
procure what you ſeem to promiſe me,</p>

TO
Mr. Baxter's firſt Letter.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Receiv'd yours this Afternoon, directed to
the Author of the <hi>Perſwaſive.</hi> I will not
tell you, that ſhooting at Rovers, you have
miſs'd the Mark. Though I glory not in ſuch
kind of <hi>Tactica,</hi> but prefer any plain Sermon
I preach before them. The main deſign of
of that Eſſay, (I hope) was not only inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but commendable: To cham down
fiery Spirits; not to raiſe them: And to call
in your Charitable Aſſiſtance; not to provoke
you. Therefore after ſuch candid dealing,
(eſpecially with your ſelf) I am not a little
ſurpriz'd with theſe rough Paſſages, as—<hi>Deſiring

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>! I hope
there is not ſo much Gall and Acrimony in
that whole Book you ſtumble at. Sir, I beſeech
you, ſet a ſtricter Watch over your Spirit,
that you offend not in your Tongue: Let not
your <hi>Saul</hi>-like Parts elevate you ſo high, as to
overlook others. I will aſſure you, I have no
malignant thoughts towards your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or any that are of your Judgment:
Thoſe that know me, will be my Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>I had, and ſtill have a deeper ſenſe of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſping
condition of our bleeding Church—The
ſtruglings of her own Children within her
Womb, I well knew, procur'd theſe Throws.
If therefore, according to the ſentiment of my
Judgment; which I neither receiv'd from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
or education, but from deliberate
and impartial ſtudy; I ventur'd on an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to reconcile them, and antidote her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Deliquium; I had thought I might have
eſcaped the Gauntlet, and only have been
pointed at by this Spit,—<hi>Magnis tamen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit
Auſis.</hi> If I could diſcover by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt
ſcrutiny, that I was acted with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Principles, than the Fear of God, and
Honour of the King, I would both abhor my
ſelf, and abandon my Enterprize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But till
then,—<hi>Dii coeptis aſpirate meis!</hi> I little
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62157:12"/>
look'd for this Complaint from you: for when
Fame lately ſpread a Report,<note place="margin">Kidderminſter.</note> that
you would return to your old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
in theſe Parts, I did heartily rejoyce;
not only in reſpect of the publick good, but
that I ſhould be happy in ſuch a Neighbour:
from whoſe Torch I might borrow Light, to
illuminate thoſe dark and opacous Parts which
are in my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Before I come to an Anſwer to your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I muſt premiſe my hearty thanks, in that
you have gratified me in one of my Requeſts,
by the Retractation of your political Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms.
The other, which you ſtick at, is as
modeſt and as rational. As hereafter we muſt
give an Account, to him that is ready to judge
the Quick and the Dead: So what abſurdity
was it, to deſire the Reaſons of your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
ſince you are pleaſed to walk Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to us. That you, who are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
might extricate us out of the Labyrinth of our
Errors; if you can make them appear ſo.
That ſo we may come over to you, and walk
on the ſafeſt part of the Globe.</p>
               <p>The Occaſion moving me to that boldneſs,
was a ſtartling Aſſertion from a
Friend of yours,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that Conformity is an avow'd and deliberate ſin.</note>—That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is in it ſelf ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ſinful. And was it not
time to call in Aid? Let this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and then farewell Tythes.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62157:12"/>
How ſhall I do ſuch wickedneſs, and ſin againſt
God? I do not find you ſo peremptory; but
rather to favour ſober, painful, and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Conformiſts: In which Claſſis I deſire to
be found.</p>
               <p>I had thought ſome Principles
of yours,<note place="margin">Healing Church Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> formerly laid down,
had inclin'd you to us: Not to
mention your Approbation of Dr. <hi>Brians
6th</hi> Sermon; and your late Book, wherein
you affirm many Catholick Truths. Though
(if I rearch your meaning)—All things
are not therein calculated to the pleaſing of
the <hi>Dioceſan Party,</hi> as you call them. And
the deluded Proſelytes in theſe Parts, are as
much exaſperated with you, on the other
hand, for your deſerting them: And as they
apprehend, too much compliance. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to ſtain my Paper with what they do
<hi>eruct are</hi> in their Frenzy-ſits. As double-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men are unſtable in all their ways: ſo thoſe
are never fix'd, that ſteer their courſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Notions of Mans Wiſdom. But
to your Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, &amp; 2. Q.</hi> Whether I hnow any that will
Licenſe ſuch a Book, <hi>(as contains the Reaſons
of Non-conformity.)</hi> And whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to print ſuch a Book?</p>
               <p>A. Theſe Queries are captious, and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:
Implying, that all Books <hi>de ſacto</hi> are
licens'd. The contrary whereof, is by daily
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62157:13"/>
experience evinc'd, in Books of the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and againſt the Royal Society it ſelf.
Nay, ſome of your own Books are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd.
And does your Conſcience cheek you
at this Inſtant only? Theſe Pangs will not be
permanent. Were I Chaplain to his Grace of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> I could
give you a more direct Anſwer to the former;
and as for the latter, you are your own Caſuiſt.</p>
               <p>

               </opener>
               <p>WHen I had wrote an Anſwer to ſo
much of your Book as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf, I caſt it by, perceiving
that it contained a juſt detection and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſuch things, as none of my Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
hitherto have had patience to endure to
be told of, who had not the patience or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
to forbear committing them. For your
Book confirm'd me in the Opinion which late
experience of the World had brought me to,
that it is one of Satans impudent deſigns, to
make ſin paſs uncontroll'd in the World, and
to render all that oppoſe it more criminal than
them that commit it, to tempt Men to ſin in
ſuch kinds and degrees, as that he ſhall ſeem
an uncivil Railer that preſumeth to charge
them with it. I purpoſed therefore to leave
you in the Fruition of your ſelf-pleaſing-crimes,
leſt the naming of them ſhould transfer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62157:15"/>
the imputed Guilt from you to me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I only tryed you with a few gentle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
in order to the fuller underſtanding
of your ſenſe. I anſwer to which, and in this
ſecond alſo, you expreſs ſo great tenderneſs,
and count your ſofteſt ſignification of a diſlike,
to be Cenſures ſo harſh and paſſionate, as if
you were injured, if your Crimes were not
applauded: And withall take it ill, to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
impatient of hearing the Truth, and call
for my Proofs in the very Lines which vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
expreſs your impatience. Your two
Letters ſo abound with words, which ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to tell me your conceits and confidence, and
what you would have us do, to be pleaſing to
you, and ſo much paſs over all that it concern'd
you in Reaſon and Juſtice to have ſpoke to,
that it is with reluctancy that I trouble you
with any Return. For what benefit can be
expected by it? You importune me to break
the Kings Laws by printing without Licence;
and in the ſame Volume repreſent us as hainous
breakers of his Law, for—you know
what. You can ſuppoſe me, without any
proof, to have formerly printed without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe;
and when you thought I had ſin'd
once, importune me to do it again: You can
intimate to the World how unreaſonably I
deal, if I write not and publiſh not that which
you judge it a ſin to publiſh, as being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and ſo cunningly bring me under one of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62157:15"/>
the imputations unavoidably, either of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by my unreaſonable ſilence, or by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many Laws. You lay this Charge on me,
before the World in print, and ſo importune
me to that Act, which the Law of the Land
will heavily puniſh; and yet wipe your mouth,
and take it ill to be noted, as one that would
draw me into ſuffering. And yet you want
not words, when you can give no reaſonable
Anſwer concerning any of this. You cannot
pretend, that ſuch Laws, if I break them, will
not be excuted, when I lie almoſt theſe two
years under penalty (adjudged to <hi>Newgate</hi> it
ſelf for ſix Months, by Sentence and Warrant)
for a far ſmaller breach of the Law (which my
beſt underſtanding perſwadeth me is none at
all.) You think the ſilencing of about 1800
Miniſters, while many hundred thouſand Souls
are periſhing through ignorance and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to be a Load not heavy enouh to the
People and them, (to ſay nothing of the
great indigence of many of their Families)
unleſs it be increaſed by your wordy bitter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorical
Reproach; when we would take it
for rare clemency, if we might but have leave
to preach Chriſts Goſpel without a farthing of
their maintenance, (yea, and to be confined
to preach only on the Catechiſm Points, to
ſome of the pooreſt ignorant Congregations,
ſuch as many in <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp;c. as I offered, when
I was ſilenced firſt; yea, and under ſharp Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62157:16"/>
if ever we ſpeak againſt Biſhops, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
or Ceremonies;) yet after nine years
ſilencing we muſt be ſcorned by you, as ſuch as
<hi>abjure their Calling, and make themſelves Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
emeritos:</hi> When you know that God will
not be ſerved by deliberate avowed ſin; and
that he that ſo entereth on, and exerciſeth his
Miniſtry, (and will ſin by Covenant, that he
may preach againſt ſin) can ſcarce expect a
Bleſſing, if a Pardon: And when you cannot
but know, (for you dwell in <hi>England,</hi> and
write againſt the Non-conformiſts) that the
ſins which the Non-conformiſts fear they ſhould
be guilty of, if they conformed, (not accuſing
any others) are ſo <hi>inhumane</hi> and <hi>hainous,</hi> that
we dare ſcarce name them, leſt you ſtartle, and
think we charge them upon you, (whom we
leave to your own Maſter.) Yet do you make
a hainous matter of it, that we thus by fearing
ſin our ſelves, do ſeem to think, that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is any ſin at all, and ſay we weaken your
Hands, prejudice your Miniſtry, and make
the People cold in joyning with you: What
then ſhould we do, if we publiſhed the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of our Non-conformity, and opened all
that ſin which we fear, which yet you ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
call for? Yea you ſay, <hi>[Who would
unmuzzle a fierce Panther, that would worry him
that ſet his Chops at liberty]</hi> even then, when I ask
you but to get me a License for that which you
ſo openly call for: which is all one as to ſay,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62157:16"/>
[Do it if thou dare: and if thou do it not,
thou abjureſt thy Calling, and refuſeſt to give
the World a reaſon of it:] You can tell the
World, that in my Book of <hi>Rest</hi> I ſeem to go
their way, that hold, (That they may fight
againſt the King, if it were for the cauſe of
Religion to purge the Church of Idolatry and
Superſtition, and cite <hi>P. 123.</hi> (in which Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of 12, I know not,) when I never wrote
ſo never thought ſo; but have proved the
contrary at large in ſeveral Writings! Yet this
is done deliberately in print. You fetch your
Charge from the old Editions of that Book,
eleven years after I had retracted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd,
and left out of that ſame Book, not
only that which you pervert, but all the reſt
from end to end, which ſeemed in the leaſt to
favour the late Wars. Either you knew this,
or you did not. If you did, was that done
like a peaceable Miniſter, to aggravate with
ſuch groſs and odious untruth things retracted,
and utterly expunged, even long before the
Act of Oblivion; and that ſo as directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the temporal ruine of him you charge
them on? If you knew it not, did it beſeem
you to meddle in Print, where you know no
better what you do oppoſe? What good will
<hi>Austins</hi> Retractations do him, if he ſhall ten
or eleven years after be freſhly charged with
all that he retracted, and much more? (yea,
I gave Mr. <hi>Hampden Pie</hi> one of the Books of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62157:17"/>
One of the latter Editions ſo altered, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before he came to your Houſe (to his utter
undoing.) If you did not ſee it, you might
have done, before you had written againſt it.
Yea, (as not regarding your ſelf-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
at the ſame time you call me to retract
my Political Aphoriſms, and tell me how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a Work it would be, when I had done
it before, and had ſo long before retracted what
you aggravate: Though the one was done ſo
lately, that you could ſcarce know of it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that was done eleven years before might
have been known: And if ſo long time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
not the Book, or Author yet, from
your bloody Charge, why do you deſire him
to retract another? What good will retracting
it do, if you will nevertheleſs ſo many years
after make ſuch uſe of it, (from what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and to what Ends I leave to you?) The
Aphoriſms, which you would have retracted,
you ſay, <hi>[are thoſe eſpecially which are gathered
by an Eminent Hand:]</hi> Who can think but
here you condemn all thoſe which that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
hand hath gathered? And the firſt of
all is <hi>[Governours are ſome limited, ſome</hi> de
facto <hi>unlimited: The unlimited are Tyrants,
and have no right to that unlimited Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.]</hi>
The next words are, <hi>[For they are all
Subjects themſelves, and under the Sovereignty
and Laws of God.]</hi> Becauſe it is your higheſt
Preferments, as you ſay, to preach the Goſpel,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62157:17"/>
I beſeech you give me ſome ſuch light here as
is neceſſary to a Retractation. If any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
are not limited by God, tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be any ſin in them, if they make Laws,
commanding Men to deny God, and blaſpheme
him, to worſhip themſelves as Gods, as
<hi>Caligula</hi> did, to worſhip <hi>Mahomet</hi> or Idols, to
kill all the Innocent People of the Land? (I
talk not of the abſolute Power of all Mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
and Lives.) Nay, whether there be any
thing imaginable which they may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
or whether it be poſſible for that Man
at all to ſin, that is not limited by God? And
tell me if this be the Doctrine which you
count it your chief preferment to preach?
And whether you can think that any wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
in the World will take thoſe for
friendly Promoters of their Intereſt, who
would ſo calumniate them, as to make their
Subjects believe, that they lay any ſuch claim?
You can gather, that I approve of Mens terms
of Miniſtration, becauſe I joyn with the
Church which they teach. As if no more were
required of a Curate, than of a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.
And as if the ſame Reaſons which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
my Worſhip as a private Man, would
warrant all my Subſcriptions, Declarations,
Oaths, and all the reſt of Miniſterial Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
You can blame me for not <hi>Actively ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the Laws,</hi> when you can name no
Law which commandeth me what you mean.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62157:18"/>
You can <hi>Magisterially</hi> ſay <hi>[Not that looſe para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Diſcourſe given to the Kings Commiſſioners
at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>written rather Rhetorically,</hi> ad
Captandum Populum, <hi>to inſinuate into vulgar
Capacities, than Logically to evince the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
contended for, strip'd of its multifarious
Fallacies, ungrounded Surmiſes, and erroneous
Suppoſitions,</hi> &amp;c.] 1. As if you knew what
was given in at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> when a conſiderable
part of the Papers were never publiſhed: Yea
I have reaſon enough to believe, that no Man
living can give an account of them to you but
my ſelf; becauſe no Copies were taken, and
ſome Papers <hi>only read.</hi> 2. There are many
Papers printed which were given in upon that
occaſion; and who knows by this Character
which of them it is that is called the <hi>Looſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitick
Diſcourſe?</hi> 3. You talk of a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
contended for, as if you had a mind to
be thought to ſay ſomewhat, though you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
not about what: For no Hypotheſis
is named by you, and no wonder. If you
mean the firſt, ſecond or third Paper given in
at the beginning of the Buſineſs to the Lord
Chancellor, the Hypotheſis was, that <hi>union is
deſirable;</hi> the means whereto we offered as
we were commanded. If you mean <hi>our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against the Liturgy,</hi> the Hypotheſis
was, that the Liturgy was corrigible, <hi>and to
be altered in ſome things.</hi> And do you oppoſe
that Hypotheſis which the King had expreſly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62157:18"/>
put into the words of his Commiſſion, ſo far
as to appoint Men to alter it? and which the
Convocation by their actual alterations own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
If you mean our <hi>Reply to the Anſwer of the
Exceptions,</hi> the Hypotheſis general is the ſame.
And what made all thoſe Learned Perſons who
wanted neither <hi>Time</hi> nor <hi>Will,</hi> forbear ever to
give an Anſwer to that Reply, if it were ſo
looſe and contemptible as you make it? Was
it becauſe contempt was fitter than a Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
that could not be; becauſe ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not written by Men commiſſioned by the
King for ſuch a Treaty, nor offered by their
own importunity, have found ſome of them at
leiſure for a more particular Conſideration.
If it be <hi>our Liturgy offered them</hi> that you mean,
the Hypotheſis there is, <hi>That thoſe forms there
offered were fit to be taken into conſideration,
as the</hi> Addenda <hi>mentioned in the Commiſſion.</hi>
If this be falſe, what can you imagine to be the
reaſon that we could by no importunity ever
procure any by word or writing to open to us
the faults of that Liturgy; and that <hi>L'Estrange</hi>
himſelf had no more to ſay againſt it? Though
being drawn up in eight days only, we deſired
we might have had leiſure to have made it more
perfect, (which might eaſily be done.) If it
be the <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> that you mean, the
Hypotheſis was, That <hi>our Concord was ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as that they ſhould make the abatements
there mentioned to attain it;</hi> but eſpecially, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62157:19"/>
than ſilence ſo many Miniſters, and chooſe the
other ill Conſequents that would follow.</hi> If this
be, it you mean, and you are ambitious of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
your Rulers, that you will ſtand at
Gods Judgment as an approver of—all that
—enjoy the pleaſure and fruit of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
If the ſilence of ſo many hundred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and the Conſequents to ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ignorant Souls, be a Bleſſing to be rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in, put not your Sickle into other Mens
<hi>Harvest,</hi> but let the Labourer, who is worthy,
have the hire. If it be otherwiſe, what need
any Man ſay, <hi>Their—be on us, and on our
Children?</hi> 4. And when you talk of <hi>Vulgar
Capacities,</hi> do you not reproach the Reverend
Biſhops as <hi>Vulgar Capacities,</hi> in print? To
whom were they given, but to them? And I
never heard of any that they ſhewed them to.
If you ſay, That <hi>they were printed afterward,</hi>
I anſwer, 1. Some were, and ſome were not.
2. How could we then foretel that, when we
gave them in? 3. They were done, as far as I
can learn, by a poor reading Curate, that
gave the Printer Copies through meer poverty
to get a little Money, without our knowledge.
For he was th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Scribe that we were forced to
uſe for Copies, and I hear he kept ſome for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
4. I ſent to the Kings Secretary, Sir <hi>IV.
Morrice,</hi> when I heard they were in the Preſs,
to deſire him to ſearch the Preſs, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them. 5. The printing of them by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62157:19"/>
our Antagoniſts, and by the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
falſeneſs of the impreſſion, was a very great
injury to us. Moreover you dare publiſh to
the world, <hi>[Had Men kept cloſe to the Church
of</hi> England, <hi>they needed not have stumbled at
ſwearing, That it is not lawful to take up Arms
against the King. I muſt tell the whole Chorus
of my diſſenting Brethren, that this very Fly is
enough to ſpoil the Box of pretended Oyntment:
who can chooſe but nauſeate that way of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
which startles at renouncing War againſt
the King?]</hi> Do you think you were able to
bear it patiently, if I ſhould tell you how
much of the Diabolical Spirit is in theſe Lines,
and how unfit ſuch a Spirit is for the Sacred
Miniſtry? 1. You know that it is a time in
which our Rulers are juſtly exaſperated for the
horrid Murder of the King, and for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Rebellions that have been committed:
And you know, that no deſign could more
gratifie the Prince of Darkneſs, than to bring
the Odium of all this upon the Miniſtry, or
upon any part of the Miniſtry whoſe labours
are needful to the Church. 2. I ſuppoſe you
know, that it is not one of a Multitude of the
Non-conformable Miniſters that ever took up
Arms againſt the King. I ſuppoſe in all <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire</hi>
there is not now two, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not one, (though there are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
that were in Arms againſt him.) 3. I
ſuppoſe you cannot be ignorant (becauſe you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62157:20"/>
dwell in <hi>England)</hi> that they were Epiſcopal
Parliaments that were long quarreling with
the King, and that ſtill cried out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Popery, Arminianiſm, Monopolies,</hi> &amp;c.
of which <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Collections ſufficiently
inform you: And that Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> in the Life of
Arch biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> hath fully acquainted the
World, that it was one Party of Epiſcopal
Men, (of whom he would make Arch-biſhop
<hi>Abbot</hi> the head) that contended againſt the
other, and put in the difference about the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Propriety into the Quarrel; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Neile, Laud, Buckridge, Howſon, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi>
and <hi>Mountague,</hi> the Biſhops went all the
other way: So that by <hi>Andrew</hi>'s advice it was
thought unſafe to let a Convocation meddle in
their Cauſe. 4. I ſuppoſe you cannot eaſily
be ignorant, that the War in <hi>England</hi> againſt
the King was begun by an Epiſcopal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
where (as ſome of the Members aver
to me) there was but one known Presbyterian
in both Houſes, and there or four Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and two or three Sectaries, and about
four hundred Epiſcopal Men and Eraſtians:
And alſo by an Epiſcopal Army, for ſuch was
the Earl of Eſſex, and almoſt all his Chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
and by almoſt all Epiſcopal Lord-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
who were firſt put into poſſeſſion of
the Militia againſt the Kings Commiſſioners of
Array: In ſo much that even the Propoſitions
ſent to the King at <hi>Nottingham</hi> were but for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62157:20"/>
the Regulation of Epiſcopacy, and not the
Extirpation: And among all the <hi>Westminſter</hi>
Aſſembly there were not called ten Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
(nor I think eight.) Nor indeed
was Presbytery then well known in <hi>England,</hi>
till the notice of it came in long after with the
<hi>Scots</hi> and Covenant. So that it is paſt doubt
with any but the deſperately impudent, that it
was Epiſcopal Men in <hi>England</hi> on both ſides
that raiſed War againſt each other; though
one Party of them afterward fell in with
the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for fear of wanting help, and of being
overthrown. 5. You cannot but know that
it is not <hi>the whole Chorus of your diſſenting</hi>
Brethren, that <hi>ſcrupled ſwearing, that it is
not lawful to take up Arms against the King.</hi>
That twenty in <hi>London</hi> took the whole
<hi>Oxford</hi> Oath at once, and more after:
That the chief Nonconformable Miniſters
took it in <hi>Northamptonſhire, Somerſet-ſhire,
Devon-ſhire,</hi> and ſome other Places: That
many Non-conformiſts were againſt the
War; as Mr. <hi>Geery,</hi> Mr. <hi>Capel,</hi> and almoſt
all the <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire</hi> Miniſters, and many
others. Poor Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Weedon,</hi> lately
in Goal near you for preaching in private,
loſt an Arm in the Kings Service in his <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Army; when the only Arch-biſhop left
in <hi>England (Williams)</hi> was a General in
<hi>Wales</hi> in the Parliaments Army. 6. You have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62157:21"/>
not given the World any Proof of any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi> (much leſs the
whole Chorus) that ever ſcrupled ſwearing
what you mention. I ſhould know their
minds as well as you, and I know <hi>not one,</hi> that
I remember, that is not ready to ſwear, that
<hi>[It is not lawful to take up Arms againſt the
King.]</hi> I ſay again, I know not one. And
ſhall a <hi>Levite</hi> ſtand up and intimate, (though
it be not ſo ſpoken out) To <hi>the King,</hi> and to
<hi>Papists,</hi> and to <hi>Posterity,</hi> that it is the whole
Chorus of Diſſenters about Diſcipline? Put
out your other Clauſes, and let us have no
more Oaths of Allegiance or Fidelity to Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſanes
or Lay-Chancellors put upon us, than
were impoſed on Chriſts Churches for 600 or
800 years, and then try who will refuſe to
ſwear a Renunciation of War againſt the
King. 7. But I admire how you came to ſuch
an obdurateneſs, as to talk of <hi>nauſeating [that
way of Diſcipline, which startles at renouncing
War against the King.]</hi> Is it Epiſcopal Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
that you mean? If not, what way of
Diſcipline is it that ſtartles at it, unleſs you
mean <hi>Military Diſcipline?</hi> Read over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of the <hi>French, Belgick,</hi> and all other
Presbyterian Churches, and ſee whether there
be any thing in their Diſcipline that ſtartles at
it. What if it had been the Presbyterians,
and not the Epiſcopal, that in <hi>England</hi> raiſed
the War? Doth it follow that their <hi>way of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62157:21"/>
Diſcipline</hi> was for it: Name us that Form of
Diſcipline, and tell us where to find it, which
you mean that is guilty of what you charge
on it. Doth he that ſaith <hi>[Every Church
ſhould have a Biſhop, and not only a thouſand or
600 in a Dioceſs]</hi> hereby ſay <hi>[we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
War against the King?]</hi> Do not ſo
wrong God as to think him ſo unjuſt, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to ſuffer ſuch as you thus to abuſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
8. And you that talk ſo malepertly
of the <hi>Savoy</hi> Papers, it's like know, that it
was not <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor any other <hi>than Arch-Biſhop
Uſher's Form of Epiſcopacy in terminis,</hi>
in his own printed Paper, which we offered
the King and Biſhops as the Medium of our
Concord in 1660. And when that would not
be received, ſee in the Kings Declaration about
Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, whether it was not the
down-right Prelacy that was ſubmitted to,
with only the additions of ſome Paſtoral
Power in a Rural Deanery: And I never heard
Presbytery pleaded for by Word, or ſaw it by
Writing in all that Treaty, but only <hi>Vſhers
Epiſcopacy.</hi> Why then do you talk of the
<hi>Diſcipline of the Chorus,</hi> unleſs you mean <hi>the
Epiſcopal Diſcipline.</hi> And do you not know,
(that write about the Cauſe) that the War
was not founded in <hi>Theological Differences,</hi> but
in <hi>Law Differences?</hi> and that it was <hi>Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Lawyers</hi> that made the difference by
their Political and Law-Controverſies? Not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62157:22"/>
but that Divines on both ſides were too guilty,
if not the forwardeſt. But my dull Brains
could never find out any one Point of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Theology, about the Power of Kings,
and the Duty of Obedience in the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Divines called Presbyterians and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal:
If you know any, name them me,
and tell me your Proof; I know that they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
too much with the Political and Law-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
of Lawyers and Stateſ-men, (for
there lay the difference) as I did my ſelf in my
<hi>Pol. Aphor.</hi> of which I unfeignedly repent,
(though I thought then, that <hi>Oceana</hi> forced
me to do it.) 10. It's not probable, that ſo
Learned a Man is ignorant what Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi>
Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews in Tortura Torti,</hi>
and many more ſuch have ſaid, to prove, that
<hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Presbyterians, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Puritans, differ not in theſe things from the
Theology of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> taking
the ſame Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how come you to be wiſer than they,
and to prove the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> Intereſt in the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement?
And when you have taught the
Papiſts to ſay that <hi>Andrews,</hi> &amp;c. ſpake falſly,
how will you prove it? I know that there
were many Sectaries, and ſome individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that erred in Law and Politicks, and
perhaps in Theologicals too. But what's
that to a difference between the Parties in their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62157:22"/>
Religious Principles? 11. For can you be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that it is the grand Champions for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
that have written for the Principles of
the Long Parliament, by which they pleaded
for their War? Do you not know, (to paſs
by Biſhop <hi>Jewel)</hi> what Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
hath ſaid, and what <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi> in his
<hi>Eccleſ. Pol. L. 1. &amp;. 8.</hi> hath ſaid higher than
thoſe Parliament Soldiers that I was moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with? I have now written a Book,
(Licenſed) which containeth a Defence of
Monarchy againſt <hi>R. Hookers</hi> Popular Errors.
Why then do you not call the <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi>
to repentance? or why do you inſinuate ſuch
ſuſpitions into Mens Minds, that the <hi>Diſcipline
is it that ſtartles at renouncing War against the
King?</hi> You know, I ſuppoſe, what <hi>Grotius
de Jure Belli,</hi> alſo hath ſaid in his Enumeration,
(out of <hi>Barclay)</hi> of Caſes in which it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to take Arms againſt Kings: Even that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
who was the Maſter of the late Game, and
boaſteth of the approbation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Prelates. Was Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
(who ſaith he was ſuſpended for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to Licenſe Dr. <hi>Sybthorpes</hi> Book; ſee his
Narrative in <hi>Ruſhworth?)</hi> Did he and all the
Clergy, and Parliaments, that went his way,
forſake the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Who then
were the Church? Yet you can add <hi>[P. 125.
And ſince the Lines of our Peace and Happineſs,
as to Church and State, do meet and concenter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62157:23"/>
in him, as our common Father, is it unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Subjects to ſwear they will not endeavour
the alteration of Government in the Church and
State? who would think, that any Natives of
a Land, profeſſing themſelves the Followers of
Christ,—and expecting protection from a
lawful Prince, ſhould once demur, whether they
ſhould make this Declaration, or take this Oath?]</hi>
(O eaſie happy Swearer!) <hi>Qui deliberant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciverunt:
Such as doubt of this, have even
ſhak'd off the Yoke of Subjection,</hi> (unhappy
Doubters!) 1. Here <hi>[They will not endeavour
the alteration of Government]</hi> is put in ſtead
of <hi>[will not at any time endeavour any alteration
of Government.] [2. In Church and State]</hi> is
put inſtead of <hi>[in Church or State.]</hi> 3. Not
one Man of my acquaintance of them you
queſtion, refuſeth to ſwear, that he will never
endeavour any alteration of the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as it is in the King according to the
Oath of Supremacy. 4. They that offered
Biſhop <hi>Vſhers Form of Epiſcopacy,</hi> are not for
altering <hi>Epiſcopacy as ſuch.</hi> 5. The Oath of
the Canons 1640. put <hi>[we will not conſent]</hi>
in ſtead of endeavour. And a Parliament
condemned that Oath; and no Parliament ſince
thought meet to juſtifie or reſtore it. 6. We
know that Lay-Chancellors exerciſe the Power
of the Keys, by decreeing Excommunications
and Abſolutions: And we believe, that exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Power of the Keys ſo, is Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62157:23"/>
And we are all agreed, that yet
<hi>no reforming alteration is to be attempted by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Rebellion, or unlawful means;</hi> but only
by <hi>Subjects petitioning, Parliament-mens ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
&amp;c. And if you think to come to Heaven
by ſwearing, that we may <hi>not petition</hi> againſt
<hi>Lay-Chancellors uſe of the Keys,</hi> cannot you
go quietly your own way, and let others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that truſt not to ſuch means? 7. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſcopacy <hi>(every
Churches unity being known by one Altar and one
Biſhop with his Presbyters and Deacons)</hi> is as
lawful at leaſt as one Biſhop only to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
or 500 Churches: And I believe, that it is
in the Power of the King and Parliament to
reduce our Epiſcopacy to that ancient Form:
And if they do it, I will not ſwear to diſobey
them, if they command my Service under
them: I was once commiſſioned among others
under the Broad Seal to endeavour ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And before
what was done about Epiſcopacy, the Kings
Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and I will not ſwear to diſobey the King,
if he command me the like again; nor I will
not <hi>ſwear univerſally,</hi> and <hi>mean particularly,</hi>
till the Law-givers ſo expound themſelves.
8. I know by what Oaths the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy
got their Supremacy, and maſtered Kings and
Emperors. 9. I know that till <hi>Roman</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
invaded the Church, the Clergy was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62157:24"/>
not put to ſwear to the Biſhops. 10. I love
but one King in a Kingdom, nor any thing
that is injurious to him; and I am willing to
ſwear Allegiance to my lawful King, as I have
done, and to take his Office as a Conſtitutive
part of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But not to twiſt any other with him by
Oaths into the Conſtitution, nor any thing that
looks like it, eſpecially not to ſwear to the
<hi>Church-Governours</hi> before the <hi>Kings State-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
And now what is the connexion of
your Premiſes and Concluſion? [The King is
the Center of our Happineſs, <hi>&amp;c. ergo,</hi> none
that are Natives and Chriſtians, and expect
protection, ſhould once demur whether he may
ſwear to Dioceſanes and Lay-Chancellors, yea
not to endeavour any alteration of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by Petition, or if the King command
them; <hi>ergo,</hi> they that doubt of this, have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhaken off the Yoke of Subjection; <hi>ergo,</hi>
they all deſerve, not only to be forbidden
preaching Chriſt, but to be hanged, (as all do,
no doubt, that have ſhak'd off the Yoke of
Subjection;) <hi>ergo,</hi> not only the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
but the Conformiſts, that ſwear doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
ſhould be all hanged. Thus differ the
Prieſt and the Levite, that paſs by the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church, from us wretched <hi>Samaritanes.

ſo far, I will add but a little more as to your
Letters: In the firſt Letter theſe words aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
me, <hi>[I hope there is not ſo much Gall and
Acrimony in the whole Book.]</hi> Wonderful, that
any Man ſhould ſo little perceive what he ſaith
and doth, and be ſo blinded by Self-love! as
to think he ſpeaketh Oyl and Sugar, when he
ſpeaketh Fire and Swords. You ſay you find
me not ſo peremptory as to hold Conformity
ſimply and abſolutely ſinful: I pray you, could
you judge ſo hardly of me, as to think that I
left my Miniſterial Labours, to which I was
vowed, to eſcape but that which I account <hi>no
ſin?</hi> You ſay, [Some of my own Books have
not an <hi>Imprimatur]</hi> why would you ſay ſo,
before you knew it? I know of none of them
that want it, that were then printed ſince the
Law required it; though the <hi>Imprimatur</hi> be
not printed in them. But ſince you have ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62157:25"/>
urged me to print without Licenſe, I cannot
ſay that the laſt Book (the Defence of my
Cure) is licenſed, nor that it is not; but if it
come without, you have taught it the way.
You ſo far credit your Neighbour <hi>Lee's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
as to give me the advice for reſtitution of
his Horſes. Charity is not ſo eaſie of belief.
Why did he never make ſuch a demand of
me while I lived there in ſixteen years ſpace.
This is like Dr. <hi>Boremans</hi> printing, that [it is
ſaid I killed a Man in cold Blood with my own
Hand; but if that be not true, I am not the
firſt that have been ſlandered.] Very true:
Whereas I know not that ever I ſtruck one
Man in anger (except Boys at School) in my
life, nor did I ever kill or wound any Man in
War or Peace. Nor did I ever take any Mans
Horſes with my own Hand; nor was I ever, to
my knowledge, in <hi>Northfield</hi> or <hi>Kings-norton</hi>
Pariſh; nor ever with any that were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about taking up Horſes in the War, to my
knowledge, but once; which was, when the
Kings Soldiers had taken up about a thouſand
in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> and 500 in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> gave a Commiſſion to
Colonel <hi>Mitton</hi> and others to take up ſome
three hundred in the Kings Quarters in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-ſhire:</hi>
And about twenty Men went
three or four times about it; of which times
I went once with them to ſee that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no abuſe by taking from ſuch as they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62157:25"/>
were not warranted to do; and they brought
away about twenty or leſs, and ſome were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
and I touch'd not one of them, nor
was their Guide; and I never heard that they
that went the two other times (which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Northfield,</hi> where and when I had nothing
to do with them, nor knew what they did)
took about thirty more, which I heard were
many of them reſtored; and if your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
had come to me, and given me any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that he had loſt by me injuriouſly,
it's like I had repayed it; but his ſlander ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
me not to reſtitution: I will ſay no more
about your Rule, with relation to all that were
preſent on either ſide when any were wronged
in that War. Your acquaintance with the
Huxters that ſo readily print and ſell unlicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Books, is no direction to me that know
them not: A few Sheets many will venture
on; but I know not them that will venture on
a large Book, leſt they be undone by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
of it. In your Letter you could find
a Categorical Affirmation, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a Verb;
whereas you may ſee in the Errata of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Book then at the Preſs, (becauſe that
Book had no Errata prin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed) that <hi>[Verb]</hi>
was miſprinted for <hi>[Word<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>]</hi> And if I know
not a Verb from a Participle, yet that little
concerneth our Caſe in hand: And though my
own opinion be, that the Parts of Speech
ſhould be reduced to three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62157:26"/>
trouble you with my Gramatical ignorance
any further than to tell you, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that you take liberty to judge it as
great as you pleaſe; but that Man ſhould
be more temperate in cenſuring the Errors
of the Preſs, Scribe, and Author, who ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> (then in Priſon) upon
<hi>Jude,</hi> who never wrote on <hi>Jude,</hi> but only
on <hi>James;</hi> and that citeth Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi>
of Regeneration, who never wrote of ſuch
a Subject; it's like the Subject drew you
to think, that he that wrote ſo much for
the Ceremonies (though once a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt)
was like to be the Author of ſuch
a Book, which indeed Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burges</hi>
wrote, when he was a great Conformiſt,
who was afterward Aſſeſſor in the <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
Aſſembly, and (though a Proteſtor
for moderate Epiſcopacy) wrote that Book
for the neceſſity of Reformation, which ſo
much offended the Epiſcopal Party. In
your laſt <hi>you</hi> liken me to the <hi>Papiſts that
take liberty more than enough,</hi> when you
cannot name one Book ſince the Act, before
your importunity, that I took more liberty
in, than was given me, that I remember.
And you in the ſame Paragraph invite me
to <hi>comply with your ſober requeſt,</hi> and to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it to the Common-wealth of the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Clergy;</hi> and yet talk againſt <hi>unmazzeling
the mouth of the Panther,</hi> as aforeſaid; but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62157:26"/>
theſe no doubt you can reconcile better
than I. As for my nonſenſe in putting <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum
pro Authore,</hi> it is ſuch as I am not
ſeldom guilty of, as I am alſo of putting
the Author for the Book. As to your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Exceptions. 1. Speaking ſlightly of
Conformity, Do you expect that a Man that
by not conforming loſeth more than you
have yet gotten by conforming, and that
alſo loſeth his Miniſterial Liberty, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
than all the Biſhopricks in <hi>England,</hi>
ſhould commend the Conformity which he
ſo avoideth. As for Mr. <hi>Dod's</hi> words, I
glad that you ſay <hi>[Doth God stand in
need of our Lie,</hi> (O! no, nor of our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>
neither) <hi>ſhould we ſpeak wickedly for
God, or talk deceitfully for him?]</hi> (No, I
think we ſhould not; nor deliberately co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or do any wicked thing on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of ſecuring the liberty of preaching
againſt the ſin of other Men.) But yet it
is my opinion, that we may thank God
for the effects that are brought to paſs by
Mens miſ-doings; (though not for the ſin
it ſelf) even for the death of Jeſus Chriſt;
which was all that Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> could mean.
2. If you had but ſeen the Colections of
Inſtances given in by ſome body at the
<hi>Savoy</hi> Treaty to the reforming part of the
Commiſſioners of <hi>Defects and Diſorders</hi> or
<hi>Immethodicalneſs</hi> in the Liturgy, you would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62157:27"/>
not wonder that I now take it not for
<hi>Perfect.</hi> Eſpecially when you compare it
with the Liturgy which we offered them,
and ſee there what difference we made, can
you forbear a <hi>Cenſure of ours,</hi> (which hath
hitherto ſtrangely ſcaped their Cenſures who
rejected it) and yet marvel not that we
take not <hi>yours</hi> for perfect? As for your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
me to <hi>the Jews that hire Christian
Servants to dreſs their meat.</hi> (There is but
one cometh ſometime to my Houſe, and he
will eat no meat there on any days but
of his own dreſſing.) Remember that you
ſaid even now, <hi>God needeth not our Lie or
deceitful wickedneſs,</hi> that we may have leave
to preach or pray. 3. As to your third
Exception: 1. When you have got me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to write my Reaſons, I will tell you
more of my opinion about Dioceſanes, if
you cannot underſtand it by my Diſputes
of Church Government long ago printed;
which if you have read, do you ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that I ſhould approve of Dioceſanes?
or marvel that I think better of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes
Bohemian</hi> Epiſcopacy, and that which
obtained in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> yea in <hi>Cyprians</hi> days?
But what thought you of when you call
me to <hi>obey old Establiſhments, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
now ones, and ſet the People on gad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
after Innovations?</hi> Did you really think
that our Eſtabliſhment was elder than the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62157:27"/>
days of the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius?</hi> and that
theirs were <hi>Innovations</hi> to ours? And that
Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vſher reduced Epiſcopacy</hi> to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,</hi>
when he pretended to <hi>reduce it to
the ancient Form?</hi> Doth not Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
maintain, that there were no Biſhops in
Scripture times that had more than one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and that <hi>de facto</hi> there was then
no ſuch things as diſtinct <hi>Subject-Presbyters?</hi>
Is 1650 years ago the time of <hi>Novelties</hi> to
us, and our <hi>establiſhment</hi> the true Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Well! let it be ſo.—2. But you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly
report me to ſay, that we <hi>must not
communicate with a Pariſh-Minister, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth
with the Biſhop,</hi> P. 77. If you had
added <hi>[In conſenting to our ſilencing;]</hi> For
I only ſaid, that I made that none of our
Queſtion: The reaſon was, becauſe my work
lay another way, and it would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the edification of thoſe I wrote for,
to have pleaded that Cauſe with them:
But do I deny all that cometh not into
our Queſtion? To deal openly with you,
I fore-knew long ago what would ſtick
moſt againſt our Concord, when I labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in vain to have prevented it; and now
the thing which I fore-ſaw is come: When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the People to Communion in the Pariſh
Churches, they ſay [ſhall we have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with thoſe that have ſilenced ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſuch Miniſters, and ſet up ſuch and ſuch in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62157:28"/>
their ſtead?] And here I may as well drive
them through a Stone Wall, as drive them
on directly in that way. If you can do it,
why have not you done it? I am ſure I
cannot: They will ſooner renounce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with <hi>me,</hi> than hold Communion
with thoſe that they think have been the
chief Promoters of all this, that are of the
Clergy. And if I did not challenge them to
prove if they can, that ever ſuch and ſuch
Pariſh Miniſters were <hi>the Silencers,</hi> I could
get them to hold Communion with none of
them all: If you will have your work done
your own way, on your own terms, do it;
I cannot ſo do it, for I am not of your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And now, Sir, I am not ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with what I do, as to tell you I have
given you a lenifying Anſwer, or to expect
that this ſhould pleaſe you, who accounted a
few gentle Queſtions ſo ſharp: If my buſineſs
had been to win your good opinion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of me, I would have ſpoken you fairer.
But though <hi>veritas odium parit,</hi> I am naturally
addicted to ſpeak plain truth, (without any
ill will to you or any) though I foreſee that
impatient guilt will call it railing, and what
not. If none deal plainly with offending
Preachers, how much worſe is their condition
than the Peoples? But had it been for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view, and not for your own private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
I ſhould have uſed a ſofter Stile on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62157:28"/>
ſeveral accounts: As I take none of your
plainneſs with me amiſs, ſo far as it containeth
truth; ſo the imitation of it ought not to
ſeem injurious to you: Nothing hath more
moved me to it, than to find by your Letter
how greatly averſe you are to Repentance;
in the promoting whereof I ſhould gladly be</p>

And though my Head and Heart were then

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62157:29"/>
with you to tell me of <hi>Crimes and Guilt: That
I comply with Satans deſigns: That I have a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Spirit, unfit for the Sacred Miniſtry: I
talk malepertly: A Levite started up: That I
write against the Non-conformists:</hi> When I

Whereas I have procured your indignation,
only by a ſubmiſſive and mannerly Requeſt,
that you would give us the Reaſons of your

but a treacherous Watch-man, to ſuffer ſin

as <hi>Diogenes</hi> told <hi>Antiſthenes</hi>
in <hi>Laertius. Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, and
my grand Maſter, have trodden this Path be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
me.</p>
               <p>Sir, you reckon <hi>up 1800 Miniſters that are
ſilenc'd.</hi> Though I utterly diſlike the term,
<hi>Silenc'd;</hi> for to me 'tis apparent they are ſilent
actively, and through their own fault, until it
appear to the contrary; and then the ſin is yet
more hainous, by how much it is the more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.
But if you are a true Accountant;
if this be not a falſe Muſter, and you miſtaken
in your Arithmetick: How many of theſe have
little more learning than your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books
have taught them? As great Strangers to the
Writers of the firſt Centuries, as they have
been to the Univerſities. How many of theſe
were neſted in other Mens Habitations; whilſt
the right owners were expoſed to wind, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62157:30"/>
and ſtarving; double the number of
1800. This Retalliation may cauſe them to
ſay: <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi>
Judges 1. 7. yet I have ſome ground to think,
the number is not ſo great, ſince I hear that
many come in, and more remove into more
remote Parts and conform there. If it be true
that Dr. <hi>Connaught</hi> has re-aſſum'd his Miniſtry;
I think his Example (whoſe Piety and Learning
is ſo conſiderable) may be very attractive. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis no ſtrange thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Methinks that Men who are <hi>ſo willing to
preach in</hi> Wales, <hi>and the poorest Congregations,
without a farthing, upon Catechetical Points;
neither medling with Biſhops, Liturgy, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
(as you ſay) ſhould be willing to
take things (in order thereunto) in their
moſt favourable and candid ſenſe. Give me
leave to give you two Cautions. 1. Take
heed how you undertake for any conſiderable
part of thoſe 1800. that they ſhall preach on
thoſe terms: For then you tranſ-element them;
their Tongues do not only itch, but their very
Nods and Whiſpers tend that way. 2. Take
heed you do not impede ſo good a Work, by
maintaining <hi>Conformity to be an avowed
and deliberate ſin; abſolutely and ſimply
ſo: A ſin, as it were, by Covenant: So that a
Bleſſing is not to be expected on their Miniſtry;
ſo inhumane and hainous, you dare ſcarcely name
it. What will we ſay, if you ſhould lay open
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62157:31"/>
the ſin of Conformity in your Reaſons?</hi> Such a
Lyon in the way is enough to affright many.
Such a Flaming Sword may keep Labourers
out of the Vineyard; out of the Paradiſe of
the Church. I have ſadder apprehenſions yet.
As the Papiſts do unchurch us, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
damn us; ſo you are like to arrive to
the ſame uncharitableneſs: For if we live and
die <hi>in avowed and deliberate ſin,</hi> what Wages
are we like inevitably to receive? You infer
from my words, or rather drag from them,
by an odd Climax of <hi>Ergo's,</hi> that there are
ſome Perſons deſerve hanging: But I can, with
more eaſe, and better Logick, gather from
what you ſay, that we muſt be damned.</p>
               <p>I am glad you own my Quotation out of
your Book of <hi>Reſt:</hi> At firſt you made me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
when you ſaid,—<hi>You never wrote, or
thought of any ſuch Paſſage.</hi> Yet this is but
like the jumping of a Deer after a Mortal
Shot; or the playing and ſprunting of a
Fiſh, when it is ſtrucken with an Hook: You
make me amends afterward by ſaying, <hi>you have
retracted and expunged it in your later Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And truly, I do much rejoyce at your
reiterated Ingenuity in this kind: For as it is
ſaid, The beſt thing is <hi>not to be born;</hi> the
next, <hi>cito mori:</hi> So a Palinodia is next to the
publiſhing of ſound Truths. But though this
<hi>Retractation</hi> was <hi>before the Act of Oblivion,</hi> (as
you ſay) yet I fear the War was done, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62157:31"/>
execution over. If you be ſo raſh in obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your immature Notions upon the World,
before you have lick'd them, and ſtrain'd out
their Crudities, and ill Humours in the Preſs
firſt, by ſeveral Editions, you will diſcourage
Men from buying your Books, when they firſt
come forth.</p>
               <p>This Overture has given you occaſion,
—<hi>Renovare dolorem,</hi> by minding me of the
ſaddeſt Tragedy of my whole Life. <hi>The utter
undoing of Mr.</hi> H. P. though you well know
he was undone before: I could lament this in
Tears of Blood; yet as my Conſcience does
not upbraid me of negligence herein, ſo that
good Lady (I hope) will do me the Juſtice,
that I gave her notice of what I fear'd and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
a fortnight before the Cataſtrophe.
And if there was ſuch a fatality in it; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had beſeech'd her Ladiſhip, that I might
convey him to ſome Houſe of his Fathers;
and this not being yielded unto, but I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to keep him longer; I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Walls of my Houſe from being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the night time; this is, this muſt be for
a lamentation.</p>
               <p>I preſume you had not pour'd this Vinegar
into my Wound, had I not been your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer,
about your taking the Horſes of <hi>Will.
Lees.</hi> And though you deny the Fact, both
he and his Wife offer to ſwear it. They ſay,
they followed you to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and obtain'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62157:32"/>
an Order from the Committees there to have
the Horſes reſtor'd; but you refuſed to obey
it. Nay, they followed you to <hi>London,</hi> and
and at Mr. <hi>Foley's</hi> Houſe came to your Bed-Chamber.
If their Relation be falſe, or your
Memory fail, I cannot help it: Many and
many a time they deſir'd me to write unto you
for ſome ſatisfaction towards maintaining them
in their poor decrepit Age. You confeſs <hi>you
came into the Kings Quarters in thoſe Parts to
take Horſes; ergo,</hi> Retract again: For in your
late Book, you ſay, you medled not with the
War, until after <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight; yet you pray'd
and preach'd to the <hi>Coventry</hi> Garriſon: Could
you forbear to beſprinkle your Prayers and
Sermons with ſome of thoſe Principles which
after carried you into the Field?</p>
               <p>Although I moved you to retract your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Aphoriſms; yet 'twas only ſuch as were
erroneous, and dangerous to our Peace. That
which you mention, <hi>about an unlimited Power
in Princes,</hi> or <hi>univerſal Obedience in Subjects;
even to turn Mahumitans, if they command;</hi>
I do as much abhor in the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as I did
diſlike thoſe Rotations and fond Principles of
Government in the <hi>Oceana; ergo,</hi> you might
have ſav'd the labour of your Dilemma. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
did not retract all that ever he wrote.
How does it follow? <hi>I account it my chiefeſt
preferment to preach the Goſpel; ergo,</hi> you ask
me, <hi>whether this Goſpel which I preach be the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62157:32"/>
unlimited Power of Princes?</hi> Sure you think I
live not in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Turkey;</hi> or elſe that
I am an errand Stranger to the Nature and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of that Embaſſage, which is committed
to my truſt. Well! <hi>Injoy your own pleaſing
Conceit!</hi> You will be a Gnoſtick, do what I
can. This is not very ſtranger: For you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that ſince Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot refus'd to
Licenſe Dr.</hi> Sybthorpes <hi>Book, I must ſuppoſe
him to be a Presbyterian.</hi> And becauſe, I ſay,
the King is the Center of our Happineſs; <hi>ergo,</hi>
I muſt ſay, <hi>None must demur to ſwear to Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans,
or Lay-Chancellors; and that thoſe that
petition for an alteration of their Government,
if the King command, must not preach.</hi> The
Conſequent is not here queſtion'd, but the
Conſequence; and your Metaphyſical Head
will hardly find Enthymems enough to make it
good.</p>
               <p>Since you ſo often tell me in your Letter of
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as if you were their great
Patron, and would ſet them againſt me; though
(under that Name I never diſturb'd them) to
gratifie your importunity, take my naked
Thoughts. Many of them (I think) are
good, ſober, religious Men; eſpecially ſuch as
are deluded and ſeduc'd into that Sect; Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
but if they be <hi>Gerrones,</hi> Men devoted
to a Party, and addicted to a diſtinct Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from that under which we live; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting

the pulling down Epiſcopacy eſtabliſh'd by
Law, and to ſet up Presbyterian Government
in the Church, againſt the conſent of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate: I think ſuch a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
<hi>quatenus</hi> ſuch, in the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(as things now ſtand) is neither a good
Man, nor a good Subject; but is rather facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſeditious, ſchiſmatical.</p>
               <p>As for your large Narrative, concerning
the <hi>Savoy</hi> Tranſactions; wherein you inform
my neſcience, or negative Ignorance, (for I
was not bound to know every Secret of that

notice of what was reveal'd to the World in

But I perceive, the older the World

               <p>You are at much expence of pains to clear
the Non-conformiſts of the guilt of the late

Epiſcopal Lords, and Epiſcopal Lieutenants of
Counties.</hi> I had thought <hi>(currente Rota)</hi>
whilſt your hand was in, you would have ſaid,
that the Regicides had been Epiſcopal too.</p>
               <p>Sir, I do now perceive, that <hi>Cataline</hi> was a
Fool: If he had laid the Conſpiracy againſt
<hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Tully,</hi> might not he have gone
free? But I foreſee alſo, that in proceſs of
time it is like to fall out with the late unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
War, as it did with the Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<hi>Cecil,</hi> and the Puritanes, were accuſed
for this by the Papiſts: And the other (though
acted but yeſterday, and by whom, is too freſh
in our Memories) is like to be father'd on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Men: Or elſe, like <hi>Filius Populi,</hi> it
will be hard to find the true Father; or like
<hi>Nilus,</hi> the true Original. Give me leave to

Epiſcopal Men began, and carried on that
War, and Presbyterians were free; I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

For I hate nothing more than Rebellion.
But ſure you were too credulous, and eaſie to

they were, they were degenerous from the

to our Church,</hi> (which were my words) <hi>to our
Articles, our Canons, our Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>
If they were Epiſcopal Men, they had
found out ſome new model'd Epiſcopacy. I
will (in this) neither own them for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
nor my Brethren. They were Monſters
ſure; for would Epiſcopal Men conſpire to root
up Epiſcopacy?</p>
               <p>The <hi>only Arch-biſhop in</hi> England, (ſay you)
<hi>Williams, was in Arms against the King; pudet

               <p>What you ſay <hi>of Arch-biſhop</hi> Abbot, <hi>out of

Do but read the Drs. laſt Book concerning the

me to ſhew from the Confeſſions of
any Presbyterian Churches, that they
allow the taking up of Arms against
Princes,</hi> you deal juſt as the Papiſts
do, when we urge them with that
odious Doctrine from <hi>Mariana,</hi>
and others of their Jeſuits; and
alſo with their practiſe in this
caſe, they ſay as you do: Shew us
any Decree of the Church; ſhew us any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Counſels, wherein the Doctrine of
Killing Kings is allowed. What ſhall we ſay?
I can find no ſuch Canon in the Counſel of
<hi>Trent:</hi> I know no ſuch Edict of the Church:
Nay, the Counſel of <hi>Conſtance</hi> condemneth
the Doctrine of killing Tyrants, as erroneous;
yet indirectly and obliquely they do maintain
the ſame, by giving the Pope a Power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excommunicate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62157:36"/>
Heretical Princes, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
their Subjects from their Allegiance.
And as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays; though the Pope does
not teach Men to diſobey their Kings, yet he
makes them, who were their Kings, to be
their Kings no more. So, though this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be not expreſſed, in the Confeſſions of
<hi>Diſciplinarians;</hi> yet if it be ſuitable to their
practiſe, and follows <hi>a posteriori</hi> from their
Covenant, and other Principles, by a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Reaſon, it is enough to prove them
guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However the War was managed; yet</hi> the
Divines (whether Presbyterian or Epiſcopal)
medled little with it. <hi>If</hi> I know any, you bid
me name them. Your dull Brains could never
find out any Point of difference in Theology, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Power of the King, or the Duty of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in the People.</p>
               <p>This is ſtrange, <hi>you liv'd in</hi> England, as you
often tell me: And were you ſuch a Stranger
in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that you heard nothing of the
claſhing of Pens, as well as the brandiſhing of
Swords? <hi>Was the Controverſie only betwixt
Lawyers and Stateſmen?</hi> I have much ado to
forbear an alluſion to the words of <hi>Job</hi> to his

like ſome rude and ignorant People in the
Country. Did you never hear of Dr. <hi>Ferne?</hi>
Mr. <hi>Dadley Diggs,</hi> and many others, who
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62157:36"/>
wrote in behalf of the King, againſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of taking up of Arms? And did you
never hear of Mr. <hi>John Goodwin?</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridges?</hi>
Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s Speech in the City of <hi>London?</hi>
What was the great deſign of moſt Sermons
preach'd at <hi>Westminster</hi> for ſome years by the
Smectimnians, but to tell their Auditors, that
the Ingagement of that War was <hi>pro aris,</hi>
as well as <hi>focis;</hi> for the Cauſe of God and of
Chriſt; againſt Idolatry and Superſtition, as
well as for the Priviledges of Parliaments; and
againſt <hi>Monopolies.</hi> The <hi>King and Martyr

ſince you affirm, <hi>That
Dr.</hi> Manton <hi>never wrote upon</hi> Jude,
<hi>but only upon</hi> James. Will not the

no more notice of his Labours?
And as for Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> it is now in
the Hand of a Friend. Are you
ſuch a walking Library? Such an
<hi>Heluo Librorum,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62157:37"/>
that are Modern and <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And yet had

               <p>You <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>you ingeminate it,—That
there is not any Non-Conformist but is ready to

the King.</hi> Why did ſo many of them
then flit their Habitations, five Miles from any
Corporation, or their own ancient Homes?
What was the Sum of that Oath? was it not
plainly and directly againſt taking up Arms?
Did it any way <hi>hinder Parliament Mens ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
or others peaceable petitioning,</hi> for ſuch
Reformation as is neceſſary? were not thoſe
who were commiſſione'd to adminiſter it, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to declare the ſenſe of it? yet down it
would not go with many; <hi>latet aliquid:</hi>—
But I find it is with many of you as I have
found it experimentally with ſome who have
been troubled in Conſcience: When I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the beſt Balm I could to theſe tender
Souls, ſo that they had nothing to ſay againſt
their own Peace; yet ſtill they would be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome black doubts againſt themſelves;
turning their very Shadows into Gorgons;
that ſo they might continue in the Valley of
<hi>Baca.</hi> Juſt ſo will you find knots in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes;
Myſteries in Cabbaliſtical Titles; and
Anexes; ſpin Webs to intangle your ſelves, out
of your own Imaginations; and with Thruſhes,
pinion your own Wings; that ſo you may
ſcrupulouſly vex your ſelves. You ſay well
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62157:37"/>
in your Book of Conſcience,—That Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
is often miſtaken for Conſcience: So
I fear this ſhieneſs and skittiſhneſs of theſe Men,
is rather the reſult of an hot and feavouriſh
Brain, than any well-weighed concluſion of a
ſound Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> put out the other Clauſes out of the Oath;
let us have no more Oaths of Allegiance to Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans,
or Lay-Chancellors, put upon us, than
Christs Churches had for ſix or eight hundred
years impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p>Why do you lay this Injunction upon <hi>me,</hi>
and <hi>others</hi> in my Sphere? Are we the King
and Parliament? Have private Men a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power? Can they <hi>reverſe</hi> and <hi>retrench</hi>
Laws? It is very plauſible in you to bring all
things to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt; and in
things doctrinal 'tis alſo neceſſary: But as to
what concerns all the Modes of External Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Adminiſtrations, it is not only difficult,
but impoſſible. Nay, I think he may be implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of Schiſm and Singularity, that ſtands up
too ſtifly for the immediate Diſpenſations
(eſpecially where they are ſo uncertain) in
oppoſition to the Inſtrumental teachings and
directions of Men. You may find my Ground,
<hi>1 Cor. 1. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſeems you are much troubled</hi> at Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors;
<hi>as</hi> if they hindered your Conformity, by
exerciſing the Power of the Keys, in decreeing
Excommunications and Abſolutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62157:38"/>
Me thinks a Perſon of your ingenuity ſhould
reſt ſatisfied with that modeſt declaration of
our Rubrick, concerning the Cenſures of the
Church in the Preface to the Communion. But
ſince you ſay, <hi>That Lay-Chancellors exerciſe the
Power of the Keys in Excommunications;</hi> do
they do this of themſelves, as Lay-men? or
do they not? You ſee, 'tis eaſie to puſh with
your Horns, and to evince, that you are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant or abſurd. But I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you, what you cannot but know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
—That Lay-Chancellors, (though
commonly very knowing in the Civil Law,
which is an excellent Hand-maid to Divinity)
yet they excommunicate not as Lay-men, but
by vertue of thoſe Surrogates, who are dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
for this purpoſe, originally by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
himſelf. This Abſtraction is not too hard
for you to conceive. But why are you ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
againſt Lay-Chancellors? I'le warrant
you have more kindneſs for Lay-Elders, if
they were joyn'd with you in things Sacred;
as Catechiſing, admiſſion to the Sacrament,
and the Cenſures of the Church.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Luther</hi> diſtinguiſhes of little and
great Devils; ſo I think this of <hi>Lay-Chancellors</hi>
is but a Gnat in your way. The Camel or
<hi>Belzebub</hi> is <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops. The Epiſcopacy of
Biſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>you are for;</hi> and <hi>the Epiſcopacy of</hi>
Ignatius <hi>(you ſay) is lawful.</hi> I am glad you
grant this; for one of your Brethren maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62157:38"/>
to my Face,—That there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a Biſhop and a Presbyter in <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius.</hi>
But you are kinder to Biſhops; for
where there is one, I ſuppoſe you wiſh there
were many hundreds: And if this were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
we that are <hi>minorum gentium</hi> (as to
our own Intereſt) have no <hi>cauſe</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> it:
For then, it may be, you and I might in ſome
time of our Ages commence Biſhops. But
me thinks we ſhould now agree; eſpecially if
you would call to mind that Maxim in Logick.
<hi>Magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Biſhop Vſher</hi> were now alive, he would
give you but ſmall thanks for preſſing <hi>his
Model of Epiſcopacy</hi> (if his,) now the King
and Laws are reſtor'd, which he only calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as that which could be born by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the latter times. Sequeſtered Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who would gladly then have received
a fifth part out of their Revenue, would be
loth now to be bound up to the ſame terms.
The Counſel Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> gave to the late
King; Rather to part with his Life, than
Epiſcopacy: And his Notes upon <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
concerning the diviſion of <hi>Aſia,</hi> confuting Dr.
<hi>Meric Cauſabon,</hi> affirming, that Epiſcopacy
crept into the Church in the ſecond Century,
do ſufficiently diſcover his Judgment. If
Thieves ſhould ſtrip me of all my Cloths, I
I will rather accept from them my old Coat,
than go naked; yet if the time come, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62157:39"/>
honeſt Men may come to their Goods, I would
have all again to a very Shoo-ſtring. Let us
not take up the old trick and method of the
Papiſts; they have given out, that ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Men, who liv'd Proteſtants, dyed Papiſts:
So let not us extract Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of the dead Trunks of Epiſcopal

This is but obliquely to reflect upon
former Kings and Stateſmen, who have allowed
ſuch large Provinces. Some of them have
been much canton'd in latter Ages, if we look

there not many Pariſhes in theſe? And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

the Cities and Towns adjacent. So
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62157:39"/>
many <hi>Regiones ſuburbicariae,</hi> did belong to the
Biſhops of thoſe great Cities; <hi>ergo,</hi> they had
their <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> to aſſiſt them. Tell me true,
were there not Biſhops before there wery any
Pariſhes? If ſo; Chriſt never ordained they
ſhould be Parochial. Do not you know that
the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had all <hi>Aegypt, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> under him? And that
<hi>Thebais</hi> and <hi>Mareotis</hi> were afterward added
to his Dioceſs. But <hi>you will be guided</hi> (you
ſay) <hi>by</hi> Cyprian <hi>and</hi> Ignatius. Well! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
yet theſe were <hi>Dioceſans: Cyprians
Dioceſs</hi> was <hi>Africa;</hi> over great part of which
his Power did extend. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was Biſhop

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> why ſhould we ſwear Allegiance to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?
Till the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny invaded the

This is to twist them into the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>Is it unlawful to promiſe or ſwear to be

Yet this is the ſum of our Canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
By your leave, Sir, <hi>de facto,</hi> Presbyters
have been obedient to their Biſhops, under

<hi>long before the</hi> Roman <hi>Tyranny inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

wrangled himſelf at laſt into Conformity:
And if you have arriv'd to a juſt Latitude of

you,—that <hi>what we ſwear to Biſhops, does
not twist them with a Coordinate Power with
the King,</hi> no more than when I ſworeſidelity
to the Univerſity at my Matriculation: When
a Soldier takes a Sacrament to be true to his
General; and Tradeſmen do the like to their
ſeveral Corporations: I ſay, no more do we
ſet up an Aemulous confronting Power with
the King in ſubſcribing to Biſhops, which he
does not only allow, but authorize; than I
made the Univerſity, or they, their Generals,
or Corporations to have—<hi>diviſum cum Jove

When I quote your words,—<hi>We muſt not
communicate with a Pariſh Miniſter, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth
with the Biſhops,</hi> you ſay I ſhould have
added; <hi>In conſenting to our ſilencing.</hi> Indeed
I thought thoſe words needleſs and ſuperfluous:
For what Pariſh Miniſters had any hand in your

If as approving and rejoycing at your ſilence,
you will find this very diffcult in any good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

for your Miniſterial Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>You tell me, <hi>You can as ſoon drive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

diſtorted, and poiſoned by other Tutors, much
might have been done; perhaps we might have
taken ſuch ſtragling Sheep upon our Shoulders,
and have brought them to their proper Folds.
But ſince they have been taught (like Wolves)
not to value the Scepter, I have ſmall hopes to
prevail with my Shepherds Crook. If they
will not now hear your Voice, and be obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious

I did ſend an <hi>Epistola veridica</hi> to the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
(in the Uſurper's days) without an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You end, as it were glorying, <hi>That you have
not given me a lenifying Anſwer,</hi> or <hi>ſpoken me
fair.</hi> You might have ſaid, <hi>(If you are ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
addicted, as you ſay, to ſpeak plain truth,)</hi>
That taking your Rod into your Hand, you
have ſlaſh'd the <hi>Malepert Levite.</hi> Well! I will
get ſome good by you, whether you will or
no; I will think more humbly and meanly of
my ſelf, than you can ſpeak. <hi>And though you
ſay I am ſo blinded with ſelf-love, that I neither
know what I ſay or do;</hi> yet I will not pay you
in your own Coin; but pray for you, as I do
for my ſelf,—That wherein you or I erre,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62157:41"/>
that God would even reveal this unto us, and
reduce us into the Way of Truth.</p>
               <p>If your habit of ſeverity, and keen edge of
faſtuous contempt, may be abated, and you
may be happily mollified into more kindneſs:
If you ſhall then vouchſafe to write to me in
a more favourable, ſmooth, and obliging Strain;
you ſhall not overcome, though you conquer
me. In the mean time you may call me a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite;</hi>
but I will take the boldneſs to ſubſcribe
my ſelf,</p>

LETTER
Written to
Mr. Baxter,
After his BOOK of
Church Diviſions came forth.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Perceive, that my Anſwer to your Letter
was not ſatisfactory; ſince I find in your
late Book, not only oblique Reflections,
but direct and down-right Expreſſions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(without any Ambages) you articulately
ſignifie your diſcontent both with me and my
Book. Who would have thought that a word
or two of advice and ſeaſonable counſel ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62157:42"/>
have merited ſuch harſh and Paſſionate Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?
or ſhould not eſcape branding with the
black <hi>Theta</hi> of a <hi>Challenge, Ambuſcade,</hi> and
an intimation of <hi>Defamation</hi> and <hi>Blood?</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(me thinks) conſidering the Premiſes, you
ſhew as great a defect of Logick, as of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
To what purpoſe is your Tragical out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
of <hi>provoking you to gape against an Oven?</hi>
and <hi>making your Name a Stepping-stone to thoſe
Ends I aſpire after?</hi> Alas! what advantage will
it be to me to ſee you in the flames? or your
Name ſullied? That's barbarous; and this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious.
I am in the Zenith of my preferment,
whilſt I am a conſtant Preacher of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>How are you ſure that I am not able <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the light of the Truth?</hi> If the Organs of
my Eyes are indiſpoſed at preſent, I will bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſome Spectacles, or procure ſome Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve
to clear them, before you can prove thoſe
things to be <hi>truth,</hi> which you call ſo. When
I ſee Scripture and reaſon for them, let me be
accounted ſtabborn or ſtupid, if I either ſhut
my Eyes, or cannot <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hold them ſteddy
enough to diſcern them in their genuine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
Before this be done, you cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that you are a true Prophet, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and condemning me afore-hand. Are you
Secretary to him, who at one glance ſees them,
who have Eyes and ſee not, or elſe ſee but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not? You know who it was that boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his Eyes were open, <hi>Numb. 24. 3.</hi> I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62157:43"/>
wiſh you knew me better, and then you might
have abated theſe ſeverities.</p>
               <p>How can you hope to <hi>heal our Diviſions,</hi>
and to wooe our <hi>Engliſh</hi> World into mutual
love? when your own Gall runs over with
ſuch large Effluviums, and your thoughts are
ſo over-weening, as if you did comprehend
all Knowledge, Truth, and Light; and we, poor
Wretches! were groping in Cimmerian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or grovelling in ſome narrow Ditch. But if
you will not hold up your Taper and help us
forth, reſerving your Antidote againſt our ſin
and error, in your own Breaſt; take heed you
meet not with the ſame doom, as he in <hi>Cardan,</hi>
who knew how to cure the Stone, and dyed
without revealing it.</p>
               <p>It is well, that you are pleas'd to prolong
your <hi>Anſwer, until I procure you a Licenſe;</hi> for
ſo you may ſpare your own trouble, <hi>uſ<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> ad
Cal. Graec.</hi> For who would unmuzzle a fierce
Panther, that would worry him that ſets his
Chops at liberty? Although another Man
would tell you; Herein you deal like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
who tell us, they can prove us all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
if they might have liberty to diſpute,
and write without the hazard of the Law:
Yet when it pleaſes them, they take liberty
more than enough. Sir! if ever you comply
with my ſober Requeſt, you need not direct it
to me, but to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:62157:43"/>
As for thoſe four Lines <hi>2. Part. Pag. 8.</hi> ſpend
your ſecond thoughts upon them, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you can make ſenſe of them. There you
ſerve in again the ſame Diſh of Coleworts;
but you leave out the Author, and name the
Book; yet in your Grammar the Book is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This is no Solaciſm with you, who
can make one <hi>Diſparatum</hi> to predicate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
for in the ſame Part <hi>Pag. 92.</hi> you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorically
affirm, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a Verb. Theſe
are but trifles; yet if a Man be put to ſencing,
he will take all advantages.</p>
               <p>As for the bulk and ſcope of your Book,
concerning healing Church Diviſions,—<hi>Cum
ſis mortalis,</hi> &amp;c. The Scene is laid in
Heaven, and the deſign is Generous, Noble,
and Chriſtian. It is great pity, that you ſhould,
<hi>Auſis excidere tam magnis.</hi> Yet conſider
whether the aim and level be both right.
If you would have us joyn together with one
Heart and Shoulder in the Worſhip of God,
as now conſtituted, which you allow P. 38.
me thinks you ſhould not (I will uſe as much
ſoftneſs as I can) have ſpoken ſo ſleightly—of
Conformity. As, <hi>if you ſhould conform, it
would neither be a little or ſingle ſin,</hi> Pag. 26.
This muſt needs weaken our Hands, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
our Miniſtry, and make the People cold
in joyning with us. Will thoſe words of Mr.
<hi>Dod</hi> hold weight in the Ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary?
<hi>who thanked God for the Churches ſake,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62157:44"/>
that ſome Men conform'd; and for the Truth
ſake, that ſome conform'd not.</hi> Can that be for
the advantage of the Church, which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Truth? Does God ſtand in
need of our Lies? ſhould we ſpeak wickedly
for God, or talk deceitfully for him? <hi>Job
13. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Though in ſome places you ſpeak honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
of our Liturgy, <hi>Pag. 38. 59. 88.</hi> yet
you daſh all again by complaining of <hi>its
imperfect mode and faſhion of words,</hi> Pag. 59.
And that you joyn with us meerly by force,
for want of a better; for <hi>were you in</hi> New-England,
<hi>you would not</hi> joyn with our Prayers.
<hi>2. Part P.</hi> 176. Is this your Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi>
for our Wounds? Are you like to prove a
good <hi>Samaritan</hi> to our bleeding Church?
What lowring and longing muſt there be, after
another mode of Worſhip, if ours be ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and that of other Churches ſo far beyond
it? You do well: Go on! that you joyn with
the Prayers of the Liturgy, and in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Sacrament, <hi>P. 34. 40.</hi> yet you
will not touch either (as to an active Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of them) with the leaſt of your Fingers.
And herein you reſemble the preſent <hi>Jews,</hi> who
hire Chriſtian Servants to kindle their Fires,
and to dreſs their Meat on the Sabbath-day.
They care not what is done, ſo they do it not
themſelves.</p>
               <p>

3. Was it a right courſe to cement us, and
<hi>cure our Diviſions</hi> by alienating the Minds of
Men from their <hi>Governours,</hi> and that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
which is eſtabliſhed by Law amongſt us?
As if it were not lawful (by your Doctrine)
to own <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> and to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with a Dioceſan Church, <hi>P. 75.</hi> Nay,
<hi>we muſt not communicate with a Pariſh Miniſter
who concurreth with the Biſhops,</hi> P. 77, <hi>The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is ſuch as God will not accept,</hi> Part
2. P. 3. And to take off the Stomachs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the more from their preſent Governours,
you have found out a Forreign Government
for them, (though not in <hi>Rome,</hi> yet in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
Pag. 46.) which in your <hi>Judgment</hi> does
far ſurpaſs ours. Sir, I thought it had been
far better for you and I, to obey old Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than to invent or preſcribe new ones.
If we ſet the People a gadding after Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we neither perform our own Duties,
nor go the right way to <hi>cure</hi> the Peoples <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Sir! I have given you theſe Strictures,
not out of any deſire to reciprocate the ſame
with you, any farther than a private Letter;
but only to prepare you for what you may
expect from your Antagoniſt, and to ſhew you
how dangerous it is to recede from the good
old Paths, and allowed Principles, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder
our ſelves and others with new and
raſh contrivances of our own Heads. As
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62157:45"/>
for any thing, which upon juſt and proper
Grounds ſhall have a tendency to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Love and Peace, I ſhall always be

Third Letter.</head>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THough you foretel me how little good
my writing will do you, in which I
preſume not to contradict you; yet
the vindication of Truth is an end ſufficient to
invite me to beſtow a few more Lines, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
your unworthy oppoſition againſt that
Object of the intellectual Nature. Truth and
Repentance are the things which you vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
militate againſt, (under pretence of
skirmiſhing with my words) and that by no
better Weapons than a wrangling Wit, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
diverſions, which you uſe like one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to underſtand the truth, or to confeſs
an Error or injurious Deed.</p>
               <p>§. 1. You tell me I am a <hi>treacherous Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
if I ſuffer ſin upon you; and at the ſame
time open your offence, that I tell you of
<hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Guilt,</hi> and name ſome of your
faults: This is the <hi>Waters of</hi> Marah to you,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62157:46"/>
                  <hi>Sarcaſmes, Satyrs,</hi> &amp;c. Are not you reſolved
then to be diſpleaſed by our Speech or Silence,
and to make me unavoidably an Offender by
the contrariety of your Laws; (and what a
wonder of ſelf-ignorance is it, that the Author
of the <hi>Perſwaſive</hi> ſhould draw up the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
of Sarcaſtical ſcorn upon ſo many and
ſuch Men, and yet be ſo ſenſible of a drop of
juſt reproof that fell upon his own Head?)</p>
               <p>§. 2. After ſuch a Book you would not be
ſaid to traduce the Presbyterians, as if you
wrote you knew not what, or had already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. When I had opened your ſtrange
dealing in calling for thoſe Reaſons of our
Non-conformity which you knew we muſt
not publiſh, you neither can hide your diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
nor will confeſs it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In my laſt I briefly named divers of
your palpable contradictions; and many of
them you have no cloak for, and yet no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of, but a ſilent preterition. And what
you ſpeak to is ſo managed, as if our Queſtion
had not been, whether you had ſpoken well
and truly? but whether you could ſpeak
again, or had any Pen, Ink, and Paper
left?</p>
               <p>§. 5. As to the ſilenc'd Miniſters, (that you
may not ſeem guiltleſs) you firſt ſay, <hi>[How
many of theſe have little more learning than your</hi>
Engliſh <hi>Books have taught them, as great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62157:46"/>
to the Writers of the first Centuries, as
they have been to the Vniverſities.]</hi> You did
craftily to ſpeak interrogatively: For a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
cannot be falſe. There are many Non-conformiſts
that live within a few Miles of
your dwelling; which of them do you mean?
Is it good old Mr. <hi>Sam. Hilderſham,</hi> or Mr.
<hi>Sam. Fiſher,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Wilsby,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bryan,</hi> or
Mr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Tho. Baldwin Senior,</hi> or
Mr. <hi>Spilsbury,</hi> or which of all the reſt do you
mean? Sure it's I that am the Stranger to the
Univerſities, that am therefore worthy to be
ſilenced: I know but of two or three more in
all the Country about you: But that two of
thoſe are ſo ſtrange to the <hi>Fathers</hi> I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
But if they be, I had rather the Church
had Men that will ſpeak ſound Doctrine in an
apt and ſerious manner for the bringing of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to repentance in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than ſuch as can
lace an inſipid, empty, or ſenſeleſs diſcourſe
with ſome Shreds of <hi>Chaldee, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick:</hi>
And though I could wiſh, that all the
Miniſters of Chriſt had all Accompliſhments
fit even for the adorning of their Sacred Work;
yet I had rather hear a meer <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divine,
than an <hi>Hebrew</hi> or a <hi>Syriack</hi> Sot. But as I am
grown of late years to take it for no very
great honour to our young Preachers, that
they are acquainted with the Univerſities; ſo
I think it ſo ſhort a Work to read the few brief
Writers of the three firſt Centuries, as maketh
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62157:47"/>
it more a diſhonour to be ignorant of them,
than any great honour to be acquainted with
them.</p>
               <q>But Sir, this kind of talk had been ſitter
for a Man of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> or <hi>Armenia,</hi> that
knoweth not <hi>England,</hi> than for an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Prieſt. O that one half of our Pariſhes now
had Men that were near as learned and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and able for their Miniſterial Work,
as thoſe two that I know near you, who never
were Graduates in any Univerſity: How eaſily
could I bear the ſilencing of my ſelf and all the
reſt, if all our Places were but fully ſupplyed
with Conformiſts that had but that meaſure of
Knowledge, Utterance, Piety, and Diligence, as
the more unlearned and loweſt Rank of the
Non-conformiſts of my Acquaintance have, if
you take out a third part of that inferior Rank,
(though ſome one individual may be as low.) And
I think I know as many of them as you: What
pains do I take by Word and Writing and
Example, to ſatisfie them that are averſe to joyn
in the publick Aſſemblies? And when I meet
with a Pariſh that hath an honeſt, ſober, tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
or competent Preacher, I uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
But alas! from how many do I hear,
[What Man can endure to hear a School-boy
read over or Cant the Shreds and
Patches of inſipid nonſenſe, or ignorantly
abuſe the Scripture, and talk of things which
he underſtandeth not, and prate againſt he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62157:47"/>
knoweth not what, to get ſome reputation
with thoſe that take Vanity and Vexation to
be the laudable Accompliſhments of a Prieſt?
Or if ſometimes they ſpeak things good and
needful, it is done with ſo little skill or ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
that all comes cold and dead to the
Hearers, who hear them as School-boys ſaying
over their Leſſons, and not as Men that are in
good ſadneſs and believe themſelves: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſidering how ſeldom a good word
is heard out of their mouths all the week
after, and how oft they are in the Ale-houſe,
and how ſeldom in the Houſes of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to inſtruct them, and help them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the Life to come] ſuch Anſwers as
theſe, how often do I hear? <hi>Pudet haec oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>—I
believe no more than I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to believe. But I ſometimes hear Lads
talk in the Pulpit at ſuch a rate my ſelf, as I
confeſs would go near to drive me alſo away,
if ordinarily I had not better: And when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
ſeek to me to motion them to a Teacher,
how hard do I find it to find them a Man that
hath the abilities of the lower ſort of Non-conformiſts.
To confeſs the truth to you,
the Preachers of theſe late years have almoſt
brought me to the opinion of ſome of the
higheſt Formaliſts, that not only a Form of
Prayer, but of Preaching too, be ſtrictly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on ſome Miniſters, and nothing endured
but Liturgies and Homilies: For I am ſo far
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62157:48"/>
now from being all for Sermons, that I take
the Common-Prayer to be incomparably bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Prayers or Sermons of ſome that I
hear, and to be the beſt that I expect in many
places when I go to Church: And if all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
Preachers were ſuch, as too many be,
I would heartily prefer our Homilies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer
before all their Pulpit-work.
And now I ſee which is the way to bring it to
this paſs, and to put down Preaching and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-Prayers,
even to ſet up ſuch as will weary
the Hearers, and make them be glad of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
as better than ſuch pittiful ſtuff: But yet
I will not conſent to that deſign, while there
are ſo many living that can and would do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if they might. But muſt we be ſilenced
becauſe we be not ſuch as theſe Conformiſts, or
muſt theſe alſo be ſilenced with us? But I pray,
Sir, forget not to tell me in your next what
one Non-conformiſt was ſilenced on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of inſufficiency? and whether the very
worſt and meaneſt of thoſe that formerly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, be not re-ordained and received
when they do conform?</q>
               <p>§. 6. You next ask [How many of theſe
were neſted in other Mens Habitations, while
the right owners were expoſed to Wind, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Starving, double the number of
1800?] <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> But how many of thoſe
were <hi>never</hi> in any Sequeſtration; and muſt not
<hi>they</hi> preach the Goſpel for the ſake of <hi>others?</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62157:48"/>
2. I deny not the great Crime you charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: When the Judges of thoſe times
had caſt out many Conformiſts, (moſt that
ever I knew of, upon accuſations of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
or groſs ſcandal witneſſed upon Oath)
though too many (contrary to the requeſts
of my ſelf, and many other Miniſters) were
cenſured for their oppoſition to the Parliament)
then did theſe Non-conformiſts (ſome of
them) come upon the Peoples requeſt into
the vacant Churches, and choſe rather to
preach to the People, than they ſhould have
none, and Gods publick Worſhip ſhould ceaſe
in the Land; and I confeſs, that they did eat
Bread while they laboured, even that which
was devoted to the maintenance of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.
I was one of theſe my ſelf, and
others before you have told me of it. And
though I never put the Vicar out of his Houſe,
(nor ſet my foot within his doors, leſt he
ſhould think I intended it) yet I confeſs he
had but ſomewhat above <hi>40 l. per Annum</hi> out
of the Sequeſtration, and his old Curate Mr.
<hi>Turner 10 l.</hi> But that amounted to abovt <hi>500 l.</hi>
a Sermon in fourteen years, (and I never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade
him to preach) whereas before his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration
he had not paſt <hi>30 l.</hi> or <hi>40 l.</hi> a
Sermon at moſt; (For he preach'd (as ſome
called it) once a quarter.) His Curate Mr.
<hi>Turner</hi> had his old ſtipend to his death, and
almoſt all the time did publickly read the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62157:49"/>
Common-Prayer at <hi>Mitton,</hi> though I told him
indeed that I could wiſh he would give over
the Miniſtry; ſeeing upon examination I could
not find that he underſtood much of his
Creed, nor what we expect from Catechized
Children of twelve years old. But whether
it had been my duty to have forborn my four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years labour there, becauſe the Times
caſt out ſuch Men; and whether it had been
better have left many hundreds untaught, to
periſh for ever in their ſin and ignorance, or
whether ſin and ignorance are really ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
matters as we Non-conformiſts have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
are Controverſies which I will not now
debate.</p>
               <p>§. 7. You add, [The Retalliation may cauſe
them to ſay, As I have done, ſo God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
me.] <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Doth this ſavour of any
ſenſe at all of a love to Souls? Is it the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
or the <hi>People</hi> that ſuffer more? When
we deſire but that we may be ſuffered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
ſinners, and perſwade them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
till the Churches be ſo well ſupplied
as not to need us, in ſtead of nothing the miſery of
thoſe that periſh for lack of teaching, you tell us
how juſtly we are requited: And muſt ſo many
thouſands go to Hell that we may be requited?
Why ſhould ſo many ſuffer for our faults?
2. But let us conſider alſo your Juſtice to our
ſelves. 1. The Miniſters that were in Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
were put out (where any could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62157:49"/>
claim the Place) before the 1800 were ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and they were not I think a fourth part of
the ſilenced ones that were of that number.
2. They ſucceeded thoſe that were moſtly
caſt out upon accuſations of ſcandal, witneſſed
upon Oath, (as the two firſt Centuries print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unhappily ſhew:) If you ſay that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſwore falſely, and the Judges were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
I anſwer, That where I was acquainted
the Witneſſes were reputed as honeſt Men as
any in the Place, and they got nothing by
their Oaths; and if all were unjuſt, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that was not the ſucceeding Miniſters
fault. 3. I my ſelf ſucceeded one that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
but once a quarter, and that ſo as I never
heard the ſillieſt Sectary preach in my life.
4. None of them that I know of had any
hand in caſting out theſe Miniſters: Moſt of
them came out of the Univerſities after the
other were ejected. 5. If they had not come
in, the Peoples Souls, and the publick Worſhip
of God had been forſaken. 6. When we
were in, we laboured with all our skill and
power publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe,
and might we have indulged the Fleſh, had
never taken ſuch a Fleſh-diſpleaſing courſe.
7. The ejected Miniſters had for their Wives
a fifth part of the maintenance. 8. And the
ejected Miniſters were never ſilenced that I
know of, but only forbidden to uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer
but a little before <hi>Cromwel</hi> dyed.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62157:50"/>
9. And againſt this both I and others wrote,
and requeſted of the Uſurper, that none that
was of competent Parts, and an honeſt Life,
might be hindered from the Miniſtry for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the King, or upon any ſuch civil or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary
differences. This was our Caſe; and
were we requited as we had done? Did we
ſilence any Man? Did we caſt any out, (how
bad ſoever;) ſome did perhaps, or had a hand
in it? But what's that to the many hundred
that did not? Have we the fifth part? Have
we leave to preach when we are ejected out of
the Places of Maintenance? I confeſs we had
an opinion, which I will not now ſtand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
that the damnation of multitudes of
Souls is too dear a price to purchaſe the Eaſe
or fuller Maintenance of an ignorant and a
drunken Prieſt above his fifth part: And
though here and there ſuch a Man as your ſelf
might be caſt out, which I never liked
or had a hand in, yet your pleading in this
Cauſe doth urge me to tell you my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
When I was a Child, I lived under
five Teachers before I was ten years old, of
which moſt were ignorant Readers, two Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
one an unlearned ſeldom Preacher;
after that, before I was fifteen, I lived where
was a Parſon of eighty years old, that never
preached, and a Vicar of near eighty that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
preached, both in one Pariſh; and four
Curates and Parſons, drunken Readers, moſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62157:50"/>
of them my School-maſters: The laſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but once, and then he was ſtark drunk,
the dreadfulleſt Sermon that ever I heard, on
<hi>Mat. 25. 40, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides all theſe, ſome years,
when the old Parſons Eye-ſight failed, he ſaid
the Common-prayer by rote, and a Taylor
read the Scriptures for him one year, and a
poor Day-labourer another. When I entred
into the Miniſtry my ſelf, I have told you
whom I did ſucceed: But as the man is, ſo
is his appetite and reliſh: I ſtrive not to
bring you to diſlike ſuch Prieſts, nor to
win you from pleading for the ſilencing of
Faithful Miniſters; but while I am ſilenced,
I will tell you what Truth and Innocence have
to ſay.</p>
               <p>§. 8. As to the <hi>Number</hi> which you will not
believe, I can only tell you that about 1800
were ſilenced 1662. of whom I will ſuppoſe
an hundred to have conformed, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to be dead: But doubt not but ſome
ſpring up in their ſteads.</p>
               <p>§. 9. As to your firſt Caution, I confeſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperations
have made ſome talk more ſharply
againſt the Biſhops than I think meet: But I
wonder and rejoyce that they are ſo few. Had
it been about <hi>London</hi> an uſual thing, they had
heard more of it before now.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And for your ſecond Caution, it is
not you nor I that make thoſe Laws which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
Duty and Sin: And if I would hold
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62157:51"/>
it to be no ſin in me to <hi>lie deliberately,</hi> and
ſay, that I aſſent and conſent to all things in
three Books, when I do not, or to abſolve
from an Oath many hundred thouſands, when
I never knew in what ſenſe they took it, or
other ſuch like; if I incourage the Laity to
conform to the Corporation Declaration, that
no man is bound by any thing in the Vow, no
not againſt Schiſm, Popery nor Prophaneſs,
nor to repent of his ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods Law will
never the more juſtifie any of this for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to it: Nor will he accept of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
for a Sacrifice, nor needeth my lie or
other ſin to his Service or Glory. But it's a fine
World, when fearing ſin (and no leſs ſin than
aforeſaid) is become the ſin and danger of the
Church.</p>
               <p>§ 11. I will add one obſervation on this
Subject, to make up your compariſon what
thoſe whom I and others of my acquaintance
ſucceeded were (not ſilenced but) ſequeſtred
for, is ſaid before; but. I never yet heard of
one Non-conformiſt ſilenced for <hi>Inſufficiency</hi>
or <hi>Scandal,</hi> but for <hi>Nonconformity</hi> alone. Let
not your talk and mine, but the Laws, and
Court-Records judge and tell Poſterity the
Truth. But I have known ſilly Anabaptiſts
and Sectaries, whom we never approved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
upon their Conformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:62157:51"/>
§ 12. You ſay, <hi>[I am glad you own my
quotation out of your Book of</hi> Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.]
Anſw.</hi> Alas Sir, is not repentance better than
hiding ſlander by palpable untruth? I told you
truly, [I never wrote ſo, I never thought ſo,
but have proved the contrary at large, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
Why did not you cite the words where I
ſay it.</p>
               <p>§. 13. You add for a Cover another untruth,
that I ſay [I have retracted and expunged it in
a later Edition;] not a true word, I only ſaid,
[That <hi>I had retracted and expunged, not only
that which you pervert, but all the reſt from
end to end, which ſeemed to ſavour the late
Wars.]</hi> And is it all one to ſay, I expunged
what you <hi>accuſe me</hi> of, and to ſay I expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>that which you pervert:</hi> But you have
more learning than we that are ſtrangers to the
Univerſities, and therefore can make good one
untruth with another; and ſport your ſelf
with the Image of a jumping Deer, and a
playing Fiſh; ſo hard is it to convince you of
viſible ſin.</p>
               <p>§. 14. You add, <hi>[If you be ſo raſh'in obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your immature Notions,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> I
juſtifie none of my Juvenile Errors or Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But how ſuitably cometh this from the
ſame Pen, that tells me how <hi>glorious it would
be,</hi> P. 128. <hi>to retract with the great Biſhop of
Hippo,</hi> &amp;c. And in the ſame Book not only
<hi>urgeth,</hi> but <hi>falſifyeth</hi> what I did ſo many years
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62157:52"/>
                  <hi>before retract;</hi> and now again upbraideth me
with that which I did retract. I know <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
is beſt: But can any Man think it would
pleaſe ſuch Men? I confeſs had I never wrote
at all, I had never wrote any word amiſs:
And had I never preached at all, I had never
preached word amiſs, which is the cure uſed
on us now, and the innocency of Prieſts which
I have heard ſome plead for.</p>
               <p>§. 15. I neither had nor have any mind to
pour Vinegar into the Wound which you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only, when in your Book you tell me of
the inconformity of ſome that grew up under
my Shadow, <hi>Pag. 129.</hi> you forgot that you
would not be reſponſible for one Man in
your own Family, and yet I am chargeable
with that which you ſuppoſe the fault of I
know not who.</p>
               <p>§. 16. If your Neighbour and his Wife will
ſwear what you ſay, wonder not that ſo much
ſcandal was charged by Oath on your <hi>ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
Ministers;</hi> I tell you again, that I was
never to my knowledge in your Pariſh in my
life; that I never took Horſe in my life; that
I medled not <hi>my ſelf</hi> with any one at that
time that I told you I went out; that I never
kept or poſſeſſed one of them: Therefore no
Committee could order me to reſtore them.
But a Week after, another Company, as I told
you, did fetch ſome from that Pariſh, and
were ordered by the Committee to reſtore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62157:52"/>
ſome of them; which muſt needs prove your
Neighbours miſtake. No Man, to my beſt
remembrance, ever came to me with any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Committee; for they knew that
I was no Officer, and kept not a Horſe. And
if he followed me to <hi>London,</hi> it muſt be at
leaſt ſixteen years after. For I was never at
Mr. <hi>Foley</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>London</hi> till 1660. and the
time he ſpeaketh of was 1644.</p>
               <p>§. 17. You ſay, <hi>[In your late Book you ſay,
you medled not with the War till after</hi> Naſeby
<hi>Fight.] Anſw.</hi> Not a true word: What ſhould
move you to do thus? I ſee Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> is
not the only temerarious Writer. I tell you
the clean contrary in that Book, and only
ſay, <hi>[That I never entered into the Army till
after</hi> Naſeby <hi>Fight.]</hi> And is that all one as to
ſay, <hi>I never medled with the War?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 18. The Aphoriſms which you called
me to retract, you thus noted, <hi>[Thoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
which are gathered by an Eminent Hand.]</hi>
I inſtanced but in the firſt which that Eminent
Hand had gathered: And now, <hi>this is not one
of thoſe</hi> that you meant.</p>
               <p>§. 19. You ſay, <hi>[That ſince Arch-biſhop</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<hi>refuſed to Licenſe Dr.</hi> Sybthorpes <hi>Book,
I must ſuppoſe him a Presbyterian.] Anſw.</hi>
Yet not a word true! I only ſaid, <hi>[Was
Arch-biſhop</hi> Abbot <hi>a Presbyterian?]</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was none: and ſo that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts
were they that began to offend the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62157:53"/>
King by ſtriving againſt his Will, as I further
told you.</p>
               <p>§. 20. The inconſequence which you bring
in with <hi>[I must ſay]</hi> ſhould have been turned
into <hi>[I did ſay,]</hi> Did I not recite your
own words? Doth he not ſwear to Dioceſanes
and Lay-Chancellors, who ſweareth, <hi>That he
will not at any time endeavour any alteration of
the Government of the Church,</hi> which is in their
Hands? And doth not he <hi>endeavour an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
who <hi>Petitioneth</hi> the King or Parliament
for it? Shall we ſwear <hi>univerſally,</hi> and ſay we
meant it but <hi>particularly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 21: In your deſcription of Preſbyterians
you talk of <hi>[pulling down Epiſcopacy, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up Presbyterian Government in the Church
against the conſent of the Supream Magistrate,]</hi>
when you were told that it was <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> that
the preſent Non-conformiſts moved to obtain:
And I know none of them that take it not for
Rebellion to pull down or ſet up forcibly or by
the Sword, any thing againſt the Supream Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
or without him, (except only what a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
or Maſter may do in his Family on Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with the Rod.)</p>
               <p>§. 22. Seeing you cannot deny but that you
printed about the <hi>Savoy</hi> Buſineſs that which
you underſtood not, and cannot juſtifie;
why do you not rather retract it, than wiſh
things had been managed worſe? Do you not
know how much, yea very much more we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62157:53"/>
yielded to, than ever <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> whom you
praiſe, or the other old Non-conformiſt would
have done? See but the Kings Declaration
about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and read Dr. <hi>John
Reignolds</hi> Papers to Sir <hi>Francis Knowles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Epiſcopacy, and judge whether he
himſelf would have gone any further. Indeed
I know not that I differ in any Point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Ceremonies or Diſcipline, from that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctor whom you praiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 23. You make me wonder to read what
you urge us with about Popery, when we ſo
long together ſpake aloud, (when we were
allowed) and told them, <q>[Our union is our
ſtrength, and all the faithful Miniſters of
<hi>England</hi> are too few to caſt and keep out Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Popery, and Senſuality; and if we
were all never ſo conformable our ſelves, we
do know the Land ſo well, that we are ſure
if ſuch and ſuch things be made neceſſary to
Miniſtration and Communion, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
worthy Miniſters will be ſilenced, and
many thouſand religious People will become
Separatiſts, and more be offended; and our
Diviſions will involve us in diſcontents and
murmurings on one ſide, and ſeverities on
the other, and Popery and Prophaneſs will
proſper under our Diviſions: And you will
be neceſſitated to fill up our Places with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch Miniſters as will increaſe all this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and all this may now be prevented by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62157:54"/>
that which will do you no harm at all.]</q> And
when after all our endeavours the Flood-gates
are pluck'd up, which we would have kept
down, it is now pretended, that if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
nimbly and deeply ſwear, and ſubſcribe,
and do all that is impoſed on us, Popery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
will come in, and it's long of us, that
would fain have prevented it, and ſtop'd the
gap.</p>
               <p>§. 24. When I had beyond all ſober contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
proved to you, that it was Epiſcopal
Men in <hi>England</hi> that raiſed the War againſt the
King, that I might move you to impartiality,
and to call them to Repentance, you do the
poorlieſt put off that which you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
and yet will not acknowledge, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were criminal in them that are of the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> Who knoweth not that
many Epiſcopal Parliaments before had begun
the ſame Quarrels againſt the King, which the
Long Parliament proſecuted, and cryed out
ſtill of Monopolies, loſs of Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
Arminianiſm and Innovations in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
toleration and increaſe of Popery?
Read but <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Collections, and <hi>Heylins</hi>
Life of Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and deny it if you
can. You cannot deny but that the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
began in the ſame temper as the former
ended, having the irritation of that which
they accounted <hi>Lauds</hi> Innovations to go
higher: You cannot I think name two in all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62157:54"/>
the Houſe of Commons that were Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
when the War began: I provoke you to
read over the Liſt of the Lord-Lieutenants of
the Parliaments firſt Militia throughout all
<hi>England,</hi> and prove but one of them to be
then a Preſbyterian, or any of them that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
yet to this day: I provoke you to name
me one General, Officer, yea or three Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
in all the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his firſt Army that
were Preſbyterians. I might have gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and wiſh'd you to peruſe the Names of
all the Parliaments old Major-Generals or
Chief Commanders in the ſeveral Counties,
(the Earl of <hi>Stamford,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi>
M. G. <hi>Maſſey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Denbeigh,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Gell, Ferdinando</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfaix, Dointz, Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Sir <hi>Tho. Middleton, Morgan,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Manchester,</hi> &amp;c.) and tell me how many you
can find that were Preſbyterians. I can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that many greatlyeſt famed of late for
Preſbyterians, have earneſtly pleaded with me
for the preſent Epiſcopacy. I asked you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was not only the taking down that
which they took to be the Innovations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances,
and civil Power of the Biſhops,
which the Parliament asked when the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan?
You can give me no anſwer to any of
this that ſavoureth of ſenſe and modeſty, but
what muſt grant, that it is notoriouſly certain
that it was not a Preſbyterian, but an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and Eraſtian Parliament in <hi>England</hi> which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62157:55"/>
began the Wars: And yet you will rather hide
their fact and fault, while you aggravate the
ſame in others, than you will call the Epiſcopal
Party to repentance. What credit ſhall we
ever give to Hiſtory, when a thing ſo publick
and notorious, as a Parliament, an Army, the
Lord-Lieuteants, the Major-Generals, yea and
the Synod, ſhall all be repreſented to be
Men of another Party, and that had another
Cauſe, than indeed they were and had? If in
the ſame Age, the ſame Land, even where and
when a great part of them are yet living, and
the reſt lately were our Neighbours and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars,
there ſhall yet be found ſuch Men, yea
Preachers, as have the face to tell the World,
that theſe at the raiſing of the War were Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians;
we may next expect, that Hiſtory
may make Poſterity believe, that they were
not <hi>Engliſh-men:</hi> I my ſelf knew many of the
Parliament, many Lord-Lieutenants, many of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army, many of the Major-Generals,
and I ſcarce remember one Preſbyterian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them all at the beginning of the War,
except two or three <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Soldiers that were
in <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army; and I do not know that
they were ſuch, but only that they were <hi>Scots.</hi>
And for the <hi>Westminster</hi> Aſſembly, except
only the ſix or ſeven Independents that were
there, I provoke you ſtill to name me three
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, that were Preſbyterians, or
that were not Conformiſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62157:55"/>
Now what do you ſay to all this? Do you
deny? Do you confute any of it? Do you
name a Man as an inſtance of my miſtake, or
can you do it?</p>
               <p>§. 25. Firſt you tell me, <hi>I am at much
pains to clear the Non-conformists of the guilt of
the late War. Anſw.</hi> No ſuch matter,—I
only tell you that it was not a Preſbyterian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or Army, that <hi>began</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> War.
1. The <hi>beginning</hi> of the War is one thing, and
the <hi>progreſs</hi> is another; the Preſbyterians (or,
ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Lords for their
Church-Lands and Tyths ſake) began it in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the Papiſts began it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> one
part of the Epiſcopal againſt another began it
in <hi>England.</hi> 2. All Non-conformiſts were not
Preſbyterians. 3. Cannot I ſay that the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<hi>began</hi> it without clearing thoſe that did
<hi>ſecond</hi> them; or the Sectaries that carried it
on to the end?</p>
               <p>You feign me to ſay, that <hi>[A very few Non-conformiſts
of a multitude were engaged in it;]</hi>
whereas my words were, <hi>[It is not one of a
multitude of the Nonconformable Ministers that
ever took up Arms againſt the King.]</hi> I ſpeak
there of <hi>Ministers</hi> only, and thoſe that are <hi>now</hi>
Non-conformiſts; of whom the far greateſt
number were then <hi>Children,</hi> and many <hi>unborn,</hi>
and many of the elder (yea moſt) never
medled with Arms: But as for the <hi>beginning</hi> of
the War, I cannot ſay, of a multitude a few
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62157:56"/>
only were ingaged, for there was then <hi>no mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> of Nonconformable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
Little did I think to have ever been put
to diſpute ſuch a Cauſe about open matter of
Fact. I know not your age, but (being a
Preacher near four years before the Wars) I
was old enough to know, that in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that I was acquainted in, there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
one poor obſcure Nonconformable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in a County, taking one with another,
nor I think paſt one for two Counties: Poor
old Mr. <hi>Barnet</hi> in <hi>Shrop-ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> in
<hi>Cheſhire,</hi> none in <hi>Worchester-ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi>
in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and
how few more in all <hi>England,</hi> and which of
theſe medled with the Wars?</p>
               <p>§. 26. And here you ſay, <hi>[I had thought,</hi>
currente rota, <hi>while your Hand was in you
would have ſaid, that the Regicides were Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
too,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sir, I now perceive</hi> Cateline <hi>was

ſatisfie your Conſcience, for the falſifying of
ſuch notorious matters of Fact? Is there any
room for a doubt in the Buſineſs, except to
Strangers, or thoſe that were unborn, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
Would you make me believe, that I
ſaw not what I ſaw, and heard not what I
heard?</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>[If Epiſcopal Men began and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

You add,</p>
               <p>§. 27. <hi>You were too credulous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were they
Epiſcopal Men that cryed, To your Tents O</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?
<hi>that preached Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>first vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Is there one Man named here as an Inſtance to
Confute me? Is this Evidence fit for ſuch a
Contradictor of notoriety it ſelf? When you
have named me the Men that uſed thoſe words,
I will anſwer you whether they were Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal?
I think Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> was one of the moſt
accuſed Preachers, being Aſſeſſor in the Aſſembly,
and Chaplain to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s own
Regiment: And he was one that proteſted for
a <hi>Salvo</hi> for Epiſcopacy, when the Covenant
was taken in the Aſſembly, as he hath told me
with his own Mouth, and wrote to me with
his own Hand, and none deny: And Dr.
<hi>Downing</hi> of <hi>Hackney</hi> was one of the next,
Chaplain to the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi>'s Regiment, who
(being Dr. of the Civil Law) hath Writings
yet viſible in print <hi>for Prelacy and Conformity.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> and Mr. <hi>Obadia Sedgwick</hi> were
two of the next, (one Chaplain to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the
other to the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Regiment) both
old Conformiſts: Of all the Chaplains of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62157:57"/>
Army, I knew not a Non-conformiſt and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
but Mr. <hi>Aſh;</hi> and I think I knew them
almoſt all. And for the Parliament I ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
before: The Members yet living ſay,
that Mr. <hi>Tate</hi> of <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> was the
only Preſbyterian then in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and I never yet knew one among the
Lords.</p>
               <p>§. 28. You ſay, <hi>[If they were, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
from the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Epiſcopacy, they did
not keep cloſe to our Church, (which were my
words) to our Articles, our Canons, our Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
our Homilies.] 1. Anſw.,</hi> Your words
were alſo, <hi>[Who can chooſe but nauſeate that
way of Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c.] 2. Speak out then,
and confeſs that they were degenerous Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Men, and call them to repentance as the
Raiſers of the War, and deceive not Poſterity
by telling them the contrary. 3. But Sir,
what mean you by <hi>your Church,</hi> which they
kept not cloſe to? Doth not the Canon Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize
them that deny the <hi>Convocation</hi> to
be the <hi>Repreſentative Church?</hi> And muſt not
the main Body of the Clergy then be your
Church? And doth not Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> largely ſhew
you, that there were but five Biſhops joyned
at firſt with Biſhop <hi>Laud?</hi> and that <hi>Abbot</hi> had
the reſt with him, in ſo much that they durſt
not commit their Cauſe to a Convocation?
And that Arminianiſm, new Ceremonies, with
Matters of Propriety and Prerogative, were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62157:57"/>
the Matters then of the Contention, which
made <hi>Heylin</hi> ſay, That <hi>he knew not whether the
Church could have a greater plague than a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Prelate,</hi> (becauſe of <hi>Abbots</hi> Intereſt in the
Nobility, Gentry, and People.) How ſhould
one then have known which of the Parties
was the <hi>Church,</hi> and who ſhall be Judge which
Party it is that keeps cloſe to the Articles, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
Lyturgy and Homilies: <hi>Whitgift</hi> with
Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> thought that the Anti-Arminian
<hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles were the ſenſe of the Church
and Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George Abbot</hi> Arch biſhop, and <hi>Robert Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with <hi>Davenant, Hall,</hi>
&amp;c. thought the middle Auguſtinian way was
the true ſenſe of the Articles, Lyturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(which is the plain truth.) Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> with
his four Partners, <hi>(Neile, Buckeridge, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and <hi>Corbet)</hi> thought (as <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith)
that the way called Arminian was the true
ſenſe of the Articles and Church. <hi>Overal</hi> and
<hi>Mountague</hi> kept with them of the middle way
in the main, yet were more averſe to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt
Prelates than the reſt. Theſe fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves: The Arminians being few,
are born down by the reſt in Parliaments, and
Convocations. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
(and, as <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, the King) favoured
the five diſſenting Biſhops! When favour
ſtrengtheneth their Party, they call themſelves
the Church; accordingly one part of them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62157:58"/>
pleadeth for His Majeſties Prerogative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the other are for Parliaments, and cry up
Propriety and Liberty: At laſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> and
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Buſſles prepare all for a War, and theſe
two Epiſcopal Parties ſight; one Party cryeth
down Arminianiſm, Innovations, Altars, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Papiſts, Ship-money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the other
Party cryeth out againſt abſolute Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Calviniſm, Puritaniſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the one
Party cryeth down the Papiſts, and calleth
the <hi>Scots</hi> Preſbyterians to their help; the other
Party cryeth down the Preſbyterians, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Papiſts to their help: Which of theſe
is the Church, which keepeth cloſe to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
Canons? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for my part I am none of
the Judge between them in that Point. And I
think if you call one ſide the Church, it will be
never the more the <hi>Church</hi> for that; unleſs the
King doth make it ſo: but ſurely they were
both Epiſcopal, though one Party after fell in
with the Preſbyterians, (and the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
were conquered or caſt out by the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
and the other Party kept with the
King.</p>
               <p>§. 29. You ſay, <hi>[Would Epiſcopal Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to root out Epiſcopacy?] Anſw.</hi> At firſt
they conſpired but to reſtrain and regulate
thoſe that they thought Innovators and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (I ſpeak only of Church Matters)
but after they were too weak to defend themſelves
without the <hi>Scots</hi> and Sectaries, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62157:58"/>
were content to take down Epiſcopacy to
pleaſe their Helpers, rather than to be overcome
themſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 30. Whether <hi>Williams</hi> or <hi>Laud</hi> was the
better Arch-biſhop, or whether they did well
that cut off <hi>Laud,</hi> is none of the Queſtion:
All that I ſay was, that <hi>Williams</hi> was an Arch-biſhop,
and a Commander for the Parliament
in Arms.</p>
               <p>§. 31. When you turn me from <hi>Heylins</hi> Life
of <hi>Laud,</hi> to <hi>Heylins</hi> Hiſtory of Preſbytery
you do but trifle and ſeek a <hi>Subterfuge.</hi> I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
not the Preſbyterians in that he chargeth
on them, (though you may know what <hi>Peter
Moulin,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> hath ſaid about
the Forreign Churches.) But what's that to the
Queſtion, whether it was an Epiſcopal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or a Preſbyterian that began the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
War, will the fault of one excuſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>§. 32. As to what you ſay of the <hi>Change of
the Puritans, ſince</hi> Jewel, Andrews, <hi>&amp;c. wrote
for them, and that they are not ſuch as</hi> Ball,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer 1. Is the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> changed
which you ſpeak of, or the <hi>whole Chorus</hi> which
you ſpeak to? Was there no <hi>Martin-Marpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
then? Have we retracted our Doctrine
or Conſent to the Church Articles, or to the
Oaths of Allegiance or Supremacy? Have we
not in 1660. yielded to more than ever <hi>Ball,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62157:59"/>
or any of the old Non-conformiſts yielded to?
Deny it if you can. 2. As for perſonal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

the like: But neither you nor they ſhould
charge any more, than you can prove guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>§. 33. You tell me, <hi>[If</hi> Hooker <hi>were alive,

which I have retracted. And muſt I be put to
defend the King againſt ſuch Men and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
at the ſame time when we are charged
with that which we oppoſe? And will you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
cry out of the Diſcipline of the whole

               <p>Come on then, I will cite you ſome of their
words; ſend me your defence of them in your

the Laws of thoſe Realms do permit
the People to ſtand on their right, if the
Prince would offer that wrong, I dare not
allow their Arms:—I buſie not my ſelf
in other Mens Common-wealths as you do,
neither will I raſhly pronounce all that reſiſt
to be Rebels. Caſes may fall out even in
Chriſtian Kingdoms, where the People may
plead their Right againſt the Prince, and not
be charged with Rebellion.—If a Prince
ſhould go about to ſubject his Kingdoms to a
Forreign Realm, or change the form of the
Common-wealth from <hi>Imperie</hi> to Tyranny, or
neglect the Laws eſtabliſhed by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Prince and People, to execute his
own pleaſure; in theſe and other Caſes which
might be named, if the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
joyn together to defend their ancient
and accuſtomed Liberty, Regiment and
Laws, they may not well be counted Rebels,—I
never denyed that the People might
preſerve the Foundation, Freedom and Form
of their Common-wealth, which they forepri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
when they firſt conſented to have a King.
I never ſaid that Kingdoms and Common-wealths
might not proportion their States, as
they thought beſt by their publick Laws,
which afterward the Princes themſelves may
not violate.—And in Kingdoms where
Princes bear Rule by the Sword, we do not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62157:60"/>
mean the Princes private Will againſt his
Laws, but his Precept derived from his Laws,
and agreeing with his Laws, which though it
be wicked, yet may it not be reſiſted by any
Subject with armed violence. Marry when
Princes offer their Subjects not Juſtice but
Force, and deſpiſe all Laws, and practiſe
their Luſts, not every or any private Man
may take the Sword to redreſs the Prince:
but if the Laws of the Land appoint the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as next the King, to aſſiſt him in doing
right, and with-hold him from doing wrong,
then be they licenſed by Mans Law, and ſo
not prohibited by Gods, to interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

of all Laws.</p>
               <p>And yet Biſhop <hi>Carlton Treat. of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Pag. 12.</hi> ſaith, <q>[This I obſerve the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe ſome of the Popes Flatterers of
late, as others alſo, to open a wide gap to
Rebellions, have written, That the Power
of Government by the Law of Nature is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62157:63"/>
in the Multitude.]</q> I conjecture that Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> was the chief Man whom he meant by
[others:] And his foreſaid Pupil and Friend
was far from being a Preſbyterian, as his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae
Speculum</hi> ſheweth; and yet it's well
known how cloſe he ſtuck to <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Party,
and how great a Man he was in Parliaments
for the Subjects Liberty, and the reſtraint of
Monarchy. And even Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> his laſt
Publiſher ſaith, <hi>Pag. 4.</hi> of his Life. <q>[This is
certain, that the ſtrength of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> was much decayed and undermined,
before it was openly battered, partly by
ſome ſuperfluous illegals and unauthorized
Innovations in Point of Ceremony, which
ſome Men affected to uſe in publick, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon others, which provoked People to
jealouſie and fury, even againſt things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
every Man judging truly, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of all publick Obedience ought to be
the publick Laws.☜ Partly by a ſupine
neglect in others, of the main Matters in
which the Kingdom of God, the peace of
Conſcience, and the Churches Happineſs, do
chiefly conſiſt; while they were immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent upon meer Formalities, and more
zealous for an outward conformity to thoſe
Shadows, than for that inward, or outward
conformity with Chriſt in Holy Hearts and
unblamable Lives, which muſt adorn true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.]</q>
To which he adds the Teſtimony of
Dr. <hi>Holſworth!</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62157:63"/>
So that it is a thing notorious and paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
that the Arminianiſm, Innovations,
and ſuppoſed exceſſes and exorbitances of one
part of the Prelatiſts, gave occaſion to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part (then accounted the Church and
the more Proteſtant) to vent their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and fear in many Parliaments, and at laſt
to take up Arms, and when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too weak, to invite the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
to their Aid, who fell at laſt into the
Hands of the Sectaries. And therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
or juſtifie none of the Parties; but thoſe
that ſay that the beginners of the War againſt
the King are guilty of his death, as well as
they that kill'd him, muſt confeſs that it was
the Prelatiſts, or they muſt be impudent: And
therefore I again adviſe you to forbear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Hooker</hi> and ſuch Conformiſts, and
call them firſt to repentance, who were firſt
(of the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> in taking up Arms againſt
the King.</p>
               <p>§. 34. It's well you diſclaim the Politicks of
<hi>Grotius:</hi> But what abundance more Authors
of Politicks could I name you that make the
<hi>Majestas Realis</hi> to be in the People, yea and
the Power of judging Kings. Such as <hi>Willius</hi>
(he whom Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to in
his <hi>Remains) Alſtedius,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;
and if you agree with me in diſliking
thoſe, do not own the ſame in <hi>Hooker,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prelatiſts.</p>
               <p>

§. 35. Becauſe you ſaid, <hi>[Who can chooſe
but nauſeate that way of Diſcipline, which ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
at renouncing War against the King:]</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you ro tell me what Diſcipline you mean?
You will not ſay <hi>Prelatical</hi> Diſcipline; If you
mean Preſbyterian, 1. I told you it was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy
which the preſent Non-conformiſts
offered to the King and Biſhops. 2. I deſired
you to peruſe the Confeſſions and Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Diſcipline of the Forreign Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and to tell me which words do deny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
ſuch War. And what ſay you to
this? why! firſt you deride the motion, as a
thing not to be required of you, and ſay their
Actions are quite contrary to their Confeſſions?
Will not your Conſcience mark here; 1. How
your own Pen doth acquit their <hi>Confeſſions,</hi>
and yet <hi>you nauſeate the way of Diſcipline that
startles,</hi> &amp;c. And where is <hi>the way of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
to be found</hi> but in thoſe <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> which
even the Accuſer now abſolveth? 2. And now
you lay it on <hi>Practice,</hi> and what's that, 1. to
the way of Diſcipline; 2. or to the <hi>whole Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
which you ſpeak to, or any one Man
whoſe Practice you have not proved ſuch as
you accuſe? And is your printed Clamour
come to this?</p>
               <p>§. 36. And what ſay you of <hi>the Practice
now?</hi> 1. You tell me of <hi>Davila.</hi> I pray next
go to <hi>Parſons</hi> Image of both Churches, and
to <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> where you ſhall find
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62157:64"/>
the Prelatiſts as deeply charged. And muſt
<hi>Davila</hi> a Papiſt be credited againſt Biſhop
<hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and many
other on the other ſide? And is not <hi>Davila</hi> a
falſe Hiſtorian? For inſtance, he falſely ſaith,
That <hi>Carpenter</hi> was kill'd in the Maſſacre, (who
dyed of the fright) and that <hi>Peter Ramus</hi>
(the Father of the Independents) was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is a falſe Forreigner and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
to be believed againſt the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?
I again refer you to the late notable
Vindication of the Forreign Preſbyterians in
<hi>France, Holland, Embden, Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. by
<hi>Pet. Moulin Jun.</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>Philanax
Anglicus:</hi> And yet his Father might well blame
them for ſome Inſtances as you cite him; For
as to the laſt Buſineſs at <hi>Saumurs</hi> and <hi>Rochel,</hi>
he was a noted and ſuffering Diſſenter from
that Party, and ſo were other Proteſtants, as
well as he.</p>
               <p>But one would think by your Progreſs, that
I had juſtified all the Wars or Actions of the
Preſbyterians, becauſe I told you that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts
begun the <hi>Engliſh</hi> War; which if you
would inſinuate, (or elſe you ſpeak not ſenſe)
you want either that underſtanding or that
ſincerity which beſeemeth a Hiſtorian and a
Divine.</p>
               <p>But if really you will ſtand to it, that their
<hi>way of Diſcipline</hi> is to be <hi>nauſeated,</hi> who are
<hi>guilty in practice</hi> of reſiſting Kings, who do
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62157:65"/>
you not ſpeak out then, that the Prelatical
Diſcipline is to be nauſeated, when you have
not ſpoken a word of ſenſe to diſprove the
aforeſaid Charge againſt the Prelatiſts? As to
your Margin; 1. I have no more to do with
<hi>Martyn</hi> than you have. 2. If you had any
thing to have juſtifyed your Calumny out of
<hi>T. C.</hi> or <hi>Travers,</hi> you ſhould have cited it;
for it's but a ſilly ſhift to ſet down their bare
Names. 3. And I will no further believe <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi>
or Sir <hi>Th. Aſton,</hi> than they prove what
they ſay, no more than your ſelf. And I have
reaſon for ſo ſaying.</p>
               <p>§. 37. Next you feign me to ſay, That <hi>[the
Divines, Presbyterian or Epiſcopal, medled lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with it;]</hi> whereas I had no ſuch word, but
on the contrary told you, <hi>[That the Divines on
both ſides were too guilty, if not the forwardest.]</hi>
And are you a fit Man to ſtate theſe matters in
print for Poſterity, and pour out ſuch Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
againſt other Men, that have not ſo
much patience or care as to heed what you
read in a Letter, or what you write in anſwer
to it? What uſe can ſuch Writings as theſe be
of, but to abuſe the ſimple? I only told you
the differences were Political and Legal, and
not Theological; but I ſaid not that Divines
medled not in them.</p>
               <p>§. 38. I did, as you ſay, deſire you to <hi>name
the Theological Differences,</hi> if you know any,
for I never did: And what ſay you to this?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62157:65"/>
would not any Reader here expect that you
ſhould have named ſome one difference? But
inſtead of that, you exclaim, <hi>[This is strange]</hi>
and you ask me, <hi>[Did I never hear of Dr.</hi>
Ferne, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dudley Digs?] yes, and of Mr.
<hi>Weldon,</hi> and <hi>Michael Hudſon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis
Netherſole,</hi> and more, and have long ago read
them all. And what of that? And I have
read <hi>Jo. Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi>
&amp;c. And what of all that? Why did you not
name the Theological Difference?—You
ſay, That it was called the <hi>Cauſe of God, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
&amp;c. Did you think that you ſpake to
the purpoſe, when you ſaid this? It was <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
materiae, finis &amp; effect us</hi> that they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it the <hi>Cauſe of Religion:</hi> They thought it
had been the liberation of their Church and
Country, and the defence of Religion againſt
Innovators. But what's that to the lawfulneſs
of taking up Arms? Is any Man ſo mad (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
an Epiſcopal Parliament) as to think
all War lawful againſt the King, which is <hi>for
Religion?</hi> Will a good end juſtifie ill means?
Your own Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi>
to prove, that in <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> by the <hi>higher
Powers</hi> was meant the Parliament-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if you had been a Man of conſideration,
would have clearly ſhewed you how it confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
your ſelf: That, and many Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
were agitated by Dr. Ferne, Mr. <hi>Digs,</hi>
and thoſe that anſwered them: Upon all which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62157:66"/>
it was agreed, as far as I know, that the <hi>Higher
Powers</hi> were not by <hi>Arms</hi> to be reſiſted. And
this is all the Theological part. But did you
think that they thought that <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> or other
Scriptures, did tell the World whether <hi>Caeſar</hi>
or the <hi>Senate</hi> was the higher Power? or which
is the higher Power in <hi>Venice, Germany, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Hungary, France, England,</hi> or any
Country in the World? Will you put the
King to prove all his Power from Scripture?
What ever you take it, I and all that ever I met
with, that were above the Rank of thoſe you
deſcribe by <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife, did take this to be a
Point of Policy and Law, and not of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
and that Scriptures tell us not who is the
Supream in every Republick, but ſuppoſing
that known, commands us not to reſiſt them.
And then comes in Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and ſaith
what is before cited for <hi>Lords and Commons</hi>
vindicating their Librerties; and then comes in
<hi>Hooker</hi> and tells us, That by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Legiſlation belongeth to the Body, and
that the King is dependent and ſubject to the
Body, and ſuch like. And many Divines took
up thoſe Opinions; and Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi> and others
were againſt them. But what of all this? Are
not theſe Controverſies in Law and Politicks,
though handled by Divines?</p>
               <p>§. 39. Your next ſay, That Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>
wrote on <hi>Jude,</hi> and note my in-advertency
that take no more notice of his Labours: And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62157:66"/>
I marvel more than you can do, that I never
heard of that Book before: Nor could hear
of it from any one, till he told me himſelf, that
he had long ago publiſhed ſome Sermons,
which he preached very young, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on <hi>Jude.</hi>
And that I was hereof ignorant I confeſs.</p>
               <p>§. 40. You ſay of your Citation of Dr.
<hi>Burges,</hi> That the Book is in the Hand of a
Friend; and you add, <hi>[Are you ſuch a</hi> Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luo
Liborum, <hi>and yet had you no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with theſe?] Anſw.</hi> I have read I think
all Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi>'s Writings, except thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Conformity before he turned. And I
read Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burges</hi> Book of Baptiſmal
Regeneration about 36 years ago; and I after
wrote ſomewhat againſt it, and Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> on that Subject; and ſince I was
familiar with the Author till near his death,
therefore I believe not that it was <hi>John Burges</hi>
that wrote that Book, but ſuppoſe you to be
much liker to be miſtaken than I. And unleſs
Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> wrote another Book of the
ſame Subject (which I ſhall alſo wonder that I
never heard of) I am as ſure you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as my Eyes and Acquaintance can make
me.</p>
               <p>§. 41. I told you I knew not one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that was not ready to ſwear that which
you feign the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Chorus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.
And you ask me, <hi>Why then did they flit
their Habitations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62157:67"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Did I not expreſly tell you why?
and was your diſingenuity at leiſure to fill
your Paper with the recital of an anſwered
Queſtion, that you might have opportunity
to vent your <hi>Latet aliquid?</hi> And here you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to diſpute the Caſe (Platonically.) But I
cannot perſwade my ſelf to diſpute it with
one that no better underſtandeth it, or careth
what he ſaith; only I anſwer your Queſtions.
Q. 1. <hi>What was the ſum of that Oath, was it
not plainly and directly againſt taking up Arms?
Anſw. 1.</hi> And <hi>is that all</hi> the Oath; or is there
<hi>not a</hi> Clauſe for our <hi>Church-Government?</hi> 2. If
ſo, why is the firſt Clauſe the <hi>Sum</hi> of the
whole? 3. Or need my Conſcience ſtick at
nothing in an Oath, but what you will call the
<hi>Sum?</hi> O happy quieter of Conſciences that
fear an Oath! Q. 2. <hi>Did it any way hinder Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Mens ſpeaking, or others peaceably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning
for ſuch reformation as is neceſſary?
Anſw. 1.</hi> You ſhall not draw me to ſay, that
an alteration of Dioceſanes or Lay-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
is neceſſary, no not <hi>ad bene eſſe Eccleſiae;</hi>
for I know the Law is againſt it. But if I
thought ſo, is <hi>Petitioning no Endeavouring?</hi> Say
ſo, and ſhew that you care not what you ſay,
to draw down an Oath: And muſt not I ſwear,
That I <hi>[will not any time endeavour any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?]</hi>
And ſhall I ſwear <hi>univerſally</hi> againſt
<hi>all endeavour,</hi> and mentally reſerve <hi>[excepting
petitioning, ſpeaking,</hi> &amp;c.] Are Oaths things to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62157:67"/>
be ſwallowed thus in ſport? And will wiping
my Mouth thus make me innocent? Q. 3. <hi>[Were
not thoſe who were commiſſioned to administer it,
ready to declare the ſenſe of it?] Anſw. 1.</hi>
Where did the King and Parliament give them
power to declare the ſenſe? 2. Is it not all the
Juſtices in <hi>England</hi> that are authorized (two
at once) to adminiſter it? And do you know
what all the Juſtices in <hi>England</hi> are ready to
do? 3. Are you ſure they will <hi>all agree</hi> in the
ſenſe? or muſt we take it in ſeveral ſenſes, if
ſeveral Men ſeverally expound it? 4. What
Law or Divinity teacheth you to take an Oath
in the ſenſe of an inferior Magiſtrate that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
it you, who is not by the Law impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
to interpret it; nor is ſo much as made a
Judge of the ſenſe, but of my Fact of taking
or refuſing it? If this way be lawful, what if
a Papiſt could find a Juſtice that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Oath of Supremacy for the Pope?
May he therefore take it? Is not the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
the univerſal Expoſitor of his own Law;
except for the Judicial deciſion of a particular
Caſe which he committeth to his Judges? or
can a Juſtice diſpenſe with equivocation in
Oaths, and not a Pope? 5. I was but once yet
ſent to Goal for refuſing that Oath, and then
I told them that I refuſed it not, but deſired
the Juſtices to tell me the ſenſe of it, which
they refuſed, and ſaid I muſt take it according
to the plain words, or importance of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62157:68"/>
Phraſe, (which is the truth.) And yet you
ſay, <hi>Are they not ready,</hi> &amp;c. What wonder if
Oaths go ſmoothly down, where there are ſuch
Reſolvers? and it Books revile them that will
not ſwear?</p>
               <p>But here enſueth as confident a Rhetorical
Invective againſt thoſe that ſcruple this kind
of ſwearing, as if Logick firſt had done its
part, or at leaſt one word of ſenſe had been
ſpoken to ſatisfie the Conſcience of a Man that
would not be ſtigmatized with <hi>PER.</hi> And
we muſt ſwear without any ſmoother Oyl to
get it down, than ſuch talk as this, or elſe we
muſt go with you for Men of <hi>hot and feavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Brains.</hi> But <hi>Swearers</hi> we find have a <hi>Heat</hi>
of their own kind, tranſcending others: Such
as your Book and other Mens Actions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>§. 42. I told you, [If you would put out
the other Clauſes of the Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſhould
ſee how few would ſtick at that of taking
Arms againſt the King.] Here you ſay, <hi>[Why
do I lay this on you,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> But Sir, you
might have underſtood my Inference: Why
then do you pretend a falſe Reaſon of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal,
when we tell you the true Reaſon? If
you cannot put out the Clauſe which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
you could forbear to Calumniate us of
Traiterous Meanings, as if we ſtuck at another
Clauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62157:68"/>
§. 43. When I deſired the impoſing of no
other Oaths on us to Prelates or Chancellors,
than were impoſed or uſed for many hundred
years in the Church, you tell us, That <hi>[it
may be ſchiſmatical to stand up too stifly for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Diſpenſations as to the Modes of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Policy,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> As ſome things not
commanded in Modes of Church Policy are
lawful, ſo ſome things are <hi>unlawful;</hi> or elſe you
may ſwear to the Pope as well as to Dioceſanes.
And is it lawful to ſwear to the <hi>unlawful</hi> part
think you? what that is I will not diſpute with
you. 2. All that is <hi>lawful</hi> to be <hi>done,</hi> is not to
be ſworn to, and made ſo neceſſary, as that a
Church or Nation ſhall ſwear <hi>never</hi> to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any alteration</hi> of it, when a Change of
Divine Providence can turn many lawful things
into unlawful. 3. But are we the grea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Antiquity, and yet muſt we have Oaths,
even publick Oaths in the Church it ſelf, and
Matters ſo neceſſary, as that Miniſters muſt be
ſworn to them, which the Church never knew
for 800 years. Well! plead for Antiquity
when it ſerves your turn, and when it makes
againſt you cry it down. 4. If you will (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many others that have written, how
the Pope got Princes under his feet, by
impoſing Oaths upon the Clergy) read but
what Biſhop <hi>Carlton</hi> ſaith of Juriſdiction,
<hi>Chap. 7.</hi> and you will ſee one Reaſon why
we are loth to ſwear to the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62157:69"/>
as totally unalterable, and that before
the States.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 44. About Lay-Chancellors exerciſing
the Spiritual Power of the Keys, and our
ſwearing never to endeavour any alteration of
it, you ſay,</hi> [Me thinks a Perſon of your inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
ſhould reſt ſatisfied with that modest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of our Rubrick, concerning the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is there one Syllable in that Preface
for juſtifying Lay-Chancellors uſe of the Keys?
What need is there of Ingenuity to ſwallow an
Oath upon ſuch ſatisfaction as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you add,</hi> [Do they do this of themſelves
as Lay-men, or do they not? You ſee it is eaſie
to puſh with the Horns, and to evince that you
are either ignorant or abſurd: But I ſhall only
remember you, that Lay-Chancellors excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
not as Lay-men; but by vertue of thoſe
Surrogates who are Delegates for this purpoſe,
originally by the Biſhop himſelf. This abstracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not too hard for you to conceive.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have <hi>feaveriſh</hi> and <hi>skittiſh Brains</hi>
indeed, if all this Oyl will not get down
Oaths. But come Sir, Horns againſt Horns is
an ordinary way of combating. Theſe Lay-Chancellors
either are Clergy-men, or they
are not: If they are not, (as they are not)
then they that excommunicate not as Lay-men,
do it <hi>as Clergy-men,</hi> or not; if not as Lay-men,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62157:69"/>
nor as <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> as what then? If as
<hi>Clergy-men,</hi> then they that are no Clergy-men
may excommunicate <hi>as Clergy-men,</hi> or not: If
not, all the Fat is in the Fire ſtill: If yea, then
either they may act as in a Perſon which they
have not, or not: If not, yet we cannot
ſwear: If yea, then you are puſh'd up to a
Stone Wall, and muſt deny two Principles:
1. That <hi>operari ſequitur eſſe:</hi> 2. That <hi>a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
est ſecundi adjecti, ad negationem est ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii
adjecti, valet argumentum: Qui non eſt Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,
non operatur qua Clericus.</hi> 3. To which
I may add a Moral Principle; <hi>Non est men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have heard before now of Preaching,
and other officiating <hi>per ſe aut per alium.</hi> But
let us horn it with you a little further: Either
the exerciſe of the Keys by excommunication
is an Act proper to the Sacred Paſtoral Office,
or it is not: If it be not, then Preaching,
Praying, Sacraments, or ſome other Actions,
are proper to it, or not: If <hi>none</hi> be proper to
it, we are at the Wall of a Contradiction, for
then it is no Sacred Office; but if ſomething
be proper to it, that ſomething is more Sacred
than the Power of Excommunication, or not:
If not, then we are again at the Wall of a
Contradiction: If they be equally Sacred, they
are equally proper to the Sacred Paſtoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
If yea, then <hi>Argumentum valet ab opere
ad Officium,</hi> the Office of a Biſhop as ſuch is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62157:70"/>
leſs Sacred than the Office of a Preſbyter: And
either it is one half a Biſhops Work that may be
done by a Lay-man, or all! If all, (Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Juriſdiction or Cenſure) then a Lay-man
may be a Biſhop, and a Biſhop a Lay-man;
and ſo Epiſcopacy no Sacred Office. If
half, 1. Either that half is included in the Keys
of the Kingdom, given to Paſtors, or not:
If not, then we are at a Wall; for, 1. It will
prove no part of their Office or Power (as
Biſhops or Paſtors.) 2. The word Keys will
never be intelligible, if it include not the
Power of Binding and Looſing; but if that
half be included in the Power of the Keys,
then either Chriſt, when he committed the
Keys to the Clergy, did diſtinguiſh in that <hi>one
word,</hi> and make one Act of the Keys proper to
the Clergy, and not another, or he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,
but make the ſaid Keys wholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to them: If the former, what is the proof?
where is the diſtinction found? there is none
in the Words: If the latter, then <hi>habetur quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum;</hi>
Excommunication is not to be done by
a Lay-man; or elſe he made all the Keys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to the Laity; and then Baptiſm
(which is the firſt Exerciſe of them Politically)
is communicable, and then there is no Sacred
Office.</p>
               <p>Again, a Biſhop can excommunicate by a
Preſbyter, as well as by a Lay-man, or not:
If not, we are at a Wall: If yea, then a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62157:70"/>
may do the Work of a Biſhop, if a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
pleaſe; and if ſo, then he may ordain
alſo, if a Biſhop pleaſe; for why may not one
Key be exerciſed <hi>per alium,</hi> as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
and if a Biſhop pleaſe, Preſbyters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
is valid.</p>
               <p>Moreover, either the Biſhop may commit
this Power to a Lay-Chancellor only <hi>pro hac
vice,</hi> or ſtatedly as an Office. If the firſt,
farewell Chancellors who have an Office of it.
If the latter, then either to make a Man a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
is to make him a Biſhop, or not: If yea,
then ſpeak out, and call him not a Lay-man,
but let him be ordained and conſecrated; if
not, we are at a Wall again, and we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are the ſame
things that have the ſame true definitions.
For, (do but ſuppoſe the other half the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
Work (Ordination) alſo to be done
<hi>per alium</hi> in a ſtated way of Office, and he
that doth it will have the ſame definition; that
is, one in ſtated Office, authorized to ordain
and exerciſe the Keys of Juriſdiction, or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and Excommunication: For the Office
is nothing elſe but Authority and Obligation
to do the proper Acts. In a word, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials,
<hi>circa Sacra,</hi> or Accidentals, may be
done <hi>per alium,</hi> (as to call the People to
Church, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Acts proper to the Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(of Biſhop or Preſbyter) may not! O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
1. Ordination or Conſecration cannot
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62157:71"/>
be proved to be an entering into a Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
becauſe it tyeth us but to that which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be tyed to without it; 2. or the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which may be exerciſed <hi>per alium</hi> by a
Lay-man, is not Sacred; and Epiſcopacy may
be tranſlated into the Hands of the Laity, or
rather is a Lay-Office already.</p>
               <p>But what mean you by ſaying, That they
<hi>excommunicate by vertue of thoſe Surrogates,</hi>
&amp;c. Do you mean that <hi>Surrogates give</hi> the
Chancellor his Power? I knew not ſo much
before, nor believe it now; or doth the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
repreſent the Surrogate, and do it in his
name? I am content to be ſtill ſo ignorant
and abſurd, as to wiſh you had more conſulted
the Honour of your Knowledge, than to talk
at theſe rates. In my opinion, of the two you
had taken a more plauſible way, if with your
Brethren you had pretended, that taking down
Chancellors (who are the ſtated Governours)
is <hi>no alteration</hi> in the Church Government; or
elſe that the ordinary Prieſt, who ſometime
<hi>pro forma</hi> pronounceth the Sentence which
the Chancellor decreeth, is the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Abſolver; and ſo ſay that a Preſbyter
exerciſeth the Epiſcopal Office, rather than a
Lay-man, (if we were not more jealous of
the Preſbyters claim of right to it, than of the
Lay-mans.) I pray take ſome of theſe ways
the next time; or elſe do not rant too hotly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe skittiſh hot-brained Men, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62157:71"/>
make a queſtion of ſwearing as boldly, and as
deeply as you expect them. And teach them
better than by Rhetorical Flouriſhes, how to
confute the Seperatiſts, that ſay, <hi>[A Perjured
Clergy is not to be communicated with: But,</hi> &amp;c.]
If I had no better anſwer for them than what
you afford me, I would leave them to ſome
that are more able to confute them: For with
your Weapons I am unable.</p>
               <p>And your ſaying they do it by vertue of the
Surrogates, makes me queſtion by how many
deſcents a Biſhops Power may be committed
to others. Doth the Biſhop commit it to the
Surrogate, and the Surrogate to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and the Chancellors to the Official? And
what if it come down yet ten degrees more?
Is it a Lay-work, or a-Sacred Clergy-work at
laſt, when it is <hi>per alium, qui per alium, qui
per alium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall ſay, that by the Surrogate you
did mean either any Prieſt that doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Sentence, or the Pariſh Prieſt that
proclaimeth it in the Church; remember that
it is neither Miniſterial pronouncing, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
proclaiming or reading it that we ſpeak
of, but Judicial authoritative decreeing it;
and that the Chancellor doth not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
decretively by any vertue of the Prieſts
pronuntiation or reading, which both follow
after, and are done miniſterially in obedience to
him: And that the Cryer that readeth the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62157:72"/>
Kings Proclamations is no Magiſtrate, much
leſs one by vertue of whom the King doth
make them.</p>
               <p>§. 45. <hi>You add,</hi> [I'le warrant, you have
more kindneſs for Lay-Elders, if they were
joyned with you in things Sacred: As Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
Admiſſions to the Sacrament, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Church.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your Warrants are ſo ready and raſh,
that I know not well what it is that you may
not warrant at theſe rates; or elſe you would
not have warranted this to one that hath wrote
ſo much againſt Lay-Elders, and never had
any thing to do with them, (as Men that med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with any part of the Sacred Office, though
Lay-Magiſtrates and Aged Men I honour.) I
will not trouble the Churches Peace either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Lay-Elders or Lay-Chancellors; but I
will be ſworn to neither of them as Vſers of
the Keys.</p>
               <p>But you think <hi>this is but a Gnat in my way;</hi>
ſo wide is your Swearing-ſwallow, and ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

               </p>
               <p>§. 46. <hi>You ſay,</hi> [The Camel or <hi>Belzebub</hi> is

               <p>

I ſhall bleſs my ſelf from ſuch a Defender as
you, if you can defend no better than you do
ſwearing to Church-Government by Lay-Chancellors.</p>
               <p>§. 47. <hi>You ſay,</hi> [You are kinder to Biſhops,
for where there is one, I ſuppoſe you wiſh there
were many hundreds; and if this were allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we that are <hi>Minorum Gentium</hi> (as <hi>to</hi> our

then it may be, you and I might in ſome time of

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> O for one Grain of ingenuity and
modeſty in this kind of Men! The Debater
reproacheth us in print for <hi>blowing ſo long upon
our Eccleſiaſtical Dignities before we refuſed them;</hi>
When I delayed my Anſwer but one day; and
there were but three of us that had the offer
of Biſhopricks, and two of Deanaries, that
ever I heard of: And <hi>one</hi> did almoſt as ſoon
accept it, as I refuſed it: And the third (Mr.
<hi>Calamy)</hi> and the two other, only delayed till
they ſaw whether the Kings Declaration about
Eccleſiaſtical Affairs would be eſtabliſhed by an
Act; and refuſed when they ſaw it at end.
And I was ſo afraid of the odious Crime of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
that I was fain to give the Reaſons
of my refuſal, as eaſily as I could, in writing to
the Lord-Chancellor, leſt it ſhould favour of
undervaluing the favour offered. And I ſcarce
ever talk'd of it to any to this day, unleſs in
anſwer to a queſtion, leſt I ſhould ſeem to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62157:73"/>
unthankful; yet can we not have reſt in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
for this ſort of Men! while all my fear
was, leſt my refuſal would be too diſpleaſing,
and caſt me under more diſcountenance than
before; ſometime I hear out of the Pulpit,
(from a grave Doctor known to you) when
no Non-conformiſt but my ſelf is preſent, that
<hi>the reaſon why we diſlike Biſhops is, becauſe we
cannot be Biſhops our ſelves,</hi> (and yet I ceaſed
not hearing the Accuſer:) And here you Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtically
inſinuate ſome ſuch thing; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
me again to wiſh for one Grain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
in you.</p>
               <p>§. 48. You add, <hi>[Magis &amp; Minus non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant

Spoon be a Spoon if it were as big as a Church,

and the General would be the ſole Ruler of the

Is a Chriſtian Society united for Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

Enjoy your Logick: I am contented
with the diſhonour of being no Graduate in

               <p>
                  <hi>§. 49. You ſay,</hi> [If Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> were now
alive, he would give you but ſmall thanks for
preſſing his Model of Epiſcopacy, (if his) now
the King and Laws are restored, which he
only calculated, as that which could be born by the
iniquity of the later times.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> That the Model was his, he told
me with his own Tongue. 2. That he thought
better of it than of that which you ſet againſt
it, and did not offer it as a leſs deſirable thing,
appeareth by the Reaſons which he giveth for
it, from Antiquity, and from the nature of the
Paſtoral Office, to which he ſaith, a part in
the Keys or Diſcipline belongeth: And he
took this to be the true ancient frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62157:74"/>
uſed for many hundred year after
Chriſt, and to be the true means of our union:
And he told me, that he offered it his Majeſty
before the War, and it was not accepted, and
after the War, and then it might have paſſed.
And in conference with me he came lower than
that Model, as the <hi>Minimum</hi> that might ſerve
for our agreement, which I mentioned pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to the Parliament, in my Sermon the
day before the Kings Reſtoration was voted by
them, (printed by their Order.) And he told
me, <hi>That moderate Men would unite on thoſe
terms, but he had tryed that others would not.</hi>
2. But what is there in that Model that is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
now? Is one tittle taken from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
or Arch-biſhops Honour? Is one farthing
taken by it from their Eſtates? Is any of their
Power or Negative Voice taken away? or is
not the ſtated Miniſtry only made their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
inſtead of a few uncertain Preſbyters,
that muſt be preſent when they ordain, and
inſtead of the preſent Form of ſome Courts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> O humble Clergy-men, that take this
for more intolerable than all the contrary evils
that we undergo! Diſhonour not our Church
ſo as to tell Forreigners, That to be <hi>reduced to
ſuch an Epiſcopal Government by Biſhops with
their Presbyters, as was commonly in uſe for ſix
hundred years at least, as that which could be
born by the iniquity of the latter times, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be born by the Clergy now, if it pleaſed His
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62157:74"/>
Majesty ſo to order it:</hi> But miſtake me not;
I only ſpeak of <hi>Uſhers</hi> Model: I do not now
ſpeak againſt the Government, nor plead for
a Change; for the Law forbiddeth me.</p>
               <p>As to what you ſay concerning <hi>Vſhers Notes
on</hi> Ignatius <hi>concerning the diviſion of</hi> Aſia, I
ſuppoſe you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>His Notes on</hi>
Ignatius, <hi>and his Diſcourſe of the Proconſular</hi>
Aſia, which are two Books, (if you knew the
Books you talk of:) But I know very well that
he ſuppoſed Epiſcopacy to have been before
the ſecond Century; but the queſtion is, what
ſort of Epiſcopacy? and that Queſtion his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
doth reſolve.</p>
               <p>§. 50. To all that you talk after on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I cannot find in my heart to trouble my
ſelf with any other Anſwer, than to tell you,
that all you ſay is utterly impertinent to thoſe
you write of, and ſheweth that you do not at
all underſtand the Caſe of the preſent Non-Conformiſts,
nor the ſtate of the Controverſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 51. But about ſwearing Obedience to the
Biſhops, you ſay;</hi> 1. It is but in <hi>Licitis &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtis:</hi>
2. That of old Presbyters have been obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to their Biſhops under the Penalty of an
Anathema.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> The Queſtion is not only of <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to obey them,</hi> but <hi>ſwearing never to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any alteration of Church-Government.</hi>
2. The King himſelf is to be obeyed but <hi>in
licitis &amp; honeſtis:</hi> And muſt we be ſworn as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62157:75"/>
much to the Clergy as to the King? 3. Thoſe
that think the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Species of Dioceſanes to
be unlawful, take them to be <hi>quoad jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
Uſurpers: And they ſay, they would not
ſwear to obey the Pope <hi>in licitis &amp; honest is,</hi>
nor <hi>Cromwel</hi> if he were alive, leſt it prove
Treaſon againſt the true Sovereign, to ſwear
Obedience to an Uſurper, even <hi>in licitis &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestis.</hi>
And how impertinently do you ſpeak
of <hi>Presbyters Obedience, ſub poena Anathematis,</hi>
when I only ſpake of <hi>antecedent ſwearing</hi> to
them. (Nay not <hi>to them,</hi> but to Men of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Office,</hi> though of the <hi>ſame name.)</hi> Are
we not now under Anathema's enough in the
Canons if we obey not? Yet how little have
you heard the Non-Conformiſts ſay againſt
thoſe Canons theſe eleven years? (I mean ſuch
as have ever publickly agitated their Cauſe.)
If <hi>you Anathematize</hi> me <hi>unjustly,</hi> it is none of
<hi>my ſin:</hi> But if I <hi>ſwear unjustly,</hi> it is my ſin,
I can <hi>obey</hi> many a Man that I cannot <hi>ſwear obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to:</hi> He that taketh away my Coat, may
have my Cloak alſo; and if you bid me go a Mile
for you, I may rather go two, than do worſe:
And we muſt ſubmit our ſelves to one another;
but yet I will not ſwear Obedience to all that I
may thus obey. And I may obey a Juſtice or
Conſtable as my duty; and yet not ſwear to
the perpetuity of their Office, and that before
the Kings: But if Obedience under pain of
Anathema ſerved above a thouſand years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62157:75"/>
ſwearing it, why may it not ſerve turn
now? Are new Oaths neceſſary to be ſworn by
us to the Clergy, which never were neceſſary
till of late? You mean not I perceive, that
Antiquity or Univerſality ſhall be the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of your Church or Impoſitions: Nor to

<hi>in ſpecie,</hi> nor be under ſuch Bonds only
as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſpeaks for, without ſuch Oaths as

for you to cite the words of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 52. You ſay, <hi>[Mr.</hi> Cartwright <hi>wrangled
himſelf at last into Conformity.] Anſw.</hi> It is
not well done of you to write Hiſtorical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
ſo boldly: You have no way to come
off, but either to ſay ſome body told you ſo,
or that by Conformity you mean that he ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
not from the Pariſh Churches, which he
never did, or that he was favourable to kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Sacrament, and not peremptory againſt
the Surplice, into none of which he wrangled
but ſtudyed himſelf: And, ſaith <hi>Ameſius,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
his moderation about the Surplice:
But did he conform to <hi>Dioceſanes,</hi> to <hi>Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi>
to <hi>the Oath of Canonical Obedience, to the
Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. How is the World abuſed by falſe
Hiſtorians? Thus one of my Antagoniſts
chargeth him (after <hi>Suttliffe)</hi> with acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with <hi>Hackets</hi> Villany, and other ſuch
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62157:76"/>
things, from which he ſo fully vindicateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a Manuſcript of his own, which I have
by me, (given me by old Mr. <hi>Simeon Aſh)</hi> as
may make the Reader wonder at the harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
front of Calumny?</p>
               <p>§. 53. When you ſay, [you <hi>will ſecure me]</hi>
about the Oath, I have no confidence in your
ſecurity, till I ſee it to be better back'd, than
your bare word with a fallacious unlike ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Simile. when I muſt ſubſcribe and ſwear,
That <hi>[I will not at any time endeavour any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Government in this Army, Colledge,
Vniverſity or Corporation, nor of the State,]</hi>
putting them conjunct with the State, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

things moſt different.</p>
               <p>§. 54. Who is it that hath done moſt <hi>to drive
People from the Pariſh Churches,</hi> I am ſatisfied
by experience. And whether all ſuch Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>are ſuch Children of Hell</hi> as you deſcribe,
I ſhall leave to a more wiſe and righteous
Judge.</p>
               <p>§. 55. To write a full and juſt defence of
that Non-conformity, which I own according

ANSWER
TO
Mr. Baxter's third Letter.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu lay a very ſandy Foundation in
your very firſt words; <hi>you foretell
(ſay you) how little good my writing
will do you; yet the Vindication of Truth is an
End ſufficient to invite me to bestow a few Lines
upon you.</hi> Do you call five Sheets a few Lines?
Are theſe written to vindicate the Truth? Yet
I muſt tell a Man of your gravity, (though with
bluſhing) that Truth has no communion with
Falſhood, nor Light with Darkneſs. Where
did I <hi>foretell you,</hi> that <hi>your writing ſhould do
me but little good?</hi> I have told you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that if you could evince your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
<hi>that Conformity is abſolutely ſinful;</hi> I
would quit my ſtation, and come over into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62157:77"/>
your Camp. Nay, when you had inform'd
me, (as to ſome Paſſages in the <hi>Savoy</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference)
I return'd you my thanks. Is not
this an inauſpicious and ominous Preſage, what
is like to follow? A Line crook'd at hand,
will never be ſtraight, though drawn (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
<hi>in infinitum.</hi> Speak the truth your
ſelf, before you accuſe me for an <hi>unworthy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
of the Truth.</hi> What delight had I, think
you, to ruſh into the midſt of your Pikes?
and to put my Hand into an Hornets Neſt?
But only to extricate Truth, and redeem it
(as thoſe <hi>Argonauts</hi> did the Golden Fleece)
from the midſt of waking Dragons; that it
may be try'd whether <hi>I and others do ſin in
Conforming,</hi> by the dint of Scripture and ſound
Reaſon. Some would call this a generous
Enterprize proceeding from tenderneſs; but
you call it <hi>an unworthy oppoſing of Truth; coming
from Calumny, and an hardened Front.</hi> One
Grain or Filing of Truth is more precious to
me than all the Gold of Ophir; if it lay in the
bottom of the Sea, I had rather fetch it thence,
than all the Pearls and Coral, which the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<hi>Indians</hi> venture for with ſo much hazard.
No Man can do me a greater favour, than to
reduce me from any by-way of Errour. <hi>Et Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium
meum impliſſe arbitror, ſi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
meus aliquos homines ab errori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
liberatos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lactantius de Opificio, Ca. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ad Iter Coeleste di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexerit.</hi>
Who would have thought but that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62157:78"/>
you who affirm, <hi>that Conformity is ſimply ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
ſhould have brought ſome clear Texts of
Scripture to prove this, or ſhewn ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
divine Law which is violated hereby?
So you might have brought the Controverſie
to an Iſſue. This had been the moſt dexterous
courſe, to have overthrown the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Principle whereon I ſtand; which is,
That I owe ſubmiſſion to the Ordinances and
Conſtitutions of my lawful Governours, ſo
far as they are ſuitable to, or not repugnant
or contrariant to the Word of God. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
hereof, you write large Encomiums, and
Panegyricks on the Non-conformiſts, reproach
the preſent Preachers, ſtumble at <hi>Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Lay-Chancellors,</hi> and the <hi>Oath of not taking
up Arms,</hi> yet in none of theſe will you take
up your ſtanding, by ſaying this or the other
is abſolutely ſinful: So that you are ſtill wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Breach, cutting out new Work, and
putting up new Game; which is nothing elſe
but a rambling from the firſt Subject of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute:
Yet I muſt follow you, or rather be
drag'd and hail'd after you, as the Serpents
Head in the Fable, when the Tail had the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and conduct of it. Only let me tell you,
whereas you complain of my <hi>Rhetorical Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
I wiſh you were liable to the ſame Guilt;
for then you would not write ſo much with ſo
much eaſe, if you did but ſlick and poliſh your
Lines as you go.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:62157:78"/>
§. 1. What a wonder of ſelf-ignorance is it,
that the Author of the <hi>Perſwaſive</hi> ſhould draw
up the Flood-gates of Sarcaſtical ſcorn upon ſo
many and ſuch Men, and yet be ſo ſenſible of
a drop of just reproof?</p>
               <p>Had you been train'd up in <hi>Alexanders</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
you might have felt his diſcipline for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather than fighting, for giving a Book
hard words, when you ſhould have confuted
it with convincing Arguments; or had you
been brought up at the feet of ſome <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
you might have learn'd, that a general Charge
is no ſufficient Anſwer, and that a Book cannot
be faulty, as you make it, when the Pages are
not ſo; as a Man is not leprous, when all his
Members are whole and ſound. I ſhould not
fear to lay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf on his back, if
it were enough to nick-name his Writings with
ſome unmanly taunt. I am not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
that my Book is innocent, in that you
(though you ſpeak big) deal as kindly with it
as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> when he hid
himſelf by the Stone <hi>Ezel,</hi> you ſhoot your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
on this ſide and on that; but you have
taken more care than to hit it. I might well
complain <hi>of your Drops, (as you call them)</hi>
for they made me to ſmart, as if there had
been Poiſon in them. Can you blame me for
laying them before you, that you may ſee, if
not bluſh at their malignant Aſpect; and if
one <hi>drop</hi> be ſo painful, what if you ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62157:79"/>
pour one of your <hi>ſpoonfuls as big as a Church
upon me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Title of <hi>Self-ignorance</hi> which you
apply to me, I have taken that up, and put it
into my Pocket. We'l raiſe no duſt about
that; only I muſt obſerve, 'tis hard to be
Head of a Party, and to be humble, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
contemptuous ſcorn towards thoſe that
ſtand in their way, and do not vail their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
to ſuch Popular Rabbies.</p>
               <p>§. 2. After ſuch a Book, you would not be
ſaid to traduce the Presbyterians, as if you wrote
you know not what.</p>
               <p>I well knew what I wrote, for I never named
them in that whole Book: Yet if they be
guilty of Non-conformity and Diſobedience,
(in our Caſe I make but little difference 'twixt
theſe) I mean them. However, your Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to a particular Rank of Men, of what
was ſpoken to the Non-conformiſts in general,
is a tranſgreſſion from the Laws of Diſcourſe.
Who gave you Commiſſion to make an Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of that which lay in Common? or to
limit my meaning without Authority from
my words? You cannot be ignorant that there
are other Non-conformiſts beſides theſe that
are Claſſical, and ſuch that not long ſince were
the more predominant, and ſuch that will not
conform now to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet
could then dance after the Pipes of thoſe grand
Maſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:62157:79"/>
There were but few who were not then
<hi>tantum non</hi> Independents; and are they all
now of a ſudden become <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> ſure
they are like the Elements, which agree in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
qualities, they are eaſily exchanged one
into another.</p>
               <p>§. 3. When I had opened your strange deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in calling for our Reaſons of Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
which you knew we must not publiſh, you
can neither hide your diſingenuity, nor well
confeſs it.</p>
               <p>Conviction, you know, muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Confeſſion; <hi>you ſay indeed you have
opened my strange dealing;</hi> but if what
you hitherto ſaid <hi>be called opening,</hi> 'tis
like the publiſhing of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Phyſicks,
<hi>Editum, &amp; non Editum.</hi> What you <hi>have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened</hi>
is ſtill abſtruſe and myſtical to me. <hi>Is
it strange dealing, and diſingenious, to call for
the Reaſons of Non-conformity? ſince you ſay
you cannot conform without ſin?</hi> Is it diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
to learn of you where the ſin lies, that
we may avoid it? I know not to this day
why you may <hi>not publiſh ſuch Reaſons:</hi> I am
ſure you take liberty to publiſh things of as
dangerous conſequence; yet you would make
Men believe that you muſt not write on this
Subject, leſt you <hi>ſhould traduce the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
yet you dare traduce the Writ <hi>de Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato
Capiendo,</hi> in the difference 'twixt
the Magiſtrates and the Church-Paſtors, <hi>P. 19,
27, 39, 40, 41, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62157:80"/>
Alas! the Church-Cenſurers, without the
Civil Arm, are but <hi>Brutum fulmen;</hi> yet that
Writ is incorporated into our Law. Is it not
better that the Civil Magiſtrate ſhould take
the excommunicated Perſon in hand, than that
he ſhould be delivered over unto Satan and
viſible Judgments; which in the Primitive
Times followed <hi>Anathema,</hi> and <hi>Maranatha?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Once more,</hi> you dare joyn Popery and Church-tyranny
together, and 'its eaſie to diſcern who
you mean by Church-tyrants. <hi>You dare ſpeak</hi>
against a lofty Faction, that perſwade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that there must be no King any longer than
their Dominion is upheld: Such as ſhall twist
the very grandure of their Function, by Oaths,
into the Constitution of the State. Tell me no
more that I am diſingenious in deſiring your
Reaſons of Non-conformity; for then you ſhould
traduce Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 4.</hi> In my laſt I nam'd ſome palpable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions;

'Tis like a Female Impotency, to reſolve to

This is like <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orſon</hi> and <hi>Knights
Errant,</hi> that boaſt of Battels and Victories in
ſuch Fields where they never drew Sword, and
ſlew ſuch Enemies who never were <hi>in rerum

this muſt not paſs for a culpable Contradiction;
ſhew me any one, and you ſhall have another
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62157:81"/>
Anſwer; in the mean time your Atchievments

               <p>You deal craftily in ſpeaking interrogatively,

               <p>Some Lines before <hi>you accus'd me of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

               <p>§. 5. I had ſaid that of thoſe 1800 ſilent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
how many of them have much more
learning than your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books have taught
them? <hi>You reply,</hi> Do you mean good Mr. <hi>Sam.
Hilderſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brian,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Wilſby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baldwin</hi> Sen', or
Mr. <hi>Spilſbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have reckon'd up ſeveral of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but not all, if you would put me upon
the proof of my words, you ſhould have
given me leave to be my own Accountant: It
is Anſwer enough to your arguing; you have
rekon'd without your Hoſt. I could give you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62157:81"/>
another Liſt of ſuch Men that have leap'd out
of their mechanical Shops into the Pulpit. If
theſe had learning enough to paſs your Hands
in Ordination, yet were they well examin'd,
they would ſcarce befound fit to teach a petty
School, or be Interpreters to ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Perſons you mention, I have as
much eſteem for them, as you can have; but
not for their Non-conformity; yet for their
gravity, ſobriety, learning, peaceableneſs.
May not I ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of
the Faithful, and <hi>David</hi> a Man after Gods
own Heart? though the one was puſillanimous
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the other had his falls? May
not I ſay that <hi>Venus</hi> was beautiful, though ſhe
had her Mole? But this is a uſual Stratagem
with you, to poſſeſs particular Perſons with
an opinion, that I detract from them, though
I named them not. As this is bad arguing,
—<hi>Syllogizare ex particulari,</hi> ſo 'tis worſe
Morality. Thoſe which I intended have your
ſuffrage. <hi>You had rather hear a meer</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Divine, than an</hi> Hebrew <hi>or</hi> Syriack <hi>Sot.</hi> You

a queſtion whether you are more for Blew
Aprons or the Prieſthood. What Fanatick
could have ſpoken more ſlightly of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
than you have done? <hi>'Tis no very

though never ſo near, yet could not find out

               <p>Had you been planted and cultivated in

They had need agree with ſome ſuch as Dr.

I have been acquainted with the Studies, and
therein with the prepoſterous Method of ſome
amongſt you. They began with <hi>Calvin</hi> and
ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Divines, and ſo read
downwards; but when their minds have been
prepoſſeſſed with prejudicate thoughts towards
our Government, and Diſcipline, then (if
urged thereto) they have ſtep'd back many
hundred years, and read ſome of the Fathers.
But alas! It has been only to wreſt and deprave
them; to weed ſomething out of them,

to find a Man that hath the abilities of the
lowest ſort of Non-conformiſts. And you are

               <p>I ſee that it is difficult to forbear reproaches
towards them from whom we differ; or not
to build our own reputation upon the ruine of
other Mens Names. Does this ſavour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
in preferring our ſelves before others?
If this judging and condemning be from the
Spirit, I muſt tell you, <hi>You know not of what
Spirit you are of.</hi> I heard a grave Miniſter
ſay formerly, I thank God, I never heard a
Sermon, but I could get ſomething by it; if
the Sermons which you hear be inſipid, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
your Palate, and the Anfractuous Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of your own Ears; ſomething may be
amiſs there. Caſt away prejudice, purge out
the Yellow Jaundice of partiality: Do not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62157:83"/>
eſpouſe a Party; but put on Catholick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It may be you may taſt more ſweetneſs,
and ſee more comelineſs in the Sermons you
hear. St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>Whether
in pretence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>or in truth, Chriſt is
Preached, and I rejoyce and will rejoyce.</hi> But
as you complain of the Miniſters, juſt ſo did
<hi>Martin-mar-prelate</hi> traduce the regular Clergy
in his days; calling them Boys, Dolts, Lads,
Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence
<hi>Brown</hi> did not only take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his ſeparation;<note place="margin">Heylin <hi>of the Presb.</hi> p. 181, 182.</note> but Sir
<hi>Edwin Sandys affirms,</hi> that even
at <hi>Rome</hi> there was uſe made of thoſe ſcandalous
Aſperſions. What your deſign is herein, I
will not divine. But 'tis well obſerv'd, that
ſome complain of abuſes; not
that they may be redreſſed;<note place="margin">Ibid. 35.</note> but
by diſparaging the State, they may make way
for their own Diſcipline: They wound the
Civil State through the Eccleſiaſtick. King
<hi>James,</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament <hi>Ann
18.</hi> of his Reign, ſpake like an Angel, or like
himſelf; That thoſe that make themſelves
popular by recounting grievances, have the
Spirit of the Devil. Juſt ſo did <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſteal
away the Hearts of the People.—There is
none appointed by the King.—O that I
were made King in <hi>Iſrael!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did theſe <hi>prating Lads, with their</hi> Hebrew,
Chalde, Arabick <hi>Shreds, come out of your
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62157:84"/>
Shool, they ſhould</hi> have been ſtroaked for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Youths. Then it ſhould have been ſaid
as formerly; when young Birds come abroad
unfledg'd, and with their Shells on their heads;
<hi>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings haſt
thou ordained strength, becauſe of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope it is not a crime to learn other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
than what our Mothers taught us,
eſpecially ſuch as are even neceſſary for the very
right underſtanding of Scripture. The time
was, when 'twas almoſt Heretical, I had almoſt
ſaid Antichriſtian, and reſembling the Beaſt,
to make any uſe of thoſe Tongues. Sure you
are not ſo nice as to run out of the Church,
as if you were frighted with Babyloniſh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
when you hear a little <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the
pulpit: If ſuch Linguiſts do not reach the
abilities of the loweſt ſort of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts;
what Seraphick Angelical Doctors are
thoſe amongſt you of the higheſt Hierarchy?</p>
               <p>If you were better acquainted with the
Univerſity, you might find moſt hopeful Men
both for Learning and Integrity of Life (if
you do not diſlike them becauſe they have
their breeding there) to ſupply ſuch <hi>Patrons
as have recourſe to you for Teachers;</hi> and it
may be too you would be a propitious Angel
to put them into good Livings, if they would
make their Humble Addreſſes unto you. It
ſeems though you have no Rectory of your
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62157:84"/>
own, you can gratifie your Friends. As the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> took more pleaſure in making
another Man King, than being ſo himſelf. Do
not ſtop their way to preferment, becauſe they
ſhew their Parts in their firſt Eſſayes; in the
Eloquent Efforts of their Oratory. Such
Colts as trot high at the firſt, may at long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
become good Pad-naggs. We were
Children before we were ſtrong Men; <hi>Hercules</hi>
had not all his vigour at once: You will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
leſs Judgment than they, if nothing will
pleaſe you in a young Divine below the skill
and dexterity of an old <hi>Chryſoſtome. As for
thoſe amongst us who are Sots, as you ſay, and
ſpend their time in Ale-houſes, I am no Proctor
for them, ſighs and groans ſhall be all my Anſwer:</hi>
Yet if I would recriminate, I could point out
ſome of your own Minions that might bear
them company. <hi>All your 1800 are not clear
from ſuch stains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince you have now ſo good opinion of
the <hi>Common-prayer and Homilies,</hi> I ſee Mens
Judgments will vary as well as Faſhions. He
that durſt have ſaid ſo formerly, ſhould ſcarce
have any Place in the Church: As <hi>Hazael</hi> once
thought he ſhould not have been ſo inhumane
as to rip up Women with Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So you
little thought heretofore, that you ſhould ever
have ſpoke ſo favourably of the <hi>Common-prayers
and Homilies:</hi> Therefore it is not good (you
ſee) to drive on too furiouſly, according to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62157:85"/>
our preſent apprehenſions, without long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.
But I have ſomething elſe to obſerve:
—Some Men are ſo much afraid of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and a mediocrity, that whilſt they avoid
one Extream, <hi>in contraria currant.</hi> You im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Task on me, to tell you, <hi>What one Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist
was ſilenc'd for inſufficiency:</hi> You
might have forborn this; unleſs you could have
grounded it on my words, as my Aſſertion.
But 'tis uſual with you to wave the ſubject
Matter of Conteſt, and to move impertinent
Doubts: As if he that has to do with you muſt
anſwer <hi>Quodlibets.</hi> The grand reaſon of your
ſilence is of another nature: You do not give
ſecurity to Authority; that you will preach
up no more Wars; and carry your ſelves like
obedient Subjects, and peaceable Miniſters of
the Goſpel: Until you do ſo, you are ſuſpended
from the exerciſe of that Miniſtry. When
<hi>Marchiomont Needham</hi> wrote a Book to entitle
the Protector to all the Revenues of the
Church; and that it was in his Power to admit
whom he pleas'd to partake thereof. This was
good Doctrine in the days of the Tryars;
they imbrac'd it as the foundation of their arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power. But now there is a Shibboleth
of Peace and Loyalty to be pronounced by all
thoſe that will practiſe in the Miniſterial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
You either liſp it out in diſtinctions, or
cry out of Tyranny: So that your Queſtion
is a Fallacy, a <hi>non Cauſa ut Cauſa,</hi> putting <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62157:85"/>
for the Cauſe, when in truth it was
quite another thing.</p>
               <p>You ask me again, whether the worst of thoſe
that joyned with you, being re-ordained, are
not received when they do conform?</p>
               <p>If <hi>they were not the worst among you, who
do conform, no doubt you think them ſo?</hi> yet
I could name ſome, who were of the chief
Rank, who ſo far have denied themſelves, as
to draw forth their Breaſts to feed the Hungry.
Sure they did not ſee with your Eyes, <hi>that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is abſolutely ſinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Sir, If <hi>the worſt among you are received
when they Conform;</hi> what a ſhame is it that
you and others of the higher Rank ſhould
ſtand idle in the Market-place? whilſt you
ſuffer God to be ſerv'd with your Bran; the
Blind and the Lame (it ſeems) are good
enough for your Heavenly Prince; and you
may ſee how favourable and indulgent the
Governours of the Church are, in that they
are loath to diſparage your Judgments, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
thoſe whom you had approved.</p>
               <p>After I had deducted out of the groſs Sum
of 1800 thoſe that had been neſted in other
Mens Livings; 1. <hi>You faintly demand,—
How many of theſe were never in any Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
and must not they preach the Goſpel?</hi>
Yes, both they and the others too; and woe
unto them, if they do not. There is never
a Cherubim with a drawn Sword in his hand
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62157:86"/>
to keep them out of the Churches Paradiſe:
2. You give up the Cauſe, and ſay ingeniouſly,
<hi>I deny not the great Crime you charge upon
them. Yet as if you repented of your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
you ſay, that many of thoſe that were
turned out formerly were accuſ'd of inſufficiency
and groſs ſcandal.</hi> So hard a thing is it, fully,
and without reserves, to acknowledge a fault.
The Serpent was <hi>Eve</hi>'s Cloak, and the Woman
<hi>Adam's:</hi> Nay, God himſelf muſt be reflected
on, (the Woman whom <hi>Thou</hi> gaveſt) before
<hi>Adam</hi> will be ſilent, and have nothing to ſay.
You know that <hi>the inſufficiency and ſcandal of
many of them was, that their Conſciences</hi> could
not diſpenſe with their former Oaths, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an ungodly Cauſe; yet had they been as
vile as you can make them, their Freeholds
ought not to be taken from them illegally.
Then 3. <hi>you vindicate your ſelf, as if I had aim'd
at you:</hi> When the truth is, I had not the leaſt
thought of you. I muſt do you ſo much
juſtice, as to ſay,—I have heard you dealt
tranſcendently civilly with the Incumbents, in
compariſon of many whom I knew; and ſince
you ſpeak of theſe things with ſome regret,
I will not (like a Coward) preſs and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this advantage. I have touch'd this Sore
very softly, that you may not smart. Here
you chide me for minding you of a Retallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as you ſupplanted others, ſo God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
you. <hi>Does this (ſay you, ſavour of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62157:86"/>
any ſenſe at all to Souls? Must many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
go to Hell, that we may be requited? The
Peoples Souls had been forſaken: The Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a multitude of Souls is too dear a
price,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. It is no up-ſtart practice to ſoar high in
Pretences, and yet with the Raven and the
Kite, have our Eyes fix'd on ſome Carcaſs here
below. We have heard ſome cry loud, the
Temple of the Lord,—the Salvation of
Souls: Yet they were not the Souls of every
Soil; ſuch as did inhabit poor Villages, but
ſuch as dwelt in the fatteſt Parſonages, or elſe
in great Towns, where theſe Men, who were
ſo much for the good of Souls, might act
their parts with moſt popularity and ſucceſs,
both in reſpect of themſelves and the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>2. What good was done to Souls by theſe
Intruders, late Poſterity will find. Thoſe
unquiet Principles which were then inſtill'd,
will not be worn out in one Age; nor thoſe
Breaches and Gaſhes in the Church, made by
them, be cemented and heal'd by the Hands
of the moſt skilful <hi>Bezaliels,</hi> or Spiritual Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
of the higheſt value.</p>
               <p>3, The good of Souls is a moſt glorious
aim; yet St. <hi>Austin</hi> held it not good to tell a
lie <hi>to ſave a Soul.</hi> Much leſs may we preach
down lawful Authority, and plunder others,
living under <hi>the pretext of the good of Souls.</hi>
This has been an old contrivance in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:62157:87"/>
to bring all Cauſes within the Kirks

Things <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia.</hi> Juſt ſo you
plead for Arms; ſtarving Men, Women, and

Mr. <hi>Lea</hi> endeavoured to diſmount that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

Reign.</p>
               <p>I thank you that you ſay, <hi>you never lik'd
turning out ſuch a Man as my ſelf:</hi> You are
more propitious than the Commiſſioners were,
who threatned to ſilence me for preaching on

mind; they would not have had me to preach
at all, and the Soldiers would ſcarce let me live:
I ſtill bear about me the Badges of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But tell me true; ſhould you re-aſſume
your Chair, would you continue in this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Moode?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62157:87"/>

You ſaid you had expung'd the words in a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The Paſſage I quoted was in the <hi>5th</hi> Edition,

               </p>
               <p>§. 15. You <hi>tell me of the inconformity of
ſome that grew under my Shadow: I tell you
again, this is</hi> no evidence of an hearty recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when you go about to deny, juſtifie, or
extenuate what is notorious in theſe Parts,
and is Matter of Fact, ſo legible, that a Man
may run and read. What was your higheſt
reputation formerly, in being the <hi>Coryphaeus</hi> of

of your Fame upon a ſure Foundation,
and then it will laſt. Such Glory will not turn
into ſhame. This freeneſs of mine (it ſeems)
provok'd you to make me ſmart, by laying
before me (what I ſhall never forget) the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of one in my own Family. The beſt
is, my Conſcience tells me, it proceeded not
from want of Vigilancy, Advice, and Prayers,
or Example, but from a defect of that which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62157:89"/>
neither you nor I have power to beſtow, and
that is Grace.</p>
               <p>§ 16. If <hi>your Neighbour and his Wife will

Yet you ſay</hi> Sect. 7. <hi>Where I was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Witneſſes that ſwore to the Scandals of
the outed Miniſters, were reputed as honeſt Men
as any in the Place; and they got nothing by
their Oaths. What, honest Men, and charge
the Sequeſtred Ministers of Scandal upon their
Oaths? no more justly and truly than my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have charged you with taking their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Whereas you affirm, you was never in my
Pariſh, nor never took Horſe in your life.</hi> I
could ſay much from my Neighbours in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their Charge; for ſince I check'd
them for putting me upon ſuch an odious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
they brought a creditable Perſon
in this Neighbourhood, who aſſerts much of
that they ſay. Sir, you gave the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to this harſh and unpleaſing diſcourſe, by
ſaying that your Impriſonment came from the
Place of my Miniſtry; thereby tacitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
my Innocency. But <hi>Manus de Tabula.</hi>
I ſhall touch no more upon this, except you
provoke me, and draw me by the Head and
Shoulders into this Field. Only your <hi>premen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
honeſt Witneſſes</hi> puts me in mind what
you have printed <hi>concerning ſome honest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
What Conformiſts and honeſt too?</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62157:90"/>
when you ſay, <hi>Conformity is an avowed delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſin! (i. e.)</hi> As I conceive, is a ſin againſt
Knowledge, which the Scripture calls a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Sin; and if I miſtake not, it is ſuch
a Sin that borders upon that againſt the Holy-Ghoſt.
<hi>Honeſt Conformists</hi> then in your Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
muſt be tantamount to <hi>Honest Sinners.</hi>
But who are <hi>the Honeſt Conformists?</hi> are they

prove, <hi>that Epiſcopal Men were beginners of
the War.</hi> I ſaid but a little out of abundance
of ſtore, not knowing what to ſay firſt; yet
you anſwer not that little. <hi>Who knows not that
many Epiſcopal Parliaments cryed out still of
Monopolies, Liberty, Arminianiſm,</hi> Lauds <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,</hi>
&amp;c. Was it not as true,
that the Spirit of Preſb.<note place="margin">Heylin <hi>of Presb.</hi> P. 267. 307.</note> was

There might be claſhing 'twixt thoſe Epiſcopal
Men in Parliament; yet it would have been
long enough e're theſe had rais'd War againſt
the King. You are not ignorant, that in the

in Packets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay</hi> Sect. 25. There was but few Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
or Non-conformists here before the War,
no Presbyterians, except two in the Parliament:
The General, Lieutenant-Generals, Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
were Epiſcopal Men. I little thought to
have diſputed ſuch a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I medled not with Lay-men, but with my
diſſenting Brethren: Though the other cannot
be excus'd; yet theſe were moſt guilty in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Trumpet. <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>
(of the other Tribes) roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes;</hi>
but that Rebellion was call'd the gain-ſaying of
<hi>Core;</hi> becauſe he being of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
was deepeſt in the Conſpiracy: And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that all Inſurrections againſt Princes
have been inflam'd by ſome Clergy-men or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for ſome Centuries laſt paſt. <hi>But were
there ſo few Non-conformiſts in</hi> England <hi>before
the War?</hi> yet <hi>Anno 1603.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> is ſaid
to be ſaluted with a Petition of a thouſand
Miniſters, againſt Epiſcopacy; and before that,
<hi>Anno 1582.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> (who was no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Man) for he had renounc'd his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Ordination beyond Seas, met uſually
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62157:93"/>
with ſixty Miniſters of his own Way, in ſome
Corner of the Land: Did not theſe (think
you) increaſe and multiply? If five or ſix in
the Aſſembly, and five Biſhops (as you ſay)
in the Parliament rais'd ſuch ſtirs; what ſhall
we think may be effected by ſo many Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
Whereas you think that the late Wars
furniſh'd us with Preſbyterians out of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
it is doubtful to me, whether <hi>Scotland</hi> infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, or we <hi>Scotland:</hi> for when the King
was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was inform'd, that the
<hi>Scots</hi> had neither taken up Arms, nor invaded
<hi>England,</hi> but that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to it by ſome Members
of Parliament,<note place="margin">Heylin <hi>Presb.</hi> P. 442.</note> 
                  <hi>(you'l ſay theſe
were Epiſcopal Men)</hi> on a deſign to change the
Government of Church and State.</p>
               <p>One Propoſition ſent to the King after
<hi>Edgehill,</hi> was, That he ſhould yield to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet you'l ſay
that all the Parliament (except two) were
<hi>Epiſcopal Men.</hi> As good as any among the
Covenanters, who vow'd to aboliſh Prelacy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or as any of thoſe in your own Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> with his 15000
Myrmidons petition'd againſt Biſhops, it may
be you'l vouch them to be <hi>Epiſcopal Men,</hi> as
well as you do the Parliament Men: Yet I do
not find that any ſaid any thing againſt that
Petition beſides the Lord <hi>Dighy;</hi> as for many
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62157:93"/>
others it did appear that ſuch Lettice was too
ſuitable to their Lips, yet ſound Epiſcopal Men
in your ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The War was called <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> not
as if fought by Epiſcopal Men on both ſides;
but Epiſcopacy (or rather the Biſhops Lands)
was the <hi>Palladium</hi> or <hi>Helena;</hi> one ſide fought
for it, the other againſt it. <hi>Mulciber in Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jam

ſtick at laſt in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> As for the
particular <hi>Members in the Army,</hi> they were
better known to you than my ſelf. I delight
not in perſonal Reflections or Quarrels. If thoſe
that are yet alive be not Epiſcopal, I wiſh they
were ſo. But that they were, whilſt they
acted in the ſupport of the late Cauſe, I have
not ſo far renounc'd my reaſon and experience,
as to fall in with your Account: And if you
perſevere in this new Doctrine, we ſhall be as
diſtant as the two Poles. One Document I
cannot but obſerve from what is ſaid,—That
the late War was ſo odious, that neither
ſide will own it. Even as the dead Child (in

               <p>§. 28. <hi>Your notion of the</hi> Arminian <hi>and other</hi>

and when you are ſetting of it up,
it will not hang together. I may ſay of it, as
the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> did of one ſetting up the
body of a dead Man, when his Head ſwagg'd
this way and the other, he cried out <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>It is true <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> Williams <hi>was in Arms;</hi>
but he loſt the Lord-Keepers Seal, and was not
admitted to do his Office at the Kings Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This inflam'd the Man, and tranſported
him beyond his duty towards the end of the

that Anſwer? Juſt as our modern Naturaliſts

But you <hi>muſt prove it better that the Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

               <p>33. The Principles of <hi>Hooker, Bilſon,</hi> and
ſuch Prelatists, led me to what I did and wrote
in the Book which I have retracted.</p>
               <p>As for Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> I have not his Book by
me which you quote; neither dare I take
upon me to defend what all our Biſhops have
written: I muſt either want Imployment, or
be very pragmatical, to venture upon every
Task you are ready to impoſe upon me. If
any of my Fathers diſcover their nakedneſs, I
will put on my Mantle and go backward. I
will not lick up their Spittle, and ſay it is
ſweeter than Nectar and Ambroſia. I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:62157:95"/>
I am ſatisfied that Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> was willing
to ſay ſomething in behalf of our Neighbours
of <hi>Holland,</hi> in vindicating them from Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And ſo
ſtretched the Doctrine of Subjection too far.
Whether this will ſatisfie you I know not: I
am ſure <hi>multitudo pecantium non minuit pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</hi>
If Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> miſled you in point
of <hi>Subjection aud Obedience,</hi> let him make you

Biſhops.</p>
               <p>I ſaid ſomething (upon your provocation)
in behalf of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> not intending to be
drawn further into the Field. I am jealous of
my own failing and weakneſs; and ſo am unfit

do to anſwer for my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I do ſtill admire Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> and I find my
Betters have done ſo before me. <hi>Cambden</hi>
wiſh'd his Books had been turn'd into an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Language! Biſhop <hi>Vſher, Morton,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>John Hales</hi> had the ſame high opinion of him:
Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> ſaid he had been highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
of all prudent, peaceable, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Readers. King <hi>James</hi> ſaid his Book was
the Picture of a Divine Soul in every Page of
Truth and Reaſon. The late King commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to his Children next to the Bible. And
the ſame happy Pen, which taught the Kings
Book to ſpeak as good <hi>Latin</hi> (if poſſible)
as it had <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had almoſt turn'd Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62157:95"/>
into the ſame Dialect, for the benefit of the
learned World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet you ſay he led you into what you did
and wrote;</hi> in print you ſay the ſame; you
cite his 1. Book, <hi>P. 21. Laws they are not which
publick approbation hath not made. They must
be made by entire Societies.</hi> What is this more
than what ſome that wrote for the Kings Cauſe
in the late Wars have confeſſed,—That
<hi>quoad aliquid,</hi> that is as to making of Laws
our Kings have not challeng'd a Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that the legiſlative Power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
is properly and legally in

ſame incomparable <hi>Hooker</hi> adds,—An <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Monarch, commanding his Subjects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſeemeth good in his own Diſcretion.</hi> This
<hi>Edict</hi> hath the <hi>force of a Law, whether they
approve or diſlike it:</hi> And elſe-where he ſaith,
—<hi>Where the King hath Power of Dominion,
no Forreign State, or Domestical, can poſſibly
have in the ſame Cauſe and Affairs Authority
higher than the King.</hi> Take heed you do not
imitate him, who only took what was for his
purpoſe, and left out the reſt.</p>
               <p>But you have found out other Doctrine in
<hi>Hooker,</hi> viz. <hi>That Power is originally in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Eſcheats to them, that the King is</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis
Major, &amp; Univerſis Minor. I cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to this; for as by God Kings Reign,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62157:96"/>
their Power is from him, <hi>ſo it Eſcheats to him.</hi>
No <hi>Ephori, Demarchi,</hi> or Tribunes can curb
the Prince. But <hi>Sir, was you led aſide by</hi>
Hooker, <hi>to what you did and wrote?</hi> yet you
quote theſe Paſſages out of his eighth Book.
Now <hi>you was led aſide in what you did and
wrote,</hi> before that Book and his Fellows ſaw
the Light; perhaps <hi>you did and wrote,</hi> and
then after the Kings return you gathered up
your Principles, as it were <hi>ex postliminio;</hi> as if
you ſhould firſt build the Roof of an Houſe,
and then lay the Foundation; or firſt poſſeſs
your ſelf of an Eſtate, and then blunder for

accountable to any.</hi>—Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaid,
That this Paſſage,—The King is accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the People, was not in a Manuſcript he
had ſeen; but he ſaid the Copies had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlin'd;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62157:96"/>
therefore he commanded nothing of
his ſhould be printed after his death. And
Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> whom you recite, ſaid,
the <hi>perfect Copies were lost;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See his Life printed 1666. <hi>P. 28, 29.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and
that thoſe which he ſaw were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
mangled, draughts diſmembred
into pieces; no favour or grace, not the ſhadows
of themſelves remaining.</hi> Had he liv'd to ſee
them thus defac'd, he might rightly call them
<hi>Benonivs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. I ſaid I could not chooſe but nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate
that Diſcipline, which ſtartles at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
War againſt the King. You ask,
Is it <hi>Prelatical Diſcipline?</hi> No, I acquit
it. <hi>Presbyterian?</hi> No, ſay you. <hi>The preſent
Non-conformists offered Epiſcopacy to the King.</hi>
You dare not undertake for all. Some will
ſtartle as much at Epiſcopacy, as they do at
the Oath; Except you caſtrate and qualifie it
with your allays, until you have made it quite
another thing. As <hi>Martial</hi> ſaid of a Fellow,
who repeated his Verſes amiſs, he made them
his own: The Poet would not own them. So
muſt you do with Epiſcopacy, before it will
ſlip down. Indeed you puzzle me very much;
I am at a loſs who theſe Non-conformiſts are:
When I write to them, you tell me,—<hi>I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Presbyterians.</hi> But when you ſpeak
of them, you ſay,—<hi>They are for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</hi>
By your words they are of a Motley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſey-woolſey
Kind, Epiſcopal-Preſbyterian-Nonconformiſts.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62157:97"/>
But what ever theſe Men
are, their Diſcipline muſt not be touch'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither the Chorus, nor any Man of them,
ſtartles at renouncing War against the King. You
have not prov'd their Practiſe ſuch, and is your
printed Clamour come to this?</hi> You ſay you
know the Non-conformiſts better than I; yet
I know ſome that will not agree to the former
part of that Oath about renouncing War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King. They have jealouſies and
fears almoſt about every word, as if there
were an Ambuſcade to intangle them, or to
take away their Liberty. What <hi>need I prove
their Practiſe?</hi> Is it not proof enough to point
at thoſe Men that flit their Habitations, rather
than ſubſcribe to what I ſay. Even as the
Philoſopher ſaid nothing, but walk'd up and
down to prove that there was ſuch a thing as
Motion. What if I ſhould ask you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you ever took that Renunciation; I think
I ſhould ſtop your career, that you would
not act the part ſo jovially, <hi>Militis tam glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay <hi>there is ſomething elſe in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
—as not to endeavour alteration of
Government in Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But this makes me
to</hi> nauſeate your Principles, as much as the
former. What Peace can be expected, whilſt
Men in effect tell their Governours,—they
will let them alone, whilſt they can do no
otherwiſe; but when they have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62157:97"/>
they'l throw them out of the Saddle.
<hi>Shall you not (ſay you) endeavour the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Government by Lay-Chancellors?</hi> Yes
by petition, as becomes Subjects, if you do
not bring a Sword in the other hand: <hi>But
you muſt do it in your Places;</hi> that is,—in your
Miniſtry: You muſt pray and preach them
down: If you turn Soldiers, you muſt fight
them down. So the old Covenant Evaſion
will ſtand you in little ſtead.</p>
               <p>You ſent me to the Confeſſions of Forreign
Churches, to learn what their Diſcipline was.
I gave you ſome Inſtances of their practiſe,
and I could have given you many more; as in
<hi>Prague,</hi> and other Places. Are not theſe the
beſt Commentary on their practiſe? Sir, what
think you of theſe diſciplinarian Principles?—If
Princes hinder the Diſcipline, they are
Tyrants, and may be depos'd.—The
Supreme Magiſtrate muſt
have no place in Synodical Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<note place="margin">Heyl. <hi>on Presb.</hi> P. 285. 335. 269.</note> unleſs he be choſen for an
Elder: You know then what follows. So that
it has not been ſuggeſted amiſs,—That the
<hi>Genevian</hi> Principles make thoſe, in whom they
are rooted, Enemies <hi>to the Power and guidance
of all Sovereign Princes.—That
the Principles of Presbyters are Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical
and Antimonarchical;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruſh. Coll.</hi> P. 161. 360.</note> 
                  <hi>That
Puritans and Sectaries, though two of them
ſcarcely agree in what they would have, yet they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62157:98"/>
are haters of Government; and they would have
the Kings Power extinguiſh'd in matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastical,
and limited in Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall the leſs value publick Confeſſions,
ſince I call to mind what a glorious King the
Long Parliament promiſed to make our late
bleſſed Sovereign. If any ſhould deny now,
that this King was fought againſt by the ſame
Men, and murdered; and for a proof ſhould
ſend me to their Declarations; (how Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may be cheated by this way of arguing I
know not) I ſhall never ſo far baffle and hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink
my own knowledge and ſad experience,
as to believe them. I took the ſame way to
convince you,—That Epiſcopal Men being
faithful to their Principles, could not be the
beginners of the late War; becauſe our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
Catechiſm, Articles, Homilies are againſt
ſuch practiſes. Then you even pitied my <hi>poor
ſilly kind of defence:</hi> You ſend me <hi>often to</hi>
Ruſhworth, Heylin, <hi>and lay much streſs on</hi>
Du Moulins <hi>Anſwer,</hi> to <hi>Philanax;</hi> though I
have read him all over, yet I find not that he
does patronize your Cauſe at all: His deſign is,
(and he makes it out) that Popiſh Tenents
lead to Rebellion; but may not other Men
have that Fire-brand in their Tails? though
they look quite a contrary way. But ſee your
own partiality, when I refer you to <hi>Sions</hi> Plea,
<hi>Travers, Bancroft,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Aston,</hi> that you
might ſee the Diſcipline, and nauſeate it as well
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62157:98"/>
as I: You check me and reject them. I may
allude to the words of God himſelf, (I hope
without offence) Is your way equal? is my
way unequal? Our own Brats (it ſeems) are
beautiful, and others of the ſame Symmetry
are deform'd.</p>
               <p>37. <hi>After you</hi> had ſaid the War was not
founded in Theological differences, but in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and Law-Controverſies: <hi>I inferr'd that
you intended to excuſe the Divines. If this
was not ſuitable to your mind, pray pardon
me. But ſince you ſay the difference was not
Theological, pray review your own words.</hi>
—The extirpation of Piety was the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
<note place="margin">The Saints Reſt. <hi>P. 257, 258.</hi> the fifth Edition.</note> Many able Miniſters ſilenced,
Lectures ſuppreſs'd, the Lords-day
reproach'd, and devoted to pastimes,
a multitude of Humane Ceremonies
took place. This was the Work which we took
up Arms to reſist. Thoſe that ſcruple the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our War, did not ſcruple the lawfulneſs
of ſubverting our Churches among us. <hi>Were
not theſe things Theological? Yet for</hi> theſe you
took up Arms; ſpeak no more of Political Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differences.
<hi>As if Stateſ-men were only in the
fault. Did not you ſay before that the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
was begun by</hi> Epiſcopal Men; <hi>whereof
ſome were Arminian, Anti-Arminian; and
were not theſe differences</hi> Theological?</p>
               <p>Should I inſult now and ſay, Are you fit to
torture the Preſs, and make it groan, with ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62157:99"/>
numerous a Progeny of Books, <hi>and yet do ſo
groſly contradict your ſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>40. You confeſs your Error, in <hi>denying
Dr.</hi> Manton <hi>to have written upon</hi> Jude; and I
confeſs my <hi>miſnomore of</hi> John <hi>for</hi> Cornelius
Burges. I was a ſtranger to this <hi>Cornelius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
theſe latter days, and could ſcarce believe
he could be the Author of ſo Orthodox a
Book. If we be thus ingenious, we ſhall come
near together at laſt.</p>
               <p>41. This Section is ſpent about <hi>taking up
Arms;</hi> but the latter Clauſe of the Oath does
moſt ſtick with you, and <hi>the word endeavour</hi>
much troubles you; but if we look upon it in
reference to former Tranſactions, it muſt be
reaſonably underſtood of a tumultuous and
arm'd <hi>Endeavour;</hi> and this has (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd)
been declar'd by the Judges, who are
the true Interpreters of the Law. As King
<hi>Charles</hi> the firſt told them <hi>Anno 1628. and may
not the Justices in the Country</hi> declare what was
the ſenſe of the Judges? If every word in an
Oath muſt be ſtrain'd to the moſt unfavourable
ſenſe, and no Interpreters be allowed to explain
it; it is the beſt way for us to turn Quakers,
and not to ſwear at all: Not in Chriſts ſenſe,
but theirs; for 'tis eaſie to turn the plaineſt
Oaths into Snares. How ſhall it be known,
that Men by vertue of the Covenant do not
hold themſelves oblig'd to ſubvert Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government by Biſhops; if it be unlawful
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62157:99"/>
                  <hi>to ſwear not to endeavour the Alteration of the
Government:</hi> Then they may lie at catch
to play their former Game over again; and
who knows but there is ſo much pleading to
keep this Sally-port open to this purpoſe?
This bogling makes me think your Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not ſo ſincere as St. <hi>Austins;</hi> and then
'tis no wonder you fall ſhort of his Glory. As
for <hi>thoſe Titles of want of ingenuity, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
what I ſay; O happy Quieter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience!</hi>
They are ſo common,—that like
thoſe that live near the falling of <hi>Nilus,</hi> though
it roar never ſo much, they take little notice
of it; ſo I am inur'd to your Buffetings, that
I am almoſt turn'd into a Callum.</p>
               <p>44. Your refuſal of that Oath (it ſeems)
is bottom'd on this,—<hi>That Lay-Chancellors
make up the Church-Government, which is not
to be altered.</hi> I think it will not be eaſie to
prove this; and I am ſure I never yielded it to
you. They may be appendants to, which
are not the eſſential parts of a Government.
If you peruſe the Oath 1640. which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo much duſt at that time, you will find
the Church-Governours ſet down at large,
—Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans and Arch-deacons;
there is no mention at all of <hi>Lay-Chancellors;</hi>
except you will play the Chymiſt
and extract them out of the reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
then you may make Regiſters, Proctors, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parators
to be the Government, But Sir! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62157:100"/>
your ſelf, you tell me, <hi>you must not
give the Reaſons of Non-conformity, becauſe
this would be a traducing the Government.</hi> Why
do you print againſt <hi>Lay-Chancellors</hi> then, if
they <hi>be the Government?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learned Men have maintained both in the
Schools and from the Preſs a Divine Right of
the Government of the Church by Biſhops:
But who ever did ſo in behalf of Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors?
Is not this to have <hi>hot and feaveriſh
Heads?</hi> when you will ſtartle at every Leaf,
as if it harboured a Serpent, and turn every
Buſh in your way into a Gorgon: Men will
never want woe that are ſuch pregnant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers,
how to puzzle and intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>When you ſeem'd perplex'd about <hi>Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,</hi>
I did ſay, Me thinks a Man of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
ſhould reſt ſatisfied with that modeſt
Declaration before the Commination in our
Liturgy, concerning the Cenſures of the
Church. Have I done you any wrong in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
<hi>to your ingenity, who have</hi> ſo often <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me diſingenious.</hi> In that Declaration there is
an acknowledgment,—That in the Primitive
Church there was a godly Diſcipline, which it is
wiſh'd might be reſtored. It is granted then that
our Diſcipline is imperfect; and though there
is no mention of <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> yet Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
being a part of Diſcipline, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Penance, I thought you might be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62157:100"/>
ſo ingenious as not to exagitate what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
to be imperfect. Poor impotent Flies
ſtick upon Sores, but generous Spirits are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with an acknowledgment, <hi>ſatis est pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straſſe
leoni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You might perceive I had no mind to draw
the Saw, <hi>about Lay-Chancellors and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi>
I had not mention'd them in my
Book, or aſſerted any thing about Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
but 'tis your manner to draw any
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into your diſcourſe. And then if I do
but touch upon it, 'tis enough; you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
pour forth a whole Volume. Juſt ſo
when I was a Puny-Sophiſter in the Schools: If
I could catch an advantage from any word,
that fell from my Antagoniſt, I would hold
him there, and paſs by the merits of the Cauſe.
It may be I could wiſh,—that Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
were reduc'd into a more Scriptural,
Apoſtolical and Primitive Channel, as much
as your ſelf; but I never look that the
Church below ſhould be without ſpot or
wrinkle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid, (what could be ſaid) that</hi> Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
<hi>do not excommunicate as they are</hi> Lay-men;
<hi>but by their Surrogates.</hi> O quam vapulo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſhall be good in Law, except they be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Biſhop in perſon, or by ſome other
in Holy Orders, <hi>in whom is the Power of the
Keys.</hi> You did not do well to overlook what
I ſaid about the Lay-Chancellors being expert
in the Civil Law; and ſo were competent
Judges about Intricacies, ariſing about Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Affairs, and ſo might have a Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
and a Juridical Inſpection over this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of Excommunication. Tell me, Sir!
May not a Man be ſaid to do that vertually,
which he does not act immediately? The King
does neither preach nor adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet has a Supremacy of Power in all
things belonging to the Church. Are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in Parliament aſcrib'd to the Lords
Spiritual, which were tranſacted by their
Proxies? Did you never read, that

all the Cities of <hi>Juda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 17. 4. 9.</note> and
taught the People? Was not Teachings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Prieſts, Levites, Prophets, as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Diſcipline were to the Apoſtles? Why
do you not quarrel with theſe Nobles, for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62157:102"/>
being Uſurpers? If you ſay, as ſome Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
that they taught the People, in that
they incourag'd the Levites to do ſo: Why
in this ſenſe may not Lay-Chancellors act about
Excommunication, by informing and directing
the Surrogates how to carry themſelves in
doubtful Caſes? as <hi>Jetho</hi> adviſed, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the greateſt concern ſhould be brought
to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Although all this while the original
Authority is in and from the Biſhop, and we
are all but his Curates as to the exerciſe of it.
I find that if you may be permitted to fix your

45. I told you, that if Lay-Elders medled
in Excommunication, you would not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at them: You ſay in effect <hi>you renounce
them;</hi> for you <hi>have written against them.</hi> Where
ſhall I find you? If I touch upon any thing
that may reflect upon <hi>the Presbyterians, or
their Diſcipline,</hi> preſently your blood is up,
and I muſt be call'd to a ſevere account by your
ſelf, as the <hi>Achilles</hi> of the Party: Yet if any
part of that Diſcipline be charg'd upon you,
or want a defence, then you fly off, renounce
the Cauſe you have eſpous'd: You know not
the Man, although you think I am oblig'd to
defend every uſage of the Church with which
you have a mind to quarrel. What prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is this? Into how many Shapes can you
transform your ſelf? <hi>Hecate Triformis!</hi> Fleſh,
Fiſh, Mirmaid; Epiſcopal-Preſbyterian-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent;

as you do, that Excommunication was decreed
by the Civil Lawyers, <hi>and not by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi>

                  <hi>If ever I be a Biſhop I ſhall bleſs my ſelf from
ſuch a defender:</hi> and herein you would do
me a kindneſs: for you would be ſuch a
ſtrange and uncouth a Biſhop, that it would
exceed the skill of a better Advocate than I
to defend your manner of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>But there is but little fear of this trouble;
for before <hi>Richard</hi> will agree with <hi>Baxter,</hi>
what kind of Biſhop he would be, it will be
too late in the afternoon with me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
your defence.</p>
               <p>47. Here you ſay, <hi>I ſarcastically inſinuate
ſomething about your</hi> Nolo-Epiſcopare, <hi>and ſo
you wiſh again for one grain of Ingenuity in me.</hi>
You might have ſav'd this labour, if you had
not undertaken to know my mind better than
I do my ſelf. Who gave you commiſſion to
read my thoughts backward? as deſtitute <hi>of
ingenuity as you make me,</hi> I never reproached
any with their miſery, or upbraided them
with their choice. It may be an act of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
to refuſe preferment; for <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi>
and many others have done it before you.
I will not be ſo curious and inquiſitive as to
ſearch whether your motives and theirs be the
ſame,</p>
               <p>48. <hi>Magis &amp; Minus non variant ſpeciem;

neither ſubſtances nor relatives in my Logick,
<hi>Suſcipiunt magis &amp; minus;</hi> If they be relatives
<hi>ſecundum eſſe.</hi> But this is onely in reſpect of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62157:103"/>
quantity and quality which do adhere to them.
For as one man is not <hi>magis homo,</hi> ſo one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not <hi>magis Pater</hi> than another. But ſay
you <hi>Would a ſpoon be a ſpoon if it were as big
as a Church.</hi> It is enough for my purpoſe that
there is no ſpecifick difference betwixt a little
Spoon and a great one, nor betwixt a ſmall
Dioceſs and a great one: and this you ſeem
to aſſert in your next Section, ſhewing that
there is ſmall difference <hi>betwixt Biſhop</hi> Uſhers
<hi>and the preſent Model.</hi> Take heed of abſurd
and ridiculous ſuppoſitions; for as they are
not argumentative, ſo they infer nothing but
monſtruous concluſions. Rub up your Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy

50. To all you talk after on this Subject I
cannot find in my heart to trouble my ſelf with
any other Anſwer than to tell you that all you
ſay is utterly impertinent, <hi>you would have cry'd
out</hi>—O eaſie Anſwer! <hi>but</hi> why impertinent?
you had declar'd your ſelf for the Epiſcopacy of
<hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but not for Dioceſan
Biſhops, becauſe they were not primitive. <hi>I told</hi>
you there were Biſhops before there were Pariſhes,
<hi>therefore</hi> the moſt primitive Biſhops were not
Parochial. <hi>Then I ſhew'd you the large Dioceſs
of</hi> Ignatius, Cyprian, <hi>&amp;c. And I quote the very
words of</hi> Ignatius <hi>in his Epiſtles,</hi> and all this is
impertiment: <hi>but 'tis no ſtrange thing with you;
for when I mention'd ſeveral grand Authors</hi>
about the Diſcipline, <hi>you give me juſt ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. You had ſpoken, (as I underſtood) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Oath of Canonical Obedience to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:
I told you this was only in <hi>rebus licitis
&amp; honestis.</hi> This you canvas up and down;
yet when you had to do with Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi>
you grant it, but with me you diſpute it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again.</p>
               <p>Are <hi>Oaths neceſſary to be ſworn to the Clergy?</hi>
It was once made neceſſary to ſwear and vow
againſt the Clergy to the utter rooting them
up, and thoſe that refus'd ran the hazard of
all they had. And may not we now promiſe
Obedience to them in things lawful? or rather
by the King by whoſe Law this is injoy'nd?
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62157:104"/>
but <hi>where is any Antiquity for it?</hi> I produc'd
the words of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to this purpoſe, yet you
take no notice of them.</p>
               <p>52. <hi>I had ſaid Mr.</hi> Cartwright <hi>wrangled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into Conformity: you ſay it is well done of you
to write an hiſtorical untruth ſo boldly? you have
no way to come off, but to ſay ſome body told you
ſo: ſome body told you ſo is ſometimes and in
ſome caſes a good account.</hi> If we were ſtript of
the advantage of Tradition, you would be
much puzzl'd about the Chriſtian Sabboth. But
is this an <hi>Historical Vntruth?</hi> You might have
read the very words in print before now;
and in another Author you may read—

and procure as much as he
could, both publickly and privately
the Eſtimation and Peace of the

               </p>
               <p>53. <hi>Here you repeat concerning the Oath of
non-endavouring the Alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But as you ſay nothing but what hath
been ſaid before, ſo I have nothing to ſay but
what I have ſaid already, until ſomething be
produc'd <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>54. <hi>Who it is that does moſt to drive people
from the Pariſh Churches, I am ſatisfied by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
and whether all Nonconformiſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
be ſuch children of hell as you deſcribe
them.</hi> Methinks you are like a waſpiſh or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
Diſputant, who being impatient of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and having ſpent his ſtock of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
falls to chiding, and ſupplies the want of
argument with the overflowing of the gall,
and 'tis no wonder you begun to faulter and
rage at the latter end of the day, after ſo
tedious a Journey, I mean ſo long a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
But when you are refreſhed, revolve
with your ſelf in your retirement and ſolitude.
1. Whether we that now bear the heat of the
day (I might ask you according to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
<hi>whether you mean me,)</hi> do drive men
from the Pariſh Churches. 2. Whether I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
diſſenters, all of them to be the children
of hell. <hi>Reverende Pater in hiſce duabus Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionibus
expecto animi tui ſententiam.</hi> Take

—<hi>Calumniari fortiter haerebit aliquid.</hi> Let
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62157:105"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> rather inſtruct you <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to
ſpeak the truth in love. Away with theſe
Heats; let's tear one the other in pieces no
longer: Can you blame me for ſaying ſuch
diſſentions make Muſick at <hi>Rome?</hi> Let us
ſhew our ſelves to each other like <hi>Joſeph</hi> and
his Brethren at their interview in Aegypt.
Though my Judgment leads me to be <hi>Pius Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus</hi>
to the Non-conformity of the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts;
yet nothing ſhall make me unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to their Perſons.</p>
               <p>55. <hi>To write a just Defence of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which I own, would take up more time than
I have to ſpare, unleſs I ſaw a probability of
better effect, than by putting it into your Hand,
as now you motion.</hi> I will not ſay this is a
Tergiverſation; for if there be any that comes
near St. <hi>Johns</hi> Hyperbole, of writing more
Books than the World can contain, you are the
Man. If you do but open the Flood-gates of
your Lips, out there guſhes ſuch a Torrent,
(I allude ſtill to St. <hi>John,</hi> but 'tis to the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
in the Revelation) that is enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
ſuch a Pigmy as I am. Your Foam is
the more grievous becauſe it is brackiſh. I

me in a higher Key, and a more Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
Accent: You will have the Lions
Motto, <hi>Nemo me impune laceſſit:</hi> Yet I could
wiſh that if your Writing be no ſweeter, it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62157:106"/>
might be ſhorter; and that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
your ſwelling thoughts, and like the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
ſpeak much in a little, for I am weary in
following you.</p>
               <p>I hope you will no more tell me, that I call
upon you to blow againſt a flaming Oven; and
to do Impoſſibilities, when I call'd for your
Reaſons of Non-conformity. <hi>You tell me I

I made the motion in <hi>aſſiſting you in the Birth,

               <p>
                  <hi>If you are under affliction, I hope it will make

Though I might have thought ſuch an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might have procur'd your forbearance,
and that you would not have come upon me

Honey out of ſuch a hard Rock; and I can

               </opener>
               <p>WHen I had written an Anſwer to your
laſt, the Tranſcriber moved ſlow in
his Work, and it being ſomewhat
long, (fourteen Sheets) before he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, I heard from a double report of your
own acquaintance, that you purpoſed to print
what you got from me! At the firſt hearing I
was not ſorry for it: But upon ſecond thoughts
theſe four Reaſons put a ſtop to the miſſion of
the Papers to you. 1. I have written more
plainly and ſmartly than I would have done
if it had been for any ones uſe beſides your
own: A ſecret conviction and reproof may
be ſharper than an open one. 2. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that you cannot get the whole licenſed,
(and I cannot eaſily think that you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.)
Upon your encouragement a few ſheets
againſt <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> (ſince dead) were printed
without Licenſe, and were ſurprized in the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62157:108"/>
Preſs; and if you ſhould print mine by ſcraps,
and not entirely, I ſhould take it for a great
injury and diſhoneſty. 3. And I doubt it
would be offenſive to ſome, and ſo might
tend to my own diſquiet; for to make it ſo
plain, as that nothing but a high degree of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or Impudence can contradict it, that
the Parliament that raiſed Arms againſt the
King were by profeſſion <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> (ſuch as
<hi>Heylin</hi> deſcribes <hi>Abbot</hi> to be) as againſt thoſe
whom they accuſed of Innovation, and rais'd
ſuſpitions that they were reconciling us to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
at the price of our loſs of Propriety and
Liberty. I have been fain to name ſo many
Men, of whom ſome are yet living, that I
know not how they will take it, to have their
Military Acts recited after the Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and I believe thoſe Clergy-men that have
uſed this falſe Viſor to put on the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
to make them odious, that it was they
only, and not the Epiſcopal that began the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> War, will be very angry to have their
fraud detected. 4. But all theſe are ſmall
matters in compariſon of the laſt; Though
God hath given us a King, who is ſo firm to
the Proteſtant Religion, as to make a ſevere
Law againſt all that ſhall caſt out ſuſpitions
of his being inclin'd to Popery; yet all Men
are mortal, and God knoweth into what Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
Hands my Papers may be put by the Papiſts
for their advantage when they ſee them: And
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62157:108"/>
they may ſay, You ſee, Sir, that it was not
only the Non-conformiſts, but the Epiſcopal
Proteſtants alſo that raiſed War againſt the
King; therefore no Party of them are to be
truſted by you, as <hi>Philanax Anglicus</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and Arguments from Intereſt take much
in the World. And I had rather the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
alone were diſtated and caſt out, than
the Conformiſts alſo, leſt worſe ſucceed them.
On all which Conſiderations I ſhall ſuſpend my
ſending you theſe Papers, till you give me ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Reaſons to believe that they ſhall not be
uſed to more hurt than good; and then you
ſhall have them by the next Meſſenger. But I
doubt whether it will not offend you to ſee it
ſo undeniably proved, that your Papers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſo great a number of groſs miſtakes.
Among which one of the moſt excuſable-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one, is your miſtake of my Apology <hi>(in
tantum)</hi> for one or two Non-conformiſts
near you, (I know of no more) that had
not Academical Education, or might be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
to be half as low in Learning as you
defined them to be, when I told you how
much I preferred Matter before ſtrange Words,
and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divine before a <hi>Syriack</hi> Sot, or
a few Shreds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For though I had no
thought of accuſing the Conformiſts more
than others, of being guilty of acquaintance
with the Oriental or other Languages; yet I
confeſs I had mentioned the Conformiſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62157:109"/>
in the ſame Sheet, and you were like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the contradicting humour to think
that all that was mentioned to you was ſpoken
by way of oppoſition to your Party, when
you found ſome crums of credit in it: But to
diſabuſe you, I aſſure you; 1. That I thought
not in thoſe words of comparing Conformiſts
with Non-conformiſts at all, but only Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
ſmattering in ſtrange words, with real ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
underſtanding, and preaching of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
in what Parties ſoever they were found.
2. That I never yet heard any of your Youths
in our Pulpits that ſhewed any higher Matters
of that poor kind of oſtentation than a few
words of <hi>Hebrew.</hi> 3. That really it was a
Lad in my own Houſe at my Elbow, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of whom ſuggeſted to me the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my Compariſon, who is yet no Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
and I aſſure you no judicious Divine,
(what ever he may be hereafter) and yet
(ſeeing you ſeem to differ from me in this
Point alſo, and ſo prefer ſuch <hi>Shreds</hi> before
true Knowledge in Divinity) is able to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you with ſomewhat more than Shreds of
<hi>Welch, Engliſh, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
Syriack, Arabick, Perſian, Samaritan,
Aethiopick;</hi> and if theſe be not enough for
you, we can make ſhift between us to ſend

the Bible. And if you ſignifie your deſire

ſome Shreds <hi>of theſe</hi> by the next, in ſtead of
ſolid Divinity, that you may have that which
you prefer. And I further aſſure you, that he
never had theſe from any Univerſity, nor from
any Tutor that is fond of Conformity; which
I ſay becauſe you tell me how we would boaſt
of ſuch if they were among us. And would
you have me ſend out ſuch a Lad (of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or twenty years of age) to be a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
or a Paſtor, becauſe he can talk nonſenſe
(or at leaſt but little profound Divinity) in
ſo many Tongues? Had I ſet as light by
Languages as you dreamed, I had not taken
care to help him to this much: But becauſe I
ſet more by <hi>real Science,</hi> than you ſeem to do
by your contradiction of my preference of it,
I count him that is without it, and without the
Holy Love and Life which it tendeth to, to
be but as ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling
Cymbal.</p>

ANSWER
TO
Mr. Baxter's fourth Letter.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Received yours directed to the Curate of
<hi>Northfeild.</hi> Now there is ſome hope; your
Language is truly Epiſcopal: For we are
in truth the Biſhops Curates; and under that
Title we are pray'd for in the Collect, though
more at large in the Littany. But I think the
King will ſhortly give me a Writ of Eaſe, ſo
that I ſhall neither be Rector nor Curate there
long. All Times involve me in Sufferings:
May I hereby know <hi>(Reduplicative.)</hi> the
Fellowſhip of my Saviours Sufferings! And ſo
thereby with him be made perfect!</p>
               <p>Thoſe that told you what I might ſay about
Printing our Papers, might have told you the
whole truth; which was with this reſerv'd Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62157:111"/>
—If you ſhould approve of it.
Though you well know, how you have urg'd
me to it. Such Apocopes do too much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Legerdemain of the grand Impoſtor.
I may be ignorant; I cannot be diſhoneſt. I
had rather your Devoto's ſhould take it for
granted, that you have mangled the whole
Book you oppoſe, and laid the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of it in the Duſt, than confute them by
doing you the leaſt injury.</p>
               <p>Your four Reaſons are ſatisfactory unto me:
And I am glad that you are convinc'd, that
your Ink did overflow with Gall towards one
who treated you with much humanity. But
I am ſorry you do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in ſtill aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
—that the War was raiſed by Epiſcopal
Men. Herein you are ſingular, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by your own Friends; who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to lay hold on ſuch a Doctrine, (if true)
with both hands. But this Hiſtory is too
freſh in our Memories to be tranſpos'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd.</p>
               <p>It is true, Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and many others,
thought Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> a great <hi>Mecaenas,</hi>
and favourer of Puritans, who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
call'd Preſbyterians. There were hot
Diſputes by other Epiſcopal Men againſt the
five Articles, againſt incroachments upon our
Liberty Civil and Religious; therefore theſe
Epiſcopal Men rais'd the War: This Sequel or
Conſequence you cannot make good; or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62157:111"/>
if you ſet down this Argument categorically,
I will deny the <hi>Major in Aeternum.</hi> You
may as well bottom our late difference
betwixt King and Parliament, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Quarrel betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
Had Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> liv'd, do you think he
would have eſpouſed the Parliaments Cauſe?
<hi>Qui pauca reſpicit, de facili pronuntiat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What you ſay about the many Sheets
you have prepar'd, I tell you as formerly,—I
do not court your trouble. I cannot
ſuppoſe that you have taken ſo much pains to
be buried in my Desk; nor ſhall I willingly
examine ſuch a Bundle, without the expoſing
my Sentiments to the Suffrages of the learned
World.</p>
               <p>You excuſe the expreſſion of a <hi>Syriack Sot:</hi>
And becauſe you tell me the occaſion of it,
I will tell you my ſurmiſe. I had thought you
had perſtring'd a dear and old Acquaintance
of mine, who for his humble ſelf-denial, and
deep Learning in the Languages, is <hi>stupor
Mundi</hi> both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>You ſpeak of <hi>my groſs mistakes:</hi> But if
there be no other than you name, let any Man
that underſtands ſenſe read the Papers, and
perpend the ſtate of the Controverſie, and
I dare boldly ſay, he will fall into the ſame
Toil. Your Explicatory <hi>Clavis</hi> has expedited
me out of that intanglement. And I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to be reſolute in quarreling. It
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62157:112"/>
is a ſtrange courteſie you tender me of ſending
me your Lads ſcraps. If I had not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
meaſure of that kind of Learning, I
could have a better Tutor; who, as I told you,
is the Glory of his Age. I have known preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Boys,—<hi>praecocis Ingenii,</hi> come from
<hi>Westminster</hi> School, fraught with a Cyclopaedy
of Languages; and yet before they have left
the Colledge, they have ſcarce retain'd any
foot-ſteps thereof, <hi>unus in omnibus,</hi> &amp;c. Juſt
as you have ſeen the beauty of a fair Face,
either by Sickneſs or Age, ſo obliterated and
furrow'd, that there's no more remainder of
Beauty left, than there is of <hi>Troy,</hi> in thoſe
plow'd Fields where it once ſtood.</p>
               <p>The Fathers were good Divines; yet as Dr.
<hi>Hackwell</hi> obſerves,—Among the <hi>Latins</hi> St.
<hi>Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> Among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> did
excel in the Oriental Languages.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of your Charge I cannot
but take unkindly: You ſay <hi>I prefer Shreds
before true Knowledge in Divinity, and real
Science.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir! here you ſpeak without Book: For I
have neither ſaid ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor can you cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
infer it from any thing I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
I know not how to confute you, but
by wiſhing you knew me better. When I
have heard Sermons at the Univerſity as
ſmooth as Glaſs, ſo that the Art in word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them did <hi>opus ſuperare;</hi> I have declar'd
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62157:112"/>
to Perſons of no ſmall Place,—that ſuch
ſlippery Preaching, and Cadencies of words,
will ſpoil all in the Country: Such Sermons
will reach no further than the Ears, and be
look'd on as Romantick Harrangues. You
know what <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tullies Hortenſius:</hi>
The ſame ſay I of ſuch Preaching, which tends
not to advance Piety and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Now worthy Sir! For as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Luther:</hi> Think of me what you pleaſe, I
will acknowledge your worth in many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
And as for Abſoluteneſs, it is ſo
incompetible an Attribute to Man, that I
know you do not aſpire unto it: I am ſorry;
and it ſhall be for a lamentation, to ſee in
your late Writings a Foundation laid for a
grand Schiſm in this Church, as things now
ſtand.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, <hi>ſupra totam materiam,</hi> to
re-inforce my Perſwaſive by this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
—Have not you ſeen Preſbytery ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
Epiſcopacy? Independency, Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?
Have not you ſeen Anabaptiſm with
one foot in the Stirrup? And who knows
but (as <hi>Montanus</hi> ſaid of the Holy Ghoſt)
Quakers and Fifth-monarchy-men might
have had their turns? Nay, Papiſts and
Atheiſts, if thoſe days of Anarchy and Non-conformity
had continued. If you ſaw the
boldneſs of Papiſts, and their great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
where I ſometimes exerciſe my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62157:113"/>
you would count it no ſmall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that ſuch fluctuations are limited by
Reformed Biſhops in a Reformed Church.
It ſhall be my Prayer therefore, that you
were not almoſt, but altogether a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>

                  <salute>Dear Sir!</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have always had a great Veneration for
that Biſhop who never approach'd your
<hi>Oxon:</hi> though in his Epiſcopal Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and Declining years; but whil'ſt
he was in the way, when he firſt ſaw your
riſing Towers, he alighted from his Horſe:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62157:114"/>
And in the open Field, proſtrating himſelf
upon our Common Mother the Earth, He
paid his Duty, to his Mother the Univerſity:
or rather, the Tribute of Praiſes unto God,
who firſt brought him thither.</p>
               <p>In like manner, Sir! The Senſe of that
Mercy and Goodneſs, which I have ſeen, and
taſted within your Walls; has prompted me
to ſay—<hi>How beautiful are thy Tents, O</hi> Oxford!
If at any time, from <hi>Shot-Over,</hi> or any of thoſe
Adjacent Hills, I have (as from Mount <hi>Nebo)</hi>
beheld your Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> And well I
may call it ſo; where there has been ſuch
a torrent of Milk and Honey; The <hi>Sincere
milk of Gods Word:</hi> And that, which is <hi>ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than honey;</hi> I earning, and Religion. Theſe
are the genuine ſtreams of that Fountain,
except it be mudded by ſome ſtrange Cattle;
or poyſoned by Principles of a Forreign
growth. If any come from you, either
looſe, or illiterate; they are but degenerous
Plants, that never taſted the ſweetneſs of
your Soil: nor bow'd themſelves to your
Diſcipline. They are but the Wenns and
Cancers of your body; Or rather Inſects,
hatch'd out of their own ill humours, which
they brought with them thither, out of their
Countrey, Schools, or Families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir!</hi> Our Friendſhip is no Muſhrome,
ſprung up the other Night: But it is almoſt
immemorial: of ſo long ſtanding. that I am
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62157:114"/>
even puzzled, to trace it up to its firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
or to ſhew, where was the head of this
Nile. She was a very unhappy Girle, who
had ſo long liv'd under an Act of wanton <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence;</hi>
that ſhe could ſcarce ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that ſhe had been a Virgin. But it is the
Crown of your Kindneſs, that I am not able
to tell, when It was otherwiſe. Yet All this
while, I never Acquainted you with one
notable change, or diſpenſation, which befell
me at <hi>Oxon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I came thither (bleſſed be God) well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
in the Firſt Table; Religion towards
God. My deareſt Friends were accounted
<hi>Puritanes,</hi> in thoſe days; yet I had not learn'd
my Duty to the King. I look'd upon him,
as an ordinary Man: And if things went not
well (that is) in my Apprehenſion, I was too
ready to murmur againſt his Government.
But, to Pray for him, to ſpeak Reverently of
him, as God's Vicegerent, And to give him
that Obedience, which was his Due; I had
not learn'd. Conſcience was not ſo well Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as to concern It ſelf in theſe things. They
ſeem'd to me Indifferent Acts: they might
be done; or they might be left undone:
They were no Eſſential parts of my Religion:
But altogether Extrinſecal to it: until with
<hi>David, I went into the houſe of God.</hi> I mean,
upon a day of Inauguration, I heard Dr. <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
of <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledg, Preach at St. <hi>Maries,</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:62157:115"/>
on <hi>1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. I exhort, that firſt of all, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
Prayers, Interceſſions, and Giving of
Thanks, be made for all men, for Kings, and
all that are in Authority,</hi> &amp;c. He ſhew'd ſo
Invincibly from hence, That all theſe do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
even to wicked Emperors, and Kings;
that I was thorowly convinc't of my Former
Errour; And had Cauſe <hi>to Report, That God
was there of a truth.</hi> Had you ſate in Mr.
<hi>Nye</hi>'s Chair, among the <hi>Triars;</hi> you would
have look'd on ſuch a Tranſmutation, as an
Act of Converſion. But ſuch a Confeſſion
before thoſe <hi>Rabbies,</hi> would have been ſo far
from an Evidence of grace (ſo much was this
word Abus'd) that it had been enough, to
have drawn down an <hi>Anathema.</hi> It would
not have been eaſie to have Eſcap'd the brand
of a <hi>Malignant Carnaliſt,</hi> (I ſpeak to ſoftly)
of an Abſolute Reprobate. In ſuch Requeſt
was Loyalty then. And have theſe Leopards
(do you think) chang'd their Spots? Let
them come forth! let's ſee their penitent
tears, wherewith they have waſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Let them come, but to the very
threſhold of Repentance; in an Humble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of their Guilt, before God,
and his Church; And we will be more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
unto Them in allowing Them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
than they have been to Us. I much
fear, the King's <hi>Indulgence</hi> has not melted
them, and put upon them a Royal ſtamp.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62157:115"/>
Nay? Do's it not harden them? Do they not
think themſelves the beſt of Subjects, to whom
ſo great a favour is vouchſafed? Will they
not expect hereafter to be humour'd, rather
than govern'd? As if they were a People of
the greateſt moment, and weight in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the Kingdom, to whom the Laws
themſelves muſt bow, and bend; rather than
they muſt be diſpleaſed?</p>
               <p>But I am come from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho:</hi>
from my Mother's genuine Sons, to a ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Offspring. Therefore, like a man that is
affrighted, with the ſight of Wolves and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
I will betake my ſelf out of this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
unto my beloved <hi>Oxford</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Sir! Your Lot is fallen to you in a fair
ground. You may Converſe with Men, and
Books; breath in Libraries, until you become
one your ſelf; and you may ranſack the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Treaſures of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Had not I a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
Kindneſs for you, I would tell you,
I envy your Condition. It coſt me many a
tear, when I parted from thoſe Cloiſters;
when by an heavy Judgment, it came to my
turn, to be taken; and to yours, to be left.
It was like the Haling, and Dragging of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Member, from its own Natural Body; or
the lugging a fond Child from his Mother's
Breaſt.</p>
               <p>I look'd upon Going into the Countrey, as
if I had been Condemned; or Baniſh'd. Nay!
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62157:116"/>
as if I had been Sentenc'd into a Region of
Death.</p>
               <p>But did I ſay, that I am parted from your
Society? No. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> told <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi>
you ſhall never find a Club, Knotty, and
Crabbed enough, to drive me from you. I
will be with you ſtill, in the Contemplation
of my Mind. In admiring your happineſs:
for as <hi>Plato</hi>'s Love, was in Abſtracted, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Beauties, ſo it is not impoſſible for
my purer part, my Mind (without the help
of Atoms) to take many a pleaſant, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Turn, in your Galleries. You have your
Pilgrims, as well as <hi>Loretto,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,
Ariſtotle</hi>'s Well has more Savour and Virtue,
than St. <hi>Winnifred</hi>'s. Therefore I will be
with you ſtill (Maugre all unkindneſs) in
my Devotions: Praying, That <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Plenty</hi> may be <hi>within your Walls.</hi>

               <p>WHen I firſt Read the <hi>Indulgence;</hi> I

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62157:116"/>

ſaid I, art thou to the Church of

That the Smoke, and Smother of it, would

Nay! They ſhall not be fit to be put in the

theſe begin again to diſplay their gifts; and
think, they can ſcan a Text, and ſound the
depth of Scripture, as well as the profoundeſt

by a ſullen kind of gravity; a loud and bold
utterance; and extatical Devotion, and a down
look, as if they had loſt that <hi>Os ſublime</hi> which
God beſtowed upon them at firſt; or as if
thoſe Optick Nerves, which naturally draw
and pullice up the Eyes towards Heaven,
were either crack'd, or broken. One would
think ſuch a popular <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> were the
moſt humble, the moſt mortify'd lump, as
ever was quickened, with a living Soul: And
yet that Shrub in Semblance, is higher in his
own conceit than the talleſt Cedar. He does

chime with every Pathetical expreſſion. Their

and their Sighs to Eccho; like ſome hollow
Cave, or Cavern of the Earth. Hither,

about a Dung-hil, or beſiege a dead Carcaſs.

               <p>Is not this enough to make your Students
to throw away their Books? to divert their

               <p>Sir! I have found, by long Experience, that
you have had a Compliance and Sympathy
with me, in moſt things of Concern. As if
one Soul had been divided, betwixt us both:
we have condol'd, we have rejoyc'd together;
you cannot then, but grieve with me, to
foreſee that deſolation and widowhood;
which is like to befall our Mother the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity:
when the moſt Pregnant Wits ſhall
have a damp come upon them, and even
ſmother them in their Neſts. What need ſo
much Watching? ſo much conſulting the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and Monuments of the Dead? when
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62157:118"/>
the Reading ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neotericks, will

               <p>SIR! As you have communicated, and
transferr'd to me the Occurrences of the
Univerſity; and ſo have allay'd the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
of my Countrey-Solitude; ſo (in an
unequal exchange and requital) I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
unto you the Affairs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
And becauſe nothing has been more
welcom to you, than to hear how it goes
with the Church; with God's Ark: And
thoſe deſerve to be look'd upon, as our beſt,
and moſt faithful Friends, who are the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
Votaries for the welfare of <hi>Zion:</hi> If
Religion ſit cloſe to their Hearts, we need
not fear to Repoſe our ſelves upon their Laps.
Therefore that I might ſatisfie your Pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
I inform'd you what Progreſs our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62157:120"/>
made in theſe Parts. I told you,
where the Labourers in the Lord's Vineyard,
were <hi>Labourers</hi> indeed; when they preach'd
well, and liv'd well: There were ſcarce any
<hi>party-colour'd, ſpeckled Cattle</hi> in our Flocks.
Such as had been formerly great Diſſenters,
<hi>went with the multitude to the houſe of God;</hi>
joyning with us in Prayers, Sermons, and
Sacraments: ſo that you would have ſaid in
an holy Admiration,—<hi>Who are theſe that come
as Doves to their windows?</hi> There were ſcarce
any that did ſo much as mutter againſt our
Doctrine, or Diſcipline; except here and
there an over-grown Schiſmatick; or a ſilly
Woman, who was as weak in her Reaſon, as
ſtrong in her Paſſion: who in a Proud ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
would not conſent to this Harmony;
leſt ſhe ſhould be accounted no wiſer than
her Neighbours. It's ſtrange (you'l ſay) ſhe
would not be in the faſhion. If this Sex
muſt be humour'd with the loſs of our Peace;
we deſerve to be accounted Effeminate, as
well as to be unhappy. <hi>Luther</hi> gave a good

But whil'ſt our Tongues were running
over with Praiſes; and our Hearts with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>to ſee of the Travel of our Souls;</hi> and to
behold ſuch a ſtupendious Bleſſing upon our
Miniſtery; whil'ſt the Papiſts did even gnaſh
with their Teeth, to ſee us Concentre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſo happy a <hi>Syncretiſm,</hi> and to build
our ſelves up in the ſame Faith, upon the
ſame Foundation; in comes a Ball of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
which ſcattered us into Corners. This
unravell'd all our Webs, confuted all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
turn'd our Joy into Mournings; and
in a moment caſt to the ground, what we had
been many years in erecting. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we little Artiſts have labour'd for the
wind, in Preaching up Peace, Order, and
Unanimity, for theſe ſeveral years; when
that great Body, the Parliament, reap no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Whirlwind; and have brought
forth nothing but untimely fruit, for ſeveral
Centuries. One bruſh of this Beſom, ſweeps
away the Webs of all their Church-Laws. It
was not ſo in the time of <hi>H. 3.</hi> for when
there was a Motion, tending to the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Law; the Barons, and Earls gave
this ſhort Anſwer—<hi>Nolumus leges Angliae
mutari:</hi> and good reaſon: for a City may be
as ſafe without Walls; as a Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Laws. Nay; as if the Plague of <hi>Athens</hi>
had been amongſt us; we began to ſtand off,
and ſtare one upon another, as if we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62157:121"/>
                  <hi>That ever we went to the Houſe of God
as Friends:</hi> I am ſure you are ſuch an exact
Maſter in Story, that you well know what
is ſaid of <hi>Thoſe that recover'd from that Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
That <hi>they were ſo ſtupify'd, that they
had forgotten their neareſt Friends.</hi> But though
they are willing on a ſudden; to forget, and
caſt us off, and to reject our Doctrines of
Piety, Peace, and Obedience: yet, will they
not return to their former Vomit? Have
they forgotten to Judge? Cenſure? and to
ſhed the blood of their Brethrens names?
Have they forgotten to Sequeſter? and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh?
Had they but another <hi>Declaration,</hi> to
Authoriſe them thereunto. The Lion (they
ſay) may be ſo tam'd, that you may ſtroke
him, and he may lick you; yet if his tongue
(which is rough) draw the leaſt blood, with
his ſlaver; he is ſo raviſh'd with the Savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
of it, that he is put into a rage: So, the
fierceſt Schiſmaticks may be ſo gentle, that
they will fawn upon you for a time; yet if
they do but taſte the ſweetneſs of Power and
Liberty, you are in danger of begging a
<hi>Toleration</hi> of them; who were ſo free, to let
them looſe; and to take off from them, the
Awe of Legal Reſtraint. If Beaſts break out
of their own Paſtures, and feed on the other
ſide of the Hedge; it will not be eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them from their wandring Purlieus, into
their ancient bounds; many Children have
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62157:121"/>
been utterly undone, by too Indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
I wiſh this <hi>Religious liberty,</hi> do not
make them wanton in matters Civil; And
that this Toleration in the Church; do not
make way; for another in the State. Some
Birds, when they are let out of the Cage,
will not ſtoop preſently to the Lure. And
Head-ſtrong Horſes, having once ſhak'd off
the Bridle; will never ceaſe running, until
they have thrown off the Saddle too. I have
always thought that Regularity in the
Church, and faithful Preaching there; has
been the beſt School to educate, and train
up the beſt and moſt conſcionable Subjects.
Therefore, it was the Saying of a wiſe man,
<hi>That Schiſm is worſe than Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
For that tends to the diſſolution of the
<hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and this is but an ill humour in
the Body, that ends in Death: This, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.
We ſee this in a mirrour before our
faces How are we crumbled, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Atoms, by the late Thunderbolt; who
ſtood together, a little before, as an Army
with Banners? terrible to our Enemies: love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and beautiful to our Friends. <hi>How hath
the Lord cover'd the Daughter of Zion, with
a cloud in his anger, and caſt down from Heaven
the beauty of Iſrael, and remembred not his
foot-ſtool, in the day of his anger?</hi> Sir, I am
in ſo Tragical a vein, that I could even tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the whole Book of the <hi>Lamentations:</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:62157:122"/>
for we are not only broken into ſhivers;
our ſtrength, and ſpirits waſted in vain;
and our pleaſant fruit blaſted: But the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ears are precluded, and ſtopt (like the
Companions of <hi>Vlyſſes)</hi> that they will not
hearken to our Charms. If we Preach up
Peace, and Unity; this is to caſt Pearls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Swine, who are ready to turn again,
and rent us in pieces for our labours. This
is not their Element. They muſt have more
of the Whirlwind. What? Preach up Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law? This is little better,
than Rebellion againſt the Law-maker: And
Treaſon againſt the King. The wind is
turn'd; and beats back our Arrows into our
own faces; we told them formerly, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
War againſt the King. How juſtly, let
Heaven and Earth bear witneſs! Now, they
tell us, we are the King's Enemies, if we
ſpeak a tittle againſt private Meetings; And
this venomous ſhaft, pierces deepeſt of all.
What? Shall thoſe that have pray'd, paid,
fought againſt the King? Reproach thoſe for
<hi>Traitors,</hi> who have loſt Blood and Eſtates,
and jeoparded their very Lives for him? who
Preach up Obedience and Loyalty to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
perſon, and Government. I dare ſay,
that never any King, had a more Loyal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
The poor Levites of old, did never put
forth their ſtrength, more chearfully, to carry
the Ark; than we do, to ſupport the Throne:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62157:122"/>
As if it were not only our Duty; but our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
to <hi>Honour the King.</hi> I ſay not this,
as if we did ſupererogate, or merit; but that
we are moſt willing to do what we can, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Diſcharge of our Conſciences, to
<hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the King.</hi> And ſhould the King
think it fit, in his <hi>Ratio de Stato,</hi> to deveſt
us of all our Imployments; and to put us
under the very Harrows of our Adverſaries,
to tyrannize over us, as in the days of Yore;
yet we would be as Zealous, for the Honour
and Safety of his Sacred Majeſty; as when we
<hi>wept by the Waters of</hi> Babylon; <hi>faſted</hi> and
<hi>pray'd</hi> for his Return to his juſt Inheritance.
Nay! when we trudged many a Mile, to
Perſons of Quality, and Eſtates (who were
propitious to us, in thoſe days of <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi>
to pay ſome Tribute to their <hi>exil'd
Prince.</hi> You well know, who <hi>carried their
Lives</hi> in their hands; that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it like <hi>David</hi>'s Worthies; they ruſh'd
thorow the very Army of the Philiſtims, that
they might refreſh their drooping King, with
the waters of <hi>Bethlem;</hi> and who they were,
that were deeply engaged in all Deſigns, to
dethrone <hi>Olofernes:</hi> that our Rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
might be reſtor'd to his Crown; when
ſome of theſe very Men, who are now ſhield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſhelter'd under this <hi>Indulgence,</hi> ſaid
where is now your King? Nay! where is
young <hi>Tarquine? Ch. St.?</hi> Juſt as <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62157:123"/>
Enemies inſulted over him, in his diſtreſs,
ſaying,—<hi>Where is now thy God?</hi> yet neither
Reproaches, nor Threatnings (though we
ſaw the blood of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi>
ſhed before our faces) could abate our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Courage in ſo good a Cauſe. Were
it not for this; I ſhould be like a man that
paſſes over a narrow Bridge, and then looks
back, and wonders how he came over; ſo
ſhould I be amaz'd, how we that were bred
up in Calls, and wrapt up in ſoft Gowns,
ſhould paſs thorow ſo many hazards; were
it not, for the Integrity of Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and the Providence of a good God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
And what? are we transformed now?
Are Men turn'd into Hogs, and Hogs into
Men? If this Indulgence has made them loyal,
to all intents and purpoſes; without Reſerves
and Equivocations; it is the beſt, and moſt
wonderful effect it is like to work: for I
perceive by ſad Experience, That it is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a work, thorowly to Convert one of
theſe <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as to carry Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi>
upon one's back. I will aſſure you, I
have laboured much, in convincing, and
<hi>perſwading</hi> ſome of them to be true Members
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. The work was done
in appearance. They ſeem'd to be, not only
<hi>Proſelytes of the Gate;</hi> but of <hi>Juſtice</hi> too. In
every thing ſubmitting to, and approving
our orders. Yet when <hi>liberty</hi> of Meetings
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62157:123"/>
was proclaim'd; off flies theſe <hi>Demases:</hi> like
a company of Ducklings, hatch'd under an
Hen: They follow her, and ſhe Hives them
under her wings; but if they come near
their own Element, the water; the Hen may
cluck her heart out: They are turned Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado's;
and will have none of her company.
And no wonder: for one of the <hi>Bel-weathers</hi>
of this Flock, bleated formerly, like an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Sheep; as if he intended Unity, and <hi>the
healing Church-Diviſions.</hi> But when there
was tidings of an <hi>Indulgence:</hi> He turns his
ſtyle; and ſtrikes up an Alarm, for Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Schiſm. His word is,—<hi>As you were:</hi>
He puſhes again, with his old Horns; which
had been hid for a time, under wool; as
the Viper covers his teeth under ſoft fleſh.</p>
               <p>Sir! I fear, this melancholick Diſcourſe, has
made you ſad: And indeed, who can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
that ſees the ſad fate of Religion: How
it is gone backward, more degrees, than ever
the Sun did, in the <hi>Dial of Ahaz.</hi> Not only
the diſguiſed Sectaries, who were <hi>perſwaded
to be almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> have returned to their
former Vomit: They are as buſie, as ever;
in undermining our Walls; widening our
cloſing wounds; and pouring in <hi>Wine</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Oyle)</hi> into them. But the prophane
<hi>Gallio's,</hi> have their Conventicles too. The
Ale-houſes ſtrut with theſe Companions; why,
ſay they, may not we meet, and have our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62157:124"/>
liberty; as well as every Faction, has leave,
to bandy together, and gratifie the Itch of
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir ſeveral humours? The very Peaſants
can tell us, if we give a check to their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies—
That now, <hi>they have liberty of
Conſcience.</hi> And this is not ſtrange in them,
when ſome Lawyers have mooted the Caſe;
<hi>Whether there be any Penalties remaining, for
Drunkards, and Whoremaſters?</hi> Thus the
meer Moraliſt, and Natural man, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to Atheiſm, is hardened againſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And that Sect amongſt us, who ſeem
to be moſt Zealous for Religion, in obſerving
the Chriſtian Sabbath (as if on a ſudden, they
were become Ranters) do's moſt ſcandalouſly
prophane it. I know, this word will be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
with much Kecking, and reluctancy;
yet let the beſt of their Caſuiſts, ſtate and
determine it otherwiſe if they dare: After
they have conſidered with themſelves impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
Whether it be not a breach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
to Run or Ride ſix or ſeven miles on
that Day, to hear a gifted Preacher; when
they might have heard the word of Truth
and Salvation, rightly divided, and applied
at home. Is not this to play the Wantons,
with thoſe things which are moſt Sacred? Is
not this, to ſlight, contemn, reproach, and
diſcourage their own painful Miniſters, <hi>who
watch for their Souls?</hi> and to teach others to
do ſo, by their example: when God himſelf
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62157:124"/>
has Commanded, to reverence, and honour
him, with <hi>double honour.</hi> Nay! let them
ſay it cloſe to their hearts, Whether theſe
Tranſactions do not ſavour of the <hi>Myſtery of
Iniquity.</hi> I know they are forward enough,
to lay this Brat at the doors of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
for me; let it lye there: yet 'tis worth their
ſecond thoughts, Whether ſuch dealings are
not <hi>Iniquity?</hi> yet a <hi>Myſterie;</hi> becauſe they
are cruſted, and cover'd over, with a pretence
of Piety, and Devotion.</p>
               <p>I know, you will wonder, that they are
ſo forward, to leave wholſom, and ſolid meat;
to run after Kickſhaws. Will you give me
leave to divine? They are in pain, and do
Penance in keeping off their hats; and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the publick. They are of <hi>Judas</hi> his
mind; that all is <hi>waſted,</hi> which is ſpent in an
outward Reverence, and a bodily honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Maker. They muſt be more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with God: ſit <hi>cheek by Jole</hi> with him;
and be <hi>hale fellow well met,</hi> with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
that they may reaſon the Caſe with him
(if need be) upon even terms: As when they
ſaid, Lord! why did'ſt thou leave us in the
<hi>Weſt?</hi> Why did'ſt thou forſake us at <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whil'ſt our <hi>Religioſo's,</hi> are thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
their ways, it is pretty to obſerve;
how the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> do
ſalute and embrace each other; who could
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62157:125"/>
ſcarce agree together, in our Remembrance,
in the ſame College, City, or Kingdom, yet
now they throng together into the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

                  <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate; Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
have joyn'd hands againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Juda.</hi>
And that you may ſee, what Wonders this
<hi>Indulgence</hi> worketh, Thoſe that pretended
weakneſs, and diſability of Body, to go a
ſtones throw, to their own Churches: They
would ſigh, as if they were ready to expire,
if we deſired their Company there: yet now,
they can riſe early in the morning, and
Gallop ſeveral Miles, to a <hi>Meeting.</hi> The
King (you ſee) is a moſt Sovereign Phyſitian:
He can heal all Maladies, and Diſtempers;
He can make an old decrepit Sectary, to find
new legs, and new ſtrength, and to grow
young again, all over. Before you lay down
your Admiration, concerning theſe Aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
men, tell me, if you can, how thoſe,
that have lifted up their hands to Heaven, in
the <hi>ſolemn League and Covenant,</hi> againſt a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of other Religions; can kiſs the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calf of a <hi>Vniverſal Indulgence;</hi> and yet
tell us, we go about to wound their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
and perſwade them to be perjur'd:
If we perſwade them to declare—<hi>There is no
Obligation in the Covenant,</hi> let the next Age
expound theſe prevaricating Riddles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:62157:125"/>
I know they ſay, we value our Reputations
ſo much; that we are loth that others ſhould
ſhare with us. And have we not a Cauſe?
If our Credit be ſtain'd, our Preaching will
be of little moment. <hi>Alexander</hi> got moſt
Victories, by the glory of his Name. Did not
St. <hi>Paul</hi> complain of thoſe who would <hi>exclude</hi>
him out of the Affections of the People?
Therefore, to keep our names intemerate, and
free from the ſullying breath of calumniating
Traducers; 'tis not a vain affectation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but a neceſſary means, to make our
Miniſtery effectual.</p>
               <p>They tell us too, that we have our Tithes
allow'd us ſtill: we may gnaw our Cruſt in a
corner, without ſnarling at others. True! if
our aims in taking on us this Angelical Office
were ſo low, as only to look after the Loaves,
and the Milk, without any care of the Flock.
As if a man ſhould marry a Wife, meerly for
Portion; and then ſuffer her to be proſtituted
to the Luſts of other Men. Nay! It is the
ready way, to expoſe us, to the Scorns and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
of our People; to give us their Tithes,
and yet to allow them liberty, to chooſe their
Miniſtery; for the Country People do not
dote upon ſuch as take their Tithes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they cannot be avenged on their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
any other ways, they will leave them in
their Pulpits by themſelves.</p>

from the Imputation of being an

nothing that is <hi>ſinful,</hi> in order to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
How this has been manag'd in an

the <hi>Policy, Government,</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the

againſt them. Who will care, what Volumes

take it for granted; That whatever has been

               <p>But he goes on. <hi>Let him procure us leave,

and then let him tell us, that we were better

You may imagine this man ſtanding, with

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62157:127"/>
vaunting; as if he would beat down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

As if he would fly over the <hi>Alps,</hi> had he but

Sword, <hi>Let him but procure us leave, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
our Reaſons againſt Conformity.</hi> The man
is grown modeſt, and mannerly: He has
done as much as this amounts to, formerly,
without asking <hi>leave.</hi> But what need is there
of elaborate Reaſons againſt <hi>toyes?</hi> muſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

Keen? as to hinder any man from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

or that he had ſtrange Diſcoveries in his

tied with a Gordian knot.</p>
               <p>He complains that <hi>his Tongue is tyed.</hi> If
he had ſpoken the truth; their had not been
much loſs to this part of the World. Had
his tongue been <hi>tyed,</hi> with a Cable-Rope, to

for by ſo doing, he would have looſed a

this Author for above theſe thirty years, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew him ſubject to this Infirmity, or
once guilty of ſuch a Diſtemper. His tongue
has been rolling in his mouth continually.
And ever and anon (like Mount <hi>Aetna)</hi> has
belch'd forth ſome wildfire; wherewith he
has ſcorch't thoſe that ſtood in his way: this
is not that <hi>Ignitum Eloquium</hi> which was ſaid
to be in St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> His tongue has been
like a troubled Sea; caſting up <hi>dirt</hi> and <hi>mire</hi>
into the face of the Church. He has been

wretches in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> that rave day, and night;
or ſome Impetuous chiding Women, whoſe

               <p>I am ſure, you read better Books, and place
your time better, than to ſtoop to Canting

for want of Money, to buy the Volumes of
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers; or elſe want
of Skill to underſtand them: or leiſure to
read them, are forc't to take up with Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
in our Mother-tongue; ſuch as the
<hi>Pedlars</hi> furniſh us with, at our Doors. Among
others, this <hi>Tongue-ty'd</hi> Scribe, furniſhes us
with the greateſt plenty. His pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
voids a Book, almoſt every Month.
He is as fruitful as a Rabbit. Nay! He
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62157:128"/>
tells the world, he made ſome of them (as
that <hi>of the Grotian Religion)</hi> in four, or five
days.</p>
               <p>He had little cauſe to ſay, <hi>'Tis eaſie to
talk, where none muſt confute:</hi> whereas, we do
not find that he either fears Laws, or Men.
Nor can any man give him a word; but he
has receiv'd three for it. You may as eaſily
<hi>bind the Influences of</hi> Orion, or ſtop the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,

<q>Quid tanto dignum feret hic promiſſor hiatu?</q>
what muſt we expect, when this Mountain?
this <hi>Behemoth,</hi> ſhall groan, and bring forth?
Some Maſculine Offspring ſure. If ſo, It is

hatch'd theſe hundred years. <hi>T. C.</hi> ſaw as far
into this Controverſie, as <hi>R. B.</hi> yet what ſaid

               <p>It may be (with <hi>Bolſech,</hi> or <hi>Aretine)</hi> this
great Undertaker may ſnort out his foam;
and be-dirt us with his Reproaches: But if
neither he, nor his, might have a <hi>Toleration</hi>
of all Religions, until they can evince by Dint
of Argument, that they cannot have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with our Church, <hi>without Sin:</hi> ſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62157:128"/>
that there is a Neceſſity to <hi>come out of her,</hi>
and ſeparate from her; we need not fear,
that our peace and quiet ſhould be diſturb'd,
either by the lowing of the Oxen, on the

the other.</p>
               <p>But Sir! Take notice of his Threatners
Ingenuity, and Candour. He would make
the world believe, his tongue is <hi>ty'd:</hi> He
cannot Print his Sentiments, on this Subject.
I am inform'd, and I dare ingage to make it
good, That after he had complain'd of this
Obſtruction; and had in many Sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
reaſon'd againſt Conformity; he receiv'd
Anſwers accordingly, from one of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he taxes for <hi>toys;</hi> and mentions with
Scorn. Yet when it was freely offer'd him,
that the Papers on both Sides might be
Printed; that ſo the world might ſee, what
he could ſay, againſt the Oeconomy of our
Church, and our Compliance with it; then
this daring Hector declin'd his own Motion:
and in cold blood, refuſed; that his Reaſons
(ſuch as they were) ſhould ſee the light:
Accuſing him of <hi>diſhoneſty,</hi> that ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to do it; yet, as if he were quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, upon the publick Stage, than what
he was in the private tiring Room; He ſays
in his late Book, and to the ſame effect in a
former: <hi>Let him procure us leave, but to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
our Reaſons againſt Conformity: then let
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62157:129"/>
him tell us, that we were better to Conform;
when he hath anſwered them.</hi> He had leave:
And what Reaſons he propos'd, have been
anſwer'd. But you know, the followers of
a baffled Cauſe, muſt be animated, and their
Spirits ſupported; not by what is; or has
been done: but by the bold brags of their
Leaders, what they will do for the Future.
Juſt like a Prodigious Coward, that never
looks more fierce with his Eyes, or ſtruggles
more violently to aſſault his Antagoniſt; than
when the ſlanders by (who are his beſt
Friends) hold his hands, and pinnion his Arms.
It is a fond Preſumption, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> is their
Friend, which puts ſuch Spirit into them. If
they once find that he tolerates them, as God
permits Sin; we ſhall hear no more of their
Challenges.</p>

               <p>When Miniſters walk by the ſame Rule,
and maintain one <hi>ſound form of words,</hi> as it
was among the Apoſtles, and is ſtill, among
thoſe that have ſubſcribed the ſame Articles

then they may be Coadjutors, and lend an

Sturgeon, they will ſwim againſt the ſtream;
and be weary of thoſe, that are in preſent
Office. Therefore <hi>the violence of Factions,
argues the weakneſs of Princes: For when they
are carried audaciouſly, it is a ſign, that the
Reverence of Government is loſt.</hi> And then
you know what follows. If a Son hath part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his awe towards his Father, he will
pay but little Obedience to him. Therefore
our late bleſſed Sovereign, gave this Divine
Advice to our preſent Monarch,—<hi>Neither to
fear, nor flatter any Faction: for if ever he
ſtand in need of them, or muſt ſtand to their
courteſie, he will be undone.</hi> It is to be fear'd,
that theſe hot, and buſie Factioniſts, will be
no better Friends at laſt to Magiſtrates
themſelves; than they are to us, and our
Miniſtery. They begin already to Muſter

And there are not thoſe wanting
among them, who are too well acquainted
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62157:131"/>

No time for the ſettling the Seed of the Word
in the furrows of their hearts? for ruminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and digeſting what is heard? Superfoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is monſtrous in Nature; and the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Do theſe Men grow more than others, in
the dimenſions of Religion, by their gadding
up and down? I have ſeen Sheep kept within
their bounds, in a Barren and hard Paſture;
yet by reſting quietly in their own Limits,
they have gathered Wool, and Fleſh upon
their Backs; when thoſe that have crept
Hedges, and have gone from one ground to
another, have loſt their Fleeces, and have
been little better than Carrion; ſo, many
plain honeſt Countreymen, who live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
under the droppings of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
which God hath providentially ſet over
them, thrive more in real goodneſs, than
theſe <hi>Diſputers of this World;</hi> who are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up and down, with an <hi>Oeſtrum</hi> of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and devour innumerable Sermons; yet
at laſt, are like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine. They
have paſs'd thorow ſo many brakes; that their
Conſciences are torn, and become as peel'd
and Schiſmatical, as themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Mothers Milk, is moſt kindly for the

               <p>This is as true, as Scripture. But where

One way of Preaching and Diſcipline here;

his Solitude; for he could not conceive, How
they could be proper Phyſicians, who had ſo great

ſay the ſame? Are they like to be our <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>

Piety to God? Loyalty to the King? And
mutual kindneſs towards all Men? who have
been ſo Induſtrious formerly in ſubverting all

without any open Repentance; who are to

bordering upon Idolatry: That our
Conformity is <hi>abſolutely ſinful:</hi> And that we,
are no leſs, than guilty of Ungodly Oaths,
in <hi>Subſcribing, and Declaring.</hi> Thus <hi>they
have been as Serpents in our way, and Adders
in our paths,</hi> Some of our People, who would
ſeem the only <hi>Haſidaei,</hi> or Holy Men in their
Age (whom they have not yet thorowly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

(ſome are <hi>formaliſts,</hi> who would not be

in their Seats, <hi>gaping</hi> and <hi>yawning</hi> (though very
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62157:133"/>
attentive formerly) As if they had not ſlept
the Night before; or rather, as if they were

                  <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the Heretick, was called a <hi>Snake;</hi>
for this very Reaſon, becauſe he lurk'd in
Holes to do miſchief ſecretly by his venom,
and his ſting. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> alſo, were call'd
<hi>Clancularii;</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to Graſhoppers: In that they ſculk'd
here and there, and hopp'd up and down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate
Men, with their ſly Inchantments;
and keep them from Imbracing the Truth,
<hi>in the love of it.</hi> So it is with our whiſpering,
tranſcendent <hi>Beau-Clerks;</hi> let the Publick
Miniſter (if by Mr. <hi>Med</hi>'s leave, that title may
be allowed) be never ſo Learned, and Pious:
never ſo dextrous, at <hi>the Dividing,</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi>
the <hi>Word of Truth;</hi> yet when they
meet with their Partizans, and Comrades in
Separation, they will find out, or invent
ſomething concerning his Perſon or Doctrine;
that they will ſhake their heads, liſt up their
eyes, bleſs themſelves, and pity the <hi>poor
wretch,</hi> before they part. It may be, they
may allow him to have ſome unſanctify'd
Wit, or prophane Learning: But not one
ſcrap of Grace. <hi>He was never acquainted
with the turnings and windings of the Spirit:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62157:134"/>
A cold formaliſt;</hi> one that may go to School
to one of their <hi>Heavenly Teachers.</hi> Thus men
loſe their Judgment, <hi>cum res tranſit in Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi>
when they are byaſs'd with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of their own Paſſions. But <hi>quorſum
haec?</hi> Why all this do you think? Why,
Juſt as <hi>Abſalom</hi> complain'd, That <hi>none were
deputed by his Father to do Juſtice;</hi> therefore
he wiſh'd himſelf in the Saddle, in the <hi>Throne.
O that I was King in</hi> Iſrael! <hi>I would do every
man Right.</hi> They would Preach like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Seraphims,</hi> if they might aſcend our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
and turn us again out of our Houſes.
Therefore 'tis almoſt as credible to me, That
a <hi>Muffti</hi> will aſſiſt a Chriſtian Patriarch;
That a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> will help a <hi>Reformed Prieſt:</hi>
a <hi>Lutheran</hi> go along with a <hi>Calviniſt:</hi> Nay!
a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a <hi>Jew; James and Jambres,
Moſes:</hi> As the Leaders and Guides of Houſe-Meetings,
will help forward the peaceable,
Regular, Soul-ſaving deſign, of ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
as are ſettled in their Provinces, and
Charges by Law: And do conſcionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

               <p>This is no wonder; the old Serpent is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
ſtill. He is not Superannuated; nor
has he put off his deſtroying Policy: As,
<hi>firſt to divide and break the Bond of Vnity;</hi>
And then, to cruſh the whole Community,

               <p>Here is a narrow <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or Bridge to

ſtrangle the Embrio's of Religious Attempts;
or quench the ſparks of an heavenly Zeal;
nor ſeek for ſubterfuges, either for our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or idleneſs, in declining any Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62157:135"/>

what is more neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Now ſince thoſe words in the Acts, <gap reason="foreign">

are the foundation of this Aſſertion;
And they are look'd upon, but as Demi-Miniſters,

to pry and ſearch into all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

and how they are render'd, by Learned Men,
as well as you. Some ſay, they are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,

                  <hi>Vpper Rooms,</hi> or Chambers in

met, for fear of the Jews, to Pray, Preach,
and receive the Sacrament; for the ſame
St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith,—the Apoſtles <hi>were continually
in the Temple, bleſſing and praiſing God.</hi> But
that we may come nearer yet, to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
Brethren: who will be ſure to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and <hi>Accuſe</hi> us, before our People, for
going wrong, If we do not tread in their
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62157:135"/>
ſteps; we can tell them truly, that in ſome
Senſe, our Liturgy, and Canons, do both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and injoyn us to <hi>Preach from houſe to
houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any be Sick, we muſt viſit them; move
them to Repentance for Sin: and upon their
Repentance, Abſolve them; by virtue of
that Authority, which Chriſt hath bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us. After Prayers with them, and for
them, we ſtir them up to Acts of Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that ſo they may with more comfort, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their Souls into the hands of God. I
hope there is no Conſcionable Miniſter, but
he lays hold of all Overtures, to preſerve
the Souls of his People, from the Jaws of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
and Rowſes up himſelf, to aſſiſt thoſe
that are in extremity of bodily weakneſs,
or lye under the Scruples of a troubled
mind. Thus we <hi>Preach from houſe to houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is our buſineſs alſo to reconcile thoſe that
are at variance; to confer with Recuſants;
And when we have any good Call to any
Houſe or Company; we endeavour to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe that are ſeduc'd: To inform the
Ignorant: And <hi>Reprove gainſayers.</hi> If this
be to Preach <hi>in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon:</hi> or
<hi>from houſe to houſe:</hi> we are ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it our Duty, and to take ſhame to our
ſelves, if we come ſhort of it. There are
alſo, many other Caſes of Conſcience, which
may Incidentally, and occaſionally fall in;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62157:136"/>
wherein we are obliged ever in private, to
give what Satisfaction we are able. As alſo
to diſcourage, and keenly to <hi>check</hi> Scandalous
Offenders: To <hi>Comfort thoſe that are caſt
down:</hi> To anſwer pertinent Doubts, and
neceſſary Queſtions, which may be propoſed
unto us.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Apoſtles did practiſe any other
ſort of private Preaching: yet, they have
not left any Precept behind them, to bind
us thereunto. And who dare ſay that we
are bound in every thing they did, to follow
their Example? Conſidering, what they did,
was in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel; and
in dayes of Perſecution. Neither can it,
with Reaſon be imagin'd, that in thoſe dayes,
they went into all Houſes univerſally; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe of the <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces, &amp;c.</hi> for
then they had been Prodigal, in expoſing
their Lives; neither had they leiſure ſo to
do, when every one had ſo large a Dioceſs,
as ſeveral Countreys, and Kingdomes to
preach in: and ſo ſhort a time to ſtay in
them.</p>
               <p>He that performs the former Offices faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
beſides publick preaching, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing,
(if it be lawful to diſtinguiſh betwixt
theſe two) provided, he ſet off all, and adorne
his Doctrine, with an Holy Life; Chriſt
will own him, as his Ambaſſadour: though,
it may be theſe Capricio's will ſcarce ſet <hi>him
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62157:136"/>
with the Doggs of their Flocks.</hi> Our Saviour
<hi>ſpake openly to the World; He ever taught in
the Synagogue and the Temple, whither the
Jews Reſorted.</hi> And in <hi>ſecret he ſaid nothing.</hi>
The Apoſtles alſo excuſed themſelves, that
<hi>they no where raiſed up the People.</hi> But where
they could with ſafety, they Reſorted to the
Synagogue.</p>
               <p>The old Canons did not allow Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be too frequently in Towns. Then
they were accounted to be as much out of
their Element, as to ſee a Fiſh upon the dry
Land; <hi>Facilè contemnitur clericus;</hi> ſaies St.
<hi>Jerome.</hi> That Clergy man will be ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.
That makes himſelf, ſo cheap, and
common, as to go to every Feaſt, and place
where he is invited. If <hi>his lips preſerve
Knowledge, the People are to ſeek the Law at
his Mouth.</hi> Chriſt taxes the People, that
they would not come to him. Though,
ſometimes <hi>He was found of them that ſought
him not.</hi> He that teaches School, does not go
to ſeveral Houſes, where his Scholars dwell:
but thinks he diſcharges his Duty, if he teach
them, when they meet in the place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould go to all Houſes, and deal
with the People there, in private; how ſoon
might we wound our Names? and bring a
Scandal upon our Perſons? Beſides other
Reproaches. This would too much reſemble
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62157:137"/>
falſe Teachers: who had <hi>only a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
without the Power thereof, who crept
into Houſes, and led Captive ſilly Women.</hi>
This Practice has been very ſerviceable, to
ſuch as have made it their Buſineſs, to ſet up
for themſelves; and to make Parties in the
Church. <hi>Great has been this</hi> Diana of the
<hi>Independents,</hi> and other Sectaries. But, <hi>we have
not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> Wo be to us, if we preach
not the Goſpel publickly; when we may.
Such Aſſemblies are moſt for God's Honour:
And Wo be to them, that attend not at <hi>the
Poſts of Wiſdom's Temple,</hi> when there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Impediment to keep them back, and
prefer Peſt-Houſes, before the Gates of
Heaven. You know, who ſet up an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of <hi>Prophecying</hi> among Miniſters. This
was very plauſible in its time; yet afterwards
there was Cauſe to diſcontinue the ſame. And
if this Preaching <hi>from Houſe to Houſe,</hi> has
ever been uſeful to the Church of God; there
may be Reaſon enough now, to forbear the
Practice of it (ſince it is not of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution)
when ſo many ſpeak in the <hi>Language</hi>
of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and under this Pretence, may
eaſily Inſinuate their Hetrodoxies, into the
minds of weak, but Well-meaning People.
Thoſe that are ſo minded, may <hi>bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hereſies;</hi> and countermine all our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
by this Jeſuitical Stratagem: So that
we ſhall weave <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Webb. Beſides;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62157:137"/>
ſome there are, who will have none of our
Divinity. They will even thruſt us out of
their Doors; others are poor, and muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themſelves, and their Families, by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
following of their Callings. And no
doubt, but they may ſerve God on the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
as well in their honeſt and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
labours, as if they ſhould every day
hear a Sermon; Therefore to tender our
ſelves, to interrupt them in their Vocations,
by our Preaching unto them in ſuch a Land
of light; under the very Tropick of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
will either beget in them a Nauſeating
of God's Word; or elſe it will be as unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
unto them, as <hi>Singing the Songs of</hi>

He will not care to go to the Market, If

ſhall have but little time to ſtudy in, if we

of his Buckler?</hi> There is a ſad Text in the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62157:139"/>
tenth of <hi>Hoſea. The Princes of Juda were like
to them, that remove the bound.</hi> That is,
They neglected the Laws, which were as
<hi>bounds</hi> in matters of Religion. Now it was
a great Sin in the Law,—to remove the
ancient <hi>Landmark.</hi> Therefore it follows in
that Text—<hi>I will pour out my wrath upon them
like water. Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah; Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> have embalmed their
Names to all Poſterity. The former, by
<hi>beating down Idolatrous Altars, and Groves.</hi>
The latter, by encouraging the true Chriſtian
Religion, not only againſt its open Enemies
the Heathen: But defending it too, againſt
the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other dangerous Hereticks,
who endeavour'd, in the very boſom of the
Church, to eat out the very Bowels
of it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Churches have been moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which have been moſt Zealous for the
Truth, againſt thoſe that have oppos'd it.
As, the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>—That <hi>ſhe hated
the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans.</hi> The Church
of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was condemned; becauſe <hi>ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the woman</hi> Jezebel, <hi>who call'd her ſelf a
Propheteſs, to teach, and ſeduce his Servants,
to commit fornication;</hi> that is, the impure
Gnoſticks. The Lord had alſo a quarrel with
the Church of <hi>Pergamus, that ſhe ſuffered them
that held the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam. And if theſe
things be blameable in <hi>Churches;</hi> it cannot be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62157:140"/>
for the Honour of the chiefeſt Magiſtrates
(who are the Supreme Governors of them)
to ſuffer <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; Barbarians,</hi> and
<hi>Scythians; Parthians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Elamites;
Papists, Arrians, Independents, Anabaptiſts,
Quakers,</hi> to ſet open their Shops, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their Trinkets, in their Dominions: for
though theſe look ſeveral ways; yet they are
mov'd and carried about, with one and the
ſame <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or Spring of Confuſion.
Miſerable <hi>are the People that are in ſuch a Caſe.</hi>
As once it was in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> when <hi>every one did
that which ſeemed good in his own Eyes.</hi> It
ſhew'd the Impotency of <hi>Julian,</hi> that when
he ſaw, his Cruelty would not abate the Zeal
of the Chriſtians: <hi>He gave every one leave to
follow his own Religion.</hi> This is not the
Caſe of our <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> His Garments are
not dy'd with the blood of his Subjects: nor
are our Streets prophan'd, with the doleful
cries of poor Orphans. But by mildneſs, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and gentleneſs; both he, and his
Subordinate Officers, had made ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
upon the hearts of the People; that even
by the <hi>Cords of love,</hi> they were drawn into
an happy Harmony: except ſome few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
Caitiffs; who can only be melted, and
ſoftned by an hotter Element. But alas!
There comes an unlucky wind out of the
wilderneſs, which on a ſuddain blaſts all our
Hopes: and throws all our Doors from off
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62157:140"/>
their Hinges. All the Bars of our Gates are
broken. Come Foxes! Come Leopards!
Here's a free, and open paſſage; we ſhall be
an eaſie prey; who will, may ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in our gore; and lay waſt our <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>our Laws,</hi> were almoſt aſleep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Hurricano came; yet the very
Image, and Picture of them, did fright away
the Birds of Prey: The Woolf durſt not Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
our Folds, ſo long as there was but
the Reſemblance of a Maſtiffe-Dog: But now
theſe <hi>Terriculamenta,</hi> theſe Scare-crows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away, the Laws being fallen into
a Swoon, I had almoſt ſaid, the Laws being
extinct; the Frogs Croak up and down, in
every corner. I hope they will never be ſo
impudent and ſaucy, as thoſe were in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s

Kings Chambers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this, you will eaſily ſee, that this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>
is not the way, to procure God's
bleſſed favour upon Magiſtrates, and their
Government; nor does it tend to their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for though theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſeem to be
Innocent harmleſs Creatures; without either
Tuſhes, or Talons; yet they have rooted and
ayowed Principles in them, againſt the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
and Majeſty (if not) the very Being of
Kings; and though they fawn at preſent,
and bleſs God, who <hi>hath put ſuch a thing as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62157:141"/>
this, into the heart of the King:</hi> and are ready
to ſay,—They have a <hi>greater ſhare in</hi> David,
than we; Yet, let but a warm gleam ripen
them into Maturity: let their Fangs, and
<hi>Sampſon</hi>'s-<hi>Locks</hi> grow out again, or let them
be croſs'd in their darling <hi>Dalilah;</hi> by bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them up from then beloved <hi>liberty,</hi> and
then, will they not lift up their heels? or
Curſe him to his Face? Looking backward,
in this Caſe will be looking forward:
And Hiſtory, will be down-right Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
               <q>Pelle ſub agninâ, latitat mens ſaepe lupina.</q>
               <p>You Remember, that when the late King
<hi>Declar'd,</hi> That the Right (according to Law)
was in him, to <hi>Arrah</hi> his Subjects for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his Perſon, and Government: And
accordingly He did Commiſſionate many
worthy Perſons, to put the ſame in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that not one of theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would
Comply with that <hi>Declaration.</hi> When
alſo He Prohibited any to take the Covenant,
by his <hi>Royal Proclamation;</hi> Do you call to
mind any one of theſe <hi>new Royaliſts,</hi> that did
obey it? But now there comes out a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
(Mouth-meet) which throws the Reins
upon their own Necks; and permits them
(like unbroken Colts) to go whither they
will: and now, who better Subjects than
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62157:141"/>
they? What? Not <hi>obey the King's Declaration?
It is their Duty.</hi> So that ſhould the King rule
by Edicts, as our Stories tell us His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
have done, before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Firſt, who began the Foundation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
theſe men are like to be his moſt
ſequacious, and obſequious Followers: Ready
fixt; to make him an Abſolute, and Glorious
Prince. Some, it may be, will be ready to
add, Yes; as they did his Father before him:
For I much fear, That if it ſhould pleaſe His
Sacred Majeſty, to ſet forth another <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
(to try the temper of their Obedience)
to Reinforce the Laws, concerning Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the Liturgy; that theſe Men would
not then obey the ſame, for <hi>Conſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtrange to ſee, what queazy Stomachs
theſe men have; one Morſel, which is Cook'd
to their Palats, they will ſwallow without
chewing: And at another, which is every
whit as wholſom; they will ſputter, as if it
were Poiſon. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf has had
Experience of this Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>If he call upon them to Confederate, and
aſſociate themſelves in Private Meetings, they
ſay, he is return'd to his <hi>firſt love,</hi> and his
old Principles: But if he tell them of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacrament on his Knees, and call
on them to ſtand up at the Hymns in the
Common-Prayers; then they ſay he is an
Apoſtate.</p>
               <p>

It may be, this Indulgence (like a thick
Gobbet) may ſtop their mouths at preſent.
The King may ſleep ſecurely for a time;
whil'ſt <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are ſtruggling in the
Womb; whil'ſt <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> are in
<hi>Aequilibrio;</hi> poiſed in an even Ballance: But
alas! this would be but a ſerene Calm before
a Tempeſt: The drinking a Cup of Wine,
before a Feveriſh Fit; or a lightning before
Death: for whoever, either by Power, or
Policy, can get ground of his Fellows, and
leave them in the Valley; will be ſure to ſhew
their predominant Power, not only to their
Competitors, but to the Government it ſelf.
It hath been a fallacy, which ſome have put
upon themſelves; that pity and gentleneſs
will indear, and oblige theſe <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> But
he that calls to mind, how dear one Prince
has paid already, for his <hi>lenity</hi> to them; may
have a Clew, wherewith to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of that Error; and may alſo unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others. It is pity that Kindneſs (as we
ſay of fair Weather) ſhould do harm. But as
Panthers are choak'd with Perfume; ſo Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it ſelf degenerates into Cruelty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
brings Ruine after it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes, it was once his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That no Compulſion ſhould be us'd in
matters of Religion. Yet he lived to ſee his
great miſtake: For he found by Experience,
that by puniſhing one Offender; who was
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62157:142"/>
Refractory, and turbulent in his <hi>Dioceſs;</hi> He
did more good, than by all his <hi>wooing Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Such Libertines, are like Birds put
into a Cage. They flutter at firſt; but when
they ſee themſelves coop'd up, they'l ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
no longer, to get into the open Air;
rooſting quietly in their narrow Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I have not wonder'd a little, to read ſome
of their Books, wherein they complain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically
of <hi>Priſons</hi> and <hi>Gaols.</hi> Three Perſons
are named, who have ſuffer'd in this kind,
for their Diſobedience, Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Manton.</hi> But if we would go
about to requite them with our Arithmetick,
we could reckon for every one of them an
Hundred, who were (in the time of their
Tyranny) clap'd under Shipboard, or ſtrarv'd.
But what did thoſe three men loſe by their
Impriſonment? What <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaid of his
Fetters; He <hi>look'd upon every link, as made of
precious Stones:</hi> So may theſe men glory,
in their <hi>golden Chains.</hi> Some of them got
more by a Weeks Impriſonment, than we get
by Preaching a whole year; ſo that a
Gaol was as beneficial to them, as a Biſhop's
Palace; and to Confine them, was to ſet a
Fine upon the Heads of the Zealous Citizens.
Thoſe that know the Idiotiſm, or proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

to beg in vain for that Indulgence, which
they now Injoy.</p>
               <p>The neglect of a ſpeedy Reforming, and
effectual Suppreſſing of Errors, and Schiſms,
will both encourage, and increaſe them: for
though at firſt they may ſeem like that <hi>Cloud</hi>
in Scripture, of an <hi>hand breadth:</hi> yet by Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Spirits, they will ſoon be blown up into
ſo large Dimenſions, that they will <hi>darken
the whole Heaven.</hi> It has been accounted a
great overſight in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Bleſſed
Memory; that ſhe gave too much liberty to
Foreign Divines, to Preach in <hi>London,</hi> and
other places, until they had leaven'd the minds

               <p>The ſmell of thoſe miſtaken flames of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Iliads of miſchief are contained in the little

gracious Indulgence. What? Do you thus
requite the King? O Ingrateful and unkind!
If Conſcience be once debauch'd, with ſuch
Principles as theſe; the Throne will loſe its
principal Pillar; and the King will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
weakened, by theſe treacherous Prieſts,
and undermining Popelings, who go about
to Abſolve his People from the very Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Sinews of their Obedience, which
is never more genuine, generous, and laſting.
than when it is <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> This is all
one, as to tell the King to his face, that it is
his ſafeſt courſe to guard himſelf with the
Power of Arms: For if ever he be ſo unhappy,
as to take a meaſure of their Conſciences, they
will make no more ſcruple to Dethrone him,
than they did to Depoſe his Father. Men
without Conſcience, are like Maſtiff-Dogs,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62157:144"/>
when they grow mad; or Lions (which have
been tamed) when they recover their natural
fierceneſs: They ſhake off all awe to their
Maſters, and Keepers; neither will they
boggle at taring them into Pieces. How tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
theſe Men are, when they are let looſe,
may eaſily be gather'd from ſome few ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Diſſenters, of this kind, in our own
Pariſhes; who are errant Firebrands, where
they live. There is not a Difference betwixt
Neighbours, but they are at one end of it;
blowing up and inflaming Contentions, by
their Whiſpers and Nods; and by their Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Intruding into other Mens matters:
As if they were injur'd, if they are not
look'd upon; as the only Competent Judges,
and Umpires of all Conteſts; where any
place is bleſs'd; with ſound peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
there theſe Men are un-elemented:
They ſtarve, and pine away; unleſs they
can make, what they do not find. And ſince
one or two of theſe Innovators, are ſo pregnant
with quarrels, in our narrow Precincts;
what Earthquakes? what a Conflagration?
will theſe vapours, theſe ſparks raiſe? when
they are encourag'd to Conglomerate, and
to Unite their Forces, in the Bowels of a
Church or Kingdom. There is a Tradition
of ſome Parliament-men; when it was diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whether Prieſts ſhould Marry. They
cry'd out, yes! by all means. It was better
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62157:144"/>
they ſhould have Wives of their own; than
be too buſie (as they had been) with other

that they ſhould be ſuch buſie Incendiaries,

Plots and Deſigns againſt the State, and
ſuch are unlawful ſtill: But theſe Meetings

               <p>Now this is a diſtinction without a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
The members of it are Co-incident,

That which is cry'd up at firſt for the

know who it was (in the Wane of Rebellion,
and in the declining days of Uſurpation) that
gathered a Church out of the Officers of the

had drawn the Curtain, enter'd the Scene,
and e're he had made his Legs, and paſs'd his

If you trace them back to the Spring head,
from whence they flow'd: you ſhall find

upon pretence of Religion. So that, when I
conſider this preſent <hi>Indulgence,</hi> I have great
hopes, that our wiſe and gracious Sovereign,
by the Relaxing of the Laws for a time; and
by the Confuſions, that follow thereupon;
do's but make it appear, by a viſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
how neceſſary it is to hold a ſtraiter
Rain in the Government of the Church for the

               <p>It is the great Policy of that Circumciſed

Be careful to compoſe your quarrels, and

And as the <hi>Turk</hi> is <hi>the Rod of God's anger</hi>
againſt the one; ſo are the <hi>French</hi> againſt
the other: Who can tell, but that their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous
Hotchpotch of Religion, to the
diſhonour of their Maker, has pull'd down
theſe ſignal Judgments upon their Heads? I
know, ſome will point at another Cauſe of
theſe Miſeries; and that is <hi>Rebellion.</hi> I will
not contend with them; nor have they any
reaſon to diſſent from me: If they conſider,
that Schiſm, and variety of Religion, is either
the <hi>Mother,</hi> or the <hi>Daughter</hi> of Rebellion.
When Princes have a mind to take their Eaſe,
and their Pleaſure; and that they may do ſo
the better, they give their Subjects leave to
do ſo too, by doing what they liſt; they do
but ſet them a work to gather ſticks, to ſet
their Palaces in a flame.</p>
               <p>There is not much difference, whether
we Blaſpheme God in our own Perſons; or
ſuffer others to do it, when we have
Power to hinder it. Thoſe that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62157:147"/>
the true God, and permitted Idolatry,
are ſaid in Scripture, <hi>not to fear God,</hi> or <hi>ſerve
him at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When an Houſe and <hi>Kingdom</hi> are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt themſelves, they cannot ſtand.
And are there any Diviſions ſo bitter?
and ſo deſtructive? as thoſe that ariſe from
Religion.</p>
               <p>Therefore as it was with the Image in
<hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Viſion,</hi> it moultred down, and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
apieces; becauſe it was <hi>part of Gold;
part of Braſs, part of Iron,</hi> and <hi>part of Clay:</hi>
So, that Church muſt needs come tumbling
down, which is part for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and part for
<hi>Belial.</hi> The farther we go from Unity, the
nearer we come, either to Nullity, or Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And therefore the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> thought
the Heavenly Bodies to be incorruptible, and
eternal <hi>à parte post;</hi> becauſe they were a
pure <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> free from the dreggs of
<hi>mixture;</hi> and ſuch contrary qualities, which
incline other Bodies to Corruption. If there
be any thing will make a Kingdom Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and keep it from a Palſey of ſhaking
Tumults, it is a Uniform Harmony in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which is the very Vital Spirits, and
Soul of the State.</p>
               <p>That good man, Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> has left it upon
Record, <hi>where there is a voluntary ſeparation,
from the Lords Table, and Prayers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
there is a willing Excommunicating
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62157:147"/>
our ſelves from the viſible tokens of the Lord's
preſence.</hi> Now, one of your young Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
will eaſily Infer. <hi>If in God's preſence
there is fulneſs of Joy:</hi> where this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from any Nation, there muſt needs
be the fullneſs of miſery. As Darkneſs follows,
upon the Removal of the Sun-Beams.</p>
               <p>Some will ſay,—This Toleration will
Advance the <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of the
Nation. Sir! I heartily wiſh for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
and Wealth of my Country. May
our Corn, and Wine; our Wool, and Flax
Increaſe! And may our Merchants become
<hi>Nobles,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Tyrus!</hi>
               </p>
               <q>India mittat Ebur! Mittant ſua thura

               <p>Yet thoſe Riches will bring a Curſe, a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal
along with them; which are gotten with
the loſs of Piety, and Holineſs. What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
will it be, to be rich in the World,
and poor towards God? To have a fat Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs;
but a Meagre, and lean Soul? To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Out-works, and loſe the main Fort?
To get <hi>Mammon,</hi> and to part with Religion?</p>

                  <p>A Vniverſal Indulgence is moſt likely to end
in Popery, or Atheiſm.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw we are come to the <hi>Mare Mortuum;</hi>
whither all theſe Rivulets, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of Religions, are by their ſeveral
winding, bending their Courſe; either they
will carry us <hi>beyond the River Tyber;</hi> from
whence we have been brought by a good
hand of Providence, under the Conduct of
Pious Princes. They will Reduce, and bring
us back to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke: Immerſe us in
this <hi>Lerna</hi> of <hi>Vncatholick</hi> Innovations, and
Superſtitious Inventions of Popiſh will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
As the juſt ſcandal, which <hi>Luther</hi> took
at Popiſh Indulgences, brought him off from
that Church: So, this Indulgence now on
foot; if not timely controul'd, is likely to
decoy many into the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> again:
Or elſe they will bring us into a curſed Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
whether we have any Religion at
all: Methinks I ſee the Atheiſt, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
holding out their necks, and gapeing
for a prey: As if they would ſwallow up
our Reformed Religion, at one Morſel. And
were it not that there are many faithful <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi>
in the Land, who pray'd the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62157:148"/>
into his Throne; and now are wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Heaven in his, and our behalf: I
ſhould much fear, that our whole Land,
would become a great Cage for theſe unclean
Birds; and that theſe <hi>Dragons</hi> would devour
the <hi>woman,</hi> and <hi>her Child;</hi> and Adulterate, or
quite overturn all the true Worſhip of God, in
the midſt of us.</p>
               <p>I know the Devoto's of our Age will ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
at this: What? They open the Floodgates
to let in Atheiſm? who ſtand up ſo much
for <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> or, Are they like to bring in
Popery? who have lifted up their Hands,
and <hi>Covenanted</hi> againſt it. True: But did not
<hi>Peter</hi> Vow and ſwear as heartily as they,
That <hi>He would not deny his Maſter?</hi> yet our
Saviour <hi>ſaw what was in his heart.</hi> Did not
they <hi>Covenant</hi> too, to preſerve the late King
in his Perſon, and Honour? But they never
intended to make it good; nor to move a
Hand or a Tongue in his behalf.</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Hazael</hi> ſeem to abhor the <hi>ripping
up of Women with Child?</hi> yet you know what
follow'd. If <hi>Orpah</hi> will forſake <hi>Naomi; She
will return to her People, and to her God.</hi> And
if theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will renounce our Reformed
Church, and lay their <hi>loins</hi> upon it, to break
it into Shivers; they will at laſt (when they
have wearied themſelves in their own <hi>Mills)</hi>
endeavour to fix the Plants of their Feet upon
ſome <hi>Ararat,</hi> or other. Sure, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62157:149"/>
to live and dye in ſome Church; or in
a Communion, among ſome People, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſome Religion; with <hi>Balaam, They will
deſire to dye the death of the Righteous.</hi>
Otherwiſe they muſt declare, as too many
do already, (I will not ſay thorow their
means) that they are <hi>a People without God in
the world.</hi> What Muſick? What Triumphs
are we preparing for <hi>new Rome?</hi> how can
we gratifie the Pſeudo-Catholicks more, than
by pulling down the Pale of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Church? It is this, which ſtands in their
way. Take this Rampart down, and the
Pope will hope to recover his old Revenues;
which have formerly exceeded thoſe of the
<hi>Crown:</hi> The Prieſts and Jeſuits will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
to ſet up Maſs in our Churches, and
to domineer in our Pulpits. And ſome <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
(it may be) if we cannot out-run their
Rage, will be thinking of making Bonfires
again with our Bodies; our Diſſenters, all
this while, are like <hi>Gallio—They care not for
theſe things.</hi> They go on with a <hi>Munster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fury,</hi>
in their ſeparate Meetings; pulling and
rending the very Bowels of their Mother
aſunder; As if (like <hi>Nero)</hi> they could never
be ſufficiently reveng'd of Her that gave
them life, and dandled them on her Knees. I
know, they will <hi>wipe their mouths,</hi> and deny
the <hi>Concluſion;</hi> though they lay down the
<hi>Premiſſes.</hi> They will not ſee what Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62157:149"/>
they are bringing in upon us. Although
it is as eaſie to be diſcern'd (without a Spirit
of Prophecy) upon their proceedings; as it
is to diſcover a Lunary Eclipſe, upon the
foreſight of the <hi>Interpoſition</hi> of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Sun, and the Moon. It may be;
when with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they have pull'd down
<hi>our Gates,</hi> and <hi>Pillars;</hi> and lye ſcrawling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with us, in the rubbiſh; they may
then whiſper us in our Ears,—We <hi>never
thought, that this would have been the effect of
our Schiſmatical, dividing Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</hi>
At preſent they bear themſelves up,
againſt all hazards; and disbelieve all plain
Predictions; as if they ſhould ſtill enjoy
Peace, and Proſperity; <hi>though they walk in
the ways of their hearts, and in the ſight of
their own eyes;</hi> becauſe their followers are ſo
<hi>many:</hi> There are ſuch <hi>ſwarms</hi> of Diſſenters in
all places, enough to out-face all the Power of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true: They grow into vaſt numbers,
in moſt places: But <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and the <hi>King of
Aſſyria</hi> were not therefore Victorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Armies were very numerous:
<hi>Mazzanello,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> were mere
Squibs, and Pop-Guns; though attended with
an innumerable Rout of followers. So theſe
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> not marching under the Banner
of God's Church, will find themſelves to be
like a Land-flood. They may roar and ſwell
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:62157:150"/>
for a time; and like <hi>thoſe Locusts in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
they may <hi>have Power to do hurt for
ſome Months;</hi> but they will ſoon ſhrink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Banks, and become a contemptible
Adverſary to thoſe that are wedg'd, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into one Body; and with <hi>Marius,</hi> do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
march in rank and file. Thoſe <hi>Veterans</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> have eſpied their nakedneſs; how
that they are a looſe multitude; not cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together with any Principles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will ſoon be ſcatter'd like a Flock of
Sheep, when their Eagles come once amongſt
them. Hence it is, that moſt of them uſe
that liberty, which is afforded to them, <hi>calmly</hi>
and (to give them their due) <hi>modeſtly:</hi> when
our Furioſo's do even run themſelves out of
breath; until they loſe their way, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
For they know, that by keeping their
Stations, and ſtanding their ground, they
ſhall break all the proud waves of their giddy
Opponents, and quench their wildfire. Theſe
deluded wretches are going ſo faſt towards
<hi>Rome;</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> may ſave her ſelf the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of moving one foot towards them. The
time was; theſe Men were full of <hi>Jealouſies,</hi>
and <hi>Fears.</hi> They dreaded a Pope in every
buſh. They <hi>were afraid, where no fear was,</hi>
but now they are fool-hardy, and ruſh into
the Pope's Conclave, without either fear or
wit.</p>

Sir! I muſt now pauſe a little; and fetch
my breath <hi>very deep.</hi> My heart has been
ſad and heavy, as lead, all the time I have
been writing unto you. But now, my Spirits
have ſuch a damp upon them, that I can ſcarce
form another Letter.</p>
               <p>It was my great Joy—to ſee the face of a
Church to Return, together with the King.
And though I had but little to leave behind
me; yet it was my Comfort, that my Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was like to <hi>Inherit</hi> a pure Religion, in
the beſt Church of the World. This was the
richeſt Portion, I had to Bequeath unto my
ſurviving Family. But when I come now
to look about me, there is ſuch a Change,
ſo many <hi>Vndutiful Daughters</hi> ſprung up, that
are ready to pull out the Eyes of their <hi>Mother.</hi>
The poor wafaring Church is fluctuating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
wind and water; and ſtruggling for
life; and the <hi>Ravens</hi> are ready to devour her.
So that I cannot promiſe my ſelf the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that happineſs, which once I hoped
to tranſmit to thoſe that were to come after.
Theſe penſive and melancholy thoughts and
fears, are very much inhanc't, when I conſider
the Confuſions of <hi>Holland:</hi> A place much
fam'd for Integrity of Religion, and a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
for the Diſtreſſed; yet the Inhabitants
hereof, have ſo long encourag'd <hi>all Religions,</hi>
until at laſt, they have ſcarce any at all. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is <hi>become their Godlineſs;</hi> and Gain is their
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62157:151"/>
Idol. And becauſe <hi>they did not receive the
love of the Truth;</hi> but proſtituted this Virgin
to be adulterated by every Sect; God firſt
gave them over to <hi>ſtrong Deluſions;</hi> and then
made them a prey to the teeth of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
So that, what Religion is like to be
Predominant; or whether any at all, Time
only will ſhew.</p>
               <p>It is obſerv'd, that before the late Rebellion
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> there was an Indulgence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
at leaſt, by way of Connivence. The
Prieſts and Jeſuits had liberty, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
to exerciſe their Religion: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after, we heard the Tragical News,
that no fewer than an Hundred and fifty
Thouſand were murder'd. The <hi>Preſent State
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>p. 134, 135, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Julian</hi> went about to bring in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm,</hi>
he firſt ſcoffed at the Chriſtians in
general: And then he derided the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Preachers</hi> amongſt them, as a Company
of Dotards, and ſuch as taught the People
<hi>Old Womens Fables.</hi> He well knew, that
the ſlighting of the Prieſthood, and bringing
it into contempt; by levelling and laying it
common with the Laity; was the moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way, to overturn all Religion.</p>
               <p>Never were there a People ſo deſtitute of
Reaſon, but they owned ſome God; And
then it followed of courſe, that ſome <hi>Prieſts</hi>
were to be maintain'd, to aſſiſt the People in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62157:151"/>
the Service of that God. And it has been the
ſpecial Honour of Kings, to defend and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<hi>theſe</hi> in their work. One that was
much vers'd in the Antiquities of the <hi>Jews;</hi>
tells us, That whil'ſt <hi>Solomon</hi> was aſcending
thoſe ſix Steps, which led to his Throne;
the Herauld cry'd aloud,—<hi>Meddle not with
the Prieſts Office.</hi> How things go with us,
in this kind I need not tell you. If we have
been acceſſary to this contempt, which is caſt
upon us by our <hi>Idleneſs, Pride, Earthlineſs,</hi>
may we Reform, or elſe, may we be caſt
forth as <hi>Salt;</hi> which <hi>has loſt its ſavour,</hi> and
let better be put into our places, that ſo the
Church may not ſuffer for our ſakes. I know
your Sentiments do jump with this Prayer;
for you have often ſaid,—That no men do
more reſemble the Prince of Darkneſs, than
debauch'd, and unworthy Clergy-men. Yet
I think it is a Problem, which will puzzle
you to tell, which are moſt dangerous to the
Church. Thoſe that ſtand up for Loyalty
to the King, and Regularity in the Church,
yet ſtain both, by their looſe and irregular
lives; or thoſe that transform themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo many Angels of light: Cry up Religion
and Purity of Worſhip; yet affront and wound
the Church by their <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> and
ſtubbornneſs, in not yielding to her juſt
Commands. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
to <hi>flee youthful Luſts;</hi> it is thought, he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62157:152"/>
did not mean thoſe of the lower, and ſenſual
Appetite as Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for he was call'd upon to <hi>Drink ſome Wine,</hi>
but wantoneſs in the underſtanding: Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and Hot-headed Courſes. How happy
would it be, If there were a <gap reason="foreign">

ſtrait ſteps,</hi> without declining to <hi>prophane
looſeneſs</hi> on the one hand; or <hi>factious unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi>
on the other. Then we might hope
to ſee our Church to flouriſh like the <hi>Garden
of Eden;</hi> when ſuch <hi>Cherubims</hi> ſhall be the
Keepers of it. Then we need not fear <hi>(Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice

Atheiſts, or Papiſts ſhall lay it waſt.</p>
               <p>But it is time to check my ſliding Pen;
when I have firſt begg'd your Pardon, for my
interrupting your more weighty Studies with
ſo Prolix, and tedious a Diſcourſe. You

LETTER
To a MINISTER in
LONDON,
From a MINISTER in the
COUNTREY<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Good Brother!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Want ſuch a Friend as your Self, in theſe
Times; into whoſe Boſom I might emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and impart my Penſive Thoughts;
and ſo give eaſe to my Troubled Mind:
And alſo enjoy the Balſom of your Counſel,
for the healing of my wounded Spirit. My
Ears are not only grated upon, and fill'd with
the Din of a Diſcontented World: but my
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62157:154"/>
very Heart throbs, and Palpitates in my
Breaſt, when I conſider the Diviſions of our
<hi>Reuben.</hi> It is not long ſince we ſang the
Songs of <hi>Zion:</hi> our Mouths were fill'd with
Laughter, and our Hearts with Joy: when
after a long, and weariſom Night; the Sun
brake forth in our Hemiſphere, and cheer'd
our Drooping Spirits: Our Rightful Prince,
came leaping over all the Mountains, that
were in his way. And under the ſhadow of
this Cedar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have ſate ſafe and quiet ever
ſince. That which ſweeten'd the Mercy, was
this; It was beſtow'd by way of Anſwer to
our Prayers: After many fruſtraneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
Combinations; and Attempts of
our own. We gave Heaven no Reſt, either
day, or night; until He, by whom Kings
Reign; gave us our Rulers as at the firſt,
and our Governors as in Ancient days. But
as if (with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur)</hi> we had let down
our hands; and intermitted thoſe Devotions
which muſt Contribute to the continuing,
and preſerving of Mercies, as well as Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the procuring of them; we are again ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Affrightments. The Clouds
gather, and the ſhadows are ſtretching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
over us; as if there were a Storm; and
another Eclipſe of the Sun approaching. The
Archers are fitting their Arrows in their Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
Nay! upon their Strings; as if they
had ſome Game in view; ſome ſignal Mark
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62157:154"/>
to aim at: Neither great, nor ſmall; but the
King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All this while we ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd,
and cannot tell out of what Coaſt
this Storm may ariſe; or from whence this
ſhowre of Artillery may aſſault us: Like men
devoted to fall a Sacrifice; yet we know not
whoſe hands may be imbrued in our Blood.
All Parties are lowing after their Calves;
and are ready to Gore thoſe that meddle with
them, or ſtand in their way. Of old, we
read but of two in all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But now Calves
have gender'd, and brought forth a numerous
Generation. There's ſcarce a great Town,
where there are not whole Droves and Herds
of them. They leap, and Sport, and take
their Paſtime (like <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the Waters)
without Controul. None ſo fierce that dare
ſtir them up; who is able to ſtand before
them? They eſteem Iron as Straw, and Braſs
as rotten Wood: Darts are counted as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
they laugh at the ſhaking of a Spear.
At their firſt appearing in the World, their
Pens were at a conſiderable diſtance one
from the other: <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> but now
they couch ſo near together, that they are
almoſt Contiguous. And as Herrings when
they meet in Sholes; they do not only threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but indanger the talleſt Ships; ſo the
Adorers of theſe Calves, combining together;
and ſwelling into a Prodigious Bulk; do even
threaten the downfal of Church and State;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62157:155"/>
though rooted in Adamant: <hi>Joab</hi> himſelf
would be confounded; if he were to Number
theſe People. You ſee how Sparks neglected
may grow into a Flame, and a Flame not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd
in time, may become a Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Then it will be too late to ſay,—We
thought Calves had been ſo far from having
Horns—that they had been harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Creatures, ſo that Children may even
play upon the holes of theſe Aſps. The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi>
in their Common-wealth, and
the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to this day, will not permit
Strangers to continue in their Cities above
three Days; leſt their People ſhould learn
any Manners, or Cuſtoms which might Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
or Subvert thoſe of their own growth.
It is Death among the <hi>Turks</hi> to do any thing
openly; whereby the Religion Profeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, may ſeem to be ſlighted or
contradicted. And <hi>Porcius Cato</hi> told the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in a ſet Speech—How careful their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had been; that no external Rites of
Worſhip; or Sacrifices of other Countries
ſhould creep in; and incroach upon their
City. This made it, and them ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto their Enemies. It may be hereafter
ſcann'd by Sober Politicians—whether <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
or <hi>Prudence</hi> was the Aſcendant in this
Nation, when Thiſtles, and Nettles were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to multiply, and grow to that height—that
they threaten all the Flowers in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62157:155"/>
either to choak or over top them. The
poor Husbandman weeds out the Tares and
Darnel out of his Field, leſt they ſhould
rob his Corn of that Sap which ſhould feed
it; or twiſt about it with Mortal imbraces;
until they humble, and level it with the
Earth: Who would nouriſh a Viper in his
Boſom, until he come to that ſtrength and
vigour, that 'tis able to ſting him to the very
heart? Governors, even of private Societies,
and Houſes, are commonly jealous of any
Incroachments; that may undermine their
Power, or confront their Authority. Now
he is an errant Stranger in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſees
not how ſeveral Parties ſwell &amp; increaſe every
day; and all Combine againſt the Powers that
are. Where one Man ſpeaks the Language of
<hi>Canaan:</hi> what ſavours of Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Prince: what tends to the Peace
and welfare of the Church. There's twenty
ſpeak the Dialect of <hi>Aſhdod;</hi> what ſmells of
Nitre and Sulphur, Diſcontent, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And what they do not expreſs in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
Sounds; they make out in Nods, and
Whiſpers. A naughty Man winketh with his
Eyes, and ſpeaketh with his Feet.</p>
            <p>Some think the Blow we fear, will come
from <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed that City was founded
in Blood: Her very Walls were cemented
with the ſame. And ſince it became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
how have the Streets thereof been
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62157:156"/>
fill'd with Blood, from one end to the other,
in the ſeveral Perſecutions? <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf,
in the days of <hi>Titus,</hi> can ſcarce Parallel thoſe
Tragoedies. Nay! Since the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle,
has given place to the Croſs: And the Biſhop
has ſupplanted the Emperor: How eaſie
would it be in each Countrey, where the
Pope's Horſe has ſet his foot, to find out
whole ſtreams of Blood? This Beaſt has
ſtill the ſame Inſtruments of Cruelty; though
ſhe hide them (as the Viper her Teeth) yet
when any Game is ſtarted, that is fit for her
prey, then her fangs do appear. Blood is as
natural to this Woman, as 'tis to a young
Lion, or a young Eagle; She loves to dabble
in gore; until, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays,—<hi>ſhe be drunk
with the blood of Saints and Martyrs.</hi> Yet
who can conceive that any ſhould be ſo fond
of Slavery, as to return into this <hi>Babylon?</hi>
ſo Ambitious to hold the Pope's Stirrup; and
lay his Neck under his inſulting feet; that
he ſhould be acceſſary to promote his own
Bondage? to bring his Perſon,—Conſcience,—
and Eſtate under the Harrows of this Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tyrant? to make the Land of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
Tributary to a foreign Power; by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as <hi>Egypt</hi> once was) the Granary of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others fear a Storm from <hi>France.</hi> The
Clouds gather that way: But maugre all the
Pride and Power of that growing Monarchy,
we may be ſafe under the Protection of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62157:156"/>
Almighty, and the Conduct of our National
Prince; if we were as a City that is at Unity
in it ſelf: more Zealous in the Service of that
God, who dwells on high, and laugh's thoſe
to ſcorn—that think to trample on their
Neighbours, by virtue of their own brawny
fleſh; without any Commiſſion from himſelf;
and to lead into Captivity thoſe that deſire to
be quiet in their own Land. If ever we fall
by a foreign Enemy; we ſhall be acceſſary to
our own Ruin: either betraying our ſelves by
our own Sins; and ſo forfeiting God's bleſſed
Providence, which has been ſo long a wall
about us: or by ſome Perſidious <hi>Sinons</hi> among
our ſelves—that ſhall open our Gates to our
open Adverſaries. If we could Reduce and
Unite our roving and diſtracted Affections
into one Point: gather our ſelves into a Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet did their greateſt
Danger, in the days of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> If like
Sheep (when affrighted with Dogs) we could
rally into one Body; we might be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in our own Iſland; If the Stars in their
courſe, or God himſelf did not fight againſt
us. But alas! we are ſo ſhatter'd, and look
ſuch ſeveral ways: As if we were contriving
how to ſink, with the leaſt trouble to our
Aſſailants; and give them an eaſie and cheap
Victory; we have almoſt as many Parties, as
Men: And each Party ſtands on Tiptoes,
waiting for the Deſtruction of the reſt. Alas
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62157:157"/>
poor <hi>England!</hi> What evil Spirit is come
abroad, and crumbled thee into ſo many ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
What Stars did then prevail, when
thou becameſt the By-word of other Nations,
who waſt the Glory of all Lands? The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails
of <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Agencourt,</hi> are not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in Story. And ſhall our Sins ſo bow
down our Backs, that we muſt fear thoſe
whom we have Conquered? Shall we now
ſo unravel our Cord by our Inteſtine Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that they may be eaſily broken apart;
which were inviolable whil'ſt twiſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
This is to bring ſwift Deſtruction upon
our ſelves, without yielding any glory to
thoſe that ſhall ſpoil us. Where was the
Kites renown, that ſoop'd away the Frog
and the Mouſe, whil'ſt they were contending
and aiming at each others Ruine? whilſt
their eyes were ſo blood-ſhotten with Spite,
that they never attended the Motions of their
Common Enemy. Thoſe fowl that are tame,
do even dread the Shadows of Birds of prey,
by the inſtinct of Nature, though they hover
in the Air at a great diſtance from them. And
ſhall not we have ſo much Prudence, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
our ſelves, now our Enemies are not
only hovering, but ready to fall directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our heads? <hi>Hannibal</hi> is even at our very
Gates, <hi>Titus</hi> is caſting up his Trenches;
and we (like thoſe Zealots in <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> are
pulling each other by the Throat. Was there
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:62157:157"/>
ever Madneſs like this Madneſs? O for the
Harp of <hi>David!</hi> to allay this rage, and to
charm down theſe Furies. O that ſome Rays
from the face of God, might ſhine upon us!
That theſe Clouds might be diſpell'd; and
our Fears prevented! If that Grace which
brings Salvation, did once ariſe in our hearts;
by reducing us to the ſame Point, where we
firſt parted; That is, the door of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary:
by teaching us to worſhip the ſame
God, in his own way; there might yet be
hopes in our. <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this: we
might all ſpeak the Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and become a terror to our Enemies.
The Lord is terrible in the behalf of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by ſending Hornets among their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
when they are gather'd together in
the holy Place of his <hi>Zion. T. Quintius</hi> ſaid,
the Snail was ſafe in her ſhell; ſo might we
be in the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>You ſee 'tis hard to live in a Countrey-Cell;
and not gather ſome Melancholly Air.
Yet 'tis for a Conſolation, that I have both
liberty and leiſure, to breath out the ſame to
my God in Devotions, and to give a vent
to it; by tranſmitting the Eccho thereof to
your ſelf. I wiſh theſe Lines may find you
free, from all Incumbrances of Sadneſs: that
no ſuch ghaſtly Objects may perplex or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
your Receſſes. And leſt I ſhould be
guilty of pouring Water into your Wine; I
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:62157:158"/>
will ſhake off my Hermits Pall; and dazle
you with a more taking Dreſs. My Gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
ſhall requite you, for my former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
and I will both encourage you, and
my ſelf with what follows.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, not only common Fame,
but my own ſecret Thoughts have ſuggeſted
to me an equal fear from your <hi>London,</hi>
to that from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> For I am
old enough to remember, what Commotions
aroſe from that place about Forty years ago.
The King of bleſſed Memory, was affronted
in the Streets: All loyal Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Conſcionable Subjects, were aw'd
with the dreggs of the People. Judgment
was turn'd backward; thoſe gave the Law,
that did violate it moſt, and deſerv'd to be
made Examples by it. Seditious Pamphlets
and Inſolent Petitions, flew abroad like Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's;
and he that durſt give a check to
this Torrent, was ſure to be over-whelmed;
and to periſh in this Gain-ſaying of Core,
Wo be to Righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> if found in the
midſt of theſe <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Wo be to St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelf, if he ſtood in the way of <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
and his Crew. No man fit to deſcribe theſe
Confuſions, but he that wears Buskins: has
a Vein of writing Tragedies; and can ſet
forth the Plague of <hi>Athens</hi> in its own direful
Colours. I once thought, I ſhould have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62157:158"/>
dy'd St. <hi>Steven</hi>'s Death, only for Preaching
on the Fifth Commandment. When I look
back and conſider what Tails theſe Comets
drew after them; I am like one that goes
upon a narrow Bridge over a deep River.
My head and my heart tremble and pant;
and I can ſcarce believe my own Happineſs,
that I have eſcaped the roaring of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for ſo the Sacred Writ calls a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Multitude: Methinks I am only in a
Dream, and I ſometimes ſeem to ſee the
Mountains ſmoaking; and Firebrands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Pulpits, to increaſe the Flame.
Young Men, that were ſent by their Friends
to be diſciplin'd and train'd up in honeſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
were debauch'd in their Duties to their
Superiours, and inchanted with <hi>Sheba</hi>'s Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;
As if it were not enough to Poiſon one
Generation.</p>
            <p>Sir! It is not long ſince we were affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Countrey; as if the like times
were Revolving upon us. As if your <hi>London</hi>
were catching again the ſame Wildfire; and
like <hi>Aetna,</hi> were breaking forth into another
Conflagration. Every man we met, talk'd
of little elſe, but the riſing of the City: Such
eſpecially, as are given unto Change; and
have the Leproſie of Sedition, and Schiſm
running upon them; that think to get that
in a Scramble, which they can never attain
by their own Merits. Theſe ſhak'd their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62157:159"/>
Heads; made ghaſtly Faces—as if another
Dooms-day of Inſurrections were coming
upon us; and the fatal Period of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
was approaching. This Alarm did
ſo far amaze me; that I dreaded the Fire,
that had ſcorch'd me. I wrote Letter after
Letter to my Son, an Apprentice there—to
Charge and Command him, by virtue of
my Paternal Authority—not to enter into
their Secrets: or Conſpire with thoſe <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi>
that deſire to diſturb our Peace, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our Government. It is better we ſhould
all ſuffer; than Carve out our Fortunes, and
divert ſuppos'd Calamities, by lifting up an
hand againſt the Lord's Anointed. God
commonly turns the Projects of <hi>Achitophels</hi>
into Folly: for though precipitate actions
are pleaſing in their beginning; yet they are
difficult in carrying on, and diſapprove the
Succeſs.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be God! <hi>London</hi> is not <hi>London</hi>
now. The Magiſtrates and Citizens are Men
of another Spirit; and better acquainted with
their Duty to God, and Men. They are too
wiſe to be cheated over again, with Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
I had almoſt ſaid—Deviliſh pretences,
whereby they were formerly deluded. Their
Repentance coſt them too dear, ſo ſoon to
traverſe the ſame ways, wherein they have
been betray'd to Robbers and Thieves. I am
almoſt afraid to hear Subjects cry up Religion,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62157:159"/>
and Property; leſt they ſhould again ſtrip us
of both: To cry down others Miſcarriages
with <hi>Abſolom;</hi> or with <hi>Cham</hi> diſcover their
Nakedneſs; leſt they ſhould Uſurp the <hi>Faſces</hi>
into their own hands, and whip us again
with Scorpions. It is almoſt enough, to make
men Jewiſh Infidels, to compare ſome Mens
former Actions, with their own Declarations:
Their hairy Hands, with their <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Voice,
whatever we feel: whatever we fear, is the
diſmal Effect of that Hypocriſie. The Jews
thought there were ſome grains of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calf, in all their Sufferings; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Ghoſt haunts and affrights us now, was
rais'd by our own Malignant actings in the
days paſt. Of whom ſhall we Complain?
If our Dangers are great, our Sins have been
ſo too: let us no more prevaricate: let us be
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed; and then thoſe unhappy
vapours, which threaten to Eclipſe our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
will ſoon vaniſh. No need of being
Jealous of our Governors: or for them to be
diſtruſtful of us: For then they may ſleep
ſafely in the Laps of their People; and we
Rejoyce under their ſhadows.</p>
            <p>Good Sir! Pardon the <hi>Indecorum</hi> of this
Letter: For I write to an Eminent Shepherd;
juſt as I treat my Countrey Flock: yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear to tranſgreſs, whil'ſt I deprecate
my Fault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:62157:160"/>
I ſometimes Ruminate with my ſelf—How
our Tribe is aſſaulted from ſeveral Coaſts. It
ſhakes and totters with Impetuous Volleys
from all parts of the Circumference: <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh</hi>
againſt <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt
<hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> and both againſt <hi>Levi.</hi> Theſe
Rocks are even ready to grind us to Powder.
And as the Earth hangs upon nothing, but
the Word of God's Power: ſo we only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and are preſerv'd, by the powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of the ſame God; and by the gracious
Favour of his Vicegerent. Let us be Faithful
and Diligent in our Places; and thoſe billows
ſhall be ſo reſtrain'd, that they may roar; but
ſhall not ſwallow us up. Whil'ſt theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
take up my Thoughts; there
are other Sentiments ruſh in upon me. Alas!
How cold and perfunctory are many of us
in our Miniſterial Imploys? As if we were
not only Regardleſs of the Souls committed
to our Charges; but of our own. As if Eaſe,
Gain, and Grandeur, were the great deſigns
of our Functions. Nay! Has not the Altar
it ſelf been formerly polluted? Has not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
been proſtituted to the Luſts of Men?
Has not the <hi>Diana</hi> of Diſobedience been cry'd
up, by Preaching and Prayer? Is not the
ſame Fervent Swelling ſtill among us? The
ſame <hi>Jonah</hi> in our Ship? The ſame <hi>Achan</hi> in
our Camp? Shall not the Lord viſit for theſe
things? If any Complains that ſuch Men are
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62157:160"/>
ſilenc'd; who for their Parts may be uſeful
to the Church; I anſwer with <hi>M. Curius</hi> in
a like caſe—The Church has no need of ſuch
as have not learn'd to obey.</p>
            <p>But I am carried (I know not by what
Genius) out of a Fragrant Garden, into a
ſtinking <hi>Golgotha.</hi> I was commending the
preſent Conſtitution of your City, beyond
what it has been in our Memory; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that God might have the Glory; and
the Sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> too, might have that
praiſe which is due unto it: I mean your
ſelf; and other Regular Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
there, who have far tranſcended many of
thoſe that went before you; by infuſing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Principles: Planting and Preaching more
ſound and peaceable Doctrines among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of that place: ſo that the Glory of
this ſecond Temple, has quite outſtrip'd the
Rubbiſh that went before it: yet whil'ſt I
was thus muſing: ſolacing my ſelf; and
ſweetning this Solitude, with the Platonick
Pleaſure, and ſenſuality of theſe Idea's; In
came a ſwarm of Thoughts; what a confuſed
heap that famous City has been; under the
Conduct of falſe Lights, and unlucky Pilots:
And whil'ſt I was thus poſſeſs'd and tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I have convers'd with Tombes, and
Charnel Houſes. But waving theſe unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Reflections; I ſhall fix my Eyes upon
your <hi>London,</hi> as it is Inform'd, and Reform'd
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62157:161"/>
by happy Teachers: Not only Glorious and
Stupendious in Structures, and Merchandize;
but alſo, for her Religion to God; and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the Prince. In a body of ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions;
there's no wonder—that there are
ſome excentrical Motions: Some Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Excreſcencies, Wens and Botches. Our
little Pariſhes are not free from Heteroclites:
irregular, and diſorderly walkers. There
are ſome Dregs, and Reliques of the late
Times. We can eaſily divine, who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
by the Impreſſion of thoſe crooked,
and diſtorted Foot-ſteps they have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
Though we conſtantly Pray, Preach,
Catechize, and Inſtruct our People publickly,
and privately: yet the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
and thoſe Tares which <hi>Inimicus homo</hi>
ſow'd in the Furrows of our Fields, are not
yet rooted up. There are: there muſt be
Hereſies in the World, until we come to the
Unity of the Faith; and all our Chaff ſhall
be winnow'd out at the Day of Judgment.
The Harveſt will come, when vile Weeds
ſhall be ſeparated from the precious Corn.
In the mean while, we that live in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
are ſo far from envying your Happineſs,
that we make it our own, by exulting and
triumphing in the ſame; and praiſing God,
for your numerous and generous Progeny.
Though ours be as thin as Grapes after the
Vintage: As lean and meagre as <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62157:161"/>
Kine. Many of your People are as the Sons
of <hi>Anak,</hi> of a tranſcendent growth and ſtature,
both for Parts and Piety: your Aſſemblies,
as ſo many Synods—How beautiful are thy
Gates! thy Tents, O <hi>London!</hi> when a Man
enters into your orderly Congregations; He
ſtands as it were, in the Porch, and Suburbs
of Heaven: ſo that he muſt ſay—God is
among you of a Truth: Your Faces look
towards <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſhine with the luſtre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s in the Mount. Your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Devotion declare—That Heaven is
your aim; and that you are in good earneſt,
in ſeeking the Countrey that is above. It is
true:—<hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck</hi> do what
they can to weaken your hands, and blaſt
this your Succeſs. They grudge, and gnaſh
with their Teeth—to ſee thoſe ſo proſperous
in their Miniſtery; whom they traduce and
undervalue; and in their Proſperity, ſet them
with the Dogs of their Flock. Therefore they
ſet up Altars of their own; and decoy your
People into their Mountains. Mountains,
did I ſay? Nay! into their <hi>African</hi> Corners,
and Vaults. Yet thorow your Primitive dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and dexterity; your bow does ſtill
continue in ſtrength. And Maugre all their
Contrivances and Blocks they lay in your
way, to divert you in your Evangelical race;
and hinder the erecting of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Walls:
your work goes on thorow the Power of the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62157:162"/>
Almighty God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> And theirs moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and dwindles; at leaſt, It does not thrive,
being ſet together with untemper'd Mortar.
Though they have this Advantage—They
drive down the Hill, and woe the People, to
what both Naturally, and by Inſtigation,
they are too much inclin'd; and that is, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to Authority, and all that is called
God. This ſuits too well, to that Gun-Powder:
that deprav'd Activity; and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Virtue, which they bring into the world
with them. May you, and all our Brethren
go on with undaunted Courage! notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their barking; to keep your Flocks
from ravenous Wolves; and to ſave the
Souls of your People, from Schiſm, Faction,
and Sedition here! from Satan, and Hell
hereafter! We cannot deny, but there was
much Zeal (ſuch as it was) in that place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
But this was as Fire in our Thatch; or
like the career of a blind Horſe, that has
much Spirit; but no eyes to guide him. Now,
there is not only Zeal; but according to
knowledge: Not only a partial Religion, in
obſerving the firſt Table; but alſo, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Obedience to the ſecond; that Faith
towards God may appear to be true and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine;
by works towards Men; Love to God,
whom we have not ſeen; by Love to our
Brethren, whom we have ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:62157:162"/>
In the midſt of our late Fears—This very
Conſideration kept me from drooping, and
ſinking. What? Shall men that have a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
well-grounded fear of God, bandy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
againſt their lawful Governors? Men
that are ſo taught? ſuch Proficients in Chriſt's
School? ſhall theſe brandiſh that Sword, to
which they have no Right? This would
even have juſtified the worſt of Times; when
thoſe in your places pleaded Scripture and
Conſcience for Reſiſtance. Others made Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
to the Repreſentatives of the City
in their Common Council, to inflame them
to an ungodly War againſt their Prince: nor
were there wanting ſuch Orators among
them, that muſter'd up all the ſinews of their
Eloquence, and Rhetorick, to ſway and bow
the great Council of the Land the ſame way.
You have better learn'd Chriſt, and you have
better taught your People. It is the Phyſitian's
glory to check and chaſtiſe any predominant
and luxuriant humour in the Body; and to
reduce it into an even and Moderate temper
with the reſt. So it ſhews the Miniſters Skill
to allay the vehement Efforts of an irregular
People—in perſwading them to this Sobriety—
to leave the Government of the World to the
Providence of God; and the diſpoſal of
Church and State to the Wiſdom of the
King. We may be too Pragmatical, and
deprive our ſelves of preſent Injoyments; by
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62157:163"/>
being too ſolicitous for the time to come;
I will Pray for the welfare of this, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages. May true Piety, Peace, and
Plenty be ever within the Walls of this
Church, and State! And may God raiſe up
ſuch Men to ſit at the Stern of both; that
may be nurſing Fathers indeed! yet I will
leave my Prayers at the feet of God; and
truſt him with the ſucceſs of them. It has
been the great Mercy of God, in putting it
into the heart of the Prince; and the ſignal
Prudence of the Right Reverend Biſhops ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively;
to place in, and encourage, Able
and Regular Miniſters, in the chief City of
the Land: both to root up thoſe dangerous
and unpeaceable Doctrines, which have been
formerly ſettled there: and caſt a Malignant
Influence upon the head of all our Tribes.
And alſo to plant ſuch ſound Catholick, and
Orthodox Truths; whereby men may be
guided into the ways of Peace, and Holineſs.
The fruit and benefit of ſuch Preaching, and
Preachers, has appear'd in huſhing thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
that were amongſt you: In reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preventing the madneſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and their Tumultuous Practices. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters are not only Neceſſary to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
men to Heaven; but alſo to eſtabliſh
Peace here below—and to ſupport the King's
Throne. The Sun it ſelf may as well be
ſpared out of the Firmament, as theſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62157:163"/>
out of the Church. Had it not
been for Faithful Preachers in the City and
Countrey—to ſtand in thoſe Gaps, that are
trodden down by the Furioſo's of our times;
we had been over-run e're this, with Herds
of feral, and unruly Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Many there are that complain, and find
faults. They declaim againſt Abuſes, and
Exorbitancies, eſpecially in the Church; not
that they may be redreſs'd (except they
themſelves may be the Reformers) but that
they may Diſgrace and Wound the Civil
State, thorow the ſides of the Eccleſiaſtick:
For if we would ſtudy how to be reveng'd
of thoſe that Diſſent from us: To Crucifie
them, and Countermine their Projects; we
cannot take a more Compendious way—than
to agree together, in a vigorous purſuit of
the fear of God, and the Honour of the
King; to teach our People true Piety, and
Allegiance; our Sores are their Repaſt, and
our Peace is their Torment. May we always
thus goad their Sides! and rend their Caules!
by being good Men, and Orthodox Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
By maintaining God's Honour, the
King's Repoſe, the Tranquillity of the Church
and Kingdom; promoting our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our Peoples eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome Grief to you, that ſome
of your Flocks are cluck'd away, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin'd
from their own Shepherds. Chriſt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:62157:164"/>
himſelf was troubled at the loſs of one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:
He alſo put an Accent of Sorrow upon
theſe words to his Diſciples—<hi>Will ye alſo go
away?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> complained, when <hi>Demas</hi> and
the People of <hi>Aſia</hi> forſook him. Yet be of
good cheer—you are ſtill throng'd with
grave, and knowing Auditory. The ways
of <hi>Zion</hi> do not mourn; and the Abomination
of Deſolation does not ſtand, where it ought
not. Though ſome looſe, light, ſmutty Ears
may fall, or rather be ſnatch'd from you;
yet your ſheaves are ſtill full of weighty and
ſolid Corn. Your People do not talk, ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
diſpute, and wrangle about the great
things of Religion: but they live, act, and
practice the ſame. Their Senſes are both
exercis'd to diſcern, and their capacious, and
healthy Souls, to receive and digeſt the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Meats of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Alas! We are not ſo happy in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
we liſp, and ſpeak half words; we In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill
our Milk by Drops; here a little, and
there a little: And we account it our beſt
Learning, to condeſcend to the Ignorant; in
Calculating our Words and Matter to the
Meridian of their Underſtanding. We had
rather ſome ſhould carp, and cenſure; than
the greater part ſhould go away, without
any Edification. 'Tis better to Sacrifice our
own Credit, than their Souls. To uſe an
<hi>Arcadian</hi> Dialect; than they ſhould ſtare,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62157:164"/>
gaze, and ſay we are Mad; or with him in
the Poet, be ſtarv'd in the midſt of our
Dainties; and ſcorch'd with thirſt, whil'ſt
they are catching at the gilded Streams of our
flouring Rhetorick. Yet we rejoyce, if by
the Pulſe of our People we can diſcern any
Motions, or Symptoms of a Spiritual life; and
that Religion is true, and ſincere; though
weak, and unpoliſh'd.</p>
            <p>Sir! I know that your heart ſounds and
ecchos herein to mine. Well! let us go on
with a chearful Diligence in our ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
you in the Mount; we in the Valleys:
you, with the Mother-City; we, with the
Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>—until Righteouſneſs,
and true Holineſs; be not only the Ornament,
but Bulwark of our Land. For as the moſt
rugged paſſages of God's Providence, are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in their ſeaſon: And the moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Members of the Body, are Uſeful and
Neceſſary in their places; ſo the loweſt and
meaneſt Officers in the Church (if found
faithful) may add to her luſtre, and adorn the
Compages of Chriſt's myſtical Body: As
little Choireſters may help to make up the
Conſort, and Harmony of the Quire. I know
you will not overlook our help in carrying
on the common Salvation; though our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are weaker than yours.</p>
            <p>I have got the happineſs to ſpeak to a wiſe
Man, who is able to judge what I ſay; and I
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62157:165"/>
am unwilling to part with it. This muſt be
my Apology, for protracting this, beyond
the bounds and meaſures of my ordinary Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
If you be more conciſe in your Anſwer,
make it out in your Prayers. And herein
I will requite you—by Importuning the
Throne of Grace—That both you, and all
our Brethren, may do worthily in that <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and famouſly in your <hi>Bethlem!</hi> That the
Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> may be the glory of
<hi>England!</hi> as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Chriſtian world. And though the
Fawns of the Wood, muſt be content to
come behind the City-Muſes. Though we
cannot reach the <hi>Selah</hi> of your loud Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals;
yet we will follow you, with our little
Timbrels and Pipes. We will do what we
can—In reconciling God, and his People; in
preſerving a right Underſtanding betwixt the
King, and his Subjects; promoting Primitive
Piety, with Catholick Love, and Charity
amongſt our People.—</p>
