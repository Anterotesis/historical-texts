         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now the pride and arrogance of this multitude and millions of men begun to ſhew it ſelf, when all the Sons, and Off-ſpring of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaving <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Phaleg</hi> (who were Gods more peculiar reſerves both for language and people) journing from the Eaſt, where it is probable they made a long abode in the mountainous country, before they came down into the plain, for the fearfull memory of the late Flood: Finding themſelves over-numerous to be contained in a ſmall compaſſe of ground, and cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and <hi>Nimrod</hi> a prime ſtickler in all ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, they conferred together how to perform ſome mighty and magnificent work, which were eaſily done while they were now together, and before they parted, which might eternize their name and memory, whereas if they were once ſevered (as they peceived they begun to over-ſwell the banks, bounds, and capacity of thoſe parts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117435:5"/>
where they made abode) they ſhould want heads to deviſe and contrive, hearts for courage, and hands to act and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſo great and glorious a deſign, and the freſh memory of the Flood minding them of preſervation, maugre (as mans ſimplicity was apt to imagine) the power and force of another Flood if it ſhould happen, the country furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with earth for brick, and ſlime for morter, they fell to work, and when they were in the heat and hardeſt travailes thereof, and made all the haſte they could to get up to Heaven, God came down to them, as he took off the Chariot wheeles from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hoſt in the Red-ſea, ſo as they drove them heavily, ſo now he brake in ſunder the Stern and Rudder of all their actions (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſayes, <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum humane ſocietatis eſt ratio &amp; oratio</hi>) by confounding their language, ſo as <hi>alter alterius labium non perciperet,</hi> they could not underſtand one another, nor gueſſe by the motion of their lips at what was ſpoken, but they all ſtood amazed, and at laſt they reſolved, or diſſolved into 72 Languages, <hi>unuſquiſque ſecundum linguam ſuam in tribubus ſuis, &amp; in gentibus ſuis,</hi> Japhet 15, Cham 31, Sem 27, as <hi>Auſt. de Civit.

            <p>Now for the manuduction of ſome neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, it ſhall be requiſite to enquire at what time and year after the Flood, the <hi>Confuſion of Tongues</hi> at the building of <hi>Babel</hi> hapned, which by all Writers is agreed and ſtated to be in <hi>Phalegs</hi> time, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. ver. 25. from the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of the word <hi>Phaleg,</hi> which is Diviſion, as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Hebrew inform us, the Flood was in <hi>An. Mun.</hi> 1656.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sem</hi> was 98 years old at the Flood, and begat <hi>Arphaxad</hi> two years after, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
            <p>Now the Diviſion of Tongues granted to be in <hi>Phalegs</hi> time, it reſteth to enquire in what parts of his age, which to diſcover, or moſt probably to evince, will be of ſpeciall uſe to ſome part of our ſubſequent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Some will have that name given him at his birth, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Confuſion of Tongues then hapned; but to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117435:5"/>
that I cannot ſubſcribe, becauſe I read <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. v. 25. In his <hi>dayes</hi> was the earth divided, which word <hi>daies</hi> muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the time of his Manhood, not of his Birth, Infancy, or Childhood; for when we ſpeak of ſuch a thing done in ſuch a mans daies, it implies when he was a man of action.</p>
            <p>Again, an indefinite conceſſion that his name was called <hi>Phaleg,</hi> becauſe the Diviſion of Tongues hapned in his dayes, or life-time, demonſtrates no certainty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phaleg</hi> lived 239 years, and dyed <hi>An. mund.</hi> 1996, and<note place="margin">Theſe lived with <hi>Phaleg. Noah 8 Sem 239 Arphaxad 239 Sala 239 Heber 239 Reu 209 Serug 176 Thure 118 Abraham</hi> 48.</note> 340 years after the Flood, and all theſe (as on the Margent) were contemporaries with <hi>Phaleg;</hi> and why ſhould <hi>Phaleg</hi> have a name importing Diviſion, rather than any of the reſt which then lived with him, unleſs the name ſhould be given him from ſome notable and confiderable circumſtance, or accident of his life, and ſo from thence to be changed, as <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Iacob</hi> to <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> and to make that the Epoche or Root from whence to ſupputate ſo great an action? but that is but conjecturall, and no firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a good Argument. And now not to dull or dazle my ſelf with too curious prying and piercing into this obſcurity of queſtion, I offer my qualified opinion as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phaleg</hi> was born <hi>An. Mun.</hi> 1757, and <hi>poſt Diluvium</hi> 101<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he lived in all 239 years, till <hi>An Mun.</hi> 1996 and then died. I will grant that the name <hi>Phaleg</hi> was given him at his birth, not becauſe the Diviſion then hapned, or was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, but given him prophetically at his birth, when I ſuppoſe the building began, and the prophecie to be after fulfilled according to the ſecret and determinate counſell of God, when the conſpiracy and practiſe ſhould be ripe for his Judgment of Confuſion and Diſſipation, and to which purpoſe I ſuppoſe God (for his greater glory) did not at the inception and inchoation of the work inſtantly break them off, but permitted and ſuffered them to make ſome fair and far progreſſe in the work, to the end that having built, and beſtowed the more time and coſt therein, and then to be ſcattered, fruſtrated, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117435:6"/>
deluded of their hopes, it would be a far greater anxiety and vexation to them to have <hi>naufragium</hi> almoſt <hi>in portu,</hi> eſpecially alſo when they were furniſhed of all materials, and all both Architects, Contrivers, and Engineers, as alſo of Labourers and Workmen in abundance, and they all ſtrong, ſound, and of perfect conſtitutions (proportionall to the length of the lives of the men of thoſe dayes, which I preſume to think to have been then even of common and ordinary perſons omitted as of thoſe which are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture) and yet to be daſhed and defeated by ſo weak a ſeeming means, as though they had every one of them all their fives ſenſes in compleat meaſure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet they could not underſtand what one ſayd to another, but chattred like Jayes and Pyes, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſabled from action without any diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the faculties of the body or mind, and wanting nothing of the perfection of men, yet could not conſult to doe any thing; therefore as they vauntingly ſayd, <hi>Gen. 11. 4. Let us build us a Tower whoſe top may reach up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> So undoubtedly God ſuffered them to raiſe it very high, whereby to flatter their ambition while it was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to let them ſee the ſin of their Pride in their Confuſion, and that their Tongues ſhould ceaſe to be any more any meſſenger of the mind to action.</p>
            <p>I will not here reprove the modeſty of ſome mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who allow forty years expended in the building of this Tower; for truly my fanſie may incline to allow them as long time to build that Tower, as God allowed <hi>Noah</hi> to make the Ark, which was 100 years, as <hi>Auſt. de Civ. Dei, lib. 15. cap. ult.</hi> and <hi>Contra Fauſt. lib. 12. cap.</hi> 18. and ſome give it 120 years, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. v. 3. that as <hi>Noah</hi> made the Ark ſufficient (in that ſpace of time) to endure that great long ſiege and battery of the ſeas, ſo God might give the <hi>Nimrodites</hi> or Babel-builders leave to try their art and ingene (which they thought was able in a like ſpace of time) to contrive a fabrique and ſtructure of ſuch vaſt dimenſions for height and breadth (as ſome have made it a mile and a quarter high) as might dare and wade through
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117435:6"/>
all future deluges, ſtorms, tempeſts, rages of winde and weather whatſoever, and preſerve them ſafe and alive; for the judgment and puniſhment of the Flood ſtill ſtuck in their ſtomacks, and they would not take Gods word, Chap. 9. v. 11. never to drown the World again, and they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the warrant of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Faith, which <hi>Horace</hi> calls no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than

to venter upon ſuch another voyage as <hi>Noah</hi>'s. Thus if we ſtate the Diviſion of Tongues to be but forty years after the beginning to build the Tower, it will be 140 years after the Flood, and in about the fortieth year of <hi>Phaleg</hi>'s age, and <hi>an. Mun.</hi> 1797. or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1800.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nimrod</hi> (who was the ancient <hi>Belus</hi>) was King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the firſt King that ever was, and by the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt Chronologers, he reigned 66 years, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is ſayd of him <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. v. 9. <hi>Nimrod the mighty hunter,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe that doth but only intimate his open, imperious domineering, and ambitious ſpirit, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he was the great and chief author and ringleader of the building of <hi>Babel</hi> Tower, but I think alſo that he reigned not as King untill after the Confuſion; but when he ſaw his hopes and purpoſes daſhed, and a ſolſtice of the work, and that he was now arrived at the <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, and <hi>nil ultra</hi> of his great action and adventure, and could not reach home to ſay with <hi>Nebuchadnezar, Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>that I have built?</hi> yet he was unwilling to remove from the place where he had erected ſuch a monument of his aſpiring mind, but there he meant to ſtay and abide, expecting the dawning of another day, and how ſo great a wonder and miracle ſhould conclude.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the people being ſcattered and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into ſundry parts of the World, <hi>Nimrod</hi> being of moſt note and renown (with a great party that adhered to him, as bad is ever moſt numerous) ſtill kept together, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome reaſonable ſpace of time (as we may conjecture
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117435:7"/>
about forty or fifty years) had now contracted and made a proper and peculiar language; and ſoon after <hi>Nimrod,</hi> having now many followers, ſet now his ambitious ſpirit on work to feed their eyes, mouth, and ears, with the ſight, report, and noiſe of his undertakings; and at laſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the firſt of Kings, and Monarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> while <hi>Sem</hi> with his children, and grand-children <hi>Phaleg</hi> and <hi>Heber,</hi> are thought (by ſome of the Fathers, and the beſt Chronologers) never to have engaged in the action of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but to have removed Eaſt-ward to <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Diviſion of Tongues being (as before) about 140 years after the Flood, and there being a <hi>motus trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis</hi> at, and for about forty or fifty yeares after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Languages, by the panique amazement that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> the ſumme is about 180 years; then adde 66 years, the time of <hi>Nimrods</hi> reign, the ſumme is about 240, or 250 years.</p>
            <p>Thus have I prepared and made way for the credit of the ſtory of <hi>Diodorus Siculus lib.</hi> 2. out of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If I adde this ſumme of 33 of <hi>Ninus</hi> reign, to 250, the ſumme of years is, 283 after the Flood, and if this ſpace and extenſion of time will not ſatisfie for ſo great a breed of men and people, I may yet adde more help to admit this expedition of <hi>Ninus</hi> to have been three hundred years after the Flood; for by how much leſſe of time that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of people ſpent (as ſome will not allow it two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, others a little above two hundred years) by ſo much the greater plenty and over-flow of people might the ſooner extend, and move Eaſt-ward to the populating of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>

of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> who were haraſſed and canvaſſed by the Romans after the expugnation of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and wee gather from hiſtory that thoſe Iewes were moſt ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Weſt, North, and South into <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> but from thence we cannot ground any plantation of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Iewes had gone over into <hi>America,</hi> by themſelves, or with the Tartarians, then the commixture of Nations would have produced a diffuſion of promiſcuous and medly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtomes, and the more Iewes the deeper die and influence of their rights and cuſtomes had alſo pierced and poſſeſſed thoſe parts, &amp; with it an inundation of the peoples rights, cuſtomes had alſo followed and overflowed, but we ſee they differ <hi>toto caelo,</hi> as appeares by <hi>Acoſta, Maffeius, Pe. Mart. Jo. de Laët</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I offered my weak conceptions, firſt how <hi>America</hi> may be collected to have bin firſt planted, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Iewes leave to goe into <hi>America,</hi> but not admitting them to be the chief or prime planters thereof: for I am of opinion, that the Americans originalls were before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Ten tribes, even from <hi>Sems</hi> near progeny (of which I have ſpoken enough already) beſides that from the Confuſion of languages, to that Captivity, there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of about 13 or 1400 yeares, which is time ſufficient for the plantation of <hi>America</hi> out of <hi>Aſia</hi> before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
            <p>Now I come to enquire into the harmony and agreement together of the Iewes and Americans, in manners, cuſtomes, language and religion.</p>
            <p>The Firſt inſtance of the firſt Conjecture which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<note place="margin">Conject. 1.</note> notes, is the Americans acknowledgment; but to this <hi>Acoſta</hi> (who lived 17 yeares in the Weſt Indies, and travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Country over as he ſaies himſelf) tells us <hi>lib. 5. cap.</hi> 25. that what the Americans talk of their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is nothing worth, and rather a dream than any likelyhood of a true ſtory, nor will the weight of his experience, learning, and integrity, be overpeiſed by any.</p>
            <p>The Second Conjecture is raiſed from rights and<note place="margin">Conject. 2.</note> cuſtomes, whereof the Author hath made a diſtinction of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117435:9"/>
Common and Sacred, and given a ſelect liſt of both, which are his chief life-guard.</p>
            <q>And Firſt of Common rights.</q>
            <p>The Firſt is from their garment or Mantle which the<note place="margin">Cuſt. 1.</note> Americans uſe, as the Author, ſo alſo <hi>Acoſta</hi> confeſſeth to be a ſquare coat or cloak as moſt ſingle, ſimple, and leſſe charge, and no more peculiar to the Iewes or Americans than to any other Nation, and is the ſame with <hi>Elias</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp; ſuch as wee read of in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> uſed by the Chaldeans, &amp; in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> by the Egyptians, &amp; ſuch as the very Iriſh wear, though of a thicker ſubſtance, becauſe a colder Country; and reaſon ſhewes it is the moſt proper and ready garment for any Nation in an ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <q>They conſtantly annointed their head, as the Iewes did,</q>
            <note place="margin">Cuſt. 2.</note>
            <bibl>Luke 7. &amp; 46.</bibl>
            <p>This Pharagraph muſt be thus conceived and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the Authors meaning, that they conſtantly, that is daily, uſually, and very often, as the Iewes daily, uſually, and very often did; Or that in ſuch manner as the Iewes did ſometimes, So the Indians did daily, uſually, and very often, annoint their head.</p>

            <p>The Sacred or holy oyle or Annointing is that we read of <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. being a very ſweet perfume, the confection or compoſition whereof was directed by God himſelf, and hee appointed that the Tabernacle, and all the inſtruments and veſſells thereof ſhould be annointed therewith, and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt and his Sonnes, as v. 30.

            <p>The firſt place in Scripture where we read of Annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with oyle, is <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. where it is ſaid that <hi>Iacob</hi> (when his Father ſent him on wooing) in his travail, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlept all night upon a ſtone for a pillow, and dreamed of the ladder to heaven, and of the wonderfull promiſes of Gods bleſſings to him revealed in a viſion, he was ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed therewith, that he brake forth into theſe expreſſions of Admiration; <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place; How dreadfull is this place? This is none other than the houſe of God, this is the gate of Heaven,</hi> and he builded an Altar there, and called it <hi>Bethel,</hi> and vowed a vow, and took the Stone (implying the ſame ſtone whereupon hee ſlept, &amp; that rather than any other, becauſe in his reſt upon that Stone he had that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious apparition) and powred oyle upon it, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was no other than ſuch as he carried with him in his travaile for his own refreſhment, and which though he uſed as partly for food (as the widow of <hi>Zarephath 1. K.</hi> 17. 12. and as we eate it with fiſh, Salades and Herbes,) ſo alſo to ſupple his joints and tired Limbs (as 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28. v. 15.) yet he thought it not too precious ſo to be beſtowed, whereby to make the Stone look ſmooth, cheerfull and ſhining, as alſo to preſerve it from froſt, raine, and the injury of weather, as wee doe metalls, wood, ſtones, (of more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>There was another Annointing with oyle mentioned in Scripture, which was of ſuch as were ſick, as <hi>Mark 6. 13. Ia.</hi> 5. 14. that was a Power given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, which was not from any expreſſe receipt, or cure, but onely for a ſigne and earneſt of Spirituall health, and cure of the Soul, as were many other miracles done by them; this manner of annointing laſted as long as the gift to work miracles laſted <hi>Chryſoſt.

            <p>Other Annointing than what I have here mentioned,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117435:11"/>
I find not in uſe among the lewes, ſave that in <hi>feſtis ſolebant Iudaei caput oleo ungere,</hi> upon their feſtivall daies the Iewes uſed to annoint their head with oyle, which was no other than that, becauſe upon thoſe high and great daies they were more publique in their meetings, and aſſemblies, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they annointed themſelves both to ſmooth and chear the countenance, and to pleaſe by ſent &amp; perfume; And their head rather than any other part, both becauſe the hair would better lodge and retain the ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially alſo being preſerved warm with an hat or covering, and becauſe when men are together in ordinary conference and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the outward ſeat of the ſeat of ſmelling (which is in the noſe a member of the head) is nearer the object of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as they talke nearer, and their heads are nearer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſalutations of kiſſing or embraceing, and ſo they contribute pleaſing odours and perfumes to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of one another.</p>
            <p>Of all this that is ſaid which is of odoriferous and ſweet oyles, nothing makes for the ſcope of the Author to the uſe of the Indians, who never annoint to the purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; but as they prefer the dark and tawny complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo they love to adulterate the colour of their hair. So in <hi>Florida,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Braſile,</hi> they annoint themſelves, their skin with oyle, <hi>ut nudam cutem, &amp;c.</hi> to cruſt, harden, and defend it againſt the ſcorching of the Sun, but of the annointing of the head, I reade no cuſtome among them.</p>

            <p>It is certain, that ever after the women of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang <hi>Davids</hi> victory over <hi>Goliah,</hi> with an higher note and pitch of honour ten to one than <hi>Sauls, Saul</hi> ſought his life, and ſo <hi>Sauls</hi> propoſition, as it was but a trap for <hi>David</hi> (thinking <hi>David</hi> could never have paid the price of ſo dangerous a purchaſe) ſo <hi>Saul</hi> knew alſo that if <hi>David</hi> quit himſelf, and eſcaped, he ſhould have his daughter in marriage, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I hope I have ſufficiently proved the antiquity of the giving of portions by Parents to their children in the time of the Patriarchs, and under, and from the time of giving the Law. So as I ſuppoſe the Author cannot maintaine his pretended cuſtome of the Iſraelites to ſell their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, after giving and knowledge of the Lawes for Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and long before the carrying away of the Tenne Tribes, and contrary to all Laws of religion and nature.</p>
            <p>I have alſo ſufficiently maintained mine aſſertions by ſome of the moſt ancient prophane writers of beſt Teſt, and credit, and what <hi>Saul</hi> did in the height of his malice.

            <p>Firſt, who may bee thought to have buried that treaſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to what purpoſe.</p>
            <p>If any treaſure were hidden or laid up cloſe, It will be conceived, that either <hi>David</hi> commanded it, or <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117435:22"/>
wee may rather think <hi>David</hi> than <hi>Solomon</hi> could ſpare it in overplus, or redundance, above the treaſures, which by the Scriptures record he left to <hi>Solomon</hi> for accompliſhment of the great deſignes, according to the vaſt dimenſions of the knowledge and wiſdome of <hi>Solomons</hi> heart, as <hi>Syracides</hi> ſaies of him, ch. 27. <hi>Thou wert filled with underſtanding as with a flood, and thy mind covered the whole Earth.</hi> And if any aske how <hi>David</hi> could be ſo gathered and ſtored of wealth, It is anſwered, that the fountaines of his treaſure were the good husbandry of his Cattle, Corne, Vines and Olives, 1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 27. and tributes from conquered Nations, and the ſpoiles of his many victories, and preſents from confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes and States, by all which he heaped what he could, having no divining ſpirit of <hi>Solomons</hi> future ſupplies from <hi>Ophir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot imagine what either preſident, example, dictate, or reaſon, ſhould move <hi>David</hi> to bury any treaſure in his own ſepulchre, or monument, as if he meant to count his Gold with <hi>Iobs</hi> complement, <hi>Thou art my Confidence,</hi> or ſhould dedicate it to <hi>Pluto,</hi> the God of Darkneſſe, there to reſt and ruſt uſeleſſe, and without imployment, as it is recorded of <hi>Ioram,</hi> that he lived without being deſired, when Gold animates all the world to Action, and (as the wiſe man ſaies) <hi>Money anſwers to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, If <hi>David</hi> had deſigned it to ſerve future purpoſes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet to bury, or command it to be buried in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and thereby to ſeeme to be willing to carry it with him as far as he could, muſt have fallen under ſome ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter interpretation, to the blemiſh of the honour of his piety.</p>
            <p>Nor can wee Imagine that though the Poets feign <hi>Pluto,</hi> the Devill, to be the God of riches, and that Spirits, Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes and Hobgoblins doe haunt graves and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, therefore as <hi>Gryphons</hi> are feigned to keepe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Gold; So <hi>David</hi> hoped that the ſimplicity of men would be afrayd to deale with (much more to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to) the monument of his treaſure, for feare of fiends or Spirits that might haunt and keepe it, though he knew
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117435:23"/>
               <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſedome, (when he ſhould have occaſion to uſe it, and he muſt of all men be moſt privy and knowing thereof) could eaſily conjure thoſe <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> and take and enjoy thoſe treaſures to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Againe, If <hi>David</hi> cauſed any treaſure to be buried for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> private ſupplies, and which he would have kept very cloſe and ſecret, then we may not imagine it to be buryed in the midſt of his houſe, but rather in ſome ſpare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome, or place, or part, and whither it might be carried and conveyed, and where buried, with the leaſt noiſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, diſcovery or ſuſpition; and they that doe make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the City of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Adrichoimimus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doe place the Sepulchre of <hi>David,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> in the South-Weſt angle, and Corner of the City, near unto the wall, and far from the Kings palace, as may bee gathered out of <hi>Nehem. 3. &amp; Niceph Eccl. Hiſtor. lib.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Nor can I imagine that the treaſure was buried by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (though <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaies it) in <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulchre, for <hi>Solomon</hi> knew as much in Religion, and could as well diſtinguiſh of godly and ungodly, and ſuperſtitious acts, as <hi>David</hi> (though he cannot be excuſed from the great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his life, by the ſeducement of Idolatrous wives and concubines, whom his affections Idolized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) yet the beſt divines, both ancient and modern, make little doubt of his Salvation, onely the Papiſts (who me thinks ſhould be the better perſwaded of him, for his complements, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of his Idols wives, and of his wives Idols) are of another mind, and yet (which is very ſtrange) though they know ſo many waies to be ſaved, yet they cannot find the way to be ſure of it.</p>
            <p>Now after this ſhort wry ſtep out of the way, I return, and ſay, that beſides the great uſes which <hi>Sodomon</hi> had of treaſure, for the glut of himſelf in all worldly pleaſures and delights (as he confeſſeth of himſelf in the Second Chapter of his retractations) in the flower and ſtrength of his age, and yeares, and when his ſtirring blood boyled towards action, and that he heard his Glory and Wiſdome cryed up for the None-ſuch and wonder of the world,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117435:23"/>
which invited continuall concourſe to his Court; And leſſe can I imagine that any treaſure was left by <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> Monument, for if <hi>Solomon</hi> were really neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lay great taxes upon his people, which yet I doe not reade in ſcripture clearly expreſſed and charged upon him, otherwiſe than by <hi>Ieroboams</hi> expoſtulation to <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the beginning of his reign; For I paſſe over the tributes laid upon the Hittites, Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Iebuſites, which were not of <hi>Iſrael, 2. Chr.</hi> 7. 8. and if <hi>Solomon</hi> had bin in ſuch want, hee might lawfully have relieved himſelf, and juſtified his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, out of the great magazine of the Monument, which if amaſſed by <hi>David,</hi> it was not to bar or baniſh his Son from the uſe of it, if by <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, ſure he might be bold with his own.</p>
