         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR CROWNING THE Prince and Princeſs of Orange KING and QVEEN joyntly, <hi>And for placing the Executive Power in the Prince alone.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas the Grand Convention of the Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> have aſſerted the Peoples Right by declaring, <hi>That the late King James the Second, having endeavoured to Subvert the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People: And by advice of Jeſuits, and other wicked Perſons, having Violated the Fundamental Laws: And having withdrawn himſelf out of this Kingdom, has abdicated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that the Throne is thereby Vacant.</hi> For which Miſ-government He has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Truſt of the Regal Inheritance of the Executive Power, both in Himſelf, and in His Heirs, Lineal and Collateral; ſo that the ſame is devolved back to the People, who have alſo the Legiſlative Authority; and conſequently may of Right Give and Diſpoſe thereof, by their Repreſentatives, for their future Peace, Benefit, Security, and Government, according to their good Will and Pleaſure. And foraſmuch as it is abſolutely Neceſſary, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſpeedily ſettled on ſure and laſting Foundations, and conſequently, that ſuch Perſon or Perſons be immediatly placed in the Throne, in whom the Nation has moſt reaſon to repoſe an entire Confidence: It therefore now lies upon Us to make to Judicious a choice, that we may, in all Humane Probability, thereby render Our ſelves a Happy People, and give our Poſterity cauſe to rejoyce, when they ſhal Read the Proceedings of this Wiſe and Grand CONVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION. Who is it therefore, that has ſo highly Merited, the Love and good Opinion of the People? the Honour of Wearing the Crown, and Swaying the Scepter of this Land? As His illuſtrious Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with ſo great Expence, Hazard, Conduct, Courage, and Generoſity, had happily Reſcued Us from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> and with ſo much Gallantry Reſtored Us to our ancient Rights, Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Properties: for which Heroick Action, we can do no leſs, in Prudence, Honour, and Gratitude, than pray Him to Accept our Crown.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is better to ſettle the Exerciſe of the Government in One who is not immediat in the Line, than in One that is,
<list>
                  <item>(1.) Becauſe it is a clear Aſſerting of a Fundamental Right that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and covers the Subjects from Tyranny and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</item>
                  <item>(2.) It cuts off the Diſpute of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(3.) The old Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being legally Diſſolved, and a new one made, the Government is ſecured from falling into the hands of a Papiſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>making</hi> the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> King and Queen joyntly, is the Nation's Gratitude and Generoſity: And by re-continuing the <hi>Line</hi> in Remainder, is manifeſted the ineſteemable Value the People have for the <hi>two Princeſſes,</hi> notwithſtanding the Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Unhappy Father.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The preſent State of <hi>Europe</hi> in General, and of theſe Kingdoms in particular, require a Vigorous and Maſculine Adminiſtration. To recover what's loſt, reſcue what's in danger, and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what's amiſs, cannot be effected but by a Prince that is conſummat in the Art both of Peace and War. Tho' the Prince and Princeſs be King and Queen joyntly, and will equally ſhare the Glory of a Crown, and we the Happineſs of their Auſpicious Reign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the wiſdom of the Grand Convention is manifeſted,
<list>
                  <item>(1ſt.) In placing the Executive Power in one of them, and not in both; for two perſons, equal in Authority, may differ in Opinion, and conſequently in Command; and it is evident no Man can ſerve two Maſters.</item>
                  <item>(2ly.) It's highly neceſſary and prudent;, rather to veſt the Adminiſtration in the Husband than in the Wife:
<list>
                        <item>(1.) Becauſe a Man, by Nature, Education and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is generally rendered more capable to Govern than the Woman. Therefore,</item>
                        <item>(2.) the Husband ought rather to Rule the Wife, than the Wife the Husband, eſpecially conſidering the Vow in Matrimony.</item>
                        <item>(3.) The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is not more proper to Govern as he's Man, and Husband only, but as he is a Man, a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a Prince of known Honour, profound wiſdom, undaunted Courage, and incomparable Merit; as he's a Perſon that's naturally inclin'd to be juſt, Merciful and Peaceable, and to do all publick Acts of Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Advancement of the Intereſt and happineſs of Humane Societies, and therefore moſt fit under Heaven, to have the ſole Executive Power.</item>
