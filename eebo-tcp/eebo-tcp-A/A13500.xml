            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is no matter into whose hands or censure this my <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiae Flagellum,</hi> or Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or Stripping of Pride fall into, if it come into the view of true Nobility or Gentry, I know it will be charitably accepted. If into the hands of degenerate yongsters, that esteeme Pride more then all the Liberall Sciences, who account the foure Cardinall vertues, inferiour to their owne Carnall vices, such a one will put me off with a scornefull tush, a pish, or a mew, and commit my Booke to the protection of Aiax. If a wiseman reade it, I know it will be discreetly censur'd; if a Foole, his Bolt is soone shot, and I am arm'd against it; if a Learned man peruse it,
<pb facs="tcp:18872:5"/>
hee will beare with my bad Schollership; if an vnlearned, I care not for his opinion; if a man of knowledge view it, he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ignorance; if an ignorant Asse see it, hee will bray out his owne; if an honest Richman spy it, hee will be the poorer in spirit though not in purse; but if a proud Diues handle it, hee will esteeme it worse then his dogges; if a proud Courtier reade it, he will teare it to tatters; whilst a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Affable Gentleman, will louingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine it. If beauty chance to behold it, it will bid it welcome, if Pride stand not in the way; if a strong man that is not proud of it, grow aquainted with the contents of my meaning, I thinke it will content him; if Parents, or children, or all, or any body, that are not poysoned with pride, doe but see or heare it distinctly read, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it with iudgement, I am perswaded it will passe and repasse, with friendly vsage,
<pb facs="tcp:18872:5"/>
but if any of the contrary faction come within the Aire of it, they wil vse it in some sort, as bad as the hangman may vse them. And so much for, To no matter <hi>who.</hi>

            <p>It is no great matter <hi>where</hi> this be read, for as a good man (being banished) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer out of his countrey, because all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes are his, so my Booke in Church, Court, City, Countrey, Castle or Cottage, is one and the same; it may perhaps alter the place where it comes from worse to better, but the place can neuer alter the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest entents of it from better to worse. Therefore no great matter <hi>where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be read there is matter, <hi>why,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it strikes at the roote of a most deadly sinne, which almost as bad as an vniuersall deluge, hath ouerflowed the most part of the world; and though the Preachers on Earth, (Gods Trumpets, and ambassadors from Heauen) doe diligently and dayly

strike at this abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the eternal sword of the euerlasting Word, yet what they cut downe in the day, like Mushromes, it growes vp againe thicke and threesold in the night, for whilst the husband-man sleepes, the enuious man sowes tares.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I hauing a talent of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge lent me, by which I know that I must render an account one day, how I haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it, and hauing Written neere forty seuerall pamphlets in former times, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose henceforward (God willing) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time I haue so mispent, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Pen in such exercises (which though they be no free from a rellish of mirth, yet they shall be cleare from profanation, scurrility, or obsceannesse I do know Pride is at such a height, that my Mole-hill Muse can neuer by mineing at her foote, shake her head, for where Diuinity preuailes not, Poetry in medling doth but shew the Suns

brightnesse with a Candle. Yet forasmuch as I know that Pride cast Angels out of Heauen, made diuels in hell, threw man out of Paradise, was a maine causer of the drowning of the first World, is a deuow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of this world, and shall euer be accursed in the world to come, by this knowledge, I haue with a mix'd inuectiue mildnesse, shewed in this Booke the vanities of all sorts of Pride, not that I hope for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to shew my honest intendment.</p>

            <head>A FEW LINES, TO SMALL PVRPOSE, against the Scandalous Aspersions, that are either maliciously, or ignorantly cast vpon the Poets and Poems of these Times.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THere doth a strange, and true opinion runne,</l>
               <l>That Poots write much worse then they haue don:</l>
               <l>And how so poore their daily writings are,</l>
               <l>As though their best inuentions were threed bare.</l>
               <l>And how no new things from them now doth spring,</l>
               <l>But all hath refrence from some other thing.</l>
               <l>And that their daily doings doe reueale,</l>
               <l>How they from one another silch and steale,</l>
               <l>As if amongst them't were a statute made,</l>
               <l>That they may freely use the theeuing trade.</l>
               <l>And some there are that will not sticke to say,</l>
               <l>That many Poets liuing at this day,</l>
               <l>Who haue the Hebrew, Latine, Greeke, at will,</l>
               <l>And in th' Italian and thè French haue skill,</l>
               <l>These are the greatest theeues they say, of all</l>
               <l>That vse the Trade (or Art) Poeticall.</l>
               <l>For ancient Bards, and Poets in strange toungs,</l>
               <l>Compiled haue their verses and their songs:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:8"/>
And those to whom those tongues are rightly knowne,</l>
               <l>Translating them, make others verse their owne,</l>
               <l>As one that steales a Cloake, and presently</l>
               <l>Makes it his owne, by alt'ring of the dye.</l>
               <l>So whole boookes, and whole sentences haue bin</l>
               <l>Stolne, and the stealers, great applause did win,</l>
               <l>And by their filching thought great men of fame,</l>
               <l>By those that knew not the right Authors name.</l>
               <l>For mine owne part, my Conscience witnesse is,</l>
               <l>I ne're was guilty of such theft as this,</l>
               <l>Unto such robbery I could neuer reach,</l>
               <l>Because I vnderstand no forreigne speach.</l>
               <l>To prooue that I am from such filching free,</l>
               <l>Latin and French are heathen-Greeke to me,</l>
               <l>The Grecian, and the Hebrew Charactars,</l>
               <l>I know as well, as I can reach the Starres.</l>
               <l>The sweete Italian, and the Chip Chop Dutch,</l>
               <l>I know the man i'th Moone can speake as much.</l>
               <l>Should I from English Authors, but purloyne,</l>
               <l>It would be soone found counterfeited coyne.</l>
               <l>Then since I cannot steale, but some will spy,</l>
               <l>Ile truely use mine owne, let others lye.</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:8"/>
Tis because bounty from the world is fled,</l>
               <l>True liberality is almost dead.</l>
               <l>Reward is lodg'd in darke obliuion deepe,</l>
               <l>Bewitch't (I thinke) into an endlesse sleepe,</l>
               <l>That though a man in study take great paines,</l>
               <l>And empt his veines, and puluerize his braines,</l>
               <l>To write a Poem well, which being writ</l>
               <l>Wthall his Iudgement, Reason, Art, and Wit,</l>
               <l>And at his owne charge, print and pay for all,</l>
               <l>And giue away most free, and liberall</l>
               <l>Two, three, or foure, or fiue hundred bookes.</l>
               <l>For his reward he shall haue nods and lookes;</l>
               <l>That all the profit a mans paines hath gat,</l>
               <l>Will not suffice one meale to feed a Cat.</l>
               <l>Yet Noble Wcstminster, thou still art free,</l>
               <l>And for thy bounty I am bound to thee:</l>
               <l>For hadst not thou, and thy Inhabitants,</l>
               <l>From Time to Time relieu'd and helpd my wants,</l>
               <l>I had long since bid Poetry adieu</l>
               <l>And therefore still my thankes shall be to you.</l>
               <l>Next to the Court, in generall I am bound</l>
               <l>To you, for many friendships I haue found.</l>
               <l>There (when my purse hath often wanted baite)</l>
               <l>To fill or feed it, I baue had receite.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:9"/>
So much for that, I'le now no more rehearse,</l>
               <l>They shew their loues in prose, my thankes in verse,</l>
               <l>When death, <hi>Mecaenas</hi> did of life depriue,</l>
               <l>Few of his Noble Tribe were left aliue,</l>
               <l>This makes Inuention to be meane and hard,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Auarice</hi> doth killreward.</l>
               <l>And yet me thinkes, it plainely doth appeare,</l>
               <l>Mens writings are as good as e're they were.</l>
               <l>Good lines are like a Banquet ill imployd,</l>
               <l>Where too much feeding hath the stomack cloyde.</l>
               <l>Good verses fall sometimes (by course of fate)</l>
               <l>Into their hands that are preiudicate.</l>
               <l>And though, the Writer ne're so well hath pend,</l>
               <l>Yet they'le find fault with what they cannot mend.</l>
               <l>Thus many a learned well composed line,</l>
               <l>Hath bin as Pearle that's cast before a swine.</l>
               <l>Or more familiarly to make compare,</l>
               <l>Like Aquauitae giuen vnto a Mare.</l>
               <l>These fellowes, (glutted with variety)</l>
               <l>Hold Good lines in a loath'd saciety,</l>
               <l>Whiest paltry Riming, Libells, Iigges, and Iests,</l>
               <l>Are to their appetites continuall feafts.</l>
               <l>With which their fancies they doe feed and fill,</l>
               <l>And take the Ill for good, the Good for ill.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:9"/>
Whilst like to Monkeyes, (scorning wholesome meate)</l>
               <l>They grredily doe poysnous spiders eate.</l>
               <l>So let them feed vntill their humours burst,</l>
               <l>And thus much bold to tell them heere I durst.</l>
               <l>That Poetry is now as good as euer,</l>
               <l>If bounty, to relieue her would endeuer.</l>
               <l>Mens mindes are worse then they haue bin of yore,</l>
               <l>Inuention's good now, as it was before.</l>
               <l>Let liberality awake, and then</l>
               <l>Each Poet in his hand will take a pen,</l>
               <l>And with rare lines inrich a world of paper,</l>
               <l>Shall make <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Muses caper.</l>

               <l>MAN, and then did th'Almighty Red Earth take,</l>
               <l>With which he formed <hi>Adam,</hi> euery limine,</l>
               <l>And (hauing made him) breathed life in him.</l>
               <l>Loe, thus the first Man neuer was a Child,</l>
               <l>No way with sinne originall defil'd:</l>
               <l>But with high Supernat'rall Vnderstanding,</l>
               <l>He ouer all the World had sole commanding.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:11"/>
Yet though to him the Regency was giuen,</l>
               <l>As Earths Lieutenant to the God of Heauen,</l>
               <l>Though he commanded all Created things,</l>

               <l>Though he so highly heere was dignifide,</l>

               </l>
               <l>He could not brag or boast of high borne birth,</l>
               <l>For he was formed out of slime and earth:</l>
               <l>No Beast, fish, worme, fowle, herbe, weed, stone, or tree,</l>
               <l>But are of a more ancient house then he;</l>
               <l>For they were made before him, which proues this</l>
               <l>That their Antiquity is more then his.</l>
               <l>Thus both himselfe, and his beloued Spouse,</l>
               <l>Are by Creation of the younger house,</l>
               <l>And whilst they liu'd in perfect Holinesse,</l>
               <l>Their richest Garments were bare Nakednesse,</l>
               <l>True Innocency were their chiefest weeds,</l>
               <l>(For Righteousnesse no Masque or Visor needs.)</l>
               <l>The royal'st robes that our first Parents had,</l>
               <l>Was a free Conscience with Vprightnesse clad;</l>
               <l>They needed ne're to shift; the cloathes they wore</l>
               <l>Was Nakednesse, and they desir'd no more;</l>
               <l>Vntill at last, that Hell-polluting sin,</l>
               <l>With Disobedience soil'd their Soules within,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18872:12"/>
And hauing lost their holines Perfection,</l>
               <l>They held their Nakednes an Imperfection.</l>
               <l>Then (being both asham'd) they both did frame</l>
               <l>Garments, as weedes of their deserued shame.</l>
               <l>Thus, when as sinne had brought Gods curse on man</l>
               <l>Then shame to make Apparell first began,</l>
               <l>E're man had sin'd, most plaine it doth appeare,</l>
               <l>He neither did, or needed Garments weare,</l>
               <l>For his Apparell did at first beginne,</l>
               <l>To be the Robes of pennance for his sinne.</l>
               <l>Thus all the brood of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of <hi>Eue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The true vse of Apparell may perceiue,</l>
               <l>That they are Liueries, Badges, vnto all</l>
               <l>Of our sinnes, and our Parents wofull fall.</l>
               <l>Then morethen mad, these mad-brain'd people be</l>
               <l>(Or else they see, and will not seeme to see)</l>
               <l>That these same Robes (with Pride) that makes them swell</l>
               <l>Are tokens that our best desert is hell.</l>

I thinke this man most madly would appeare</l>

               <l>But if he should vaingloriously persist</l>
               <l>To make a Rope of silke or golden twise,</l>
               <l>And weare't as a more honourable showe</l>
               <l>Of his Rebellion, then course hempe or towe,</l>
               <l>Might not men justly say he were an Asse,</l>
               <l>Triumphing that he once a Villaine was,</l>
               <l>And that he wore a Halter for the nonce,</l>
               <l>In pride that he deserued hanging once?</l>
               <l>Such with our Heau'nly father is the Case,</l>
               <l>Of our first Parents and their sinfull Race,</l>
               <l>Apparell is the miserable signe,</l>
               <l>That we are Traytors to our Lord diuine,</l>
               <l>And we (like Rebels) still most pride doe take</l>
               <l>In that which still most humble should vs make,</l>
               <l>Apparell is the prison for our sinne</l>
               <l>Which most should shame, yet most we Glory in;</l>
               <l>Apparell is the sheete of shame as't were</l>
               <l>Which (for our pennance) on our backs we beare,</l>

               <l>How vaine is it for man, a clod of Earth,</l>

               <l>Like the humility of <hi>Absolon:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This shadowed <hi>Pride,</hi> much danger waites vpon</l>
               <l>These are the counterfeite (God faue yee Sirs)</l>
               <l>That haue their flattries in particulars,</l>
               <l>That courteously can hide their proud intents,</l>
               <l>Vnder varieties of complements.</l>
               <l>These vipers bend the knee, and kisse the hand,</l>
               <l>And sweare, (sweet Sir) I am at your command.</l>
               <l>And proudly make humility a screw,</l>
               <l>To wring themselues into opinions view.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Pride</hi> is hatefull, dangerous, and vile,</l>
               <l>And shall it selfe (at last) it selfe beguile.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Pride</hi> is deadly sinne, &amp; sinne brings shame,</l>
               <l>Which heere I leaue to hell, from whence it came</l>
