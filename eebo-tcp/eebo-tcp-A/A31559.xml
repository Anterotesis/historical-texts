            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Speech made in the House
of Commons the 26th day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1646. (upon the Reading of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Papers the same day, In Reply to the
Votes of both Houses of Parliament of the
24th. of Sept. concerning the disposall of
the Kings Person,) spoken by Thomas
Chaloner, Esquier, a Member of
the said House.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have just now heard two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
Read before you from the
Commissioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the
first concerning the disposall of the
Kings Person, the other touching
the distractions of the North, by
reason (as they say) of the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment
of their Army: I shall speak nothing to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57772:2"/>
latter, because it hath beene so sufficiently answered
by divers knowing Members of this House. To the
first I shall wholly apply my selfe, because little or
nothing hath beene said to that point.</p>
            <p>The question then before you is, about the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseall
of the Kings person, you say that, hee is to be
disposed of as both Houses of Parliament shall
think fitting, but your Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> say hee
is to be disposed of as both Kingdomes shall think
fitting, And they Fortifie their affirmation with
these reasons.</p>
            <p>They say that he is not only King of <hi>England,</hi> but
also King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as you have an interest in
him, hee being King of <hi>England,</hi> so have they no
lesse interest in him hee being KING of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And as they have not the sole interest
in him, hee being KING of Scotland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they acknowledge with all, that hee is King of
<hi>England,</hi> so have not you the sole interest in him, he
being King of <hi>England,</hi> because they desire you to
remember, that he is also King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> so as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation having a sole, but a joynt Interest in his
person, they ought joyntly to dispose of it for the
weale and benefit of both Kingdomes:</p>
            <p>This I take to bee the whole scope of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which they have represented unto you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so many disguises, and as it were by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57772:2"/>
glasses, Insomuch as the bare relating of it takes
up three large sheets of paper.</p>
            <p>But while they debate this great question with
you, touching the disposall of the Kings Person, and
while they possitively affirme, that he is to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of by the joynt consent of both Nations. Give
me leave to remember you that in the meane time,
they dispose wholly of him themselves, and so have
done for these six months, and may for six months
longer, for any thing I can gather out of these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>Their Argument runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wheresoever the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath an
Interest in there King, there they may dispose of him.
But the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath an Interest
in their King, he being in England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore in <hi>England</hi> they may dispose of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, This may seeme at the first to some to be a
faire and specious Argument, but let it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
it will prove erronious and Fallacious. For
in the Major Proposition they understand one
thing by the word King, and in the minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
they understand another thing by the
word King, and so here is a conclusion inferred,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57772:3"/>
which the premisses will not warrant.</p>
            <p>For the cleering whereof, I pray Sir, remember
that this word King is of a various signification,
sometimes it is taken in <hi>abstracto,</hi> that is for the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
power, Function, and office of a King, sometimes
it is taken in <hi>Concreto,</hi> that is for the man or person
whom we call King.</p>
            <p>If their Major Proposition be taken in the first
sense, we shall never deny it them, nay wee shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> being taken in
<hi>abstracto,</hi> wee have nothing to doe with him at all,
hee is solely and totally theirs; God forbid that a
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> going out of his Kingdome, should
either make <hi>Scotland</hi> cease to bee a Kingdome, or
give any participation of interest to that Countrey
where hee doth reside, Let his person reside in the
furthest parts of the earth; yet the Royall Office
and Capacity of the King resideth still in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
They have his sword to do Iustice by, they have his
Scepter to shew mercy by they have his Seale to
confirme what they please by: And they have his
Lawes to Governe by; And in this sense it is only
meant that the King is never under yeares, never
dyes, cannot bee deceived, can neither do wrong,
not take wrong, of any body; And in this sense we
fight for King and Parliament, though the person
of the King bee in opposition to both, and in this
sense the returnes and tests of the Kings Writs are,
<hi>Coram me ipso apud VVestmonasterium,</hi> and <hi>teste me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipso
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57772:3"/>
apud VVestmonasterium,</hi> let the Person of the
King at the same time be in <hi>France,</hi> or the remotest
Country of the world; but a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> taken
in this sense is never out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore
whereas they say in the minor Proposition. That
the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath an interest in their
King, he being in <hi>England,</hi> this must needs be meant
of a King in <hi>Concreto,</hi> that is onely of the person of
their King, and not of his Royall Capacity, And in
this sense we must deny that they have any thing at
all to doe with him. For though the Royall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is solely to bee disposed
of by the State of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Yet it is not so with
his Person. For <hi>Persona sequitur loc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m;</hi> and his
person must be disposed of by the supreame power
of that Country wheresoever he shall happen to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide.
Suppose a King of <hi>Scotland</hi> should bee in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> will they say, they have as great an interest to
dispose of his Person there as in <hi>Scotland, I</hi> thinke
they will not say so: and yet they did affirme last
day at the Conference, that they had as good right
to dispose of his person at Westminster, as they had
at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> But under their favour <hi>England</hi> is as
distinct a Kingdome from <hi>Scotland</hi> as <hi>Spaine:</hi> It is as
distinct in Lawes, distinct in Priviledges, distinct in
interest, it is neither subordinate, nor dependent of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and they can no more dispose of a King
of <hi>Scotlands</hi> person, he being in <hi>England,</hi> then if he
were in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57772:4"/>I shall take this as granted for good Law, that let
the person of any Nation under the fun, which is in
amity with <hi>England,</hi> happen to come into <hi>England,</hi>
that person is forthwith a subject of <hi>ENGLAND</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For hee being protected by the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hee becomes thereby subject to those Lawes,
it being most certaine that <hi>Protectio trahit subjectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
&amp; subjectio protectionem,</hi> they being relatives,
the one cannot stand without the other, and as no
man can be said to be a father that hath no son, nor
no man a husband, that hath no wife, so no man
can bee said to bee protected, that is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thereby subjected. And since without such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
every man may kill him, and destroy him.
It seemes to stand with no proportion of Justice,
that a man should bee protected in Life, Limbe, or
estate by any law that will not subject himselfe to
that Law.</p>
            <p>It cannot bee denyed, but that there is a
twofold subjection legall, and locall, the
legall subjection is due from every subject
to his naturall Prince, the locall from any
Forreigner to that Prince or State where his
person doth reside. And this, though it be
onely <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and the other, during life:
Yet it doth for the time totally obstruct the
operation of the other subjection: So that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57772:4"/>
no King can command any subject of his,
living out of his Kingdome, but such subject
of his, is to bee disposed of, by the sole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that supreame power, where hee
makes his Residence: And since the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is onely about the person of a King of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> for I conceive they will not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them any Authority to dispose of the
Person of a King of <hi>England,</hi> I doe affirmc
that if a King of <hi>Scotland</hi> should have come
into ENGLAND, before the Union of both
these Kingdomes, hee had beene instantly a
subject of England and his person to bee
disposed of by the sole Authority of the
Lawes of England.</p>
            <p>For either wee must take him as a King
or a Subject, since betwixt them two there
is no medium, as a King wee cannot take
him, unlesse wee should commit Treason
against our naturall Prince, and subject our
selves to any but to him, it being most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that there is the same relation betwixt
the King and his Subjects, as betwixt the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57772:5"/>
husband and his wife, and as no man can be
said to be a husband but his own Wife;
So no man can be said <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be a King but to
his owne subjects, and therefore we cannot
admit of any Regality in the person of a
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> comming into <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
at the same time, to the same person we
should confesse subjection. For that it is
most true, that as none can be said to be <hi>Rex
sine Regno,</hi> so no man can be said to bee <hi>Rex</hi>
but in <hi>Regno:</hi> Therefore if a King of <hi>Scotland</hi>
comming as afore said into <hi>England,</hi> if against
the Lawes of England hee doe offend, by
those Laws of <hi>England</hi> he must be tryed, and
by none other, For <hi>ubi quis delinquit, ibi punie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
And it is most sure, that we have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the persons of Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into <hi>England</hi> both living and dead.
And if wee may dispose of the person of a
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> without the consent of the
Kingdome of SCOTLAND, much
more may wee dispose of the person of
a King of ENGLAND, hee being now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57772:5"/>
in England without their privity or advice.
But if they have any power to dispose of him, it
is because they are either our Masters or our
Fellows: if they be our Masters, let them shew
the time when they conquerd us, or the price for
which we were sold unto them: If they be our
Fellows, why come they not to our Parliaments,
why contribute they not to our necessities? But as
it is apparent that they being two distinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
governed by two distinct Lawes: so they
ought not to intermeddle one with anothers inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
but to content themselves with what doth
naturally appertaine to each of them severally.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt to be made, but that every
Husband hath as great an interest in the person
of his wife, as any Subject hath in the person of
his Soveraigne; and yet a man may lose that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
by some act of his Wives, as if she commit
Felony, Murder, or Treason, the Law disposeth of
her person, and her husband cannot claime any
right, so much as to her dead body: so fareth it
with a King, who by going out of his Kingdome,
or by being taken prisoner by his enemies, his
Subjects lose the interest they had in him, and
he is at the disposall of his enemies <hi>Iure belli.
Iohn</hi> King of England was cited to appeare at
Paris to answer for the death of <hi>Arthur Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet</hi>
Duke of Britaine whom hee had murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the State of England would not let him
goe, as holding it a great indignity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
that a King of England should answer for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57772:6"/>
any thing at Paris right or wrong; The French
answered that they cited him not as King of
England, but as Duke of Normandy; as King
of England they acknowledged to have nothing
to doe with him, he was in that respect without
them and beyond them; but as Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy
which he held in fee of the Crown of
France, he owed fealty and allegiance for the same
to the Crowne of France, and therefore ought
to answer. The English replied, that if the
Duke of Normandy did goe, the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
must goe; and if the Duke of Normandy
were beheaded, they knew well enough what
would become of the King of England; Upon
large debate hereof by all the Lawyers in France
it was resolved that if <hi>Iohn</hi> had been in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy
at the time of his summons, he ought to
have appeared; but he being <hi>Extra jurisdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Reg<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i Franciae</hi> at the time of his summons,
and <hi>infra jurisdictionem Regni Angliae,</hi> though
legally he were a subject of France, yet locally
he being in England, his summons was voyd,
and hee forfeited nothing by his non-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>I will onely urge one argument more deduced
from a knowne maxime of the Law, not of
England but of Scotland also, which the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
of Scotland the other day at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
did cite themselves, in my opinion much
against themselves, and that is this, <hi>Quando Duo
Iura, imo Duo Regna</hi> (sayth a great Lawyer) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57772:6"/>
in una persona, aequum est ac si essent in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis,</hi>
which is no more then this, when two
kingdomes held by two distinct Titles doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in one and the same person, it is all one as
if they were in two distinct persons. I suppose
here is our very case, here are two kingdomes.
England and Scotland, held by two distinct
Titles, which doe both concur in one Person,
in the person of King CHARLES; it is all one
sayth this rule and maxime of the Law, as if
they were under two severall persons; why
then put the case, that there were one King of
England and another of Scotland, should the
State of Scotland have any thing to doe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the person of a King of England, he
being in England? I thinke you will say they
could not.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am sorry that our brethren have moved
this question at this time; for all questions make
debates, and debates differences; and this were
a time for brothers to reconcile differences ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to make them; we have now lived 44
yeeres, both under two Princes, and in all this
time this question was never stirred in, till now;
had it been stirred in, no question but it had been
rejected. The people of England would have
held it very strange that they could not have
disposed of the person of their owne King, or
that a King of England could not have gone from
Whitehall to Richmond or Hampton-court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57772:7"/>
the will and appointment of the Councell
of Scotland: they would have thought they
had made an evill bargaine by such a union.
For before the union they might have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the person of their Prince; but after,
not. And since they conceived that by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scotland there was an addition of charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they would have been very sorry withall to have
had an addition of servility.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of the World there was
never before such a contention about the person
of a King. The Greekes and Trojans did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for a long time in fight about the dead body
of <hi>Partroclus</hi> which of them should have it. But
here is not a contention about the dead body of
a private man, but about the living body of a
King; neither doe we contend as they did, who
should have his person, but here you do contend
(as farre as I conceive) who should not have
it. Your brethren of Scotland say positively they
will not have the Kings person upon any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever. It is now above six moneths
past that you voted in this House the demanding
of the Kings person, but the Lords refused to
joyne with ye; ever since untill this present you
your selfe did Acquiesce as if you had repented of
your former vote; Now he must be put upon you,
and with such termes as his present Gardians
please to allow of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57772:7"/>Truly it seemes strange to me, that an Army
of Scots in pay of the kingdome of England,
which by the Treaty ought to be governed by
the joynt consent of the Committees of both
kingdomes upon the place, should in England
take a King of England without the privity of
the English Committee, and convey him to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle
a Towne likewise of England, and should
there keepe him for six whole moneths without
the consent of both Houses of Parliament. And
when they finde it not convenient for them to
keepe him any longer, then they will capitulate
with you upon what conditions you must receive
his person.</p>
            <p>I never thought to have found a King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
his person being in England, under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protection but that of the Lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
but now I finde him under the protection
of a Scottish Army, whether they say hee is fled;
for shelter, and that they cannot render him up
in Honour.</p>
            <p>Sir, if that Army of theirs be come into this
kingdome as brethren, friends, and confederates
(as we hope they are) then is every person of
that Army during the time of his stay here locally
a subject of England, and such children as are
borne to them here are not Aliens but Denisons,
and not onely locall but legall Subjects of this
kingdome. And therefore they having gotten
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57772:8"/>
the King into their hands, they ought no more
to capitulate upon what terms he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into yours, then if the Army of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Fairfax</hi> were in possession thereof, who if
they should deny the surrendring of the King
unto you, but upon condition, no question but
it were capitall.</p>
            <p>They say, that by vertue of the Covenant they
are obliged to defend his Person and Authority.
What his Authority is in Scotland themselves
best know; but you onely are to judge of it in
England, since being not subordinate to any
power on Earth, there is no power under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
can judge you. The Covenant ties you to
maintaine in the first place the Rights of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the liberties of the Kingdome; and
in the second place the Kings Person and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and that onely in defence of the former,
and not otherwise. And whereas they expect
the King should be received by you with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
safety, and freedome, I beseech you, Sir,
consider whether (as the case now stands) his
Reception with Honour can stand with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Kingdome, whether his safety be
not incompatible with the safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and whether his freedome be not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the freedome of the people.</p>
            <p>I pray (Sir) take heed least that bringing him
in with Honour you doe not dishonour your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57772:8"/>
selfe, and question the very justice of all your
Actions; be wary that in receiving him with
safety you doe not thereby endanger and hazard
the Common-wealth; be advised least in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him home with freedome, you doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
lead the people of England in thraldome.</p>
            <p>I pray (Sir) first settle the honour, safety and
freedome of the Common-wealth, and then the
honour, safety, and freedome of the King, so far
as the latter may stand with the former, and
not otherwise</p>
            <p>Wherefore I shall conclude with my humble
desire that you would adhere to your former vote
that is, that the King be disposed of as both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament shall thinke fitting; and that
you enter into no Treaty either with the King
or your brethren of Scotland, least otherwise
thereby you retard the going home of their Army
out of England.</p>
