         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

an Altar in the ſaid Church, and doth uſe frequent and offenſive bowing and cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto, compelling others to doe the like, and hath kiſſed the Altar
three times in one day, and doth conſtantly read the Prayers in the Divine Service with
his face toward the Altar and backe towards the people, ſo that many of them cannot
heare what is ſaid.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Vicar, openly in the Pulpit of the ſaid Church, hath ſpoken theſe enſuing words, or words
to the ſame effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That his Fathers Soule was in heaven, making interceſſion for his, and that it was lawfull to pray
unto Saints if the time would permit.</p>
            <p>2. That the Commands of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> (whom he compared unto the high
Prieſt) were equally to be obeyed with Gods command in his word.</p>
            <p>3. That the ſaid Vicar hath ſaid, that the King is not Supreame head of the Church next under Chriſt,
and being demanded who then was? he anſvvered, the Biſhops; and ſaid further, that no Miniſter, vvho under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
himſelfe, vvould pray for the King as Supreame head of the Church under Chriſt, and that there
hath been no true Religion in <hi>England</hi> theſe 40. yeares, and being then told he was a friend to the Pope, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he loved the Pope vvith all his heart, and affirmeth that the Pope is not <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> vvhoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he is.</p>
            <p>4. That the ſaid Vicar hath declared, that vvhatſoever any perſon (vvho had entred into holy orders)
did ſpeake, he ſpake by Divine Inſpiration, and being urged, that then they differed not from thoſe that
wrote the holy Scriptures, he made no anſwer to that, but impudently and blaſphemouſly perſiſting in his
former opinions ſaid further, that, if the Divell could have orders put upon him, vvhatſoever he ſhould ſay,
ſhould be by Divine inſpiration.</p>
            <p>5. That the ſaid Vicar hath ſaid, that if a man uſually meet vvith occaſions of Drunkeneſſe or Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and be actually overcome by them, yet ſuch a man doth not ſin, becauſe he ſought not the occaſion.</p>
            <p>6. That the ſaid Vicar hath beene oftentimes ſeene drunke, and his wife hath reported that he vvas a
Papiſt in heart, and did weare a Crucifix in his boſome and kept one in his ſtudy, and that hee ſo bitterly
threatned her for not bovving to it, as ſhe vvas conſtrained to cry out for helpe and hide herſelfe.</p>
            <p>7. And laſtly, the ſaid Vicar hath ſaid, the houſe of Parliament hath nothing to doe in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but if any things were amiſſe, complaint ought to be made to the Biſhops, and they were to reforme
it, and hath alſo uttered many other words tending to the diſhonour of the High and Honourable Court of

            <p>IT is obvious to the judicious, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> have beene the originall cauſe of all the diviſions and
Schiſmes in the Church, as well ſince the Reformation as before, as may appeare by their withſtanding of it in
the beginning, and alſo ever ſince by their impoſing things upon mens conſciences, contrary to Gods Word,
and to the vttermoſt of their power perſecuting all zealous and Godly Miniſters, becauſe they vvould not be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to their ungodly commands, and in the meane time maintaining and countenancing a dumb idle and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Miniſtry, ſo long as they would be conformable to them, yea Popiſh Miniſters and Popiſhly addicted; as may
appeare both by this Petition and many other preſented to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to divers former <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
but the <hi>Prelates</hi> bare ſuch a ſway that no good could be effected. Wherefore let every good Chriſtian pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto God, that he would put into the hearts of his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and this <hi>Parliament,</hi> utterly to aboliſh this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
