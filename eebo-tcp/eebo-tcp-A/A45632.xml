            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the drudgery of writing were a <hi>Penance</hi> impos'd upon this Author, he may now at last hope for a release; having sacrific'd so much credit, with so great disadvantage to his Cause, that the Interest he design'd to serve is concern'd to sue for his <hi>Quietus.</hi> For though the scarcity of tolerable writers for the Papists did in some measure cover the meaneness of his other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, it will hardly recommend these last Essays, which have sunk below the level of <hi>Catholic Pamphlets,</hi> and (what is yet harder to imagine) degenerated even from <hi>his own.</hi> His first efforts were indeed weak, but they aim'd at our Capitol; and tho' neither the strength nor conduct, yet the boldness of the Adversary made them considerable: but now the Man that once attacqu'd our establishment both in Church and State, is dwindled to an insidious hinter; disdains not to Transcribe two little hotheaded Enthusiasts; and to shew the profoundness of his humility challenges nothing to himself but that which vitiates the work, <hi>the mixture of Reflexions.</hi> His former pieces had somthing of grandeur in the <hi>Title;</hi> and lookt like one of his <hi>Italian Hospitals;</hi>

            <p>Is <hi>this</hi> then at last the great result of his leisure after so long deliberation? Is <hi>this</hi> that for which the <hi>four parts</hi> of <hi>Church-Government</hi> must still be postpon'd? and give way to the naked <hi>Epitome</hi> of a Spittle-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? I confess I cannot imagine why he submitted to such an inglorious undertaking, unless he had some hope, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>this book</hi> might prove too mean to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and by its unworthiness escape the hard fate of confutation which has fallen so heavy on his other works. And this had certainly secur'd him; but that he was lately pleas'd to administer fresh Provocation; after a long silence had almost persuaded the world he began to understand his strength. But if <hi>He</hi> persevere in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wee shall always be ready to do him reason; and hope to convince <hi>him</hi> too (if it be possible) that he spoyls <hi>everything</hi> he undertakes.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will expect no Apology for the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Reflexions; which should have appear'd much earlier, had we meant to meddle with this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But late as they are, I believe they will come to most men, before they have seen <hi>his</hi> Treatise; and by consequence, before an answer to it is expected. For as it is this Author's peculiar happiness that his works are never known till they are answer'd; so <hi>this</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar has been so little inquired after, that it rather seem'd to be expos'd than publish'd.</p>

            <head>Some Reflexions, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE have been many ingenuous <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,</hi> who have had little sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but some of Honor; who, when they forgot to be Christians, remembred they were English-men; and tho' they were no good observers of the Laws of their Country, yet preserv'd a sense of those inbred obligations to it, which of all propensities to virtue, are the last shaken off. But so much generosity as this amounts to, is not frequent among our <hi>Roman Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi> who learn not only to defy the force of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, but cancel the common instincts of Nature; and tho' they can by no statutes be induc'd to abjure the Kingdom, are easily persuaded to renounce their allegiance to it. <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> first began, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> carryed on this holy war against their common Mother; which hath since been successively continu'd by all members and candidates of <hi>that Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi> men that have lost all claim to the title of English-men, unless we allow an English-man to be what they define him, <hi>a Feudatory Vassal of Rome.</hi> And yet, tho' many of this Author's Predecessors have thus industriously aspers'd their Country, they have been still so prudent as to spread their Calumnyes at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101427:4"/>
               <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Rheims</hi> heard sad relations of our Sacrilege; <hi>Pasquin</hi> and <hi>Marforio,</hi> talkt largely of our impiety; But it was a fresh piece of assurance to libel the English charity at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the very walls confront the accusation, and our Author's own annual revenues proclame it to be false and ingrateful. For it is not the <hi>Protestant Devotion</hi> only, against which these Reflexions are design'd, but the <hi>English liberality;</hi> and we are oblig'd to answer, not only as <hi>Sons of the Church,</hi> but as <hi>Natives of the Soil,</hi> and (what is more) as the heirs of a despis'd Munificence.</p>
            <p>To charge <hi>England</hi> with a want of Charity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the most common exercises of it as new disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in this Island, is the Complement of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and seems to look like a kind admonition: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to prefer the <hi>Roman</hi> charity as more exalted, and the French piety as more refin'd than ours, and to carry on the jest in a mortify'd stile with a shew of gravity and seriousness; of so flat a Lampoon is the most virulent that ever was written. These groundless slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Fathers and Benefactors, coming from one, who is maintain'd by them, would naturally force us to some harshness of Expression; and that notorious eminence of our Ancestors works, which has made it no difficult task to refute these calumnies, hath made it the more hard to refute them with candor, and to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify an answer. It was therefore once thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site (that all occasion of contest might be avoided) bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set the Monuments of English Charity in their true light; and to give them no other advantage than what they must necessarily receive, by being oppos'd to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian.</hi> But this would be a work of leisure, unless we would use no more exactness than this Author does in his; and though it is but due to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101427:4"/>
the merits of our Ancestors, is far more than this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet can deserve. At present therefore it shall be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make some <hi>short Reflexions on this Treatise;</hi> and to <hi>justify the necessity of making them;</hi> and that. <hi>First</hi> by <hi>Exposing</hi> the <hi>malice of the design;</hi> and <hi>2dly</hi> by <hi>Proving the falsity of the insinuations</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>First then, I am not insensible, that some men, not only those who are <hi>influenc'd by prejudices,</hi> but others too of an <hi>easy nature,</hi> and an <hi>obedient reason,</hi> may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of this, as an <hi>inoffensive</hi> Treatise; and such as should rather excite our Emulation, than require our Censure. <q>For there are some virtues so <hi>transcendent,</hi> that, as the necessity of them never enters into dispute; so ought neither the exercise, nor the due praise of them, wherever Exercis'd, to be prejudic'd by our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests. And if Charity and Devotion be the chief of those, in which all Parties center, and agree, and which all equally think <hi>commendable;</hi> what <hi>ill-nature</hi> would it be in the <hi>Levite</hi> to <hi>Envy and lessen</hi> the praise of the <hi>Charitable,</hi> tho' <hi>dissenting, Samaritan?</hi> There can therefore be no sinister intention in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Liberality, and a Panegyric on Devotion; or, if there should have been any seeming Grounds for suspicion, the Good well-meaning Author hath remov'd all occasion of jealousy; and openly protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Scene of such publick Pieties, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> cannot <hi>in his judgment,</hi> give any just cause of offence:</q> I confess therefore, I have not only this Author's <hi>word</hi> for it, that he is of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but his <hi>reasons</hi> that <hi>inclin'd</hi> him to it; and having consider'd both the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>his Arguments,</hi> and made all just allowances for the <hi>measure of the Capacity,</hi> they were to work on, I must yet beg his Pardon, If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>believe him.</hi> And tho' I am far from apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101427:5"/>
any danger from the force of his reasons, yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the influence, they may have on some mens cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; I shall be as much concern'd to <hi>detect</hi> the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the reflexions,</hi> as the <hi>falsity of the slander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident then, that ever since the first Reformers began to protest against the doctrine of Merits; and chose rather to rely on an <hi>imputative,</hi> than an <hi>inherent justice;</hi> those, who little understood the <hi>Energy</hi> of an <hi>active faith,</hi> represented them, as <hi>open Libertines;</hi> and the <hi>professed enemies</hi> of those works, which they could not think <hi>meritorious:</hi> This <hi>Calumny,</hi> that had scarce foundation enough to make it seem <hi>plausible,</hi> was yet <hi>universally receiv'd;</hi> and <hi>promiscuously us'd</hi> against the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>the Disciples of Cranmer in England.</hi> In all the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges</hi> from <note n="a" place="bottom">

Now the Notions of the <hi>Romanists</hi> in this <hi>point of Merit</hi> are so gross, and extravagant, that a Man, who is not inclin'd to <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> may reasonably doubt, whether <hi>any one act</hi> of true Charity ever was, or indeed can be founded on those Principles. For Charity exerts it-self in <hi>Free-gifts;</hi> and nothing is properly <hi>given;</hi> where the <hi>pretended Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> can <hi>demand</hi> an <hi>Equivalent.</hi> To <hi>give</hi> is to <hi>part with Right;</hi> and every Benefactor must necessarily put himself, if not out of the <hi>hope of receiving,</hi> yet out of the <hi>Capacity of requiring retribution.</hi> Whoever distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes his Mammon, and leaves him-self the Power of <hi>Exacting</hi> a greater return; is no more liberal, than he, who puts his money to <hi>interest,</hi> and <hi>buys a title</hi> to an Estate in <hi>Reversion.</hi> If therefore we would make an exact Parallel between the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; we ought not only to consider the <hi>largeness of the</hi>

               <hi>Expence,</hi> but the <hi>Generosity of the design;</hi> since Good Deeds are to be measur'd by the <hi>Ends, and Intents</hi> for which they are done; and there may be <hi>great Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,</hi> where there is <hi>no liberality.</hi> He that <hi>conveys alms</hi> to the Poor with an <hi>unwarrantable design,</hi> is an instrument of Providence but is no more charitable for being so, than the <hi>Raven,</hi> that fed <hi>Elijah.</hi> Our bounty therefore, should it be found more <hi>frugal,</hi> is yet more <hi>heroical, generous, and disinteress'd:</hi> and neither can be the <hi>result of our Covetousness, nor the occasion of our Pride.</hi> But, upon an exact scrutiny, we shall find; that these different Speculations have not the <hi>expected influence</hi> on our Practice; and that the <hi>Giver</hi> not only distributes <hi>more freely,</hi> but <hi>more largely</hi> than the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser.</hi>

            <p>This then is their Spiritual Charity. The next thing, which this Author chiefly insists on, is the magnificence of their Churches and Hospitals; some of which we willingly own to be sumptuous, and shall assign the reason of their Foundation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> had ingross'd the riches of most Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Europe, and had made the other Provinces as tributary to their Bishop, as they had been before to their Emperors; some methods were thought on, which might still improve this profitable devotion, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the revenues of the Chamber, And since it was evident, that their treasure was much advanc'd by the offerings of Pilgrims, while there; and more by their favourable relations, when they return'd; humane prudence advis'd them to consider, what motives, would most invite such advantagious guests to the City; and most oblige them in it. Stately, and Pompous Churches adorn'd with some reputed Relicks, and feign'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101427:8"/>
images were the most likely things to attract them; Good Hospitals, and kind receptives, the most probable motives, to induce them to a good opinion of the Place, and a Panegyric on those, that entertain'd them. Thus <note n="m" place="bottom">See Onup. Panv. of the 7 Churches. And Warcup. p. 160. &amp; Schrader. in Monum. Romae Edi. 1592.</note> the vast Churches, and Rich Shrines of <hi>Rome</hi> were built; thus the large Inns, and magnificent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals were endow'd, as things, that would certainly turn to accompt; and repay the Undertaker with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>And as every Nation contributed to this Common Bank of the Treasures of Europe; so was it but reasonable that the Bank should maintain a College for the receipt of her liberal Votaries. But how can it be justly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we should make equal provisions for Knights Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in <hi>England,</hi> unless they brought equal gains to our Coffers? <hi>England</hi> was a <note n="n" place="bottom">Se Mat.

They are indeed <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scata dona;</hi> not the gifts of a generous Bishop, but the baits of a Miser. The Masters of Ecclesiastical Policy undertook a new Trade; their rich Altars, and Shrines succeeded in the place of their Circi, and Amphitheatres; And the latter shew was far the more gainful.</p>
            <p>This Author then is very much deceiv'd, when he mistakes them for <hi>Roman</hi> Hospitals, which are <hi>Ours;</hi> which were bought with <hi>our</hi> mony; and with less
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101427:9"/>
than the Tenths of it; and which are not the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Italian Piety, but of English Folly.</p>
            <p>Thus these Fabricks were erected for bad Ends; nor are they apply'd to better uses. Some of which as our Author professes, are receptacles for Bastards only, and <note n="p" place="bottom">See Pi. Rom. p. 108.</note> converted Whores.</p>
            <p>To use no discrimination in Charity between the good and the bad hath once been thought blameable; but to make a difference, and to exclude all honest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, is a crime, that hath not usually been accus'd, because hardly suppos'd. But the Popes revenues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the stews; 'tis but just, and grateful that those places should receive Prostitutes, which rose up at their Cost; and, like one of the Pyramids, were built with the price of sin. Rome found in its infancy the advantage of this Trade; and therefore still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be the <hi>Asylum</hi> of sinners. These Provisions then, however warmly recommended by this Author to us in <hi>England,</hi> will probably be thought unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, till the return of the Celibate.</p>
            <p>But since we are not willing to insist on so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Topick; we will proceed to consider, whether Rome may justly boast, if not of the good imployment, yet at least of the wise management, and greatness of her Charity.</p>
            <p>First then, the <hi>care</hi> of the Poor is equally <hi>impos'd</hi> on all Christian Communities; But the <hi>Method</hi> of that <hi>care</hi> is wholly <hi>undetermin'd,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary.</hi> For that the <hi>Impotent</hi> should be <hi>reliev'd</hi> is the <hi>injunction of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;</hi> and consequently <hi>fixt,</hi> and <hi>setled:</hi> But that such <hi>Quota's</hi> should be <hi>assess'd</hi> and thus <hi>distributed,</hi> such <hi>Funds rais'd</hi> and <hi>thus imploy'd,</hi> is the <hi>dictate</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101427:9"/>
Prudence; and therefore, upon the difference of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, admits alteration. A <hi>Defect</hi> in the former is a sin; a <hi>Failure</hi> in the latter but a less degree of wisdom; and, which may probably be the best management of Alms, is not the Dispute of a <hi>Divine,</hi> but a <hi>Politician.</hi> Some States, especially those who affect Pomp, and magnificence, have heap'd up the national Charity in one <hi>Common Bank,</hi> or <hi>Prytaneum;</hi> and thence have <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi> distributed their <hi>Alms,</hi> or rather <hi>Pensions.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been more pleas'd with a <hi>shorter Circulation</hi> of Charity, and permitted it to be <hi>occasionally Expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> within those Precincts, where it was levied. The former <hi>Oeconomy of Alms-giving</hi> is more <hi>stately</hi> and <hi>Majestic;</hi> and, like the <hi>Inundation of Nile, makes a noise</hi> when it blesses the Land: the Latter, like a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Fountain, supplies <hi>Each</hi> small quantity of ground with a <hi>proportionate</hi> moisture; and carries with it <hi>less pomp,</hi> but <hi>more convenience.</hi> There have been those again, who have been induc'd by the generosity of their temper (I hope) rather than by any sinister mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Pride and Ambition, to erect stately structures for Infirmaries; to change a Palace i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

then <hi>at present</hi> seems one great difference between the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Charity; that the one consists of <hi>more Parts,</hi> but <hi>dispers'd</hi> and <hi>diffus'd;</hi> the other of a <hi>less number,</hi> but those <hi>united into a whole: Their's</hi> is not so <hi>much,</hi> but <hi>looks bigger;</hi> ours is <hi>less Compact,</hi> but of <hi>larger extent,</hi> and if not more <hi>creditable</hi> to the <hi>Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> yet <hi>more Profitable</hi> to the <hi>Receiver.</hi> The Author may be satisfied of the truth of this from a very <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic,</hi> tho' perhaps not a very <hi>acceptable</hi> Book; <note n="a" place="bottom">See 43 Eliz. c. 2. 1 Jac. c. 3. 3 Car. 4.

External Acts</hi> are as <hi>fallible signs</hi> of Piety, as <hi>Verbal expressions;</hi> we <hi>see</hi> no more men's devotion in the one, than we <hi>hear</hi> it in the other; and <hi>both</hi> may <hi>probably flow</hi> from an <hi>holy zeal;</hi> and <hi>both</hi> may <hi>possibly proceed</hi> from a <hi>gross Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we should admit, (which without fear of the consequences we safely may) That the truth of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to be try'd by the <hi>outward Good works</hi> of it's Professors, it was certainly to be hop'd that such <hi>works</hi> should be assign'd, as a <hi>Common Standard,</hi> which were <hi>evidently, and indisputably Good,</hi> or at <hi>least</hi> not <hi>apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

            <p>Many men <hi>then,</hi> that <hi>measure things</hi> by the length of their <hi>shadows,</hi> take the dimensions of their Charity and Devotion from the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of Almsgiving, and the <hi>Pomp</hi> of Piety.

And seriously those are guilty of no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, who pretend to be converted to Popery by the sight of a Religious Cavalcade, and the solemnity of a Procession. The Advantage therefore of this, as of all Superstition, lies only in outward appearance, and ceremony; and they, the <hi>essence</hi> of whose Religion consists in a <hi>shew,</hi> are carefull to keep up <hi>the shadow,</hi> that is, the <hi>Substance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I rather chosen to reflect upon the Work, than expose the Author; though the latter were not only a more easy task, but as justifiable an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: for one that has dealt with us as he has, must not look for that quarter we can give a fair and open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But it will not be advisable for him to make too bold with our good nature; or try the utmost extent of civility: especially one that lyes so open, should take care not to be too provoking. Let it suffice that he has left us, and let us be quite rid of him; but let him not believe himself privileg'd by his desertion to libel our Church and University. If he must be busy, let him add examples to an <hi>old Rhetoric;</hi> or glean
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101427:18"/>
the <hi>Jansenists Logic;</hi> or pick straws out of <hi>Il Maestro di Camera;</hi> or busy himself with <hi>Immanuel Thesauro's bees:</hi> these are imployments sutable to his capacity; and such as he may pursue without interruption. But if he will rise above his Form, tamper with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, pretend to manage an Argument, degrade Kings, and asperse Countryes; he must expect to be made acquainted with himself; and receive due corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for Assuming. It reflects upon the wisdom, which his long experience should have taught him, that when he designs to begg somewhat tow'rds the finishing of <hi>Works already begun and attemted,</hi> he should lard his petition with the slander of his Country; and think to purchase at the expence of our reputation. But I hope the event will convince him of his mistake. For though I would exhort all men, and especially English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the constant exercise of Charity; I would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise advise them, to know into what hands they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit their money; for there may be <hi>Mountains of piety</hi> so unlike those at <hi>Rome,</hi> that instead of Interest gain'd, the Principal may be lost. If I can obtain this just request of the prudent Reader, I shall rest satisfy'd with the success of these Reflexions; as being hereby indifferently well assur'd, that however the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>this Treatise</hi> have been answer'd, the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it will be frustrated.</p>

            <head>A Vindication of Protestant Charity, in Answer to some Passages in <hi>M. M'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> Remarks on a late Conference.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Protestant Churches, Hospitals, and Schools, are so frequent in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and so obvious to every man's eye; we have just reason to imagin, that they, who still pretend to be ignorant of them, do not in one point only decline the use of their senses. For is it otherwise possible that the <hi>Roman Lazaretto</hi>'s should be more visible than the <hi>English Hospitals?</hi> unless by some new rule of opticks, the Object appears larger, when it is at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Whatever respect therefore others may have for this Gentleman, I cannot think him very carefull of his own reputation, who is the Author of so <hi>severe,</hi> and yet so <hi>groundless</hi> a Calumny. Where there is a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable distance either of time or place, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact is secret, or the Witnesses scarce, a slander is more readily believ'd, or at least more hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. But the plain, and bold denial of things done in our own Nation, in our own time, is a Poyson that carries with it it's own Antidote. Wherefore tho' the confutation of such evident, and notorious falshoods be a very easy task; perhaps it may be difficult to excuse the impertinence of confuting them. However because, this <hi>Topick</hi> hath been confidently <note n="a" place="bottom">See Boz. de sign. Eccl. tit. Magnif. and Stapylton. p. 2. 10. to 2. &amp;c. and Tho. Car. Pi.

belief among the inconsiderate, it may seem worth while to undeceive well meaning men, who are not parties to the slander, but misled by an <hi>Implicit Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the other part of Mr. M'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Remarks, it is not my business to consider it; much less shall I concern my self to lessen the repute of the Author. I shall only observe, that, since he confidently affirms so much, and proves so little; they very well understood his Talent, who in these late Contests, imploy'd him not as a Disputant, but an Evidence. Had he kept within that Sphere, we should not have thought our selves concern'd with him; But since, he has been pleas'd to shew his reading in the <hi>Oxford Treatises;</hi> and among his Remarks, to insert this following Observation; we shall only examine the <hi>truth</hi> of it, and then commit him into better Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">See Remarks. p. 21. see also p. 17. 15, 19, 20, 22.</note> I am not ignorant, that <hi>some</hi> Hospitals, Almshouses, and Churches have been built by Protestants: <q>
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">For some proof of what is here said, see a book lately printed at Oxford, called Pietas Romana &amp; Parisiensis; By which in some measure the rest may be guess'd. <hi>Marginal note upon this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Remarks. p.</hi> 21.</note> But there is no more Proportion between <hi>Dr. Tenison's</hi> two Parishes and a couple of the poorest Vicariges in <hi>Wales,</hi> than there is between the Monuments of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Zeal, and whatever of that kind hath been done by Protestants. It will be a great while before the Reformation builds the <hi>fortieth part</hi> of what it hath pull'd down. Nay, (supposing that this poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to return to it's ancient Religion) there is more likelyhood, that Reformations following one another, like Egyptian plagues, the succeeding ones should still devour what the preceding left; than that men, who have taken Sacrilege for the service of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101427:20"/>
God should endeavour to repair any part of what is already destroy'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Remark now, if devested of the Usual Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will amount to these two Propositions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the <hi>Monuments of Catholic Zeal</hi> were pull'd down by <hi>Protestants;</hi> and that consequently <hi>they have taken Sacrilege for the service of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 That the Protestant Alms will not be equivalent to the <hi>fortieth part</hi> of Catholic Charity before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That both these assertions are false, any one knows, that is less ignorant than this Gentleman seems; and therefore it is for his satisfaction chiefly, (for few will be exempted out of the other Predicament) that I'll prove them so.</p>
            <p>First then; were it not the custom of some men to give the title of <hi>Catholic</hi> Princes to <hi>Reformers;</hi> and, when it seems advantageous, to return the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it might justly be wonder'd, upon what account, the <hi>first Defender of the Catholic Faith</hi> bears the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Protestant. He was a Man too much wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his own notions, to espouse <hi>Luther's</hi> Doctrine, which he had pretended to confute; and too little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of injuries, to patronize his cause, who had treated him, rather like a Disputant, than a King. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants were never more expos'd to the fiery tryal than in his time; and had as little reason to think him a Reformer, as the Jews once had to mistake their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Messias.</hi> The Dissolution of Abbies, least it should seem the act of a Protestant, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seconded by the 6 Articles; and even that was no more, than what had been attempted by <hi>Popish Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;</hi> &amp; in some measure <note n="a" place="bottom">See of Ed. 2. alienations of Ch.

The redemption of Captives, the enlargement of Prisoners, the dowry of poor Maids, the erection of Free-schools, the restitution of Tithes, and other more ordinary works of Charity, were not only the constant attendants, but the necessary results of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>But since I have formerly insisted upon these, I shall purposely avoid all repetition; and shall only take leave to answer a common &amp; that a plausible objection. <q>For since there were <note n="c" place="bottom">See 27.

H. 8. c. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Ed. 6. c. 14.</note> few Laws made for the relief of the Poor before the Reformation, &amp; there is no probability that they were not then maintain'd tho without Laws; It hath been hastily concluded, and too easily granted; that whatever small <hi>Stipends</hi> the <hi>Monks</hi> allow'd to the Poor, their <hi>Hospitality</hi> was extraordinary; and that, upon the failure of <hi>that,</hi> the pressures of the Poor first requir'd a Parliamentary remedy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not deny, but some indigent Persons might receive a sensible loss at the overthrow of Abbies; and tho' that might be one, yet I think, what I am going to assign was the chief Cause of that sudden alteration. Anciently, when every inferior person; that could probably be reduc'd to extremity, depended on some <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> either as a Servant, or Villain; every such Lord lay under an indispensable obligation, especially in those days of Hospitality, to support him in his weakness, who had imploy'd his strength in his service. But when <hi>H. 7th's</hi> Law diminish'd this dreadful power of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, by setting up almost an equal ballance in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, the Tenures were alter'd; and dependencies
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101427:23"/>
almost every where ceas'd: so that no man having a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obligation to succour him that had liv'd indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Charge necessarily fell upon the Community. Poverty therefore enter'd in upon the change of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, not of Religion; nor was the result of our Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, but our Civil liberty.</p>
            <p>2. That the Churches of this Island suffer'd much by the Reformation, signifies no more to any one that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands this Author's sincerity, than that they were increas'd by it. For if we speak in reference to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, few men that have either seen or read of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches will deny the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And since amidst our present unhappy Contests, our Charity to the building of that magnificent Edifice doth not cease, I cannot but compare it to the couragious Purchase of that Roman, who bought the Ground in the Suburbs, while <hi>Hannibal</hi> laid siege to the City. Pompous Edifices were always the works of a secure, and flourishing Church: and that the Primitve ages of Christianity ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no more, was not <hi>their</hi> crime, but their Adversaries; not the result of their covetousness, but insecurity.

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Schools of this Nation, on which this Author was so prudent, as not to insist, were then rare, and unendow'd; nor could it be justly expected, <hi>that Religion,</hi> should much promote Learning, which it self was advanc'd by Ignorance. He need not therefore be much skill'd in Antiquity, that would write the history of <hi>English Schools,</hi> few of which will be found to ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the latest rise of the Reformation. And were not this evident from Authentick Histories, the gradual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Learning among us would sufficiently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us of the increase of this Charity. For what did that age produce, that did not savour of the <hi>Cloyster,</hi> and carry with it a relish of <hi>Monkish Barbarity?</hi> The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars</hi> were very rich, and equally ignorant; the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> were like them in all things but their wealth; and the <hi>Laity</hi> had only learning enough to contemn the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. So that if the <hi>Jesuite</hi> Mr. M's friend prove no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Schoolmaster than the <hi>Ancient Regulars</hi> did; the Youth of this Nation will gain by his Instructions, as his own Cause does by his Arguments.</p>
            <p>Since the Protestant Charity therefore is much supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Popish, it can want nothing to appear so, but only <hi>Ostentation,</hi> We are better at giving Alms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which our Savior strictly commands; They at sounding the trumpet, which He as solemnly forbids.

But if they hold no more than such a bare reception (which is often affirm'd in this <hi>Apendix,</hi> but never reconcil'd with the note upon <hi>Reply p.</hi> 14.) then the name of <hi>Zuinglian</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently and falsly put upon the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for <hi>She</hi> holds more as is prov'd at large in the Reply.</p>

                     <hi>justify their departure from the Church &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> It seems then, we <hi>do justify</hi> our departure; should we grant that He can <hi>justify his desertion,</hi> we would own it were <hi>no little</hi> concession. But to come to his Argument, it will then be sense, and not before, when he proves that our Churches practice in reference to that Article argues a change in her Doctrine; which it does not, as we shall see immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. <hi>Not little, which contains the Terms of the Churches Communion, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> This looks the likest sense, and pertinence, of any thing this Paper urges; and shall therefore receive the more full and distinct Answer. And first to prevent all cavil about words, it must be noted, that <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> are of two sorts. 1. <hi>Terms of Catholic Communion: i. e.</hi> such as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our holding Communion with the whole Catholic Church. 2. <hi>Terms of particular Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; i. e.</hi> Such as any particular Church may require her Members to submit to. The former are <hi>Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> of Faith and Worship; appointed by God himself; which no Church has power to add to, alter, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish: the latter, are a kind of <hi>By-Laws;</hi> such as every particular Church has power to make, and does make, for the sake of Order, and the well governing those of her Communion, in things left undetermin'd by Almighty God. These in accurate speaking are <hi>Rules of Government;</hi> but are call'd <hi>Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi> because the Church that makes them, has pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to exclude from her Communion all her Members that obstinately refuse them; as all Government es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially implyes a power to punish the transgression of its just Laws. 'Tis with reference to the former, that we justly accuse the Papists for imposing devices
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101427:29"/>
of their own, some unnecessary, other ungodly Articles,<note place="margin">p. 203.</note> as Terms of Communion in the first sense: and with reference to the latter, that we justify our Churches power of imposing, against the exceptions made by Protestant Dissenters. For 'tis evident that Terms of Communion in the first sense, are of unchangeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; but taken in the second, they are variable, according as the exigence of affairs in a Particular Church shall require, and the wisdom of its Governors direct.</p>
               <p>Now an explicit Declaration and Subscription of the Article of the Real Presence, is <hi>at most but a Term of Communion in the second sense;</hi> because that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle contains not the essentially-necessary Doctrine of the Catholic Church concerning the Eucharist but only a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary drawn from that Doctrine: which though it be true as the Church of England holds it, and the Popish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be very false; yet an <hi>explicit knowledge and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of either of these things, is not necessary to Salvation: nor is any Church bound to extend the Terms of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion so far as the <hi>explicit</hi> owning <hi>every</hi> truth; or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi> rejecting <hi>every</hi> thing that is false. From whence it follows 1. That our Church might lawfully require or wave an explicit Declaration and Subscription of this Article: require it, because true; wave it, because not essentially necessary. 2. That her doing either one, or t'other, or both alternately, argues no change or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in her <hi>Doctrine;</hi> for to take or not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Corollary, does not change the Proposition it depends upon.</p>
               <p>But to justify yet farther the Proceedings of our Church in this matter, the Replyer told him (p. 4.) <hi>that she had not allways thought it requisite to make the Declaration and Subscription of this Article a Term</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101427:30"/>
                  <hi>of her Communion;</hi> as indeed she had not; but rather<note place="margin">p. 203.</note> us'd it like a Civil Test, to discern who were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd to bear Office in the Church; And to make and impose such Tests as may inable the Government to confide in them they imploy, is a piece of wisdome which all Governments practice; and which no man can accuse if the matter of the Test be not evil. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our Church did not do this out of pure choice, but absolute necessity. For finding all indeavors us'd to ruine her, by two seeming contrary Partyes; which alternately prevail'd as the Court-Interest vary'd; she saw it necessary to cut these Diamonds with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so far countenance the weaker, as might help to ballance the prevailing party: not despairing, but in time, by God's blessing upon good indeavors, the honest-minded men on both sides might be brought to see their Error, and return to the Unity of the Church. Now the Article of the Real Presence was at that time a very proper Test, to discover who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to either Party: for men had not yet learn'd to hold Communion with Us, and receive our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against their Conscience; nor to declare their Assent and Consent to our Establishment, and make the most solemn protestations that they are of <hi>Us,</hi> while their heart is at <hi>Rome:</hi> though we have since learn'd that all this may be done; and I wonder the Examiner knowing by whome, never urg'd it for a Spirits being in two places at once; since it seems to be a better instance than any he has given in his Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>4. 5. His two last Reasons are in effect already answer'd. For [4.] Whatever it is lawful to impose, it is lawful to secure the observance of by what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties the Government thinks fit. And [5.] If the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101427:30"/>
Church did vary from any old Form, it was because<note place="margin">p 203.</note> that Form had been abus'd to conntenance Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph He's griev'd, that we think<note place="margin">p. 204.</note> that <hi>design impertinent,</hi> which he says <q>
                     <hi>was the very primary intention of the Author as is plain enough.</hi>
                  </q> It might be <hi>impertinent</hi> for all that: and it was so <hi>plain and primary</hi> that the Author never spoke to it; so that to know it we must know his heart; <note n="*" place="bottom">See below p. 57.</note> which the Publisher of all men living ought not to expect of us. He adds, that <q>
                     <hi>the Author proves</hi> irrefragably, <hi>that our Church has waver'd in her Doctrine:</hi>
                  </q> I suppose he means <hi>unanswerably;</hi> for nothing being urg'd he might well conclude nothing could be answer'd. After this, he repeats his old <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> of what befell the Real Presence; the Doctrine whereof was according to him thrown out, and in his cleanly phrase <q>
                     <hi>lick'd up again:</hi>
                  </q> thus desparing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our understandings he tryes to work upon our Stomachs. But we have already said enough to the charge of <hi>wavering;</hi> and Tautology which is nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it self, becomes more so by his example. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finish'd his Narrative, he adds a politic, tho' not so pertinent a Reflexion about <hi>persecuting Dissenters;</hi> who if they would be eas'd, must fee him to hold his tongue; for if such a manager undertake it, their cause is irrecoverably lost.</p>
               <p>His next Remark is, that<q> 
                     <hi>Either the Replyer knows</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 205.</note> 
                     <hi>that all Catholicks declare they detest the adoration of any creature, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> The Replyer never judges of <hi>the Examiners Catholicks</hi> by what they <hi>declare.</hi> But if all true Papists detest the adoration of a creature, that Gentleman is none, who proffer'd for a halfpenny
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101427:31"/>
to <hi>declare</hi> that he terminated his worship upon the<note place="margin">p. 205.</note> very Image it self.</p>
               <p>I reserve the next Paragraph till I come to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it <hi>pag.</hi> 209. and must now admire the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners constancy, who having been so often taken in the very act of misquoting, follows the trade still with so great assurance as to falsify my own Reply, to my face. <q>If there be <hi>(says he)</hi> no real participation, as this Replyer afterwards every where confesseth &amp;c.</q> I wish for the Readers ease he had nam'd somewhere; but to supply that defect I will name him a place or two.—<q>The Body which now exists, whereof <hi>we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>—is therefore <hi>verily and indeed receiv'd,</hi> and by consequence said to be really present; because <hi>a real participation</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 18.—<q>the Church of England, which does not hold a bare reception of the benefits but <hi>a real participation</hi> of the Body &amp;c.</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 31. Which passages (to name no more) confess <hi>no real participation</hi> just as he confest Popery, when he writ and sign'd a paper (yet in being) that deny'd it. If the Reader desire a farther taste of his sincerity, <hi>the note upon p.</hi> 13. will furnish him sufficiently. We are<note place="margin">p. 213.</note> there rank'd among them that <q>
                     <hi>pierced, or deny, or disbelieve our Savior's words,</hi>
                  </q> though the charge be as false as the English. We are there charg'd with <q>

                  </q> though in the place by him quoted we say expressly, <q>that since the <hi>Body broken</hi> and the <hi>Blood shed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </q> as if the Replyer had deny'd this, or had not said that<q> the Glorify'd Body now sits at the right hand of God, and shall there continue till the restitution of all things <hi>pag.</hi> 13. and the Body that <hi>is</hi> glorify'd, is nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically the same that <hi>was</hi> broken <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</q> Nay he spares not his own dear self, but in kindness to the Replyer for whome <note n="*" place="margin">App. p. 193.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>he is ready to sacrifice his life and all that he hath,</hi>
                  </q>he says that he and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics  <q>
                     <hi>content themselves to believe and know that our Lord in this Sacrament is become to us a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit;</hi>
                  </q> tho' they know they shall scarce content the Pope and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> unless they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and say a great deal more. These and many more such passages that occurr in this Appendix will probably amaze the Reader, if he know not the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner's avow'd principle, which he says is to lye, and to forswear himself deliberately for a good purpose.</p>
               <p>We have seen in this last Paragraph how he proves<note place="margin">p. 205.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>by the Replyer's own confession that there is no Real Presence.</hi> But <hi>this being the main point of difference upon which this Replyer insists,</hi> the Examiner resolves <hi>to search a little deeper:</hi>
                  </q> that is, to repeat the old Tale, with as little truth and judgment as he told it us before. Though to do him right, he has added some Sentences which afford a large field of fresh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For a sample, wee'l run over one of 'em. <q>
                     <hi>Now</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 206.</note> 
                     <hi>it cannot be imagined that the Liturgy-makers should translate the words of the Mass</hi>—</q> Why <hi>the words of the Mass?</hi> if the Form was older than the Mass? as it must be if it were of that Antiquity he allows it: or Why <hi>translate?</hi> when he just before owns the <q>addition of divers words,</q> which is contrary to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101427:32"/>
rule of translating, unless the words added explain and<note place="margin">p. 206.</note> illustrate the Original. He says indeed these words <q>
                     <hi>more effectually conclude the Popish notion;</hi>
                  </q> but it is by asserting the quite contrary. For the form is <hi>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee &amp;c.</hi> i. e. the <hi>Body</hi> which was offer'd for thee upon the Cross, <hi>the Sacrament whereof</hi> the Priest holds in his hands. But to return to his charge against the <hi>Liturgy-makers;</hi> 'tis that <q>
                     <hi>they should intend to give the English words a quite different signification from the Latine, without giving any notice of it to the People.</hi>
                  </q> Should we for argument's sake suppose, we cannot with truth grant, that the true signification of the Latine is as he pretends; because that form was in use before <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was thought of; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Reformers did not introduce a new meaning of the form, but restor'd the old. But of this too <q>
                     <hi>they should have given notice.</hi>

Nor shall I accuse, but applaud him for his false English; for a man that can write no Sense, is safest when he writes no Language.

                  </q> And again p. 16. <q>
                     <hi>That a thing may be said to be</hi> really receiv'd, <hi>which is so consign'd to us, that wee can readily imploy it to all those purposes for which it is usefull in it self, and wee have occasion to use it.</hi>
                  </q> For if these things be true, as till they are confuted I must think they are, the Reader will easily perceive, that the instances retain their force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing your different exposition; and that it will not serve your purpose to pretend they <hi>may</hi> bear another interpretation, unless you prove that they <hi>cannot</hi> bear mine.</p>

                  </gap>. So exactly does the truly ancient agree with our present form: and so little truth is there in what the Examiner would insinuate, that the other (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by <hi>Proclus</hi>) was the ancienter form; as if (to use a Convert's expression,) he were <hi>fated</hi> to be allways in the wrong.</p>
               <p>The Replyer doubted (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) that <hi>some of the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser's quotations were not very judiciously chosen,</hi> tho' the thing for which they were quoted, at the same time he granted to be true. The place in <hi>Eusebius</hi> he expresly shew'd to be impertinent; which made him <hi>suspect the other two, which he had neither leisure nor the books by him to examine.</hi> Now the Appendix saying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the Author plainly gives him up: and he says <q>it is not worth while to Vindicate the others,</q> and for once is not mistaken. <q>
                     <hi>Notwithstanding he will add what he finds in S. Ambrose's works, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>de Sacramentis.</hi>
                  </q> I will not now return that this book is so notoriously spurious that the Examiner himself durst not ascribe it to <hi>S. Ambrose;</hi> nor will I except to the matter quoted, which is true, and agreeable to the doctrine of the Church of England, if we take it in the Author's, not the Quoter's sense: for our present inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry must be, not whether it be true, but pertinent; which it cannot be, if the form to which we answer <hi>Amen</hi> be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101427:37"/>
a prayer: and the form is <hi>The body of our Lord Jesus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 211.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ which was given for thee, preserve the Body and Soul to everlasting life.</hi> Now admitting the form im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes this assertion, <hi>what thou now receivest is the body of our Lord,</hi> which he that answers <hi>Amen,</hi> confesses to be true: yet still the whole form is a prayer, and he that says <hi>Amen</hi> to it, answers <hi>Amen</hi> to a prayer; unless the Examiner believe that the implying something asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, makes a petition cease to be a prayer; which would be so ridiculous a notion as never dwelt in the same head with common sense.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>the omission of these words</hi> [<hi>in these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mysteries</hi>] the Replyer who pretended only to <hi>guess</hi> the true reason, said <hi>it might be purely accidental.</hi> 
                  <q>And it might not be so <hi>says the Examiner:</hi> For they have a signification contrary &amp;c.</q> If they have so, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply there told him, <q>
                     <hi>that was cause enough to omit them,</hi> because they would assert an Opinion contrary to sound doctrine, and the declar'd judgment of the Church:</q> to which I find nothing return'd.</p>
               <p>The Replyer observ'd (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) that <hi>no fault was found with the second form, which is intirely agreeable to the words and end of the Institution.</hi> Wherefore now it is decreed that some fault shall be found with it. And first it is <q>
                     <hi>Faulty enough certainly because contrary to the former book; which to prove was the Author's chief intention;</hi>
                  </q> wherefore he never urg'd one word in proof of it. But we want from the Examiner a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason than the variety of expression, to prove a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in the matter; least among other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this Appendix which is all Tautology, prove only a heap of contrarieties. Of his second exception I have given my opinion already; and shall neither repeat that, nor consider the two next Paragraphs wherein there is as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101427:37"/>
much truth and pertinence as there is good manners.<note place="margin">p. 211.</note> The Examen gives me no occasion to add to what I sayd in my Reply. I say and prove; the Examiner denyes and calls names; and who takes the better method must be left to the Reader to determine.</p>
               <p>He proceeds and tells us that <q>
                     <hi>Calvin and Beza are</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 212.</note> 
                     <hi>mention'd, because by them were the English Reformers much directed, though our Author does not tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to speak only of the Church of England men.</hi>
                  </q> No; if he did he would speak to some purpose, which to do is no part of his Character. Whither our Reformers were so <hi>much</hi> directed by Calvin and Beza may be question'd: the Replyer <hi>fish'd</hi> a shrewd reason, <hi>out of that dirty pool Foxes and Firebrands</hi> why they were less directed, than otherwise they might have been. But if they were so much directed, 'tis the more probable, their direction was not approv'd where it was not follow'd. And if this be true 'tis still the more <hi>trifling and impertinent</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their judgment to the Church of England, which is all that the Reply contended for. That which follows about Conciliators in general, I dare trust to do it's own business; and come to Mr. Thorndike, for whose memory I have a great and just esteem, though I think him no proper man to determine the point in question, for the reasons mention'd, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 61. <hi>of the Reply.</hi> What I say of him, is partly from his writings, and partly of my own certain knowledg, as, if it be requisite, I can prove: but the Examiner only pretends that <q>
                     <hi>he was rightly quoted</hi>
                  </q> by the Discourser; which I think I acknowledg'd plain enough in the Reply; and I now acknowledg it again, not without some satisfaction, that the Examiner dares not say so much of any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor quoted by him. For what relates to Dr. Taylor in the next Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:101427:38"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The quotations out of Dr. Taylor are most true,</hi>
                  </q> is<note place="margin">p. 212</note> undoubtedly a fault of the Compositor, and would have been among the <hi>Errata,</hi> if the Printer as well as the Writer had delcar'd against Prevarication. The Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser was charg'd with misquoting Dr. <hi>Taylor;</hi> because he quoted him by halves, and as Patron of an opinion he expressly declares and writes against. If this be true, the quotations out of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> are <hi>most false:</hi> If the Examiner did not think it true, what need of bringing off the Discourser by a Calumny upon Dr. <hi>Taylor?</hi> But since it is lawful to calumniate for a good end, we are told that <q>
                     <hi>Dr. Taylor was an inconstant, forgetful, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man, and one that vented many indigested and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent notions.</hi>
                  </q> Well but how is this prov'd? No, it is not to be Prov'd, but <q>
                     <hi>it seems so.</hi>
                  </q> But perhaps we are once more mistaken in our Author's <hi>Design:</hi> we thought him to be quoting, and he good man, was only weeding, and <hi>picking out the tares from the wheat:</hi> and he was in the right of it; for if what he calls tares be suffer'd to grow among the wheat, it will go near to spoyl <hi>his</hi> harvest.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>He does not remember Dr. Taylor any where su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 213.</note> 
                     <hi>(as this Replyer doth) that Protestants may use the same terms as the Catholics, and yet in a quite different sense.</hi>
                  </q> Great judgments have sometimes bad memories; the more the pity that the trade the Examiner drives, requires a very good one. But to help his memory, I referr him to Dr. <hi>Taylor's</hi> book of the Real Presence; the first section; from the eighth Paragraph to the end: where he will find that Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> considers one by one the Terms that the Papists use; and shews that Protestants use the same but in another sense which he defends; from whence we gather, that <hi>he sustain'd they might do this;</hi> and very good reason they had for it, since the Fathers did so before them. For the truth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101427:38"/>
is (as abundance of Protestant books, that neither are<note place="margin">p. 213.</note> nor can be answer'd, have demonstrated) that the Popish Faction in the Latin Church, having perverted the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Antiquity, and given it a novel and absurd meaning, the Reformers as in other cases so in this too restor'd the primitive usage, and taught the people what the Fathers meant as well as what they said. Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this the Examiner would have had them <q>
                     <hi>tell the world that their words were like Jacob's, but their intention</hi>
                  </q> (which is vulgar Latin for their hands) <hi>like Esau,</hi> for then they had come over to his Party, which now looks melancholy for want of company <q>
                     <hi>and plainly confess their haeresy;</hi>
                  </q> for else they are never like to be convicted.</p>
               <p>In the entrance of the next Paragraph, he gives us an ill name; in the close he comforts himself with the hope of our damnation; which is the best argument I find in him, of his being a true Papist. I wonder what has discompos'd him; but sure his passion has a little hurt his understanding, he gives so perverse an account of the Doctrine asserted in the Reply. To prevent the errors into which he may betray the common Reader, I shall once more give him this short and plain account of what I said there. The words of institution require us to eat the <hi>Body broken,</hi> and drink the <hi>Blood shed;</hi> which we cannot do <hi>literally,</hi> because the body broken and the blood shed neither do nor can now <hi>really exist.</hi> But the worthy receivers of the Sacrament, do <hi>figuratively</hi> eat that body, and drink that blood, when they <hi>really</hi> eat and drink the <hi>Symbols</hi> of them. And the good effect, which God has annext to this by his gracious institution, and accomplishes by his marvelous power, is a <hi>real Union</hi> with the <hi>living,</hi> glorify'd body, whereby the Communicants are made <hi>partakers</hi> of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101427:39"/>
Spirit of Christ their Head; and receive the benefits<note place="margin">p. 213.</note> 
                  <hi>purchas'd</hi> by the Sacrifice of the dead body, by being united by that Spirit to the living body. Which living glorify'd body is therefore <hi>verily and indeed receiv'd;</hi> and by consequence may be said to be <hi>really present</hi> in the Eucharist. This I thought had been declar'd and prov'd plain enough in the Reply. The Examiner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it by saying <q>
                     <hi>he does not understand it.</hi>
                  </q> But if all must be rejected that is lyable to that exception, there will be as little sense in the world, as there would be honesty if his other Principles prevail'd. For a farther explication (if it be requisite) I referr him to the famous Sermon Preach'd by Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi> before the house of Commons <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1620. And to a late admirable Treatise call'd <hi>a Summary of the Controversyes between the Church of England, and the Church of Rome. Sect.</hi> IV. <hi>and</hi> V. which when he has perus'd, if he <hi>does not</hi> yet <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi> I can only tell him in his own words <q>
                     <hi>that the fault is in the organ, not the object.</hi>
                  </q> For to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his notion, is not more impossible to a man of sense, than not to understand our Doctrine after so much plain Demonstration.</p>
               <p>If the Lutherans are the only men that are <q>
                     <hi>truly call'd Protestants,</hi>
                  </q> then the Papists call the rest of their Adversaries out of their names. But this reflexion is something worse than that upon the <hi>Trisagium;</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant comes <hi>a protestando,</hi> and that is not Greek.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The Zuinglians assert no real presence of our Lord's body at all, but of the benefit only of his passion:</hi>
                  </q> but they believe all that is requisite to assert it; all the grounds that the assertors pretend for it: and it seemes the Examiner <hi>knows</hi> this, and <hi>gives notice</hi> of it to the Replyer, as if <hi>he</hi> had not said it himself in the Paragraph under consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:101427:39"/>The note upon <hi>pag.</hi> 16. is so choice a heap of Confusion,<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> that it seemes to be the Author's Masterpiece. If it be not too presumtuous to guess at his Design (which it may be, like that of the Discourses, would be <hi>incognito</hi>) I should think he had a mind to confute the latter part of the sixteenth page of the Reply. His method confirms my suspicion; for he neither gives my words, nor my meaning, nor confutes what he substitutes in their room. For example. <q>
                     <hi>A thing may be really present two ways,</hi>
                  </q> is the point the Examiner incounters. <q>
                     <hi>A thing thus really receiv'd may be said to be really present two ways,</hi>
                  </q> are the words of the Reply. The objection is <q>
                     <hi>there are many other ways of presence.</hi>
                  </q> But are there not those that I assign? which are sufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of explaining how the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and the <hi>res Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> are, the one Physically, the other Morally but both really present? To this he answers with his leg. <hi>A Physical presence is a local presence</hi> says the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <q>
                     <hi>A Physical presence (now we speak of a natural body) is local,</hi>
                  </q> says the Replyer. And is this true? If it be, (as I find it not deny'd) I am safe though it should be true, that <hi>the presence of a Spiritual body is not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> which answer and the other that is tack'd to it, are yet more absurd upon another score; because they assert the point that I contend for, viz. that our Savior's body is not locally present.</p>
               <p>But to wave the impertinence, and examin the truth of this Argument. That there is both a <hi>natural</hi> and a <hi>spiritual</hi> body; and that each of 'em has properties <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> from the other; we are very well satisfy'd; because this is very intelligible in it self, and plainly reveal'd in Scripture. But still both the one and the other is a body; and therefore must have all the Essential properties of a body. <hi>A body devested of these, yet a body still (i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:101427:40"/>
the Examiners <hi>spiritual body</hi>) is no real being, but an<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> absurd inconceivable notion; and no more a body than one of <hi>his</hi> many passages that have neither Grammer nor meaning in 'em is a Proposition. Now one of those Essential properties without which a body cannot really exist, is <hi>to have dimensions;</hi> for matter and quantity are not really distinct. Another is <hi>to be finite;</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body is a creature. A third is to be <hi>Unum numero;</hi> for whatever really exists is so. And it is utterly inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable how these three essential properties can be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a body, unless that body be suppos'd to exist in some one determinate finite space: which space the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers (speaking of a body) call a <hi>circumscriptive Ubi,</hi> or in one word, <hi>place;</hi> so that locality or being in a place, cannot possibly be remov'd from a body, without removing those properties, without which a body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exist. We may indeed allow a <hi>precisive,</hi> but not a <hi>negative abstraction</hi> of them; for a body may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, but cannot exist by halves: we may choose whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will consider more than one or two properties; but the body really existing cannot choose but have them all: wherefore though we may consider it, <hi>not as having them;</hi> we cannot consider it <hi>as not having them.</hi> But cannot God by his Omnipotence, remove all these properties of a body? Yes undoubtedly; but then it ceases to be a body. God can create, annihilate, and change at his pleasure: he can make that which is a body cease to be so; but he cannot continue it a body, when he has remov'd that which makes it be a body, unless he can verify a contradiction. Now the question depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is concerning <hi>a body really existing, and continuing still a body;</hi> which the Examiner would (as he calls it) <hi>spiritualize;</hi> that is, abstract it into nothing. For if a body occupy no place, it has no dimensions; if no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101427:40"/>
no quantity; if no quantity, no matter; if no<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> matter, it is no body. If it be not <hi>unum numero</hi> it does not really exist. Abstract all these, and what remains is the Examiner's notion of <hi>a body really existing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as no man of sense can ever frame a notion of such a body, so no Philosopher ever thought of a name for the <hi>Ubi</hi> that belongs to it. We read of a <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive Ubi,</hi> that belongs to a body; a <hi>definitive Ubi</hi> to a spirit; the <hi>repletive Ubi</hi> of Almighty God. But the <hi>Ubi</hi> that belongs to the Examiner's spiritual body wants a name: and if I were to give it one, I would borrow a phrase from the Discourser, and call it an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocatacritical Ubi,</hi> which being explain'd proves a <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi;</hi> wherein nothing exists but the Examiner's Body of Divinity.</p>
               <p>Now for the second evasion, of <q>
                     <hi>a miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, effected by the power of Almighty God.</hi>
                  </q> The Protestants (we have often told him) dispute not the <hi>power</hi> but the <hi>will</hi> of God in this particular. Our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument proceeds not upon what God <hi>can</hi> do, but upon what he <hi>will,</hi> and what <hi>he has reveal'd.</hi> Wherefore it is nothing to the purpose though it were prov'd, that God can do what the Examiner contends for, unless it appear he will do it, which we doubt is impossible to be prov'd. So that it were better to let alone the subject of God's omnipotence, upon which they often talk Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy, and never advantage their cause. Of God's not verifying contradictions, we shall have farther occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak by and by. In the mean time if to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and nothing be a contradiction; it implyes one that the Examiner's spiritual body should exist.</p>
               <p>To proceed. <q>
                     <hi>A Moral presence is call'd Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
                  </q> says the Examiner:— <q>
                     <hi>either Physically or Morally, to which we reduce Sacramentally,</hi>
                  </q> are the words of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101427:41"/>
Reply. Now for his objections. <q>
                     <hi>This</hi> (viz. what he<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> quotes) <hi>is a novel interpretation.</hi>
                  </q> First how does this appear? secondly if it did, what's that to the Reply? <q>
                     <hi>The Church used Sacramental for real, as opposed to receiving by Faith.</hi>
                  </q> If he mean the primitive Church this is false too; but how does he pretend to prove it? <q>
                     <hi>it is said before:</hi>
                  </q> but by whome or where it is not said: <q>
                     <hi>But what is it to be morally present, if not that a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral entity (as grace holiness &amp;c.) are present? The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of our Lord's passion are present to, and injoy'd by us; but what is this to the real true presence of his Body?</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q>The benefits of our Savior's passion are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on us, by virtue of our real union with his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd body which is therefore verily and indeed receiv'd, and by consequence said to be really present, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it's local absence; because a real participation and union, must needs imply a real presence, though they do not necessarily require a local one.</q> 
                  <hi>Reply. p</hi> 14. <q>
                     <hi>But neither are these benefits given us in this Sacrament, but are only apprehended of us by Faith.</hi>
                  </q> I cannot distinguish whether he advance this as his own doctrine in opposition to ours; or as ours in opposition to our selves; though 'tis so inconsistent with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all Churches, that 'tis fit for him to affirm. One would think he should not deny that the Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr grace; or that grace is one of the benefits purchas'd by our Savior's passion; or say that grace is not conferr'd at all, unless it be conferr'd all at once: yet some of these things must be done to make this objection sense. <q>
                     <hi>In summe this Replyer seems to flutter,</hi>

                  </q> And 'tis little better to examine<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> the reasoning of one that can no more make a Syllogism than he can a Convert.</p>
               <p>However I will not leave this Paragraph yet; 'tis so very honest, pertinent and judicious. <q>
                     <hi>There is a real presence of a body which is always local.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>This is false,</hi> but that which the Reply maintains, That the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal real presence of a natural body is always local, is true, and not deny'd. <q>
                     <hi>There is also a spiritual and virtual presence:</hi>
                  </q> Who doubts it? <q>
                     <hi>Distinct from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Moral?</hi>
                  </q> Who ever sayd it? <q>
                     <hi>Spiritual we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as before; but this is real and not virtual only.</hi>
                  </q> And when <hi>we</hi> say a spiritual and virtual, we neither say virtual <hi>only,</hi> nor exclude real. <q>
                     <hi>And what is virtual if not the effects of our Lord's passion? what are all these to the real presence of our Lord's body,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>the only question?</hi> the effects of his passion are communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such a manner as inferrs a real presence of his body. This is prov'd at large in the Reply, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; seqq.</hi> where this Real presence is call'd <hi>virtual,</hi> not in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>real</hi> (as this fond man seemes to fancy) for 'tis mention'd as <hi>one sort</hi> of real presence; but to distinguish it from Local which is another sort; and the reason of calling this <hi>virtual,</hi> is because it is effected by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the bodie's <hi>virtue,</hi> as the other is call'd <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> because effected by the bodie's being <hi>in loco:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Savior's very body is really in Heaven as <hi>in loco;</hi> yet really united to us, and receiv'd by us, and so imparts it's virtue upon earth; it is said to be <hi>Physical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Locally present</hi> in Heaven only, yet <hi>morally and virtually present</hi> upon earth; and <hi>really present</hi> both in heaven and on earth. Which being observ'd, we may dismiss the two next Paragraphs that pretend to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101427:42"/>
take the Replyer in a contradiction; for all that is<note place="margin">p. 215.</note> farther said in them has been consider'd already.</p>
               <p>Only there remains this passage <q>
                     <hi>The Papists allways acknowledge a local presence; The contrary whereof is true,</hi>
                  </q> And so it may be for any thing said by the Replyer. His words are <q>
                     <hi>They, however they express themselves, understand a Local Presence;</hi>
                  </q> which they may do, and not <hi>acknowledg the Term.</hi> He does not say they own the word; for he knew it was deny'd in the Catechism <hi>ad Parochos</hi> and he never allows himself to lye for a good purpose; but he says that <hi>however they express themselves they understand</hi> the thing; and so they must do if they see to the bottom of their own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; because they assert such a presence as cannot be <hi>corporal</hi> unless it be <hi>local</hi> too. Not that I <hi>take corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and locally for the same;</hi> or can think him that <note n="*" place="bottom">App. p. 195.</note> says I do, so shallow as to believe himself; but <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> in their sence unavoydably inferrs <hi>locally.</hi> This <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Letter to P. Martyr in his Scripta Anglicana p. 547.</note> 
                  <hi>Bucer</hi> was aware of; and by his example I chose to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign this as the difference between us and the Papists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is both a necessary consequent of their Doctrine, and a most manifest conviction of their error. For <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, essentially, substantially, corporally,</hi> may all be us'd in a sound sence, but <hi>locally</hi> can not: yet a <hi>Popish Corporal presence</hi> must be <hi>local;</hi> though a local presence be so manifest an absurdity, that even they disclaim it, who are not asham'd to renounce both sence and reason, in other points relating to the Eucharist.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>note upon pag</hi> 20. he has found out a pleasant excuse for the Discourser's stumbling.

                  </q> But if no Papist believe that God can effect any thing which implyes, and not only seems a Contradiction; and if no points of their Doctrine really are, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem contradictory; how comes it to pass that when we charge them with holding things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, they instead of denying the charge, accuse us of limiting God's power? why do they bestow all their pains in setting forth God's omnipotence, which would better be bestow'd in taking of the seemingness of the Contradiction? The Examiner (to do him right) makes an offer or two<note n="a" place="bottom">App. p. 195.</note> in his Harangue; let us see with what success.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>To be here and not here</hi> (he says) <hi>may be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, but to be here and there is none.</hi>
                  </q> But to be here and there is to to be here and not here—. We must know that he has Printed a book of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and that a <note n="b" place="bottom">Comp. Disc. p. 18.</note>

                     <hi>Contradiction</hi> in terminis <hi>is a thing not unusual with Orators to make the acuter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
                  </q> But if this will not pass; what say we to the <hi>Miracle of the five Loaves?</hi> This I take to be an Argument <hi>ad hominem;</hi> and am sorry I was not more particular when I mention'd it to one of the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Correspondents, and said I wonder'd that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists did not urge it in the dispute about the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. But I meant it as a plausible Argument against the testimony of sense; and now it is judiciously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd as an instance of a seeming contradiction. It may be the Examiner sees where the Contradiction lyes; but to grieve us keeps the secret to himself;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101427:43"/>
For if we solve it, we must first find it; which without<note place="margin">p. 195.</note> his assistance we cannot doe, and so he's safe enough. In another <hi>Discourse,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Concerning Celibacy. p. 11.</note> he publish'd an acute project for <q>threading of Camels;</q> He is now upon the same design, and says the thing is <q>
                     <hi>possible with God.</hi>
                  </q> I am loth to think that any thing that wears a gown, is either so weak or so ill read, as not to know that our Saviour's words are a proverbial expression of an extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, not an absolute impossibility. But does not the Text add that <q>
                     <hi>the things which are impossible with men are possible with God?</hi>
                  </q> Yes it does; but it speaks of <hi>things,</hi> not of <hi>contradictions:</hi> God is able to doe any thing; but whatever he does is something; and what a contradiction pretends to mean is just nothing. And least the Examiner should cavil because S. Luke says in another place <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>no</hi> word <hi>shall be impossible with God;</hi> we must tell him, that passage is quoted from the Septuagint version of <hi>Gen.</hi> XVIII. 13. and that as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>to do a thing,</hi> as any man will quickly find that looks but in <hi>Kircher's Concordance.</hi> To conclude, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us, and all Christians are agreed, that God can do many things which man can neither do nor conceive; but it never teaches us he can do a thing which is nothing; that is, verify a contradiction; I may say, a seeming contradiction, if we mean that which seems one to a thinking man; for nothing in Scripture can seem one to a man that considers. And the summe of what we hold in this particular is briefly this. That which seems a contradiction, while it seems so, is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; because all men are agree'd that if it really be one, 'tis impossible: and he that will convince us that a seeming contradiction is possible, must prove that it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101427:44"/>
only seems one, but really is none at all; which is<note place="margin">p. 195.</note> more than any man does or can do for the seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in the Popish Doctrine of the Eucharist.</p>
               <p>His last refuge is from three places in S. <hi>John</hi> to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that <q>
                     <hi>our Savior when upon Earth, was also in Heaven;</hi> i. e. <hi>his natural body was in Heaven and Earth at the same time.</hi>
                  </q> There's another place in S. <hi>John, viz.</hi> VIII. 58. of which he will do well to learn the meaning, and then perhaps in time, he may come to understand these. And that's all that I think requisite to say at present. For as for himself, his very quoting these places by an old rule (taken notice of <hi>Reply p.</hi> 8.) is to me an argument he mistrusts them: and for other men I'm pretty well assur'd, that none who are able to tell twenty, can read the texts and allow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>To return to the Examen. The Close of the Paragraph<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> last consider'd looks as if it were a waggish artifice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the common Reader into a distrust of his senses, the better to prepare him for digesting Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the words are <q>
                     <hi>They</hi> (the Papists) <hi>believe it</hi> (their Doctrine of the Eucharist <hi>to be plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd by our Savior's own words and S. Paul's (v. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Discourse. p.</hi> 18)</q> yet neither in the <hi>18th,</hi> nor any other page of that Discourse, is there one argument from our Savior's or S. <hi>Paul's</hi> words to prove a Popish Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Presence: at least I found none; tho' (to borrow an elegance from the Author) <note n="*" place="bottom">Comp.

                  <hi>I made a Cursory over it.</hi> Men may fancy he referrs like other writers, and had now promis'd to be awake, and speak to purpose: but he that thinks him capable of fair dealing, Wou'd to God he wou'd but try him.</p>
               <p>The Author may pardon me this resentment, since he has his revenge before hand; for it cost me the reading
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101427:44"/>
his Discourse to find my error, and be fully satisfy'd the<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> Press was not in fault, but the Writer; who <hi>design'd</hi> his Reference to belong, neither to the Clause it was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to, nor yet to the whole Paragraph, but only to the former part of it concerning seeming Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Of these indeed he speaks in that eighteenth page; and determines very learnedly p. 19. that <q>
                     <hi>God cannot verifie a formal contradiction; but no man can tell what does formally Contradict without an express revelation.</hi>
                  </q> This proves a mighty comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a late Writer; whome I allways took to be a great master of Reason, but not till now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd; I mean the Author of <hi>the absolute impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Transubstantiation demonstrated.</hi> When I hear how the Examiner evades the <hi>formal contradictions</hi> that Book exposes, he shall know more of my mind; till then I leave his <hi>Compendious Discourse</hi> in those better hands that have already undertaken it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> had said, that <q>
                     <hi>The Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity does as much violence to Philosophy, as Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation:</hi>
                  </q> which words being capable of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent meaning, the Reply explains it, and assents to 'em so explain'd. The Examiner objects that <q>
                     <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation is a Contradiction,</hi>
                  </q> and wisely leaves it with the Reader; who he hopes will be heedless enough to inferr, that <hi>therefore the Doctrine of the Trinity is a Contradiction too.</hi> This, your thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac'd Papists do not scruple to affirm in print; but our Author is a Neophyte, and modest; or perhaps he was aware, the Consequence will not hold. For if one does <hi>as much</hi> violence as the other, it by no meanes follows that both of 'em do <hi>the same;</hi> no more than he that kills a man with a Sword, does the same violence to his life, or does it in the same
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101427:45"/>
way, though he does as much as he that beats out<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> his brains. Every Fresh-man knows the meaning of <hi>as much</hi> in this kind of speech; and if You tell him that <hi>a Straw is as much a substance as Goliah,</hi> has more witt than to return, <hi>But Goliah was a giant of six Cubits and a span high.</hi> Nor will any of 'em be persuaded Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> meant more than this, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity is <hi>as truly</hi> too hard for Philosophy to explain, as that of Transubstantiation; because (as the Reply said p. 22.) <q>
                     <hi>natural reason cannot frame an adaequate notion of either:</hi>
                  </q> so they both offer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and in this respect equal violence; tho' they do it upon different accounts, and in divers ways; which makes a vast alteration in the case, when we come to talk of credibility. For example; Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation involves millions of millions of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and is therefore both inconceivable, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; for no man can conceive, or assent to, a thing that has no meaning at all. Again, there are some Mathematical notions, which no man can fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; which are therefore inconceivable, tho' not only credible, but demonstrable. Once again, there are some Divine supernatural truths which transcend a finite capacity; and are therefore inconceivable, yet not therefore incredible, but rather the contrary: for nothing is more rational than to think that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite nature of God must needs surpass man's finite Understanding; and the narrowness of human capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city can by no meanes be the standard of Divine truth. But of this passage of Dr. <hi>Taylor's</hi> enough is said in the Reply, without any answer yet return'd: I referr my Reader to it, (p. 21.) and proceed.</p>
               <p>'Tis a strange antipathy our Examiner has to Greek, and Latin; if he meet but a line of either it puts

               <p>The Bishops saying wou'd have been a very famous one indeed, had he said what the Examiner reports; but he never us'd to word things so unskilfully: so that tho' the proposition be not <hi>false,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>falsly father'd</hi> upon Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> as our Author very honestly confesses. I dare say he neither did, nor ownes this thing with design; but his fit is strong upon him; else he would not have betray'd so important a secret, as that <hi>he and his Catholicks</hi> 
                  <q>believe a presence that is only figurative and real also:</q> which is just as Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> (<note n="b" place="bottom">Vide 1.

I gave this meaning <hi>That the heaven of heavens must contain him (i. e. his Natural body) till the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of all things:</hi> not aiming at a literal version, but to give the sense of the Original.

                     <hi>The word is not contain, but receive.</hi>
                  </q> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it <hi>the heaven of heavens,</hi> nor <hi>his Natural body,</hi> but only <hi>whome the heaven must receive.</hi> Yet the <hi>whome</hi> here signifies <hi>Christ's natural body; and the heaven,</hi> means <hi>the heaven of heavens;</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> in this case is all one as to <hi>contain.</hi> This mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text and the Argument from it, are so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain and common, that I need not farther insist on 'em. If any man think they are evaded by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <q>
                     <hi>That our Savior's body is not now indu'd with natural properties, but spiritual; such as being at once in two places, having no dimensions and the like;</hi>
                  </q> I give him joy of his Understanding; but shall never offer to dispute with him. Wherefore neither shall I meddle with the former part of this Remark; which only tells us that <q>Christ in his Incarnation had a natural organical body such as ours; but now in his Glorification has a spiritual body, such as the Examiner has devis'd for him;</q> a veryer Phantome than <hi>Marcion</hi> made him in his Incarnation.</p>
               <p>In the next Note, (which to our exceeding great
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101427:46"/>
comfort is the last but one) we are told that <q>
                     <hi>our</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 216.</note> 
                     <hi>Author's quotation out of St. Austin's</hi> cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis <hi>is true and pertinent.</hi>
                  </q> But if our Author had so manag'd it, that St. Austin might seem to say what he did not say in that place, and plainly contradicts in divers others, the quotation is <hi>not true;</hi> and if St. <hi>Austin</hi> did not speak of the Martyrs bodies, it is <hi>not pertinent;</hi> because the point in question was, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a body might be in two places at once? and St. <hi>Austin</hi> was quoted in favor of the Affirmative. But <q>
                     <hi>it matters not</hi> (says our Examiner) <hi>whither the Martyrs bodyes are spoken of by St. Austin. For our Replyer p.</hi> 29. <hi>seems not to dare affirm, that a Spirit cannot be in two Ubies: but if it be a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. Austin needs not inquire; if not a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, neither is it for a spiritual body to be so.</hi>
                  </q> The Replyer indeed wav'd disputing about a Spirit's Ubiety, because it was nothing to the purpose; for* (as he had already intimated) though a Spirit could be in two Ubies, it will not follow that a Body may be in two places at once. And the crutch that is now brought to support this lame consequence (I mean the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's notion of a spiritual body) is the staff of a brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en reed, which instead of removing the absurdity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, introduces a great many worse. But to put this case beyond <hi>seeming,</hi> the Replyer <hi>dare</hi> and does <hi>affirm,</hi> that neither a Spirit nor any other creature either is or can be in two discontinu'd Ubies or Places at the same time; for he's very well assur'd he can prove when there is occasion, that the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implyes a formal contradiction. <q>
                     <hi>If it be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> (says our honest Examiner) <hi>S. Austin need not inquire;</hi>
                  </q> leaving us (if we are so careless) to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that he did inquire; and therefore thought it<note place="bottom">Reply pag 24.</note>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:101427:47"/>
no contradiction. This is a very great piece of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress;<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> for 'tis certain S. <hi>Austin</hi> did inquire; but not if a body might be in two places at once (that, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty other places he peremtorily denyes) but taking it for granted that the Martyrs did releive their Votaries, and could not do this without a Miracle; the thing that he inquir'd of, was the <hi>modus</hi> how this Miracle was wrought. For solution, he assigns divers <hi>modi;</hi> of which the most difficult may (as far as concerns this case) be explain'd without a contradiction; or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting that a Spirit is at one and the same time in two discontinu'd Ubies: but still the point is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, he professes 'tis past his understanding; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine, and therefore cares not to dispute, but contents himself with the certainty of the thing. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, the point in debate is; Whither S. <hi>Austin</hi> favor this opinion that a body may be in two places at once? and it appears, 1. That St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> says directly and frequently that a body cannot. 2. That he no where affirms a spirit can, but rather the contrary. 3. That if he had sayd a spirit could, yet the consequence from a spirit to a body will not hold; 4. That it is not pretended to hold, except in the case of the <hi>Examiner's spiritual body,</hi> which is prov'd an absurd inconceivable nothing; which there is not the least shadow of appearance that either St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> or any man of reason ever thought of. I know that <hi>Cutbert Tonstall</hi> in his dotage about An. 1554. imploy'd <hi>his</hi> notion of <hi>a spiritual body,</hi> to defend the Corporal presence; <note n="a" place="bottom">In his Book de veritate corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti in Eucharistia. Lutetiae. apud Vasco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanum A. D. 1554.</note> and for ought I find, he was the first that did so: and he did it with a tenderness which argu'd his distrust of it; tho' <hi>his</hi> was but a phlegmatic
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101427:47"/>
absurdity in comparison of our Author's highly recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> nonsense. But <hi>Cutbert</hi> stood alone, till the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser joyn'd him, and refin'd upon him; and if none beleiving, yet none expressly confuted him, 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did what our Author and Publisher shou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d have done, he put his age to his book.</p>
               <p>And since we are so near a Conclusion, that we may the more easily part friends, wee'l suppose the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner to have done this; and allow the infirmities of age to plead for those following mistakes, which would hardly be forgiven to a younger pen. When he said that my quotations from S. Austin <q>
                     <hi>do not in the least contradict the doctrine of the Church;</hi>
                  </q> good man he meant the Church of England, and only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got he had <hi>declar'd;</hi> and 'twas only the frailty of an old memory made him say and forget to prove <q>
                     <hi>that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 217.</note> 
                     <hi>the quotation from Tract.</hi> 30. <hi>in Joh. is perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Replyer.</hi>
                  </q> Perhaps it may be difficult to excuse his telling us that <q>
                     <hi>S. Austin says that Homo secundum corpus &amp;c. after having first sayd that our Savior was in divers places</hi> (in heaven and earth) <hi>in his life time by the omnipotence of Almighty God; and that he was whilst upon earth in heaven also by the power of God;</hi>
                  </q> since no such thing appears in the context of any of my quotations; nor indeed in any other passage of S. <hi>Austin's</hi> writings. However wee'l impute even this mistake to old age (which impairs a man's other faculties as well as his memory) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves to set both him and the Reader right, by giving him S. <hi>Austin's</hi> own words<note n="a" place="bottom">

is I'm so heartily tir'd, that I willingly quit the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this Paragraph affords me, to be at quiet: For the same reason I return nothing to the last angry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, but only desire him to put on his Spectacles, and once more read and consider the places I referr him to<note n="b" place="bottom">Disc. concerning the Rubric. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. §. 32. <hi>pag.</hi> 23.

I am incourag'd to expect another Appendix very speedily; and it may be as this first has in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prevented, so the next may wholly supersede the trouble of a set Answer. For this Harangue is made up of two parts, answerable to the <hi>two Discourses;</hi> the former concerns the <hi>Real presence;</hi> the latter, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of our Savior in the Eucharist.</hi> What we have in the Former depends wholly upon a new and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101427:48"/>
singular notion of a <hi>Spiritual body,</hi> which (besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other pretty tricks it has) can be at once in two places, notwithstanding the <hi>seeming Contradiction.</hi> Now of this, the Examen has already given me occasion to say what I hope may be sufficient: and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to my Reader that there neither is nor can be such a body, the Examiner may take his <hi>new nothing</hi> and hang it on his sleeve, with the rest of his Discourse that hangs upon it; for <hi>wee</hi> have no farther obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to trouble our selves about it.</p>
               <p>Thus the first part of the Examen has afforded me great relief; if the second be but as obliging, what would otherwise prove a double trouble 'will then be dispatch'd at once, to the Readers ease as well as mine. For I think we may be equally willing to be rid of an unthinking man, who talks as if his Soul were a match for his Spiritual body, and as this has neither quantity nor quality, so that had neither sense nor reason. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I attend the motions of his next Examen; and he promises fairly not to weary my expectation. For he says <q>
                     <hi>if it please God to continue their strength, they will not be long in my debt.</hi>
                  </q> Whenever they come out of it, I'll take care (God willing) to give 'em a receipt; but I hope they will not make such payment as they have done now, all in clip'd money, and three parts in four of it brass.</p>
