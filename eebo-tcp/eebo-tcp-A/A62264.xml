            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that the poor <hi>Eagle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered rather with its own <hi>Age</hi> then outward <hi>violence,</hi> yielded to that to which all must yield: and was forced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to digest all affronts offered unto him, and glad so to escape. For although some mention was made of killing him; yet by plurality of suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that <hi>vote</hi> got the mastery which onely confined him to a neighbouring <hi>wood,</hi> on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that death without mercy should be his penalty if exceeding the Bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>This done, Proclamation was made three daies after that the whole <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi>

should appeare for the election of a <hi>Principall</hi> to command them. Indeed there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which were altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they might the more freely rove and range in their Affections. These held that all were free by nature; and that it was an assault on the Liberty of man, and a <hi>rape</hi> offered to his naturall freedom; that any should assume authority above another. These maintained (what certainly was not onely a paradox, but a flat falshood) that nature at the first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made all the world a flat le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and <hi>Champion,</hi> and that it was by the violence of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi>

or great Flood, which by the partiall fall or running thereof, made the inequality, by sinking some places into humble <hi>Vallies,</hi> and swelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into aspiring <hi>Mountaines.</hi> Prosecuting which compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they maintained that all men were naturally equal; and that it was the inundation and influx of humane <hi>Tyranny</hi> which made this disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. They also defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the argument, that as the world began, so it should with the Golden age; and that all ought to be restored to that primitive Liberty which men had lost, partly <hi>surrendring</hi> it by their own folly and easie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100738:9"/>
nature; partly <hi>surprised</hi> into their own slavery by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and craft of others that practised on their simplicity. But however that these made a great noise, the opposite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prevailed, as having most of strength and reason on their side.</p>
            <p>For where all rule, there no rule at all will be: where every man may command, in fine, none will obey, the dictates of his own reason, but be a very <hi>vassall</hi> to his <hi>passion. Society</hi> cannot be twisted together where there is not a subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and subjection one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and where every one is absolute in himself, there is an

impossibility of any orderly subsistence.</p>
            <p>Let the maintainers of the contrary, try with themselves to make a rope of sand; where each crum therein being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of it self, hath no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to a generall agreement; but enjoyes it self in its own intirenesse.</p>
            <p>It being now cast (by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall suffrages) for a <hi>Commander</hi> over all, that at such a time they should meet: it was also proclaimed that all antipathy should cease between all <hi>Birds</hi> during their meeting; because being now in danger of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ruine, for want of a <hi>head</hi> all private animosity should be

great a defect in Nature, that the whole <hi>Universe</hi> would fare the worse for the same?</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it would, saith the Phoenix, for this is received for an undoubted Maxime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that if one whole kinde or <hi>species</hi> of Creatures be destroyed, the whole world would be ruined thereby: For every kinde of Creatures are so Essential to the well being thereof, that if any one of them be utterly destroyed, all the rest out of sympathy will decay.</p>
            <p>I conceive not, saith the Hawk, that you are such a foundation stone in Natures building, that the taking you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100738:18"/>
away will hazard the whole Architecture thereof. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am resolved to put it to the tryal, be it but to gaine knowledge by the experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know what <hi>Plato</hi> saith, <hi>That those are the happiest Kingdomes, wherein either their Kings are Philosophers, or their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers their Kings.</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the History of Nature is so necessary to an accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governour, I who desire all perfections in that kind, will to satisfie my curiositie make proof thereof.</p>
            <p>The Phoenix pleaded for her self the benefit of a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty to all for three dayes to come and goe with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100738:18"/>
safety; the Eagle smiling at her silly plea, informing her that such grants are to be kept no farther than they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the conveniency of those that grant them. Yet for the present the Phoenix was reprieved, because the Hawkes stomach lately gorged, had not as yet recovered his appetite to his supper.</p>
            <p>Then the Hawk approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Turtle-dove, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of her whether it was true or no what passeth for a common truth, that the Turtle if once losing their Mate, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wed more, but passe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their dolefull dayes in constant widdowhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100738:19"/>Most true it is, saith the Turtle, which I may speake by my owne sad experience; for some three vears since, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy shot of a cruel Falk oner deprived me of my deare Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, since which time I have sequestred my selfe from all company, never appearing in publique till now, forced thereunto by command from Authority.</p>
            <p>And surely, I conceive, all second Marriages little better than excusable lust, for when once the heate of youth hath been abated in one Match, none can pretend Necessity of Marrying againe, except it be for quenching those heates

which they themselves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and wilfully kindle.

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100738:21"/>Then beganne the Eagle to dispose himselfe, for Supper, intending the Turtle-dove for the first Course to begin with, and the Phoenix (as the finer flesh) to close his stomack therewith. In preparation wherunto he plumed the Dove of some of her upper Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Just in the instant as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne his prey, who should come in, but he was little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and lesse welcome to the Hawk than the old Eagle, and we must a while dwel upon the cause and manner of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
            <p>This Eagle was, as aforesaid, confined to a Grove, where he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100738:21"/>
was temperate against his will, as not able to feede on any Fowle. Nature had hung such a Lock upon his Bill, for the Redundancie thereof was such, that hee was capable of no food, save drinke, which hee plentifully powred in; thus for some moneths drinke was all the meate hee tooke, which served to support his life, though not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ncrease his strength; yet could he not be a good fellow in his Cups, as being solitary by himselfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none to keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>At last hee descryed a sharpe Rock, wherein one place white in colour, more prominent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100738:22"/>
than the rest, had a shining hardnesse therein; to this the Eagle applyes his Bill, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left off rubbing, grating, and whetting his Beak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill at last hee quite whetted off the superfluous, yea hurtfull Excrescencie of his Bill, which now reduced to a moderate proportion, was as usefull to all purposes as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before. Thus enabled to get his prey in few weekes, he recruited his strength, so that what the Poets tell of <hi>Medea,</hi> that with her inchanted Baths made her Father-in-law young againe, here truly came to passe: And now the New old Eagle hearing in what Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100738:22"/>
the Hawke kept his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant residence, thought on a sudden to have surprised him, had not the other discovered his approach, and made a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable escape, whereby both Turtle and Phoenix obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their liberty, and secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned unto their owne Nests.</p>
            <p>The Hawke having made an escape, posted with all speed to the Lapwinge, which with some difficulty he found out, and privacie being obtained, thus kindly spake unto him.</p>
            <p>Friend Lapwing, I have taken notice, that you are one of the most subtilest, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Bird in all our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100738:23"/>
you have the art so to cover your intentions, that they are not obvious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eyes, when your Egges or young ones be a mile at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, you use to flutter with your winges, and fetch your rounds and circles a great way off, as if you intended to broo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that place with your wings, or as if that were the Chest wherein your Treasure was deposited; this makes many people to search there for your young ones, but are frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their hopes; you have insecured them farre off; this lawfull Simulation, I conceive a commendable and necessary quality in every great person;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100738:23"/>
it is as necessary as breath to their well being: Should men play all above board, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their actions to all Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, Folly and Wisdome would bee both of a rate. No, it is the hanging of such Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Traverses before our Deeds which keep up our Reputation, and enable us for great performances. Now I request you help me a little in my extremity, the renewed Eagle is in pursuit of me, and my safety lyeth much at your disposall. The Lapwing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the utmost of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and desired the Hawk to proceed.</p>
            <p>See you, saith the Hawk,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100738:24"/>
yonder empty Cage of great receipt, so that it might serve for an Aviarie, for which it was first intended, though since disused, when the Eagle flying this way enquireth after me, perswade him I am flowne into the Cage, and leave the rest to my performance.</p>
            <p>All was acted accordingly, the Eagle demanded what was become of the Hawk? the Lapwing returned, <hi>Here 'tis, here 'tis,</hi> and then hovered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Cage, fetching so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny compasses thereabouts, that one might have mistaken him for some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>njurer, making his many Circles with intent to raise up some spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100738:24"/>
The Eagle violently flyes into the Cage, whose doores stood open, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his owne happinesse, that now he should be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his profest Enemy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the Hawk (who stood behinde unseen in a place of advantage) clapps an Iron Padlock on the Cage, and thus insulteth over the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes, Sir Eagle, you make mee call to minde the condition of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Great Turk, whom <hi>Tamberlan</hi> tooke captive, and carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Country, that all people might feed their gazing eyes upon him; such a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100738:25"/>
are you this day; <hi>I</hi> have now made an Owle of the Eagle, turned him into the ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diculous object of laughter and contempt: Tell me, doe you not want a <hi>Prometheus,</hi> to feed upon his fruitfull entrails as the Poets feigne, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased, and afforded the Poets Eagle both Common and Festivals. Sir, your life shall not bee vented out at once, but you shall dye many deaths, with long lingering torments: <hi>I</hi> will order it so that you shall feele your self to dye: There is no Musick in an Enemies death, which is not accompanyed with tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment; and though no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100738:25"/>
torture shall be inflicted upon you, yet know, that thirst and hunger shall be your two Executioners. Now the Guiltlesse blood of so many Birds and innocent Lambs, and hurtlesse Hares shall bee required of you; and so I leave you till to morrow, when <hi>I</hi> meane to make a new meal of you in scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>The Eagle sadly, yet stoutly auswered, my courage shall not abate with my condition, whose spirit is planted above the battery of Fortune, <hi>I</hi> will never be lesse than my selfe, whatsoever befalls me. A Lyon is no lesse a Lyon, though in a

            <p>After the Hawkes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Ostrich came in the place, whom the Eagle saw unseen, and wishly marked his postures and motions. The Ostrich fell into a strange pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and would you know the reason thereof, it was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>Some three dayes since, when hee first repaired to the generall meeting of the Birds, he left his Egges in the sand,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100738:26"/>
not covering them over, such his carelesnesse and incogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; it was in a Starre-light night, wherein he took a mark for the finding of his Egges by such a Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect position whereof he then hid them, and hoped to finde them at his returne. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the Starre being turned about with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyration of the heavens, which continue in constant motion, the Ostrich lost the Starre by which hee thought to find his Egges, and though very neare the place wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and downe, and could not light upon it, which made him breake forth into this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100738:27"/>
passionate complaints.</p>
            <p>I am the unfortunatest of all Fowles: How will all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mee for an unnaturall Parent, who have been thus carelesse of mine owne Issue? Yet <hi>I</hi> tooke as good notice of the place as <hi>I</hi> could, all things in Earth are false, and fading, and flitting away: <hi>I</hi> had thought there had been more faithfulnesse in the Heavens, more assurance in the Skies.

            <p>How comes it to passe, that the Pole-Starre is so perfect a guide and direction to the Mariner, that it may be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            <p>It was conceived, that the Peacock intended a longer O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which would have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the assembly with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity thereof, had he not casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but happily cast down his eyes on his black legs, the ugly hew therof so abated his Pride, that it put a period to his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue before his intent, and others expectation.

and those that have most courage have least crueltie, at the mediation of some potent Birds, the Eagle condescended, that the day of his Re-inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should not be stained with blood, and therefore granted life to the Hawk, but on condition, not to exceed the Grove in which formerly himself was imprisoned.</p>

            <p>It is not unknown to you, how I have the precedency of

all <hi>Flowers,</hi> confirmed unto me under the <hi>Patent</hi> of a double <hi>Sence, Sight, smell.</hi> What more curious <hi>Colours?</hi> how do all <hi>Diers blush</hi> when they behold my <hi>blushing,</hi> as conscious to themselves, that their <hi>Art</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imitate that tincture, which <hi>Nature</hi> hath stamped upon me. <hi>Smell,</hi> it is not lusciously <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> nor dangerously <hi>Faint,</hi> but comforteth with a delight, and delighteth with the comfort thereof: Yea, when <hi>Dead,</hi> I am more Soveraigne then <hi>Living:</hi> What Cordials are made of my Syrups? how many corrupted Lungs (those Fans of Nature) sore wasted with consumption,

            </p>
            <p>There is lately a <hi>Flower</hi> (shal I call it so? in courtesie I will tearme it so, though it deserve not the appellation) a <hi>Toolip,</hi> which hath ingrafted the love

and affections of most people unto it; and what is this <hi>Toolip?</hi> a well complexion'd stink, an ill savour wrapt up in pleasant colours: As for the use thereof in <hi>Physick,</hi> no <hi>Physitian</hi> hath honoured it yet with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor with a <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> name, so inconsiderable hath it hitherto been accompted; and yet this is that which filleth all Gardens, hundred of pounds being given for the root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whilst I the <hi>Rose,</hi> am negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and contemned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived beneath the honour of noble hands, and fit only to grow in the gardens of Yeomen. I trust the remainder to your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100738:37"/>
apprehensions, to make out that, which grief for such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved injuries will not suffer me to expresse.</p>
            <p>Hereat the <hi>Rose</hi> wept, and the dropping of her <hi>white</hi> tears down her <hi>red</hi> cheeks, so well becomed her, that if ever sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was lovely, it then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so, which moved the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to much compassion, her <hi>Tears</hi> speaking more then her tongue, in her own behalfe.</p>

            <p>I am not solicitous what to

returne to the complaint of this <hi>Rose,</hi> whose own demerit hath justly outed it self of that respect, which the mistaken world formerly bestowed upon it, and which mens eyes, now opened, justly reassume, and conferre on those who better deserve the same. To say that I am not more worthy then the <hi>Rose,</hi> what is it, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mankind, and to arraign the most <hi>Gentle</hi> and knowing among men of ignorance, for misplacing their affections: Surely <hi>Vegetables</hi> must not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same to mount above <hi>Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> creatures, or to think that men are not the most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100738:38"/>
judges of the worth and valew of <hi>Flowers.</hi> I confesse there is yet no known soveraign vertue in my leaves, but it is injurious to inferre that I have none, because as yet not taken notice of. If we should exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>all,</hi> by their intrinsick va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lews, how many contemptible things in Nature would take the upper-hand of those which are most valued; by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a <hi>Flint-stone</hi> would be better then a <hi>Diamond,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that spark of fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whence men with combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible matter may heat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the coldest season: and cleer it is, that the <hi>Load-stone,</hi>

(that grand <hi>Pilot</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> which findeth the way there in the darkest night) is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the most orient Pearle in the world: But they will generally be condemned for unwise, who prize things according to this proportion.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore in stones and minerals, that those things are not most <hi>valued,</hi> which have most vertue, but that men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their eyes and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies raise the reputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let it not be interpreted to my disadvantage, that I am not eminently known for any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall operation; perchance the discovery hereof is reserved for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100738:39"/>
the next age, to find out the <hi>latent</hi> vertue which <hi>lurketh</hi> in me: And this I am confident of, that <hi>Nature</hi> would never have hung out so gorgious a signe, if some guest of quality had not been lodged therein; surely my <hi>leaves,</hi> had never been <hi>feathered</hi> with such variety of <hi>colours,</hi> (which hath proclaimed me the King of all Lillies) had not some strange vertue, whereof the world is yet ignorant, been treasured up therein.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Rose,</hi> let her thank her selfe, if she be sensible of any decay in esteem, I have not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously affected superiority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her, nor have I fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100738:40"/>
endevoured to supplant her: only I should have been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my selfe, had I refused those favours from <hi>Ladies,</hi> which their importunity hath pressed upon me: And may the <hi>Rose</hi> remember, how she out of causelesse jealousie, maketh all hands to be her enemies that gather her; what need is there that she should garison her selfe within her prickles? why must she set so many Thornes to lye constant <hi>perdue,</hi> that none must gather her, but such as suddenly surprize her; and do not all that crop her, run the hazard of hurting their fingers: This is that which hath weaned the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100738:40"/>
world from her love, whilst my smooth stalk exposing <hi>Ladies</hi> to no such perills, hath made them by exchange to fix their removed affections upon me.</p>
            <p>At this stood up the <hi>Violet,</hi> and all prepared themselves with respectfull attention, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the <hi>Violet</hi> for the Age thereof, for the <hi>Prim Rose</hi> alone excepted, it is <hi>Seignior</hi> to all the <hi>Flowers</hi> in the year, and was highly regarded for the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the experience thereof that durst encounter the cold, and had past many bitter blasts, whereby it had gained much wispome, and had procured a venerable respect, both to his <hi>

               <hi>Syrian</hi> extraction, but sure there it grew wild in the open fields, and is not beheld otherwise, then a gentler sort of weed: But we may observe that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forraign <hi>vices</hi> are made <hi>vertues</hi> in this countrey, forraign <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse</hi> is Grecian <hi>Mirth</hi> (thence the proverb, <hi>The merry Greek</hi>) forraign <hi>pride,</hi> Grecian <hi>good behaviour;</hi> forraign <hi>lust,</hi> Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>love;</hi> forraign <hi>lazinesse,</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>harmelessnesse;</hi> forraign <hi>weeds,</hi> Grecian <hi>Flowers.</hi> My judgement therefore is, that if we do not speedily eradicate this <hi>intruder</hi> (this <hi>Toolip</hi>) in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of time will out us all of our just possessions, seeing no

            <p>The gravity of the <hi>Violet</hi> so prevailed with the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Flowers,</hi> that all concurred with his judgment herein; and such who had not the faculty of the sluentnesse of their tongues to expresse themselves in large <hi>Orations,</hi> thought that the well managing of a <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> spoke them as well wishing to the generall good, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing themselves in large <hi>Harrangues;</hi> and these soberly concluded, that the <hi>Toolip</hi> should be rooted out of the

            <p>As for my <hi>bitternesse,</hi> it is not a malitious &amp; mischievous <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> to do hurt, but a helpfull &amp; medicinall <hi>bitternesse,</hi> whereby many cures are effected.

            <p>True it is, I am condemned for over-hot, and too passionate in my operation; but are not the best natures subject to this distemper? is it not observed that the most <hi>witty</hi> are the most <hi>cholerick?</hi> a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing is <hi>pardonable,</hi> I will not say necessary in this kind, nor let me be condemned as destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

age may produce millions of these instances; I knew some tenne years since many honest men, whose converse was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and faire, how did they court and desire the company of their neighbours, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, how was their company desired by them? how <hi>humble</hi> were they in their <hi>carriage, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> in their <hi>expressions,</hi> and <hi>friendly</hi> in their <hi>behaviour,</hi> drawing the love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all that were acquainted with them?

            <p>Indeed such who have long been gaining of wealth, and have slowly proceeded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees therein, whereby they have learnt to mannage their minds, are not so palpably proud as others; but those who

without imparting them to any; my confessor himselfe shall know my <hi>conscience,</hi> but not my judgement in affaires of <hi>State:</hi> Let us comply with the present necessity, and lie at a close posture, knowing there be fencers even now about us, who will set upon us if our guards lye open: generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are such to which I will confine my selfe: It is antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, <hi>that the subtill man lurks in generall.</hi> But now give me leave, for honesty it selfe, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be safe, to take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary therein.</p>

               <hi>Sage returned;</hi> Were I a blab of my mouth, whose secresie was ever suspected, then might you be cautious in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating your mind unto me: But secrecy is that I can principally

boast of, it being the quality for which the common-wealth of <hi>Flowers</hi> chose me their privy Councellor, what therefore is told me in this nature, is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited as securely, as those <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> which formerly were laid up in the <hi>Temple</hi> of safety it self; and therefore with all modest importunity, I reassume my suit, and desire your judgment of the question, whether the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Tyranny is likely to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any longer? for <hi>Time</hi> I know alone can give an answer to this question.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100738:74"/>
you, which I never as yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to any mortall: I am of that hopefull opinion, that the period of this barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons greatnesse begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, my first reason is drawn from the vicissitude and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which attends all earthly things; <hi>Bodies</hi> arrived at the <hi>verticall</hi> point of their <hi>strength, decay</hi> and <hi>decline.</hi> The <hi>Moon</hi> when in the fulnesse of its <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,</hi> tendeth to a <hi>waning;</hi> it is a pitch too high for any sublunary thing to amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to constantly, to proceed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressively in greatnesse; this maketh me to hope that this Giant-like <hi>Empire,</hi> comented
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100738:74"/>
with Tyranny, supported, not so much with their own poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as with the servility of such who are under them, hath seen its best daies and highest eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To this end, to come to more particulars, what was it which first made the <hi>Turks</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, in so short a time to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run all <hi>Greece,</hi> but these two things; first, the <hi>dissentions,</hi> 2. the <hi>dissolutenesse</hi> of your antient <hi>Greeks:</hi> Their <hi>dissentions</hi> are too well known, the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> being grown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most but <hi>titular,</hi> such the pride and potency of many Peeres under him. The <hi>Egean</hi> is not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100738:75"/>
more stored with <hi>Islands</hi> (as I think scarce such a heap or hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is to be found of them in all the world againe) as <hi>Greece</hi> was with severall <hi>factions,</hi> the <hi>Epirots</hi> hated the <hi>Achayans,</hi> the <hi>Mesedans</hi> bandoned against the <hi>Thracians,</hi> the <hi>Dalmatians</hi> maintained <hi>deadly feud</hi> against the <hi>Wallachians:</hi> Thus was the conquest made easie for the <hi>Turks,</hi> beholding not so much to their own valour, as to the <hi>Grecian</hi> discord.</p>
            <p>Next to their <hi>dissentions,</hi> their <hi>dissolutenesse</hi> did expedite their ruine; drunkennesse was so common among them, that it was a sin to be sober, so that I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100738:75"/>
may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now you see the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves have divisions and dissentions among them, their <hi>great Bashaws</hi> and <hi>holy Muftees</hi> have their severall factions and dissentions; and whereas the <hi>poor Greeks</hi> by the reason of their hard usage, begin now to be starved into unity and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, they may seem to have changed their vices with the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100738:76"/>
               <hi>Turks,</hi> who are now grown as factious and vitious as the other were before. Adde to all this that they are universally hated, and the neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> raither <hi>wait</hi> a <hi>time,</hi> then <hi>want</hi> a <hi>will</hi> to be revenged on them for their many insolencies. Put all these together, and tell me if it put not a cheerfull complexion on probability, that the <hi>Turkish tyranny</hi> having come to the mark of its own might, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most limits of its own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, will dwindle and wither away by degrees. And assure your selfe, if once it come to be but <hi>standing water,</hi> it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a <hi>low ebb</hi> with them.</p>
