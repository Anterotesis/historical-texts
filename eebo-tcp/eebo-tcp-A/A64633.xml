            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The other sort of Adversaries be they that be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of any thing, either for it or against it; and perswading themselves that the sway and shew of the world must needs carry the truth with it, doe (like blind bayards) boldly venture to say any thing against it, and thinke they, doe well.

The first sort of favourers (which be the Ministers) I intreat, that as they tender the glory of God, and honour of the cause which they stand in; so they would diligently imploy themselves in this, that they may be found able to defend the same by sound and evident grounds out of the Word, and so much the rather, for that the Adversaries doe greatly triumph, when they meet with one that professeth the cause, and is not able to defend it, and confute the gainsayers of it.

If thou be satisfied therewith, give God the glory, and promote the cause by prayer, and all other good meanes that thy Calling may afford: and pray for us, that we may never shrinke, nor be overthrowne by the strength of them that fight against it.</p>

            <p>EVery Officer in the Church, must be placed in some Calling warranted by the word of God, and some Congregation must have need of such a one, before hee be called to any Function. Wherein are these Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 No Calling is lawfull in the Church, but that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly warranted out of the Word, unto him that executeth it.<note place="margin">The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note>
            </p>

            <p>They think otherwise, as their making of so many Ministers at once proveth, and as is holden, <hi>Whitgift page</hi> 222.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first is proved thus: If <hi>Iohn</hi> was constrained to prove his Minister<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rant in the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Callings under the Gospell must have as good warrant as they had under the Law, because the light of the Gospell is (at the least) as cleare as that of the Law: But there was never any lawfull Calling under the Law (excepting those that were by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner confirmed from heaven) which had not his direct warrant out of the Word. Therefore no Calling is lawfull in the Church, which is not directly warranted in the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> and <hi>Abiram</hi> (though they were <hi>Levites</hi>) were punished for that they had no warrant for that which they presumed to take in hand, then is every lawfull Calling, both in generall warranted out of the Word, and particularly layd upon the parties from the Lord: But the former is true, as the Historie teacheth us: Therefore must the latter needs be true also.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34885:10"/>4 That which giveth comfort unto a man in the time of his troubles, must have a warrant out of Gods word: But every law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Calling giveth comfort unto a man to the time of his troubles: Therfore every lawfull Calling hath a warrant out of Gods word.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That which helpeth Gods people forward in god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines, must have a warrant out of Gods word: for God hath promised a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to his owne ordinance onely: But every lawfull calling in the Church, helpeth Gods people forward in godlinesse: Therefore every lawfull Calling hath a warrant out of Gods word.</p>
            <p>Therefore if <hi>John</hi> did prove his calling out of the Scriptures; if every calling under the Law,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> was warranted out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if <hi>Corath,</hi> &amp;c. were punished for enterprising that which they had no warrant for, out of the Scriptures, if comfort in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles commeth onely from the Scriptures; and lastly, if every h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They confesse all these reasons to be true; but doe denie that the Archbishops, L. Bishops, &amp;c. be distinct Ministers from others. <hi>Whitgift</hi> page 303. which we hold, <hi>T. C.</hi> 2. book page 438. and prove it thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Those things that have divers efficient causes, are divers: Our Bishops and the Ministers of the Word have divers efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for the one is the Ordinance of God, the other the Constitution of humane Policie, as themselves doe confesse: Therefore they are distinct Ministers from others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A divers Forme maketh divers things: the Ministers of the Word, and the L. Bishops have divers formes: for their Ordination (even in the Church of England) is divers, seeing one L. Bishop may ordaine a Minister: But there must be three to ordaine one of them: Therefore they are distinct Ministers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Members of one division are distinct one from another: the L. Bishops and ordinary Ministers be members of one division: for usually the Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs be divided into the Rulers, and them that are to be ruled: Therefore they are distinct Ministers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The things that have divers effects, are divers in themselves one from another: the L. Bishops and other Ministers have divers effects; for the one effecteth Rule and Government, the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience: Therefore they are divers and distinct Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
            <p n="5">5 They that be imployed about divers things are divers one from another: The L. Bishops and the ordinary Ministers, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34885:10"/>
about divers things; for the one is exercised in generall view of many Congregations, and the other in the particular direction of one: Therefore they be distinct Ministers.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That which is perpetuall, and that which may be taken away by men, are distinct one from another: The office of the Minister is perpetuall, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13. and the Bishops may be taken away as themselves confesse: Therefore they are divers, &amp; distinct Ministers.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the Ministers of the Word,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>First, the reasons that prove it unlawfull to give the name unto any man in the Church, are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1 No man may have the name given him, which is prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2 If the name <hi>Pope</hi> be therefore odiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore must the latter be true also.</p>
            <p>But they object divers things against this,<note place="margin">Obiections for the name of Archb and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Whitgift page</hi> 318.</note> for the proving of the name <hi>Archb.</hi> to be lawfully given unto some men, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their answers doe brief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1 <hi>Objection. Clemens</hi> alloweth of those names, as <hi>Polydor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</p>

            <p n="1">1. A Shepheard hath a flocke to the end to feed it continually: The Minister is a shepheard, and his charge a flocke: Therefore he ought to feed it continually, and consequently to bee perpetually resident, for how can he feed them from whom he is absent?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where God doth place any man, there his continuall travaile is needfull, for God is most wise in disposing every thing: But God placeth every right Minister over that people, which is his charge: Therefore his continuall travaile is needfull there, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may not discontinue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Flockes that are in danger, are (by carefull Shepheards) watched night and day, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. Every Congregation is a flock in danger, for the enemy goeth about like a roaring Lyon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34885:13"/>
every congregation is to be watched night and day by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof, and consequently he may not be non-resident.</p>

            <p n="6">6 If the Ministers of the Gospell, be as narrowly tyed to their charges, as the Priests under the law, then may they not be non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident: For they were alwayes ready in the Temple, to answer the doubts, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.9: But it is cleare that they are, because men are now as hardly trayned unto godlines, and the enemie is as wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as he was then: Therefore they may not be non-resident.</p>
            <p n="7">7 If the Minister must be an example to his people; then must he be daily present with them, that they may behold him: But the former is true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 12. Therefore is the latter true also.</p>

            <p>CHurch officers must be ordained by laying on of hands; in this they agree with us, concerning the ceremonie it selfe, albeit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the parties by whom, nor on whom it must be conferred. The profit of this Ceremonie appeareth in reasons following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which stirreth up every partie, to pray with more fervencie, is profitable to be used: But such is this Ceremonie, for it affecteth the ordainers, when they feele him for whom they pray; and the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when he feeleth a calling and charge from God (as it were) sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly comming upon him, and the congregation, when they see him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the rest, by whom they shall reape much comfort or griefe: Therefore the use of it is very profitable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which helpeth forward the party ordained in his care, to walke with a good conscience in his calling, is profitable to be used: Such is the imposition of hands, for both it declareth unto him, that he is separated of God for that purpose, and also giveth him hope, that his hand who allotted him thereunto, will alwayes assist him in the course of that calling: Therefore it is of a profitable use.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which worketh a more acknowledgment of Gods ordinance in the hearts of the people, is profitable to be used: such is the laying on of hands, for it declareth unto them, that the Lord hath placed him in that Calling over them: Therefore it is profitable to be used.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Conclusion.</note>Therefore seeing the Ceremonie of laying on hands is forcible, to increase the fervencie of every partie, when they pray; seeing it assureth the calling to the party ordained, and giveth him an argument of good hope, for the blessing of God upon him in the course of the same; and seeing it procureth a more perswasion in the people, that he is allotted unto them from the Lord himselfe; it is evident that it is not a vaine and idle ceremonie (as many doe imagine) but of good and profitable use, in all ordinations.</p>

            <p>FOr the further revealing of the truth, God hath ordained, that there should be in the Church Doctors, whose office is to be imployed in teaching of doctrine, and is an office dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the Pastour.</p>
            <p>The latter part of this proposition, is the thing which espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they doe deny, which is thus prooved to be true.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Those which the Apostle (in speaking of distinct officers) doth distinguish one from another, are severall and distinct one from another: But the Apostle doth distinguish the Pastour and teacher, one from another, Rom. 12.7.8. and Ephes. 4.11. Even as he distinguisheth man and woman. Gal. 3.28. See the Greek of them both: Therefore the office of pastour and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or are distinct one from another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As are the gifts that adorne offices, so are the officers themselves, for the execution of the office, consisteth in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of the gifts: But the gifts of the pastour and Doctor are divers, as appeareth 1. Cor. 12.8. And by experience, for some hath an excellent gift in doctrine, and not in application, and others excell in application and exhortation, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re very meane, in delivering of doctrine: Therefore the office of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour and teacher, are distinct one from another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Those that are to take a divers course in teaching are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and different in their functions, for else why should they be enjoyned to take a divers course: But the pastour is to take one course, and the Doctor another, for the one is to direct himselfe principally to exhort, and the other to attend upon doctrine: Rom. 12.7, 8. Therefore the office of pastour and Doctor, be distinct offices the one from the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Ecclesiasticall stories (especially speaking of the Church of Alexandria) doe usually make a difference betwixt the Bishop and the Doctor.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Cathedrall Churches have yet some shew thereof left in them, who (besides the Bishop) have also one that readeth a Lecture in divinity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the distinguishing of them, make more for the building of the Church, then the uniting of them; then are they to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, &amp; not made all one: But the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Therefore, if the Apostle Paul distinguisheth them one from another; if God do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. That which the Apostles established in every congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought still to continue, seeing the Church must be ruled by the same lawes, that it was ruled by then, and needeth as great furtherance now, as it did then: But the Apostles established Elders in every congregation, Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.23. Which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of preaching Elders onely; considering that the scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of them was such, as Paul was constrained to send Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus to great cities, which he could hardly spare, as he often testifieth: Therefore ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Those which God hath ordained to help forward the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Church, ought to be in every congregation, unlesse it may appeare that some congregation needeth not so much helpe, as Christ hath appointed: But Christ hath ordeined El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, for the helping forward of the building of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34885:24"/>
the Church 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Therefore such Elders ought to be in every congregation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which being wanting, the body cannot be entire, that same must be in every congregation: But the Elders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting, and the Church be an entire body <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. Which every congregation should be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 4. Therefore there ought to be such Elders in every congregation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the word of God doe describe such Elders in the Church, then ought they to be in every congregation, which is cleare by this, that every congregation hath need of them, as well as any: and that every congregation must have all the other officers of the Church: and that every congregation is of equall dignity in the body of Christ: but the word of God describeth unto us such Elders. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Therefore they ought to be in every congregation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is no Church,<note place="margin">Ignat. ad Trail.</note> that can stand without her Eldership or councell.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It belongeth onely to the Bishop to baptize,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</note> and the Elder and Deacon may not do it, but upon the Bishops licence.</p>

            <p n="18">18.

            <p>They confesse it was so in the Apostles time, but seeme to say somewhat that it cannot be under a Christian magistrate thus:</p>

            <p n="1">1. The lesse able that Ministers are to direct their people in the waies of godlinesse, the more neede they have of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that God hath allowed them in his word: But Ministers are now lesse able (especially under Christian Magistrates, when men are overtaken with ease and peace, which quench go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d things) then they were in the time of the Apostles: Therefore there is as great (if not greater) neede of Elders now, then was in the time of the Apstoles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Christian Magistrates bee to maintaine the order that Christ hath set downe for the governement of his Church, then must there be Elders in it under a Christian Magestrate, for El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are appointed of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. But Christian Magestrates are to maintaine the order that Christ hath set downe for the ruling of his Church, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.23. Therefore there must be El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, under a Christian Magestrate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the rule of Christ cannot bee perpetually observed, tell the Church, unlesse there be Elders; then must there bee such under a Christian Magestrate: But the former is true, for by the Church is there meant the Seanate of Ministers and Elders, as shall be proved in the chapter of Excommunication: Therfore there must be Elders, under a Christian Magistrate.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:34885:26"/>4. If the whole governement of the Church described in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> bee to bee observed untill the end, then must there bee Elders under Christian Magestrates, for they are contained in those Epistles: but the former is true 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14. Therefore there must be Elders under a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where sinners ate more outragious, and the best most subject to waxe cold, there is greatest neede of all the helpes that God hath ordained to punish sinne, and to cherish well doing: But so it is under a Christian Magistrate especially in the peace of the Church, as <hi>Whitgift</hi> confesseth, pag. 643. Therefote there is (at the least) as great neede of Elders (seeing they are helpers uppointed of God) under a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as at any other time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>Therefore if Mininisters be lesse able now, then in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time; if Christian Majestrates must maintaine the order prescribed by Christ; if else the rule of Christ, (till the Chru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that the former proposition being true, upon the grounds alledged, notwithstanding these objections, we are to proceed to the second, which is this.</p>
            <p>There ought to be such Deacons (as are described in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proposition) in every congregation,<note place="margin">The 2. propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> which is thus proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That office which every congregation hath need of, ought to be in every congregation: But every congregation hath need of the Deacons office, which appeareth by this, that they have poore to provide for (or else they must regard the necessitie of others) and the liberalitie of others to distribute:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34885:28"/>
Therefore Deacons ought to be in every congregation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That which is indefinitely appointed for the good of the Church, belongeth unto every congregation, as well as to any one: But such is the appointment of the Deacons. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. Therefore there must be Deacons in every congregation.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Where all sorts of Elders ought to be, there must be also the joyning of their offices in one, for the good of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation over which they are placed: But all sorts of Elders ought to be in every congregation, as is proved in the 10. chap. for Bishops, the 12. for Elders, &amp;c. Therefore there must be an Eldership in every congregation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If no particular congregation have greater priviledges given thereunto by the Word of God then others have, then must there either be no Eldership at all (which is false, in that Elders are proved to be by the Word of God in the Church) or else it must be in every congregation: But every congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of like priviledge, which appeareth by this, that it is a perfect body of it self: Therefore there must be an Eldership in everie congregation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The same warrant that is in the Word of God, for to have an Eldership in one place, is a warrant for it in all; for the Word of God tyeth it, not to Churches in cities, but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to the Church: But there is warrant for it out of the Word to be some where, as appeareth by this, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whatsoever is objected against this, that hath any shew in it, is answered in the 12. chap. of Elders.</p>
            <p>The office of the Eldership is ordained by Christ to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and ordinarie for the government of his Church,<note place="margin">The 2. propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> 
               <hi>T. C.</hi> 1. book, 177. denied by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Whitgift,</hi> 627. and by their practice in keeping it out: but the truth of it appeareth by these reasons that do follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If the causes why Christ would have an Eldership in his Church be perpetuall,<note place="margin">See the answer to D. <hi>Bridges,</hi> pag. 132.</note> then must also the thing it self be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: But the causes are perpetuall, which be to govern the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34885:29"/>
Church by the rules of his Word, and that ecclesiastically: Therefore the Eldership is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If Christ be the author of the Eldership, and left it by the Apostles to be established in the Church, then it is perpetuall; for his commission given to the Apostles, is to be observed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world: But Christ is the author of it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth both by his giving of the gifts for the particular members thereof, and the whole body of it; as also in that the Apostles did establish it in the Church, who went not from their commission, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. Therefore the Eldership is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Whatsoever is the commandment of God, once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, is never repealed again, and to be acknowledged of every spirituall man; that same is to be received by the Church of God to be perpetuall: But such is the government of the Church by Pastors, Doctors, and Elders, and so of the whole Eldership, as appeareth in that they are all mentioned in the writings of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which are so esteemed: 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.37. Therefore the government of the Church by an Eldership is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That whose severall parts is perpetuall, and which hath perpetuall gifts given, for the furnishing thereof for ever; that same must needs be perpetuall: But the severall parts of the Eldership, as Pastor, Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Elders, be perpetual, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the 10. &amp; 12 chap. Therfore the Eldership is perpetual.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Whatsoever is grounded upon the generall command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and rules of the Scriptures, that same is perpetual: But the governing of the Church by the Eldership, is such, as hath partly been proved in election and ordination, and execution of the severall Church officers, which is the greatest part of government, and shall further appear, in the censures of the Church hereafter: Therefore the government of the Church by the Eldership, is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Whatsoever manner of government hath sufficient power, and that from God, to begin, continue, and strengthen, both the governors of the Church in their callings, and the people in the course of obedience unto Christ; that same government is to be perpetuall: But such is the government by the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as appeareth by this, that the Apostles used no other:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34885:29"/>
Therefore the Eldership is to be perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That government which the 12 Apostles, and <hi>Paul</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they consulted together, did uniformly ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e in, that same must needs be of God, and consequently perpetuall, unlesse the repealing of it do appear: but such is the government by the Eldership, (for all the adversaries thereunto, confesse that it was in the Apostles time:) Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Whatsoever hath the same grounds, that the preaching of the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and ministration of the Sacraments have, the same is perpetuall: But such is the government of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, for it is grounded upon the commandments of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and practise of the Apostles: Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That which hath the like grounds to be perpetuall, that the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, had to be for a time, the same is perpetuall: But such is the government of the Church by an Eldership, which appeareth by this, that they are therefore ceased, because their gifts of immediate calling, &amp;c. be gone, and the gifts of these, joyntly and severally do remain: Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Whatsoever is the perpetuall and ordinarie remedie to cure diseases of the Church, and strengthen the health of the same, that same is perpetuall: But such is the government by the Eldership, as appeareth by the necessitie, and profit of the severall offices thereof, and of this, that we are still to observe in causes of extremities: <hi>Tell the Church, Matth.</hi> 18.17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That government which was in the Church appointed of God under the Law, and continued (in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) by Christ and his Apostles, and bettered (in respect of the accedents) by them, that same is perpetuall: But such is the government by the Eldership, as appeareth in the 12. reason of the 1 chap. Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="12">12 If there be any reason why this government should be alterable (being once set in the Church by Christ) it is either in respect of the extraordinarie offices ceased, or the addition of the Magistrate: But not of the former, because the Church hath never had any need of extraordinary gifts, but God hath given them, and so will he ever: nor of the latter, for that the Magistrates office is to defend the building of the Church by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34885:30"/>
that order which Christ hath set downe, and not to alter any thing therein: Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Either this government is the best and perpetuall, or els there is none, and so Christ should be thought to have left his Church without a government, which is disproved in the 7 and 8 reasons in the first chap. for this was once established by Christ, and so was no other: But some government must needs be the best and perpetuall: Therefore this is perpetuall.</p>

to the rules of Gods revealed will, and not by that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and monstrous Cannon Law, which is made manifest unto us by these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All governours are to execute their authoritie, by the same warrant from which they have it: But the governours of the Church of God, have their warrant to be gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The Church is to be governed by that which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may teach unto the same, for they are taught to the end that they may obey, and so be governed by the same: But the Ministers may teach nothing but the Word of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Therefore the Church is to be governed onely by the word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which maketh the Church obedient unto Christ, must be the direction whereby it is to be governed: Onely the Word of God maketh the Church obedient unto Christ: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be governed by the rules of Gods Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every kingdome or houshold, must be governed onely by the Lawes of the King, or orders of the housholder: The church is the kingdome and house of God, and his Word is the onely Law that he hath given for the same: Therefore it must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned onely by the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That which was ordained to destroy the church of God, cannot be a good rule to governe the same by: But such is the cannon law, for it was ordained to strengthen the kingdome of Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="6">6.

            <p>THe office of the Church-government, is meere Ecclesiasticall, and therefore the Governours of the Church may not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but onely in Church-matters; as for example, vocation, and abdication, deciding of controversies, in doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, so far as appertaineth to conscience, and the Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <hi>T.C. book</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 206. <hi>Discip. Eccle.</hi> 126. but they thinke that Church-governours, may also meddle in civill causes: <hi>Whitegift pag.</hi> 749. and their practice, that take upon them to be Councellers of state, to judge civilly, as punish with impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, &amp;c. But this is disproved, and so the former proved by these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which our Saviour Christ refused, because it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not unto him, ruling and teaching the Church, that same is not lawfull for any Ecclesiast. person to doe: But Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to divide the inheritance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. onely because he came to build a spirituall kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for otherwise he being God, had authoritie over all things: Therefore it is not lawfull for Ecclesiasticall persons to be Judges of civill causes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which was forbidden the Apostles, is unlawfull for every Ecclesiasticall Officer, for they were the chiefe under Christ, and had (after a sort) all offices in themselves, untill they could plant them in others: But such dominion was forbidden them, as the Kings of the nations, and other civill Magistrates have, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28 which is, to rule civilly: Therefore they may not exercise any civill authoritie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If necessary duties are to be left, rather than our duties to the Church should not be thorowly discharged, then may not a Church Officer deale in civill jurisdiction, which is lesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto him: But the former is true, as appeareth by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34885:33"/>
words of Christ, to him that would have buried his father, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.59.60. Therefore they may not exercise any civill au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If he that hath an office must attend upon it, then may he not meddle in another, for he cannot attend them both at once: But the former is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. Therefore may no Church-officer, meddle with temporall jurisdiction.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As the Souldier is in his warfare, so are Church officers, in the ruling of Gods Church: But the Souldier entangleth not himself in the things of this life, because they are of another nature to his warfare; which place <hi>Cyprian</hi> alledgeth against a Minister, that became an Executor to his friends Will: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Church-officers may not meddle with Civill-officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of another nature, then his calling.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Those things that in themselves are of contrarie qualitie, cannot concur in one subject: But the governments of the Church and common-wealth be such, not onely in this, that they are the next speciall members of one generall, but also, in that the one is spirituall, and the other temporall, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the soul, and the other the body. Therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in one man together, and consequently, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7 If the government of the Church, both in every particular mans office, and in the generall Eldership, be a matter of great weight, and the ability of man, very small in every good action, then may not a Church-officer meddle in another calling, whereby he is made lesse able to discharge his dutie: But the former is true, as all men may see, that look into the Word of God, what is required of such men, and know by the same Word, the manifold infirmities and untowardnesse of man: Therefore the latter must needs be true also.</p>
            <p n="8">8 If the Apostles (who were the most able of all others) found themselves unfit for two offices, which were both Ecclesiastical; then is the best Church-governour unfit for two, which be of more difference one from another, as be the government of the Church and commonwealth: But the former is true, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. Therefore the latter must needs be true also.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That which we justly reprove in the Papists, must needs (if we do like) be found more unlawfull and intolerable in our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34885:33"/>
selves: But we justly reprove the Papists, for having in their hands both the swords, that is, the Ecclesiasticall and civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: Therefore it is more intolerable being found in any of us.</p>
            <p n="10">10 If it be lawfull for an Ecclesiasticall person, to exercise the office of the civill Magistrate, then (on the contrary) it is lawfull for the civill Magistrate, to exercise the offices of Ecclesiasticall persons, for there is as good reason for the one, as the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the latter is unlawfull; for who would like of any L. Major, to step into the Pulpit and preach, &amp;c. Therefore the first is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull also.</p>
            <p n="11">11 They may not intangle themselves with worldly offices,<note place="margin">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34885:34"/>
but the latter part is to be cleared by some moe reasons, because the Bb. do displace the best Ministers at their pleasure, which is proved to be a most wicked action, by these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Those that are called unto the Ministery by the Lord from heaven, and outwardly by the means of men, so long as they are blamelesse in doctrine and conversation 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. cannot be displaced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without hainous wickednesse against the manifest wil of God: But such are the Ministers that the Bb. do daily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, as they confesse themselves, when (even) in their sermons they justifie their doctrine, in saying that they differ onely in outward rites; and as their greatest enemies will say, when they are asked of such mens lives: Therefore they cannot be displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without great wickednesse.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Those that are carefull to discharge the dutie of Gods Ministers, both in teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giving example to their flocks, cannot be displaced without great impietie: Such are these Ministers, that are daily displaced, as appeareth by this, that they preach more diligently then any other, and that they follow not the course of the world, in adding living unto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but many of them (being as worthy for their gifts, as the worthiest) live poorely, rather then they will want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good conscience: Therefore they cannot be put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence without great sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To deprive Gods people of their spirituall comfort, is a grievous and horrible wickednesse: To put such to silence as are before mentioned, is to deprive Gods people of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall comfort: which if any man will denie, all the godly where such a one dwelleth, shall tell him he lieth: Therefore to displace such Ministers, is a hainous and horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That which giveth occasion to the weake to stumble and fall away from the Gospel, is a hainous and horrible sin: But such is the displacing of those Ministers, as appeareth by this, that many doubt whether that which he hath taught be true, whom the professors of the Gospel do display, and by this, that many who had made good beginnings, by the discontinuance of their teachers, do fall away: Therefore to displace those Ministers, is a hainous and horrible sin.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:34885:35"/>5 Those whose labours God doth blesse, cannot be displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without fighting against God, and consequently great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie: But such are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se Ministers that the Bb. do daily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, as all that love the Gospel in every countrey can witnes: Therefore to displace them is great impiety.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That action which giveth the common enemy just cause to rejoyce, and hope to get the victory, is a hainous and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offence: But such is the displacing of those Ministers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in every countrey, where such Ministers are displaced, and such enemies do dwell: Therefore to displace such, is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and horrible offence.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That action that causeth the doers thereof to be esteemed enemies to the Gospel, must needs be a hainous sin: But such is the putting of those Ministers to silence, for it maketh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have any love to Religion, think that they are not of God in so doing, for, say they, he that loveth Christ, cannot crosse the course of the Gospel as these men do: therefore the displacing of them is a hainous sin.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That which letteth in more wickednesse at once, then the diligent preaching of the Word could drive out in divers yeers, must needs be a hainous sin: but such is the displacing of these Ministers: for, prophaning of the Sabbath, and all disorder, cometh into a congregation the same day that such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that hath long laboured against it is displaced, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in such places proveth: therefore to displace such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters is a hainous sin.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That which interrupteth the course of the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant either from Gods Word, or the Laws of the land, is a hainous and horrible sin: Such is the displacing of those Ministers, as is proved in all the writings on our side; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the answer to D. <hi>Bridges:</hi> therefore to displace such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, is a hainous and horrible sin.</p>

            <p>THe Eldership is to admonish every one, by whom offence appeareth unto them to grow in the Church: There is no question between us, about admonition it self, but this they deny, that the execution of any discipline (and therefore of this point) belongeth unto the Eldership; which point is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the severall Chapters going before: so that I need not say any thing of this, saving with (a reason or twain) to shew the necessitie and benefit of it in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That which private men offended, are commanded to seek unto for the redresse of the offender, is a necessarie, and an ordinarie way for the amendment of them that do offend in the Church of God: But such is the admonition of those that are in authoritie, and carry the name of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. see chap. 14. and the 1. proposition of the same: Therefore admonition in such cases by the Eldership, is a necessarie and ordinarie way, for their amendment that do offend.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That which is more available to bring the offender to repentance, than private admonition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by one, or moe, that same is very profitable and necessarie in the Church of God: But such is the publike admonition by the governours of the Church, as appeareth by this, that Christ maketh it a remedie, when the other two will not prevail, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. Therefore it is verie profitable and necessarie in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That which maketh men more afraid to offend, then an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> admonition that private men can give, is profitable and necessarie in the Church of God: But such is the Eldership,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34885:36"/>
before whom men know they shall be brought if they do not amend: Therefore it is very profitable and necessarie in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That which hath a greater promise to do good, then private admonition, is very necessarie in the Church of God: But such is the admonition that is given by the Eldership, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it prevaileth when the former doth not: Therefore it is profitable in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That without which, all duties of charity cannot be exercised towards sinners, is needfull to be in the Church of God: But without admonition by the Eldership, all duties of charitie cannot be exercised towards sinners: Therefore it is needfull to be in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That which would bridle the outragious sins of some, and keep in the derision and mockerie, that private admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do receive, is needfull to be in the Church of God: But this would admonition by the Eldership do; for if men knew that they should answer unto the Church for their ill dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>Therefore seeing publike admonition before the Eldership is to be sought, by those that are offended, and cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; seeing it is more available then private admonition; seeing it maketh men more afraid to offend; seeing it hath a greater promise; seeing without it all duties of charitie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exercised towards the sinner; lastly seeing it would bridle the outragious sins of many; therefore it must needs follow, that it is very profitable, and necessarie to be in the Church of God.</p>

            <p>THose that be not reclaimed from their faults by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are by the Eldership to be suspended from the Lords Supper, or being officers of the Church, from the execution of their office, untill they do either give good testimonie of their amendment, or just cause to be further proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

against. Neither is there any controversie betwixt them and us, about this point; saving that (as in the former) they will denie it to appertain to the Eldership, which is proved before. I will therefore (for their understanding that desire direction in the truth) first, shew that it is a course that hath warrant in the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; secondly, that it is of very profitable use in the Church of God: the first is thus proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whatsoever is enjoyned, as a dutie to be done by every Christian, if he leave it undone,<note place="margin">Suspention warranted by the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon such grounds as the Word setteth down.</note> he is to be compelled by the governours of the Church to do it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17.23. But if a mans brother have any thing against him, and he make no conscience to leave his gift there, and be first reconciled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. he is to be compelled to do it: Therefore separation from the Lords Supper is warra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted by the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If that commandment of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7 5. give not that which is holy unto dogs, can neither be properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of them, that were never of the Church, nor them that be excommunicated; then it is a warrant for such separation of the unworthy, and consequently, that separation is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in the word: But the former is true, as appeareth by this, that the meanest of the Jews did know, that holy things belonged to neither of them, and so the commandment had been needlesse: Therefore suspention is warranted by the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If there be sinners that are not to be excommunicated, and yet it were offensive to give them the Lords Supper, then is this course warranted by the Word, for else should Christ have left his Church destitute of direction, in common and usuall difficulties, which is proved in the first chapter to be otherwise: But such s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ners there are as the notorious sinner repenting; men mainly suspected of notorious transgressions, &amp;c. Therefore suspention hath his warrant in the word.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The course that God prescribed in the shadow, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall purifyings, must in the body (in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) be observed in the spirituall clensing of every member of the Church: But many were separated from the publike sacrifices for a season, by reason of their corporall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who, yet were not worthy to be excommunicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:34885:37"/>
Therefore must also some be kept from the Lords Supper for a season, who yet appeare not so hainously to have sinned, as to deserve excommunication.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Church cannot without great offence, suffer one that hath fallen into some open sinne, or that is vehemently s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>spected, to have hainously offended, continue in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of any publike function: But the Church cannot justly displace such a man at the first, making shew of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or standing upon his purgation: Therefore he must be separated for a time.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That which was commanded under the Law to be done to the Priest, that was uncleane in body, or suspected to be a Leaper; that same must much more under the Gospell, be done unto the Minister, or other Church-Officer, that hath sinned, or is suspected to have committed a great sinne. But such a Priest was to be separated from offering of sacrifices for a certaine time: Therefore much more must the like be done to a Church-officer in the like case.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>Therefore, if the Church be to compell a private man to doe his dutie; if, give not holy things to dogges, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of them within the Church; if there be sinners that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without offence be admitted to the Lords Supper, and yet deserve not excommunication; if for corporall uncleannesse under the Law, they were to abstaine a certaine time; and if the church cannot without great offence, suffer him that hath committed an open sinne (though he repent) or that is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently suspected of a notorious sinne, continue in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his office, untill the congregation be satisfied; Lastly, if the Priest that was uncleane, or suspected of leprosie, might not offer sacrifices: then is it plaine, that both the separation of some men from the Lords Supper, and other from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their publique function for a time; is a thing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word of God.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That which keepeth the godly in more carefull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and keepeth in the hypocrites, that they breake not out, is very profitable for the Church of God: But such is the use

of the separation from the Lords Supper, and from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting publike function in the Church: Therefore it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which removeth (even) the appearance of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, from the Church of God, is very profitable for the same: But such is the separation: Therefore it is profitable for the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which declareth unto the world, that the Church of God is carefull to practice that which it professeth, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable: But such is this separation, for it sheweth that they cannot away with ungodly life; no, not among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Therefore it is profitable for the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which giveth occasion to the church, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the actions of Religion, with more sound comfort, is profitable for the same: But such is this separation, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one shall see thereby, the unworthy (for whose sakes, God might be angry with them all, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.11.) weeded from among them: Therefore it is profitable for the Church of God.</p>

            <p>Therefore, if separation of the knowne or suspected sinner,<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> from the Lords Supper, and such a Church officer from the execution of his publike function, doe keepe men in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that be godly, and restraineth hypocrites from outrage; if it remove the very appearance of evill; if it let the world see, that the Church laboureth to practice that which it doth professe; if it make every member of the Church to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the actions of Religion, with greater comfort; lastly, if it be a speciall mean to procure the Lord in mercy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Word; then must it needs follow, that it is of very profitable use unto the Church of God.</p>

            <p>WHen neither admonition, nor suspention will serve to reclaim the offender, but that it doth appeare, that he abideth in impenitency, and is incorrigible, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership, after mature deliberation, and commending of the party unto the prayers of the Church (he yet remaining ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate) is to proceed to excommunication: which containeth these propositions in question betwixt us and the Bb.</p>
