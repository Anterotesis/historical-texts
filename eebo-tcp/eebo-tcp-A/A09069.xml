            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please your Grace to understand, that wheras at the first by a frind of mine, and after by mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I perceived, that the booke insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was willingly read by divers, for the persuasion that it hath to godlines of life, which notwithstanding in manie points was corruptly set down: I thought good in the end, to get the same published againe in some better manner than now it is come foorth among them; that so the good, that the reading therof might otherwise do, might carrie no hurt or danger withal, so far as by me might be praevented. For this cause I have taken the pains, both to purge it of certain points that carried either some manifest error, or else some other inconvenience with them: and to join another short Treatise withal, to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ort those that are not yet persuaded, to join with us likewise in the truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="tcp:6188:3"/>
For so to accept of our adversaries la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors so much as is good, may I trust bring to passe with some few of them, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wil better perceive, that wherin they shal do wel, they may looke to be as readily incouraged by us, as, when they do il, to be admonished, or reprehended either, as the case doth require: and others likewise of their welwillers (yet notwithstanding in this varie from them, that they stand more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the cause of religion, and mean not otherwise to persist in their opinions, but so far as they think they have reason for them) may so be the rather induced to assure them selves (as the truth indeed is) that wherin they have sufficient warrant for the points that they stand on, they are not in any wise misliked by us, but onlie for those, wherin they have no sufficient groundwork to bear them out. I was also very glad, both that some of them had taken pains in that kind of labor: and that others of their profession were somtimes occupied in reading of such. For wheras by their bookes that are of the Controversies, the readers of them that are before smitted with that kind of infestion, are oft times therby the more intangled in their errors, and more kindled likewise with inordinate heat, against al those that more sincerely hold the Christian faith: by this kind of labor it may fal out, that comming
<pb facs="tcp:6188:3"/>
therby to the fear of God, though but after a corrupter maner, yet therin may they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly finde a readie way, first to draw them somwhat on, to a better advisement of their wais; and then after that, to espie their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errors likewise, and to join with us in the truth of religion. In which course the better to help them, I have added this other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise withal; so to bring before their eies, how the case for that matter doth stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and how little cause there is for them so much to be afraid of our profession, as some have born them in hand that they ought: trusting withal, that as they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready agree with us in many points of great importance; so they can be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend unto us in the rest likewise, if it may appeer unto them, that in so doing they shal do none otherwise, than as of conscience, and dutie they ought.</p>
                  <p>Both which bookes when I thought to have praesented unto your Grace, I was for a time staied by this, for that I thought them not a praesent woorthie inough, in respect of my labors therin. But when I did more deeply consider, that I might very wel hope of better acceptance, than the strict woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the thing should deserve, I was then fully resolved to be so bold as to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent your G. with them such as they be: and, for whatsoever wanteth, either in them, or
<pb facs="tcp:6188:4"/>
me, to rest in the good assurance that I have, that your G. wil notwithstanding of your own inclination in good part take them. As also I take it, that I am by good reason indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced so to do, both for that the dignitie of your place in the church of God among us, and mine own special dutie besides, doth of right require it, and much more than it, if mine abilitie might accordingly serve: and the nature of the matter in one principal point is such, as that by a certain kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie it leadeth me therunto. For wheras it may be the persuasion of some, that no such work as is at the first so corrupt in it selfe, should be brought foorth to light by any of us, though never so warily we purged it before (wherin notwithstanding there be many good reasons to ground upon, for those that are otherwise minded:) hence is it, that your Graces censure, especially heer in these parts, is of me and others of the same jurisdiction, especially to be regarded, for the place that God hath given you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. In which kind of labor, as <hi>Castalion</hi> first, then also Maister <hi>Rogers</hi> have done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel, in that little booke of <hi>Kempicius,</hi> that is called The Imitation of Christ, leaving out the corruption of it, and taking onlie that which was sound: so hath <hi>Iohn Baptist Fikler</hi> been very bold in wresting that which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had written so wel, of the power of the
<pb facs="tcp:6188:4"/>
magistrate over his subjects, and the dutie of subjects to him again, altogither to the establishing of the Popes supremacie, and to animate their own confoederates against their godlie and lawful princes; changing nothing else (to speak of) but those very ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and otherwise using the others matter, method, and stile. Nevertheles, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these examples shew us, how such things may rightly be used: so the other likewise may admonish those that would mislike to have their oversights so holpen, that they had need as much to go about to excuse their own fellows, as to impugn any others therfore, that use their freedom more moderately. As for my selfe, having used my libertie so easily as I have done, altering no more than need required, and doing the same in quiet maner, without any greefe against the Author whosoever it were; or disgrace to his doings (so much as might be, not betraieng the truth:) I am the lesse careful (under the protection of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces censure) either of the censure, or assalts of others, that are more led by affection than reason. To be short, wheras the former of these two bookes calleth men from the love of the world; and the latter likewise, doth cal men from their woonted errors unto the truth: in both these respects, I thought your G. would so much the rather
<pb facs="tcp:6188:5"/>
accept of them. For having had so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the world as you have, very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood teacheth, that needs you must grow more and more from the love therof: and it is sufficiently known unto al, that having found this mercie your selfe, to be delivered from the former ignorance, &amp; to be brought to the knowledge of the truth, you have in like sort (in this long course that God hath given you) much called on others to do the like. These bookes therfore that treat of the same, I thought should be the rather wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And I beseech almightie God, the fountain and giver of al good things, to give you grace so to consider of the one, and to go on forward in the other, as that more and more departing from the love of the world, and more and more performing the work of the ministerie, you bring the former at length to nothing, and make the other a pollished work for the day of the Lord.</p>

                     </note> had before written a booke of much like argument in the Italian toong: which a countrie-man of ours at Paris in France had about four yeers since translated into English; and had done (as he thought) much good therby. Wherupon the Author heerof minding to have imprinted that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to have inriched it, both with matter, and method: he found the course that he determined, to have this issu in the end, that he thought not good to imprint again that booke of Doctor <hi>Loarts,</hi> but rather to make another of his own, and to gather in therunto, whatsoever is in that booke, or others such like, to this effect. Which course when he had taken, he thought
<pb facs="tcp:6188:6"/>
good to follow this order therin: first to shew, how to resolve our selves to serve God indeed; then, how to begin to do it; and lastly, how to continu unto the end.

                     </note> until he shal be able to finish the rest. His intent and purpose was, as himselfe doth witnes, that his countrie-men might have some one sufficient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for matters of life, among so many bookes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies: for that those (though otherwise he account them needful) do help but little, he saith, oft times to good life; but rather fil the heads of men with a spirit of contradiction &amp; contention, that for the most part hindereth devotion. Insomuch that he much misliketh, that men commonly spend so much of their time so unprofitably, talking of faith, but not seeking to build theron as they ought to do, and so do but wearie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in vain: making much ado, but getting but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit therby; much disquieting our selves and others, and yet obtaining but smal reward. Which complaint of his is just indeed, as the matter is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by many. And so having protested his good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therin, desireth al, though they dissent from him in religion: yet, laieng aside hatred, malice, and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contention, to join togither in amendement of life, and in praieng one for another.

                     </note> Concerning the booke it selfe it seemeth to be most of al gathered out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Schoole-men (as they are termed) that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the corrupter time of the church, did most of al by that occasion treat of reformation of life; when as others were rather occupied about the controversies, that were most in quaestion among them. And although my selfe have bestowed no great time in them: yet by the little that I have bestowed, I see it to resemble
<pb facs="tcp:6188:6"/>
them so much (especially for the invention of it) that as we finde somtimes a readie help in the face of the childe, to gesse at the father; so in this likewise, me think that we have in the booke it selfe, that which may lead us to this conjecture. But my meaning at this time is no more but this, first to shew thee what it was as it is set foorth by the Author himselfe: and then what is done therunto by me, that so I might get it published to al.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it came foorth at the first.</hi>
                     </note> As it is set foorth by the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if we consider the substance of it, surely it was wel woorth the labor (a few points only excepted) and much of it, of good persuasion to godlines of life. But if we consider the form, or maner of it, therin maiest thou finde, that it was needful for me, before hand to admonish thee of these few things. First, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole booke the Author hath used, in those scriptures that he alledgeth, the vulgar translation that was before in common use with them: and some special words praecisely, such as before they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them to observe, and therin stil to discent from us. The vulgar translation is known wel inough: so that I need to say nothing of it. Those special words that praecisely he useth, are, Our Lord, when it is more agreeable to the text to say, The Lord: iustice, for righteousnes: poenance, for repentance: merit, for good works, or the service of God: and a few others. Then also in divers parts of the booke there were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in withal, certain opinions and doctrines of their own profession, most of them such as are manifest corruptions, and some of them no more but over-ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous: and certain places alledged out of others, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle appertaining to the matter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What is don to it since. First in the substance which is approoved.</hi>
                     </note> or else more coldly handling the matters propounded, than that wel they could match with the residu that are in the Treatise to that purpose alledged. In this maner came it into my hands: and so it is yet extant among them. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my doings therin, first for the substance of it,
<pb facs="tcp:6188:7"/>
bicause it is, much of it, good, I have so far not only conceived liking of it my selfe: but also have done my best indevor, thus to publish it unto al; that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as wil, may take to themselves the benefit of it. In which kind of argument though many others in these our dais have done very commendably likewise? Yet I do specially commend this unto thee, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that it proceedeth from those, that otherwise are for divers points, the greatest adversaries that we have in the cause of religion. And wheras inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate contention is not only unseemly for the church of God, but also hurtful to the cause of religion, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial point of wisdome it is, when God hath bestowed any good gift on any of us al, that others should so aesteem therof, as that they make the same a mean to moderate the bitternes of their affections towards al those, that gladly would live peaceably with al, so much as they might: as also on the other side it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleer, that those that wil not (so far as the cause of religion it selfe doth permit them) may have just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be ashamed; and therby to finde out, what kind of spirit it is that doth lead them. So the substance of the booke is such, as that a minde that is wel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, may with one, and the selfesame labor, gather out of it, both lessons of godlines unto it selfe: and that which may somwhat occasion some better agreement among certain of us; with such of them I mean, as stand more indifferent, and are content to dissent no further from us, than of conscience they think that they ought. The former of which wil yeeld us this fruit, that we shal addresse our selves to do, in som good measure, our service to God: the other, that we shal do it with a quieter conscience,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Then in the form or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, which is amended.</hi>
                     </note> our selves desirous to be at peace withal, so far as conveniently may be obteined. On the other side likewise, bicause I found the maner and form so far foorth out of order as I have declared, therfore did I indevor my selfe to help it a little as
<pb facs="tcp:6188:7"/>
need required. But as touching the transsation that they use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have altogither let them alone therwith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly to condescend so far unto them, as to suffer themselves in such case to use what translation they wil, and with good wil to hear them therin; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that divers points of the matter were so groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therupon, that the translation might not be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unlesse the matter were altered likewise. So far foorth therfore as there was no manifest error taken in withal, I have left it wholy unto them: though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it might oft times be amended. For which cause also I did the rather omit to meddle with the quotations to alledge the verse of the chapter withal, bicause that in distinguishing of the verses we disagree somtimes: and forbearing to obtrude ours to them, unlesse I thought they would take it in good part; have forborn likewise to use theirs, for that we finde it not so agreeable to the truth it selfe. As for those special words of theirs, that the Author so praecisely useth, I have used my libertie therin: somtimes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them stand as they are; and somtimes altering them, when they were abused, or otherwise the case did so require. Those other points of their proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, wherin we dissent from them, and they (no dowt) from the truth it selfe, I have clean left out; and some of those venturous points besides: togither with certain of those places likewise, which he hath alledged out of others, that did not so much apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the matter that he had in hand; or not so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually touched the same, as himselfe otherwise hath done. The former of which I therfore left out, for that neither my selfe could allow to leave any such as (to my knowledge) might be any hurt; or else but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stumbling to others: neither could I so have gotten it foorth to the use of al, carrieng stil such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with it. And this have I done so much the rather, for that most of those things seem rather to be
<pb facs="tcp:6188:8"/>
added by some that had the perusing of the booke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might be allowed among them to come to the print, than by the proper Author therof: they do so little oft times agree with the argument that there he hath in hand, nor with the maner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. As for example, in the first part of the booke and third chapter, setting down the end of mans life, which he saith is the service of God, eight or nine times in that chapter is joined withal the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of heaven: which notwithstanding is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the maner of the Authors handling of that point, as it may appeer in the whole discourse there, and namely by his place of Zacharie in the beginning of the third, and by his division in the beginning of the fourth chapter, where notwithstanding the gaining of heaven is very odly put in again. The other sort like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I thought good to leave foorth, for that being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, they might discredit some part of the rest, or else but weaker than the rest, might so let down the affections again which were stirred up before by the other. And truly the spirit in these dais doth proceed a great deal more effectually, both in doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, than it did in the dais of divers of those that were heer alledged. Wherin, if there shal be any that shal think, either on the one side, that I have put out too much, or on the other, that I have put out too little, neither am I desirous to overrule their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor very careful to maintain mine own, if any shal come with better matter: contenting my selfe only with this, that I have done what seemed to me to be most expedient to the glorie of God, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his people heer. And so without any further defence of my doings therin, now (gentle Reader) I send thee over to the booke it selfe: where if thou shalt bestow a little pains (though it be no more, but once with advisement to read it over) I dowt not, but that thou wilt confesse thy labor to be wel bestowed. Which
<pb facs="tcp:6188:8"/>
when thou shalt finde, then descending to the Author of it, seeing himselfe desireth to be holpen by thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thou shalt do wel, both to thank God for him for this which is done, and to solicite him with thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, on behalfe of him and the rest, that it would please him to give them a further knowledge of the truth in Christ, so far as his wisdome hath thought expedient, to the setting foorth of his own glorie, and to the salvation of those that are his. And God give us al (so many as do appertain to his kingdome) his grace in that measure, that both we may agree togither in the truth of religion, and altogither imploy our selves in his service heer, in peace and quietnes one with another. And so I bid thee hartily farewel. At Bolton-Percy, in the ancientie or liberties of York, the 9. of Iulie. 1584.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE prophet Ieremie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long complaint of the miseries of his time, fallen upon the Iewes by reason of their sins, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the cause thereof in these words: <hi>Al the earth is fallen into utter desolation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iere. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>for that there is no man which considereth deeply in his hart.</hi> Signifieng hereby, that if the Iewes would haue entered into deepe and earnest consideration of their liues and estate, before that great desolation fel vpon them, they might haue escaped the same, as the Niniuites did by the fore-warning of Ionas:<note place="margin">Ionas. 3.</note> albeit the sword was now drawen, and the hand of God stretched out, within fortie daies to destroy them. So important a thing is this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In figure wherof, al beasts in old time, which did not ruminate, or chew their cud, were accounted vnclean by the law of Moises:<note place="margin">Leu. 11. Deut. 14.</note> as no dowt, but that soule in the sight of God must needs be, which resolveth not in hart, nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6188:16"/>
cheweth in often meditation of minde, the things required at hir hands in this life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For, of want of this consideration, and du meditation, all the foul errors of the world are committed, and many thousand Christians do find themselves within the verie gates of hel, before they mistrust any such matter towards them: being caried thorough the vale of this life blindfolded with the veile of negligence and inconsideration, as beasts to the slawghter hows, and never suffered to see their own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, vntil it be too late to remedie the same.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For this cause the holy scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend vnto us most carefully, this exercise of meditation, and diligent consideration of our duties, to deliver us thereby from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, which inconsideration leadeth us unto.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Moises hauing delivered to the people his embassage from God, touching al particulars of the law, addeth this clause also from God, as most necessarie: <hi>These words must remain in thy hart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>thou shalt meditate vpon them, both at home, and abroad, when thou goest to bed, and when thou risest again in the morning.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 11.</note> And again, in another place: <hi>Teach your children these things, that they may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in their harts upon them.</hi> The like comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was given by God himselfe,<note place="margin">Iosu. 1.</note> to Iosua at his first election to govern the people: to wit, that he should meditate vpon the law of Moises both day &amp; night, to the end, he might keepe and perform the things written therein.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6188:16"/>
And God addeth presently the commoditie he should reap thereof. <hi>For then</hi> (saith he) <hi>shalt thou direct thy way aright, and shalt vnderstand the same.</hi> Signifieng, that without this meditation a man goeth both amisse and also blindly, not knowing himselfe whither.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Saint Paul having described vnto his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Timothie, the perfect dutie of a Prelate, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this advertisement in the end: <hi>Haec medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare.

                        <note place="margin">1.

Pro. 15. Eccl. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>He wil meditate upon the law of God, both day and night.</hi> And for examples in the scripture, how good men did use to meditate in times past, I might here reckon vp great store, as that of Isaac,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> who went foorth into the feelds towards night to meditate: also that of Ezechias the king, who (as the scripture saith) did <note place="margin">Esai. 38.</note> meditate like a dove that is, in silence, with his hart only,<note place="margin">Or moorn: for it was in the way of sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</note> without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> noise of words. But above al other, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holie David is singular, herein, who eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where almost, maketh mention of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exercise in meditation, saieng to God: <hi>I did meditate upon thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements which I loved.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> And again:<note place="margin">Psal. 62. Psal. 118.</note> 
                        <hi>I wil meditate vpon thee in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi> And again: <hi>O Lord how have I loved thy law? It is my meditation al the day long.</hi> And with what fervour and vehemencie he used to make these
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6188:17"/>
his meditations, he sheweth when he saith of himselfe:<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> 
                        <hi>My hart did wax hot within me, and fire did kindle in my meditations.</hi>

How many of vs do passe over whole dais, and months without ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into these meditations? Nay, God grant there be not many Christians in the world, which know not what these meditations do mean. We beleeve in grosse the mysteries of our Christian faith,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="8">8 What man in the world would adventure so easily vpon sin (as commonly men do,<note place="margin">

Which albeit everie Christian in summe doth beleeve: yet bicause the most part do never consider them with du circumstances in their harts: therefore they are not moved with the same, but do beare the knowledge thereof locked vp in their breasts, without any sense or feeling: even as a man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth fire about him in a flint stone without heat; or perfumes in a pommander without smel, except the one be beaten, and the other be chafed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 And now to come nere our matter, which we mean to handle in this booke) what man living would not resolve himselfe thorowly to serve God in deed, and to leave al vanities of the world, if he did consider as he should do,

the waightie reasons he hath to moove him thereunto: the reward he shal receive for it; and his infinite danger if he do it not? But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as I have said (scarce one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand doth enter into these considerations, or if he do, it is with lesse attention, or continuance, than so great a matter requireth, herof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that so many men perish daily, and so few are saved: for that, by lack of consideration, they neuer resolve themselves to live as they should do, and as the vocation of a Christian man requireth. So that we may also complain with holie Ieremie, alledged in the beginning, that our earth also of Christianitie,<note place="margin">Iere. 12.</note> is brought to desolation, for that men do not deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in their harts.</p>

And without this consideration, shee runneth on blindly into a thousand brakes and briers, stumbling at every step, into some one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or other, and continually in peril of some great &amp; deadlie mischief. And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful matter to think, that in other busines
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6188:18"/>
of this life, men both see and confesse, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be either begun, prosecuted, or wel ended, without consideration: and yet in this great busines of the kingdome of heaven, no man almost vseth or thinketh the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</p>

And thinkest thou (my deer brother) to passe from earth to heaven, and that, by so manie hils, and dales, and dangerous places, never passed by thee before, and this without any consideration at al? Thou art deceived if thou thinkest so, for this journey hath far more need of consideration, than that, being much more subject to bypaths and dangers: every plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this world; every lust; every dissolute thought; every alluring sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tempting sound; every divel vpon the earth, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his (which are infinite) being a theefe, and lieng in wait to spoil thee, and to destroy thee vpon this way towards heaven.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Wherfore I would give counsel to every wise passenger, to looke wel about him, and at least wise once a day, to enter into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his estate, and of the estate of his treasure

                        </note>2 First therfore it is to be understood, that the whole service which God requireth at a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6188:25"/>
Christian mans hands in this life, consisteth in two things: the one, to fly evil; &amp; the other to do good. And albeit these two things were required of us also before the coming of Christ (as appeareth by Dauid whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is general; <hi>Decline from evil, and do good:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> and by Esay the prophet whose words are; <hi>Leave to do perversly, and learn to do wel.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note>) Yet much more particularly, and with far greater reason are they demaunded at the hands of Christian people, who by the death and passion of their Redeemer, do receave grace and force to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in some measure to perform these two things, which the law did not give, albeit it commanded the same.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But now we being redeemed by Christ, &amp; receaving from him not only the renewing of the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> for the performance of these two things, but also force and abilitie by his grace wherby we are made somwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do the same: we remain more bound therto in reason and dutie than before, for that this was the fruit and effect of Christ his holy passion as Saint Peter saith, <hi>That we being dead to sin, should live vnto righteousnes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> Or as Saint Paul more plainly declareth the same when he saith,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note>

Phil. 1. Heb. 10. and 12. Matt. 9.10.20. Luk. 10. 1. Tim. 5. Psa. 125. Mat. 13.</note> &amp; our life a warfare upon the earth: for that as soldiers do alwais lie in wait to resist their enimies: so ought we to resist sin and the temptations therof. And in respect of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we are called labourers, stewards, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the like, for that as these men attend diligently to their gain and increase of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this life, so should we to good works, to the glorie of God, and benefit of others here in this life.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 These therfore are two special points which a Christian man should meditate upon; two special exercises wherin he shuld be occupied: two special legs wherupon he must walk in the service of God: and finally two wings wherby he must flie and mount up unto a Christian life. And whosoever wanteth either of these, though he had the other: yet can he not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to any tru godlines, no more than a bird can fly lacking one of hir wings. I say, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocencie is sufficient without good works: nor good works any thing available, where innocencie from sin is not. The later is evident by the people of Israel, whose sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, oblations, praiers, and other good works commended and commanded by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, were oftentimes abhominable to God: for that the dooers thereof lived in sin and

wickednes, as at large the prophet Esay decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?<note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note> The former also is made apparant by the parable of the foolish virgins, who,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> albeit they were innocent from sin, yet bicause they gave not attendance, they were shut out of the doores.<note place="margin">Luc. 13.

                     <p n="8">8 It is a woonderful matter to consider, and able to make a man astonied to think, what great care, fear, diligence, and labor, good men in old times did take about this matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting sin, and how litle we take now.

diligence, &amp; attention, as he could pronounce of himselfe,<note place="margin">1.

Which charitable deeds (and a thousand mo both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publik; secret and open, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not report) came out of the purses of our good ancesters: who oftentimes not only gave of their abundance, but also saved from their own mouths, and bestowed it upon deeds of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the glorie of God; and benefit of others.

                     <p n="12">12 If God did exhort us to good deeds for his own commoditie, or for any gain that he is to take therby: yet in reason we ought to pleasure him therin, seing we have receaved al from his only liberalitie before. But seing he asketh it at our hands for no need of his own, but only for our gain, &amp; to pay us home again with advantage: it is more reason we should harken unto him. If a common honest man upon earth should invite us to do a thing, promising us of his honestie a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we would beleve him: but God making infinit promises unto us in scripture of eternal reward to our wel doing (as that we shal eat with him;<note place="margin">Luc. 22.

                     <p n="13">13 Of al this then that I have said, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian may gather, first, the lamentable estate of the world at this day, when amongst the smal number of those which bear the name of Christians, so many are like to perish, for not performing of these two principal
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6188:30"/>
points of their uocation. Secondly, he may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cause of the infinit difference of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for good and evil in the life to come,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent state of a good and evil man at the day of death.</hi>
                        </note> which some men wil seeme to marvel at: but in deed is most just and reasonable, considering the great diversitie of life in good and evil men whiles they are in this world. For the good man doth not only endevor to avoid sin: but also by resisting the same, daily and hourly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in the fauor of God. The loose man by yeelding consent to his concupiscence, doth not only lose the favor of God, but also dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth sin upon sin without number. The good man, besides avoiding sin doth infinit good works, at the least wise in desire and hart, wher greter abilitie serveth not. But the wicked man neither in hart nor deed doth any good at al, but rather seeketh in place therof to do hurt. The good man imploieth al his mind, hart, words, and hands, to the service of God, and of his servants for his sake. But the wicked man bendeth al his force and powers both of body and mind, to the service of vanities, the world, &amp; his flesh. Insomuch, that as the good man increaseth hourly in the favor of God, to which is du increase of grace and glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: so the evil from time to time, in thought, word, or deed, or in al at once, heapeth up sin and damnation upon himself; to which is du vengeance, and increase of torments in hel: and in this contrarie course they passe over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6188:31"/>
their lives for twentie, thirtie, or fortie yeeres, and so come to die. And is it not reason now, that seeing there is so great diversitie in their estates: there should be as great or more diversitie also, in their reward? Especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is a great God, and rewardeth smal things with great wages, either of everlasting glorie or everlasting pain. Thirdly and lastly, the diligent and careful Christian may gather of this, what great cause he hath to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the godly counsel of Saint Paul, which is; <hi>That every man should prove and examine his own works.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> And so be able to judge of himselfe, in what case he standeth: and if upon this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he find himselfe awry, to thank God of so great a benefit, as is the revealing of his danger, whiles yet there is time and place to amend. No dowt, many perish daily by Gods justice in their own grosse ignorance, who if they had receaved this special favor, as to see the pit before they fel in, it may be they would have escaped the same. Vse Gods mercie to thy gain then (gentle brother) and not to thy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther damnation. If thou see by this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hitherto thou hast not led a tru Christian life: resolve thy self to begin now, and cast not away wilfully that pretious soul of thine, which Christ hath bought so deerly; and which he is most readie to save, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du with grace and eternal glorie, if thou wouldest yeeld the same into his hands, and be

severitie; with what danger of punishment, if we be found negligent and rechlesse therin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For better understanding wherof, it is to be noted first, with what order, and with what ceremonies and circumstances God gave us this charge, or rather made and proclaimed this law of our behaviour and service towards him. For albeit he gave the same commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Adam in his first creation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed it afterwards by nature into the harts of ech man before it was written (as Saint Paul testifieth) yet for more plain declarations sake,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. Rom. 7.</note> and to convince us the more of our wickednes (as the same Apostle noteth) he published the same law in writing tables,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> upon the mount Synay: but with such terror, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of majestie (as also the Apostle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Hebrues) as may greatly astonish the breakers therof.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> Let any man read the nineteene chapter of Exodus, &amp; there he shal see what a preparation there was for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of this law.<note place="margin">Exo. 19.</note> First, God calleth Moises up to the hil,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The dredful publication of the law.</hi>
                        </note> and there reckoneth up many of the benefits which he had bestowed upon the people of Israel: and promiseth them many mo, if they would keepe the law which he was then to give them. Moises went to the people, and returned answer again, that they would keepe it. Then caused God the people to be sanctified against the third day, to wash al their garments, and that no man should companie
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6188:32"/>
with his wife: also to be charged that none upon pain of death should presume to mount up to the hil but Moises alone, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should dare but to touch the hil should presently be stoned to death. When the third day was come,<note place="margin">Acts. 7.</note> the Angels (as Saint Steeven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth it) were readie to promulgate the law. The trumpets sounded mightilie in the aire: great thunder brake out from the sky, with fearce lightenings, horrible clouds, thick mists, and terrible smoke rising from the mountain. And in the midst of al this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, and dreadful terror, God spake in the hearing of al:<note place="margin">Exo. 20. Deut. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>I am thy Lord God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt: me only shalt thou serve:</hi> and the rest which foloweth, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a perfect description of our dutie in this life, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the ten commandements of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Al which terror and majestie,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> the apostle himselfe as I have said, applieth to this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we should greatly tremble to break this law, delivered us with such circumstances of dread and fear: signifieng also hereby, that the exaction of this law, must needs be with greater terror at the day of iudgment, seeing that the publication therof, was with such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment and dread. For so we see alwais great princes laws to be executed upon the offenders with much more terror than they were proclaimed. And this may be a forcible

                        </note>5 Secondly, if we consider the sharp executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on used by God upon offenders of this law, both before it was written, and since; we shal find great cause of fear also: as the wonderful punishment upon Adam,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> &amp; so many millions of people besides, for his one fault: the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of al the world togither:<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> the burning of Sodom and Gomorra with brimstone:<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 1.

Which al being done by God with such rigor, for lesse and fewer sins than ours are, and also upon them, whom he had more cause to spare than he hath to tollerate us: may be admonishments what we must looke for at Gods hands, for breach of this law of serving him in this life.</p>

                        </note>6 Thirdly, if we consider the speeches and behaviour of our Lord and maister Christ in this matter, we shal have yet more occasion to dowt our owne case: who albeit he came now to redeeme us, and to pardon al, in al mildnes, humilitie, clemencie, and mercie: yet in this point of taking accounts, he is not woont to shew but austeritie and great rigor: not onlie in words, and familiar speeches with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; but also in examples and parables to this purpose.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> For so in one parable he damneth that poore servant to hel (where should be we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and gnashing of teeth) only for that he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6188:33"/>
had not augmented his talent delivered him. And Christ confesseth there of himselfe, that he is a hard man, reaping where he sowed not, and gathering where he cast not abroad: expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting also advantage at our hands,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents lent us, and not accepting onlie his own again. And consequently threatning much more rigor to them which shal mispend his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, as the most of us do. Again, he damneth the servant whom he found asleepe:<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> he dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the poore man, which was compelled to come into the wedding,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> onlie for that he came without a wedding garment: he damned the five foolish virgins, for that they had not their oile with them, and were not readie (jump at the very hour) to go in with him, and would not know them when they came after: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he promiseth to damn al those (without exception) which shal work iniquitie,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> as S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew testifieth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Moreover, being asked by a certain ruler on a time, how he might be saved: he would geeve him no other hope (so long as he sought salvation by his works) though he were a prince, but only this; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 18. Mat. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>keepe the commandements of God.</hi> And talking with his disciples at another time of the same matter, he geeveth them no other rule of their life, but this; <hi>If ye love me, keepe my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As who should say,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> if you were never so much my disciples, if ye break my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6188:34"/>
there is no more love nor frindship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us. And S. Iohn (which best of al others knew his meaning herein) expoundeth it in this sense, when he saith; <hi>If a man</hi> (saith he) <hi>knoweth God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and yet keepeth not his commandements he is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And more yet (to take away al hope or expectation from his disciples of any other way pleasing him than by keeping his commandements) he saith in another place,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> that <hi>He came not to take away the law, but to fulfill it,</hi> and streight way he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth upon the same; <hi>Whosoever therfore shal break one of the least of these commandements shal be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> For which cause at his departure out of the world, the verie last words that he spake to his Apostles were these, that <hi>They should teach men to observe al his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements whatsoever.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8 By which appeereth the severe meaning that Christ had touching our account for the keeping of his commandements in this life. The which also may be gathered by that being asked whether the number were smal of them that should be saved:<note place="margin">Luc. 13.</note> he counseleth men to strive to go into the strait gate: for that many should be shut out, yea even of them, which had eaten and drunken with him, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied the corporal presence of his blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but had not regarded to live as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. In which case he signifieth that no respect or frindship must take place, with

him at the last day: for which cause he said to the man whom he had healed at the fish pools side in Ierusalem, <hi>Behold now thou art hole,</hi>

                        </note>11 Now as touching the first of these two judgements, albeit the holy ancient fathers, especiallie Saint Austen, do gather and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers particulars of great severitie and feare (as the passage of our soul from the body to the tribunal seat of God, under the custody both of good and evil angels: the fear she hath of them: the sodain strangenes of the place where she is: the terror of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; the strait examination she must abide; and the like) yet for that the most of these things are to be considered also in the second judgement which is general; I wil passe over
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6188:35"/>
to the same, noting only certain reasons yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy fathers, why God after the first judgement,<note place="margin">

The second is, that as Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was dishonored and put to confusion here in the world publikly: so much more he might shew his majestie and power, at that day in the sight of al creatures, and especially of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

And that (which yet is more) he cannot abide nor permit the sinner to praise him, or to name his testament with his mouth, as the holy Ghost
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6188:41"/>
testifieth: and therfore no marvel if he shew such rigor to him at the last day, whom he so greatly hateth and abhorreth in this life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There might be many reasons alledged of this: as the breach of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the ingratitude of a sinner in respect of his benefits, and the like: which might justifie sufficiently his indignation towards him.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The reason why God so hateth a sinner.</hi>
                        </note> But there is one reason above the rest, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the whole fountain of the matter: and that is, the intollerable injurie don unto God, in everie sin that wittingly we do commit; which in deed is such an opprobrious injurie, and so dishonorable, as no mean potentate could beare the same at his subjects hands: and much lesse God himselfe (who is the God of majestie, may abide to have the same so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iterated against him, as commonly it is by a wicked man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And for the understanding of this inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we must note, that every time we commit such a sin, there doth passe thorough our hart (though we mark it not) a certein practik discourse of our understanding (as there doth also in everie other election) wherby we lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, on the one side, the profit of that sin, which we are to commit, that is, the pleasure that draweth us to it: and on the other part, the offence of God, that is, the leesing of his frindship by that sin if we do it: and so having as it were the balances there before us, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6188:41"/>
putting God in one end, and in the other the aforesaid pleasure:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The iniurie done to God by sin.</hi>
                        </note> we stand in the midst deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating and examining the waight of both parts, and finally, we do make choise of the pleasure, and do reject God: that is, we do choose rather to leese the frindship of God, with his grace, and whatsoever he is worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, than to lose that pleasure and delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin. Now what thing can be more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than this? What can be more spiteful to God, than to prefer a most vile pleasure before his majestie? Is not this worse than intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injurie of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. Mar. 15.</note> who chose Barrabas the murderer, &amp; rejected Christ their Saviour? Surely how heinous soever that sin of the Iewes were, yet in two points this doth seeme to exceede it: the one, in that the Iewes knew not whom they refused in their choise, as we do; the other in that they refused Christ but once, and we do it often, yea daily, &amp; hourly, when with advisement we give consent in our harts unto sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And is it marvel then, that God dealeth so severely and sharply in the world to come with wicked men, who do use him so opprobriously &amp; contemptuously in this life? Surely the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a sinner is great towards God, &amp; he doth not only dishonor him by contempt of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p n="5">5 And bicause God (which searcheth the hart and reins, seeth wel this traiterous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinners towards him, lurking within their bowels,<note place="margin">Sapi. 1.

every sin, which we do wittingly commit. And the reason hereof standeth in two points. First, for that God by how much more he is better than we are; by so much more he loveth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and hateth sin, than we do: and bicause he is infinitely good; therfore his love to goodnes is infinite, as also his hatred to evil, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his rewards to them both are infinite, the one in hel, the other in heaven.</p>

                        </note>6 Secondlie we see by experience, that how much more great and worthie the person is, against whom an offence is committed, so much greater the offence is: as the selfesame blow geeven to a servant, and to a prince diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth greatly in offence, and deserveth different hatred and punishment. And for that every sin which we advisedly commit, is done directly against the person of God himselfe, as hath beene declared before, whose dignitie is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: therefore the offence or guilt of everie such sin is infinite, and consequently deserveth infinite hatred, and infinite punishment at Gods hands.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 First then I say, consider (gentle Christian) of what an infinite majestie he is, whom thou a poore woorm of the earth, hast so often and so contemptuously offended in this life. We see in this world, that no man dareth to offend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6188:50"/>
openly, or say a word against the majestie of a prince within his own dominions: and what is the majestie of al the princes upon earth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the thousandth part of the majestie of God,<note place="margin">Psa. 148.</note> who with a word made both heaven and earth, and al the creatures therin, and with halfe a word can destroie the same again: whom al the creatures which he made, as the Angels, the heavens, and al the elements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, do serve at a bek and dare not offend?

                     <p n="4">4 Remember then (deer brother) that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie time thou dost commit a sin, thou givest as it were a blow in the face, to this God of great majestie,<note place="margin">1.

And when Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses desired to see God once in his life, &amp; made humble petition for the same: God answered, that no man could see him and live: but yet (to satisfie his request, and to shew him in part what a terrible and glorious God he was) he

told Moises, that he should see some peece of his glorie: but he added,<note place="margin">Exo. 35.</note> that it was needful he should hide himselfe in the hole of a rock, and be covered with Gods own hands for his defence, while God (in some measure of his majestie) did passe by in glorie. And when he was past, God tooke away his hand, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Moises to see his hinder parts only, which was notwithstanding, most terrible to behold.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The prophet Daniel also describeth the majestie of this God shewed unto him in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in these words;<note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>I did see</hi> (saith he) <hi>when the thrones were set, and the old of many dais sate down: his apparel was as white as snow: his haire like unto pure wool, his thron was of a flame of fire, &amp; his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots were burning fire, a swift flud of fire came from his face: a thousand thousands did serve him, and ten thousand hundred thousands did assist him, he sate in iudgement, and the books were opened before him.</hi> Al this and much more is recorded in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to admonish us therby what a prince of majestie he is whom a sinner offendeth.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Imagin now (brother mine) that thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this great king sitting in his chaire of maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie;<note place="margin">

                        </note> with chariots of fire; unspeakable light; and infinite millions of Angels about him, as the scripture reporteth. Imagin further, (which is most tru) that thou seest al the creatures in the world stand in his presence, and trembling at his majestie, and most carefully attending to do that for which he created them: as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6188:51"/>
to move abovt: the earth to bring foorth sustenance: and the like. Imagin further that thou seest al these creatures (how big or little soever they be) to hang and depend only of the power and vertu of God: wherby they stand, move, and consist: and that there passeth from God, to ech creature in the world, yea to everie part that hath motion or being in the same some beam of his vertu: as from the sun, we see infinite beams to passe into the aire. Consider (I say) that no one part of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world (as the fish in the sea, the grasse on the ground, the leaves of the trees, or the parts of man upon the face of the earth) can grow, moove, or consist, without some litle stream of vertu, and power come to it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from God. So that thou must imagin God to stand as a most glorious sun in the midst: and from him to passe foorth infinite beams or streams of vertu to al creatures that are, either in heaven, earth, the aire, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to every part therof: and upon these beams of his vertu, al creatures to hang: and if he should stop but any one of them, it would destroy and annihilate presentlie some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or other. This I say, if thou shalt consider touching the majestie of God, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite dread that al creatures have of him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only a sinner (for the devils also do fear him,<note place="margin">Iac. 2.</note> as Saint Iames saith:) thou wilt not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the severe judgement of God, appointed

for his offence. For sure I am, that very shame of the world maketh us to have more regard in offending the poorest frind we have in this life, than a wicked man hath in offending God: which is an intollerable contempt of so great a majestie.</p>

                     <p n="8">8 Consider then (deer Christian) the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good turns and benefits which thou hast receaved at the hands of this great God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to win thee to his love, &amp; that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest leave of to offend and injurie him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit no toong created either of man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, can expresse the one halfe of these gifts which thou hast receaved from him, or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew of them, or the great love and hartie good wil wherwith he bestowed them upon thee: yet for som memorie sake, I wil repeat certain

general and principal points therof, wherunto the rest may be referred.</p>

The greatnes of this benefit may partly be conceaved, if thou do imagin thy selfe to lak but any one part of thy bodie, as a leg, an arm, an eie, or the like: and that one should freely geeve the same unto thee: or if thou wantest but any one sense, as that thou were deafe or blind, and one should restore sight or hearing unto thee: how wouldest thou esteeme of this benefit? How much wouldest thou professe thy selfe beholding unto him for the same? And if the gift of one of these parts only would seeme such a benefit unto thee: how great oughtest thou to esteeme the free gift of so manie parts together?</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Ad to this now (as I have said) that he hath created thee to the likenes of no other thing, but of himselfe; to no other end, but to be his honorable servant in this world, and his compartener in kingly glorie for al eternitie to come: and this he hath done to thee, being only a peece of dirt or clay before. Now ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thou of what maner of love proceeded

this. But yet ad further, how he hath created al this magnificent world for thee, and al the creatures therof to serve thee in this busines: the heaven to distinguish times and seasons, and to geeve thee light: the earth, and aier, and water, to minister most infinit varietie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for thy use and sustinance: &amp; hath made thee lord of al, to use them for thy comfort and his service. And what magnificent gifts are these? And what shameful ingratitude is it, to turn the same to the dishonor and injurie of so loving a geever as thou dost, by using them to serve thee in sin.</p>

lay the pains of death du to thee, upon his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie son and heir, for thy sake: how much woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou think, that this king loved thee?

And yet, such is our case, and much more bounden towards Christ and his father, whom the most of us notwithstanding do daily offend, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and injurie by sin.</p>

This pain may partly be conceaved by that, if we would drive out life, but from the least part of our bodie (as for example, out of our little finger, as surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are woont to do, when they wil mortifie any place, to make it break:) what a pain doth a man suffer before it be dead? What raging greefe doth he abide? And if the mortifieng of one little part onlie, doth so much afflict us; imagin what the violent mortifieng of al the parts together wil do. For we see that first the soul is driven by death to leave the extreeme parts, as the toes, feet and fingers: then the legs &amp; arms, and so consequently one part dieth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, until life be restrained onlie to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6188:59"/>
hart, which holdeth out longest, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part, but yet must finally be constrained to render it selfe though with never so much pain and resistance: which pain how great &amp; strong it is, may appeer by the breaking in peeces of the very strings and holds wherwith it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed, through the excessive vehemencie of this deadly torment. But yet before it come to this point, to yeeld, no man can expresse the cruel conflict that is betwixt death and hir, and what distresses she abideth in time of hir agonie. Imagin that a prince possessed a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly citie in al peace, wealth and pleasure, and greatly frinded of al his neighbors about him, who promise to assist him in al his needs and affairs: and that upon the sudden, his mortal enimie should come and besiege this citie,<note place="margin">

How often would he look out at the windows and loope holes of his tower, to see whether his frinds and neighbors would come to help him or no? And if he saw them al to abandon him, and his cruel enimie even ready to break in upon him, would he not be in a pitiful plight trow you? And even so fareth it with a poore soul, at the hour of death. The bodie wherin
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6188:60"/>
she raigneth like a joly princesse in al pleasure, whiles it florished, is now battered and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by hir enimy, which is death: the arms, legs, and other parts wherwith she was fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as with wals &amp; words during time of helth, are now surprised and beaten to the ground, and she is driven only to the hart, as to the last and extreemest refuge, where she is also most fearcely assailed in such sort, as she cannot hold out long. Hir deer frinds which soothed hir in time of prosperitie, and promised assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as youth, physik, and other humane helps, do now utterly abandon hir: the enimie wil not be pacified or make any leag, but night and day assaulteth this turret wherin she is, and which now beginneth to shake and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in peeces, and she looketh hourly when hir enimie in most raging and dreadful maner, wil enter upon hir. What think you is now the state of this afflicted soul? It is no marvel if a wise man become a foole, or a stout worldling most abject, in this instant of extremitie as we often see they do in such sort, as they can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of nothing wel, either towards God or the world at this hour: the cause is the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of pains, oppressing their minds, as Saint Austen also proveth (or some other under his name) and giveth us therwithal a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent forewarning,<note place="margin">

                        </note> may be the marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous patience, and long suffering of God in this life: as for example, in that he suffereth divers men from one sin, to another; from one day, to another; from one yeere, to another; from one age, to another; to spend al (I say) in dishonor and dispite of his majestie, adding offence to offence, and refusing al persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, allurements, good inspirations, or other
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6188:67"/>
means of frindship, that his mercie can devise to offer for their amendement. And what man in the world could suffer this? Or what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hart can shew such patience? But now if al this should not be requited with severitie of punishment, in the world to come, upon the obstinate: it might seeme against the law of justice and equitie, and one arm in God might seeme longer than the other.

of the one, may serve to infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie of the other. As when Saint Paul saith; that <hi>No eie hath seene, nor eare heard, nor hart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ioies that God hath prepared for them that shal be saved.</hi>

As for example: we see one man pained in his eies; another in his bak: which particular pains notwithstanding somtimes are so extreme, as life is not able to resist them; and a man would not suffer them long for the gaining of many worlds togither. But suppose now a man were tormented in al the parts of his bodie at once, as in his head, his eies, his toong, his teeth, his throte, his stomak, his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, his back, his hart, his sides, his thighs, and in al the joints of his bodie besides: suppose (I say) he were most cruelly tormented with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pains in al these parts togither, without

He was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of his miserie (as we are now) by Moises and the prophets,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> as Christ signifieth: but he would not hear. Afterward he was in such admiration of his own follie, that he would have had Lazarus sent from Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som unto his brethren to warn them of his successe.

Would they not persecute eagarlie the parties that should bring such news: what then can God devise to do for the saving of these men? What waie, what means may he take, when neither warning, nor example of others, nor threats, nor exhortations wil do anie good? We know, or may know, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the life which we do, we can not be saved.

We know, and can not choose but know, that we must shortlie die, and receave our selves, as they have receaved living as they did, or woorse. We see by this laid down before, that the pains are intollerable, and yet eternal, which do expect us for the same. We confesse them most miserable, that for anie pleasure or commoditie of this world, are now fallen into those pains. What then shuld let us to resolve, to dispatch our selves quiklie of al impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? To break violentlie from al bonds and chains of this wicked world, that do let us from this tru and zealous service of God? Why should we sleep one night in sin, seeing that night may chance to be our last, and so the everlasting cutting off, of al hope for the time to come?</p>

But for that al harts are not of one constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this respect, nor al drawn and stirred with the same means: I purpose to adjoin heer a consideration of commoditie, wherunto commonly, ech man is prone by nature. And therfore I am in hope it shal be more forcible to that we go about, than any thing else that hitherto hath beene spoken. I mean then to treat of the benefits which are reaped by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, of the gain drawn thence, and of the good pay and most liberal reward which God performeth to his servants,<note place="margin">

                        </note> above al the maisters created, that may be served. And though the just fear of punishment (if we serve him not) might be sufficient to drive us to this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6188:79"/>
resolution: and the infinite benefits alreadie received, induce us to the same, in respect of gratitude (of both which somwhat hath been said before:) yet am I content so far to inlarge this libertie to thee (good reader) that except I shew this resolution, which I crave to be more gainful and profitable than any thing else in the world that can be thought of: thou shalt not be bound unto it for any thing that hitherto hath beene said in that behalfe. For as God in al other things is a God of great majestie, ful of bountie, liberalitie, and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnificence; so is he in this point above al other: in such sort, as albeit whatsoever we do, or can do, is but du det unto him, and of it selfe deserveth nothing: yet of his munificent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, he letteth passe no one jot of our service unrewarded,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.

                     <p n="2">2 God commanded Abraham to sacrifice unto him his only son Isaac,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> which he loved so much: but when he was ready to do the same, God said; Do it not: it is inough for me that I see thine obedience. And bicause thou hast not refused to do it, I swear to thee (saith he) by my selfe, that I wil multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and the sands of the sea: and among them also one shal be Christ, the Saviour of the world. Was not this a good pay for so little pains?<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7.</note> King David one night, began to think with himselfe, that he had now an house of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6188:79"/>
Cedar, and the Ark of God lay but under a tent, and therfore resolved to build an house for the said Ark. Which onlie cogitation God took in so good part, as he sent Nathan the prophet unto him presentlie, to refuse the thing, but yet to tel him, that for so much as he had determined such a matter: God would build an house, or rather a kingdome, to him, and his posteritie, which should last for ever,<note place="margin">Psal. 88.</note> and from which he would never take away his mercie, what sins or offences soever they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Which promise we see now fulfilled, in Christ his church, raised out of that familie. What should I recite manie like examples? Christ giveth a general note hereof, when he calleth the workmen and paieth to ech man his wages, so dulie:<note place="margin">Mat. 20. Apo. 22.</note> as also when he saith of himselfe; <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me.</hi> By which places is evident, that God suffereth no labor in his service to be lost or unpaid. And albeit (as after in place convene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent shal be shewed) he paieth also, and (that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly) in this life: yet (as by those two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples appeereth) he deferreth his cheefe pay, unto his comming in the end of the day, that is, after this life, in <hi>The resurrection of the iust</hi>:<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> as himselfe saith in another place.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Of this paiment then reserved for Gods servants in the life to come, we are now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; what, and what maner a thing it is, and whether it be woorth so much labor and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,

For that worldly princes do not use to give kingdoms to their servants for recompence of their labors.

                     <p n="6">6 When God shal take upon him to do a thing for the uttermost declaration (in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sort) of his power, wisdome, and majestie: imagin you, what a thing it wil be. It pleased him at a certain time,<note place="margin">

For as for their number they were almost infinite, passing the number of al the creatures of this inferior world, as divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and som ancient fathers do think: though Daniel (according to the fashion of the scripture) do put a certain number for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,<note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> when he saith of Angels; <hi>A thousand

But yet in creating of this transitorie world (which is but a cottage of his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal habitation) what power, what magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, what majestie hath he shewed? What heavens, &amp; how woonderful hath he created? What infinite stars and other lights hath he devised? What elements hath he framed? And how marvelouslie hath he compast them togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The seas tossing and tumbling without rest, and replenished with infinite sorts of fish: the rivers running incessantly thorough the earth like veins in the bodie, and yet never to be emptie nor overflow the same: the earth it selfe so furnished with al varietie of creatures,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6188:82"/>
as the hundred part therof, is not imploied by man, but only remaineth to shew the ful hand, and strong arm of the creator. And al this (as I said) was done in an instant, with one word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and that for the use of a smal time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the eternitie to come. What then shal we imagin that the habitation prepared for that eternitie shal be? If the cottage of his meanest servant (&amp; that made onlie for a time, to bear off as it were a shower of rain) be so princely, so gorgeous, so magnificent, so ful of majestie, as we see this world is: what must we think that the kings pallace it selfe is, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for al eternitie; for him and his frinds, to raign togither? We must needs think it to be as great, as the power and wisdome of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker could reach unto, to perform: and that is, incomparable, and above al measure infinite. The great king Assuerus,<note place="margin">Ester. 1.</note> which raigned in Asia over an hundred twentie and seven provinces, to discover his power and riches to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, made a feast (as the scripture saith) in his citie of Susa, to al princes, states, and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, of his dominions, for an hundred and fourscore daies togither.<note place="margin">Esai. 25.</note> Esay the prophet saith, that our God and Lord of hosts, wil make a solemn banket to al his people upon the hil and mount of heaven, and that an harvest ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of fat meats, and pure wines.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6188:82"/>
content to gird himselfe, and to serve in the same, as by his own words he promiseth. What maner of banket then shal this be? How mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent? How ful of majestie? Especiallie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath not onlie to endure a hundred and fourscore dais (as that of Assuerus did) but more than a hundred and fourscore millions of ages: not served by men (as Assuerus feast was) but by Angels and the verie Son of God himselfe: not to open the power and riches of a hundred twentie and seven provinces, but of God himself, King of kings, and Lord of lords, whose power and riches are without end, and greater than al his creatures togither can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? How glorious a banket shal this be then? How triumphant a joy of this festival day? O miserable and foolish children of men, that are born to so rare and singular a dignitie, and yet can not be brought to consider, love, or esteme of the same!</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Other such considerations there be to shew the greatnesse of this felicitie: as that,<note place="margin">

                        </note> This was a most forcible consideration with good Saint Augustine, who in the secret

O sweet Lord what maner of things, how great, how good, and how innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are those which thou hast prepared in our heavenly countrie, where we shal see thee face to face? If thou do so great things for us in our prison: what wilt thou give us in our pallace? If thou givest so many things in this world, to good &amp; evil men togither: what hast thou laid up for onlie good men in the world to com? If thine enimies &amp; frinds togither are so wel provided for in this life: what shal thy only frinds receive in the life to come?

What understanding can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how great this honor shal be? But yet in some part it may be gessed, by that he saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. Luc. 22.</note> that they shal sit in judgement with him: and (as Saint Paul addeth) shal be judges not onlie of men, but also of Angels.<note place="margin">1.

What honor was that he did to Moises and Aaron in the face of Pharao and al his court, by the woonderful signes that they wrought? What excessive honor was that he did to holie Iosue,<note place="margin">Iosu. 10.</note> when in the sight of

al his armie, he staied the sun and moone in the midst of the firmament, at Iosue his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, obeing therin (as the scripture saith) to the voice of a man?

Re. 13.</note> raised (by onlie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) the dead to life? Finallie (not to alledge mo examples herein) what singular honor was that, he gave to al the Apostles of his Son, that as many as ever they laid hands on,<note place="margin">Acts. 5. Acts. 19.</note> were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from al infirmities, as Saint Luke saith? Nay (which is yet more) the verie girdles and napkins of Saint Paul did the same effect; and yet more than that also, as many as came within the onlie shadow of Saint Peter were healed from their diseases.<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> Is not this marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous honor, even in this life? Was there ever monarch, prince, or potentate of the world, which could vaunt of such points of honor? And if Christ did this, even in this world to his servants,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> wherof notwithstanding he saith his

kingdome was not: what honor shal we think he hath reserved for the world to come,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. Apoc. 4.</note> where his kingdome shal be, and where al his servants shal be crowned as kings with him?</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Another declaration yet of this matter is laid down by Divines for opening of the greatnes of this beatitude in heaven:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The three places wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man is appointed.</hi>
                        </note> and that is, the consideration of three places, wherto man by his creation is appointed. The first is his mothers womb, the second this present world, the third is <hi>Coelum Empireum,</hi> which is, the place of blisse in the life to come. Now in these three places, we <note n="*" place="margin">It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grounded upon any sufficient warrant, to set down so just a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion herin.</note> must hold the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> (by al reason) which we see sensiblie to be observed between the first two. So that look in what proportion the second doth differ from the first: in like measure must the third differ from the second, or rather much more: seeing that the whole earth put togither, is by al Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, but as a prik or smal point in respect of the marveilous greatnes of the heavens. By this proportion then we must say, that as far as the whole world doth passe the womb of one private woman: so much in al beautie, delites, and majestie doth the place of blisse passe al this whole world. And as much as a man living in the world doth passe a child in his mothers bellie, in strength of bodie, beautie, wit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, learning, and knowledge: so much and far more, doth a Saint in heaven passe men of this world, in al these things, and manie mo

besides. And as much horror as a man would have, to turn into his mothers womb again: so much would a glorified soul have, to return into this world again. The nine months also of life in the mothers womb, are not so little in respect of mans life in the world, as is the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest life upon earth, in respect of the eternal in heaven. Nor the blindnes, ignorance, &amp; other miseries of the child in his mothers womb, are any way comparable to the blindnes, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and other miseries of this life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the light, cleer knowledge, and other felicities of the life to come. So that by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, some conjecture may be made of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we have in hand.</p>

                        </note>11 But yet to consider the thing more in particular, it is to be noted, that this glorie of heaven shal have two parts: the one belonging to the soul; the other belonging to the bodie.

many corruptions; replenished with so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite miseries and calamities, shal then be made glorious, and most perfect to endure for ever, without mutation, and to raign with the soul, world without end. For it shal be delivered from this lumpish hevines, wherewith it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in this life: from al diseases likewise and pains of this life, and from al trobles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances belonging to the same, as sin, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drinking, sleeping, and such like. And it shal be set in a most florishing estate of health, never deceaveable again.

the world, being only sparkles &amp; parcels sent out from God: they are al contained much more perfectly and excellently in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, than they are in their own natures crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as also al the perfections of his creatures are more fully in him, than in themselves.

Psa. 140.</note> but also do seeke excuses for their sloth and wickednes, and do alledge reasons to their own perdition.

soul,<note place="margin">Tob. 12. Pro. 29.</note> as the scripture affirmeth obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be. But yet (as I say) they have their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses: and the first and principal of al is, that vertuous life is painful and hard, and therfore they cannot indure to follow the same: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as have been brought up delicately, &amp; never were acquainted with such asperitie, as (they say) we require at their hands. And this is a great, large, and universal impediment, which staieth infinite men from imbrasing the means of their conversion, for which cause it is fully to be answered in this place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 First then supposing that the way of vertu were so hard indeed, as the enimie maketh it seem: yet might I wel say with Saint Iohn Chrysostom, that seeing the reward is so great, and infinite,<note place="margin">

                        </note> Again, I might say with holie S. Austen; That seeing we take daily so great pain in this world, for avoiding of smal inconveniences, as of siknes, imprisonments, losse of goods, and the like: what pains should we refuse for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the eternitie of hel fire set down before? The first of these considerations Saint Paul used,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> when he said; <hi>The sufferings of this life are not woorthy of the glorie which shal be revealed in the next.</hi> The second Saint Peter used, when he said;<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Seeing the heavens must be dissolved, and Christ come to iudgement to restore to every man according to his works: what manner of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6188:96"/>
men ought we to be, in holie conversation?</hi> As who would say: No labor, no pains, no travel ought to seem hard or great unto us, to the end we might avoid the terror of that day. Saint Austen asketh this question: what we think the rich glutton in hel would do,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> if he were now in this life again? Would he take pains or no? Would he not bestir himselfe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than turn into that place of torment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? I might ad to this, the infinite pains that Christ took for us; the infinite benefits he hath bestowed upon us; the infinite sins we have committed against him; the infinite examples of saints, that have troden his path before us: in respect of al which, we ought to make no bones at so little pains and labor, if it were tru that Gods service were so travelsome as many do esteem it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But now in very deed the matter is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The way of vertu is not hard.</hi>
                        </note> and this is but a subtil deceit of the enimie for our discouragement. The testimony of Christ himselfe is cleer in this point;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Iugum meum suave est, &amp; onus meum leve: My yoke is sweet, and my burden light.</hi> And the deerly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved disciple Saint Iohn, who had best cause to know his maisters secret herein, saith plainly; <hi>Mandata eius gravia non sunt: His commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not greevous.</hi> What is the cause then,<note place="margin">1.

                           <hi>The cause of pretended difficultie.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6188:97"/>
for that men feele the disease of concupiscence in their bodies, but do not consider the strength of the medicine given us against the same.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> They cry with Saint Paul, that <hi>They find a law in their members repugning to the law of their mind</hi> (which is the rebellion of concupiscence left in our flesh by original sin:) but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse not, or consider not with the same Saint Paul; <hi>That the grace of God, by Iesus Christ, shal deliver them from the same.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> They remember not the comfortable saieng of Christ to Saint Paul, in his greatest temptations; <hi>Sufficit tibi gratia mea: My grace is sufficient to strengthen thee against them al.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4.

                        </note>4 So these men, beholding only our miseries and infirmities of nature, wherby daily tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do rise against us: do account the battel painful, and the victory unpossible, having not tasted indeed, nor ever prooved (through their own negligence) the manifold helps of grace, and spiritual succors, which God alwais sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to them, who are content (for his sake) to take this conflict in hand. Saint Paul had wel
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6188:97"/>
tasted that aid, which having rekoned up al the hardest matters that could be, addeth; <hi>Sed in his omnibus superamus propter eum qui dilexit nos: But we overcome in al these combats,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>by his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that loveth us.</hi> And then falleth he to that woonderful protestation: that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor the like, should sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him: and al this upon the confidence of spiritual aid from Christ,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> wherby he sticketh not to avouch; <hi>That he could do al things.</hi> David also had prooved the force of this assistance, who said; <hi>I did run the way of thy commandements,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 118.</note> 
                        <hi>when thou didst inlarge my hart.</hi> This inlargement of hart, was by spiritual consolation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal unction, wherby the hart drawn togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by anguish, is opened and inlarged when grace is powred in: even as a dry purse is sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and inlarged by annointing it with oil. Which grace being present, David said, he did not only walk the way of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments easilie, but that he ran them: even as a cart wheel which crieth and complaineth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a smal burden being dry, runneth merilie and without noise, when a little oil is put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Which thing aptly expresseth our state and condition: who without Gods help, are able to do nothing, but with the aid therof, are able to do whatsoever he now requireth of us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And surely I would ask these men that imagin the way of Gods law to be so hard and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6188:98"/>
ful of difficultie, how the prophet could say; <hi>I have taken pleasure (O Lord) in the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements as in al the riches of the world.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 118.</note> And in another place;<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>That they were more pleasant and to be desired, than gold or pretious stone, and more sweeter than hony, or the hony comb?</hi> By which words he yeeldeth to vertuous life, not only du estimation above al treasures in the world; but also pleasure, delite, and sweetnes: therby to confound al those that abandon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the same, upon idle, pretensed, and fained difficulties.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. Rom. 5. Heb. 6.</note> And if David could say thus much in the old law: how much more justly may we say so now in the new, when grace is given more abundantly, as the scripture saith? And thou poore Christian which deceivest thy selfe with this imagination: tel me, why came Christ into this world? Why labored he, and why took he so much pains here? Why shed he his blood? Why praied he to his father so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for thee: Why appointed he the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as conduits of grace? Why sent he the holie Ghost into the world? What signifieth this word Gospel or good tidings? What meaneth the word grace, and mercy brought with him? What importeth the comfortable name of Iesus?<note place="margin">Mat. 1.</note> Is not al this to deliver us from sin?

                        </note> that it altereth the whole state therof: making those things cleer, which were obscure before; those things easie, which were hard and difficult before. And for this cause also it is said in scripture, to make a new spirit, and a new hart. As where Ezechiel talking of this matter, saith in the person of God; <hi>I wil give unto them a new hart, and wil put a new spirit in their bowels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eze. 11. and 36.</note>

Can any thing in the world be spoken more plainly? Now for mortifieng and conquering of our passions, which by rebellion do make the way of Gods commandements unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant. Saint Paul testifieth cleerly, that abundant grace is given to us also by the death of Christ, to do the same:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> for he saith; <hi>This we know that our old man is crucified also, to the end that the bodie of sin may be destroied, and we serve no more unto sin.</hi> By the old man and the bodie of sin Saint Paul understandeth our rebellious appetite and concupiscence, which is so crucified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied by the most noble sacrifice of Christ, as we may by the grace purchased us in that sacrifice,<note place="margin">

And this is that noble and entire victorie (in this world begun, &amp; to be finished in the world to come) which GOD promised so long ago to every Christian soul by the means of Christ, when he said:<note place="margin">Esai. 41.</note> Be not afraid, for I am with thee; step not aside, for I thy God have strengthened thee, and have assisted thee; and the right hand of my just (man) hath taken thy defence. Behold, al that fight against thee shal be confounded and put to shame: thou shalt seek thy rebels, and shalt not find them: they shal be as though they were not, for that I am thy Lord and God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Lo here a ful victory promised upon our

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit these rebels are not here promised to be taken clean away, but only to be conquered and confounded: yet is it said; <hi>That they shal be as though they were not.</hi> Wherby is signified, that they shal not hinder us of our salvation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance and further the same.

And this do they hold, for that by experience it is commonly seen, that the disposition of men is such, as the nature of their complexion doth seem to import. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly those that are sanguine, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; those that are flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik, slow; those that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerik, earnest; and those that are melancholie, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: and such like. And yet the truth is, that the soul doth not follow, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth use such tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature as the bodie hath: &amp; that very wel, and to good use, if the soul be good; but otherwise abuseth it il. For the complexions are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: neither good, nor il of themselves; but as they are used. But bicause that most mens souls are il (as we are al by original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) therfore do most men abuse their complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to il: as bloud, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes; fleam, to slought; choler, to anger; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, to secret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of deceit, or naughtines. Wheras notwithstanding, those souls that are good, do use them wel: as blood, to be valiant, and cheerful in goodnes; fleam, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their affections with sobrietie; choler, to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in the glorie of God; and melancholie, to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and contemplation.

                        <hi>The hope of hypocrites shal perish.</hi> Calling wicked men hypocrites, for that they say, they put their hope in God, wheras indeed they put it in the world. Which thing beside scripture, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent also by experience. For with whom doth the wicked man consult in his affairs and dowts? With God principally, or with the world? Whom doth he seeke to, in his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Whom doth he cal upon in his siknes? From whom hopeth he comfort in his adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? To whom yeeldeth he thanks in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperities? When a worldly man taketh in hand any work of importance, doth he first consult with God about the event therof? Doth he fal down of his knees, and aske his aid? Doth he refer it wholy and principally to his honor? If he do not: how can he hope for aid therin at his hands? How can he repaire to him for assistance, in the dangers and lets that fal out about the same? How can he have any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, which hath no part at al in that work? It is hypocrisie then (as Iob truly saith) for this man to affirm that his confidence is in God: wheras indeed, it is in the world; it is in Pharao; it is in Egypt; it is in the arm of man; it is in a lie. He buildeth not his house with the wise man, upon a rok: but with the foole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sands: and therfore (as Christ wel assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him;) <hi>When the rain shal come,<note place="margin">Matt. 7.</note> and fluds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and winds blow, and al togither shal rush upon

                        </note>22 The second reason is, for that albeit they should put their hope in God (yet living wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly) it is vain, and rather to be called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption than hope. For understanding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is to be noted; that as there are two kinds of faith recounted in scripture (the one a dead faith without good works, that is which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth al you say of Christ,<note place="margin">Iaco. 2. Matt. 7. 1. Co. 13. and 15. Rom. 1. Gal. 3. Eph. 2.</note> but yet observeth not his commandements; the other, a lively, a justifieng faith, which beleeveth not only, but also worketh by charitie, as Saint Pauls words are. So are there two hopes following these two faiths: the one of the good, proceeding of a good conscience, wherof I have spoken before; the other of the wicked, resting in a guiltie conscience, which is indeed no tru hope, but rather presumption. This Saint Iohn prooveth plainly,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> when he saith; <hi>Brethren,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6188:110"/>
if our hart reprehend us not, then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with God.</hi> That is, if our hart be not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wicked life. And the words immediately folowing do more expresse the same, which are these; <hi>Whensoever we aske we shal receive of him, for that we keep his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, &amp; do those things which are pleasing in his sight.</hi> The same confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Saint Paul, when he saith,<note place="margin">1.

For the vertuous, having now (by the aid of Christ his grace) subdued the greatest force of their said passions, do passe on their life most sweetly and calmly, under the guide of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without any perturbations that much tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, in the greatest occurrents of this life. But the wicked men,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> not having mortified the said passions, are tossed and troubled with the same, as with vehement and contrarie winds.

And the causes heerof are two: first, for that the passions of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Two causes of disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</hi>
                        </note> being many and almost infinit in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, do lust after infinit things, and are never satisfied, but are like those blood-suckers which the wise man speaketh of, that cry alwais Give, give, and never ho. As for example:<note place="margin">Pro. 30.</note> when
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6188:114"/>
is the ambitious man satisfied with honor? Or the incontinent man, with carnalitie? Or the covetous man with money? Never truly: and therfore, as that mother cannot but be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, which should have many children crieng at once for meat, she having no bread at al to break unto them: so the wicked man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greedily called upon, by almost infinit pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to yeeld them their desires, must needs be vexed and pittifully tormented; especially, being not able to satisfie any one of their sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest demands.</p>
                     <p n="28">28 Another cause of vexation is, for that these passions of disordinate concupiscence, be oftentimes on contrary to the other, &amp; do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrary things, representing most lively the confusion of Babel:<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> where one tong spoke against another, and that in divers, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie languages. So we see oftentimes, that the desire of honor saith; Spend heer: but the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of avarice saith; Hold thy hands. Lecherie saith; Venture heer: but pride saith; No, it may turn to thy dishonor. Anger saith; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge thy selfe heer: but ambition saith; It is better to dissemble.

The like may be said, and much more truly, of vertuous and wicked men in this world. For when the one doth but think upon the day of death (which is to be the day of their deliverance from this prison) their harts cannot but leap for very joy, considering what is to insu unto them after.

darknes of my dowtfulnes fled away. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon putting in my finger, or som other signe (which now I remember not) upon the place, I closed the book, and with a quiet countenance opened the whole matter to Alipius. And he by this means uttered also that which now wrought in him (which I before knew not) he desired that he might see what I had read: and I shewed him. He marked it al, and went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also than I had red.

                        </note>38 In this marvelous example of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mans conversion, there be divers things to be noted, both for our comfort, and also for our instruction. First is to be noted the great conflict he had with his ghostly enimie before he could get out of his possession and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which was so much the more (no dowt) for that he was to be so great a piller after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Gods church. And we see, Alipius found not so great resistance: for the enimie saw there was much lesse in him, to hurt his kingdome than in Austen. Which ought great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:6188:121"/>
to animate them, that feele great resistance,<note place="margin">

                        </note> and strong temptations against their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: assuring themselves, that this is a sign of grace and favor, if they manfully go thorough. So was Saint Paul called (as we read) most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently being striken down to the ground,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> and made blinde by Christ before his conversion: for that he was a chosen vessel, to bear Christs name unto the gentils.</p>
                     <p n="39">39 Secondly it is to be noted, that although this man had most strong passions before his conversion, &amp; that in the greatest, and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diseases, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly afflict world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: as in ambition, covetousnes, &amp; sins of the flesh, as himselfe before confesseth:<note place="margin">

Thirdly also is to be noted, that he had not only a good victorie over these passions, but also found great sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the way of vertuous life.<note place="margin">

                        </note>40 Fourthly is to be noted for our instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imitation, the behavior of this man about his vocation. First in searching and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng out the same by his repair to Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Simplicianus, and others: by reading the word of God, frequenting of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and the like: which thou oughtest also (good reader) to do, when thou feelest thy selfe inwardly mooved: and not <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Saint Austen as we see, refused not the means to know his vocation,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> but praied, wept, and oftentimes retired himselfe alone from companie to talk with God in that matter. Which many of us wil never do: but rather do detest and flie al means that may bring us into those cogitations of our conversion. Finally Saint Austen after he had once seen cleerly the wil and pleasure of God: made no more stay of the matter, but brake of strongly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the world and vanities therof:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> gave over his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torik lecture at Millan: left al hope of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the court, and betook himselfe to serve God thoroughly: and therfore no marvel if he received so great consolation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:6188:122"/>
from God afterward, as to be so worthy a member in his church. Which example is to be followed of al them that desire to keep a good conscience, so far foorth as ech mans condition and state of life permitteth.</p>
                     <p n="41">41 And heer by this occasion,<note place="margin">

                        </note> I may not let passe to advertise thee good reader, and also by Saint Austens example to forewarn thee, that whosoever meaneth to make this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoroughly, must use some violence at the beginning. For as fire if you rush in upon it with force, is easilie put out; but if you deal softlie, putting in one hand after another, you may rather hurt your selfe than extinguish the same: so is it with our passions, who require manhood and courage for a time at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which whosoever shal use, togither with the other means therunto appertaining, he shal most certeinlie find that thing easie, which now he thinketh heavie, and that most sweet, which now he esteemeth so unsaverie. For proofe wherof, as also for conclusion of this chapter, I wil alledge a short discourse out of Barnard: who after his fashion prooveth the same fitly out of the scriptures.

So in old time he said to Abraham; <hi>Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him unto me a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> This was a feigned labor in a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: for Isaac being offered he was not killed, but sanctified therby. Thou therfore, if thou hear the voice of God within thy hart, willing thee to offer up Isaac (which signifieth joy or laughter) fear not to obey it faithfullie and constantly: whatsoever thy corrupt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion judgeth of the matter, be thou secure. Not Isaac, but the ram shal die for it: thy joy shal not perish, but thy stubburnes only, whose horns are intangled with thorns, and cannot be in thee without the prickings of anxietie. Thy Lord doth but tempt thee as he did Abraham,<note place="margin">Psal. 93. Gen. 22.</note> to see what thou wilt do. Isaac (that is, thy joy in this life) shal not die, as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginest, but shal live: only he must be lifted up upon the wood, to the end thy joy may be on high, and that thou maist glorie not in thine own flesh, but only in the crosse of thy Lord, by whom thy selfe also art crucified:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> crucified (I say) but crucified to the world: for unto God thou livest stil, and that much more than thou didst before.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the second impediment, which is persecution, affliction, and tribulation, wherby many men are kept from the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie there are in the world abroad, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before laid down: or for that, they see some good men to live as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie as themselves, are content to yeeld thus much, that in verie deed they esteem vertuous life to be pleasant inough, to such as are once entered in therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and that in good sooth, for their own parts, they could be content to follow the same, if they might do it with quiet and peace of al hands. But to request them unto it in such time or place, or with such order and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as tribulation, affliction, or persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may fal upon them, for the same: they think it a matter unreasonable, to be demanded, and themselves verie excusable; both before God and man, for refusing it. But this excuse is no better, than the other going before, of the pretended difficultie: for that it standeth upon a false ground, as also upon an unjust illation,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6188:124"/>
made upon that ground. The ground is this, that a man may live vertuously, and serve God truly, with al worldly ease, and without any affliction, tribulation, or persecution: which is false. For that, albeit external contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and persecutions be more in one time than in another; more in this place, than in that: yet can there not be any time or place without some, both external, and internal. Which although (as I have shewed before) in respect of the manifold helps and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sent from God in counterpoize of the same, they seem not heavie nor unpleasant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the godlie: yet are they in themselves both great and waightie, as would appeer if they fel upon the wicked and impatient. Secondly, the illation made upon this ground, is unjust: for that it alledgeth tribulation, as a sufficient reason to abandon Gods service, which God himselfe hath ordained for a mean to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie effect: that is, to draw men therby unto his service.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Four points to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this chapter.</hi>
                        </note> For better declaration wherof (the matter being of very great importance) I wil handle in this chapter, these four points. First, whither it be ordinarie for al that must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to suffer some kind of persecution, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or affliction. Secondlie, what are the causes why God (so loving us as he doth) would chose and appoint so to deale with us heer in this life. Thirdlie, what principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of comfort, a man may have in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6188:124"/>
Fourthlie, what is required at his hands in that state. Which four points, being declared, I dowt not but great light shal appeer in this whole matter, which seemeth to flesh and blood to be so ful of darknes and improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And touching the first,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Whether al good men must suffer tribulation or no.</hi>
                        </note> there needeth little poofe: for that Christ himselfe saith to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by them to al other his servants; <hi>In mundo pressuram sustinebitis: In the world you shal sustain affliction.</hi> And in another place;<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>In your patience shal you possesse your souls?</hi> That is, by suffering patientlie in adversities: which Saint Paul yet uttereth more plainly when he saith; <hi>Al those that wil live godlie in Iesus Christ, shal suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution.</hi> If al, then none can be excepted.<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 2. Tim. 3.</note> And to signifie yet further the necessitie of this matter, both Paul and Barnabas also did teach (as Saint Luke reporteth) <hi>That we of necessitie must enter into the kingdome of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>by many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> Vsing the word <hi>Oportet,</hi> which signifieth a certein necessitie. And Christ himselfe yet more revealeth this secret, when he saith to Saint Iohn the Evangelist; <hi>That he chastiseth al those whom he loveth.</hi> Which words,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> the apostle as it were expounding to the Hebrews, saith; <hi>Flagellat omnem filium quem recipit: He whippeth every child whom he receaveth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> And the apostle urgeth this matter so far in that place, as he affirmeth plainly, al those to be bastards, &amp; no children of God,<note place="margin">verse. 8.</note> which are not afflicted by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6188:125"/>
him in this life. The same position Saint Paul holdeth to Timothy;<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Si sustinemus, &amp; conregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus: If we suffer with Christ, we shal reign with Christ</hi>; and no otherwise. Wherin also concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth holie David,<note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> when he saith; <hi>Multae tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones iustorum: The iust are appointed to many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 The same might be prooved by many other means,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> as by that, Christ saith; <hi>He came not to bring peace, but the sword into the world.</hi> Also by that Saint Paul saith;<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>That no man can be crowned except he fight lawfullie.</hi> But how can we fight, if we have no enimie to oppugn us? The same signifieth Christ in the Apocalips,<note place="margin">cap. 2. &amp; 3.</note> when he repeateth so often, that heaven is only for him that conquereth. The verie same is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ship,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> wherinto Christ entered with his disciples, which was tossed &amp; tumbled, as if it would have been drowned: this (I say) by the ancient fathers exposition, was a figure of the trobles and afflictions, that al those should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which do rowe in the same with Christ our savior. The same also is prooved by that the life of man is called a warfare upon earth:<note place="margin">Iob. 7. Iob. 5.</note> and by that he is appointed to labor and travel, while he is here: also by that, his life is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with many miseries,<note place="margin">Iob. 13.</note> even by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God after mans fal. The same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is shewed by that, that God hath appointed every man to passe through the pains of death, before he come to joy: also, by the infinit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6188:125"/>
and tribulations, both within and without, left unto man in this life: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, within are the rebellions of his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and other miseries of his mind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath continually to make war, if he wil save his soul. Without, are the world, and the devil, which do never cease to assalt him, now by fair means, and now by fowl; now by flatterie, and now by threat; now alluring by pleasure and promotion, now terrifieng by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and persecution. Against al which the good Christian hath to resist manfully, or else he leeseth the crown of his eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The verie same also may be shewed by the examples of al the most renowned saints from the beginning:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of saints.</hi>
                        </note> who were not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salted internally with the rebellion of their own flesh; but also persecuted and afflicted outwardly: therby to confirm more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly this purpose of God. As we see in Abel,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> persecuted and slain by his own brother, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as ever he began to serve God: also in Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> afflicted diversly after he was once chosen by God: and most of al by making him yeeld to the killing of his own deer and only child. Of the same cup drank al his children &amp; posteritie that succeeded him, in Gods favor:<note place="margin">Iudith. 8.</note> as Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Moises, and al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: of which Christ himselfe giveth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.23. Luc. 13.</note> how their blood was shed most cruelly
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6188:126"/>
by the world. The affliction also of Iob is woonderful, seeing the scripture affirmeth it to have come upon him by Gods special ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> he being a most just man. But yet more woonderful was the affliction of holie Tobias,<note place="margin">Tob. 2.</note> who among other calamities, was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken blind by the falling down of swallows dung into his eies:<note place="margin">Tob. 12.</note> of which the angel Raphel told him afterward; <hi>Bicause thou wert a man acceptable to God, it was of necessitie that this tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should proove thee.</hi> Behold the necessitie of afflictions to good men. I might ad to this the example of David &amp; others: but that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle giveth a general testimonie of al the saints of the old testament, saieng; <hi>That some were racked,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>some reproched, some whipped, some chained, some imprisoned: others were stoned, cut in peeces, tempted, and flain with the sword: some went about in hair-cloth, in skins of goats, in great need, pressed and afflicted: wandring and hiding themselves in wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, in hils, in caves, and holes under ground, the world not being woorthy of them.</hi> Of al which he pronounceth this comfortable sentence, to be noted of al men. <hi>Non suscipientes redemptionem; vt meliorem invenirent resurrectionem:</hi> That is; <hi>God would not deliver them from these afflictions in this life, to the end their resurrection and reward in the life to come, might be more glorious.</hi> And this of the saints of the old testament.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 But now in the new testament, founded expressedly upon the crosse, the matter stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6188:126"/>
much more plain, &amp; that with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> For if Christ could not go into this glorie but by suffering, as the scripture saith: then by the most reasonable rule of Christ affirming, that <hi>The servant hath not privilege aboue his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> It must needs follow,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. Luc. 6. Mat. 10.</note> that al have to drink of Christs cup, which are appointed to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his glory. And for proofe herof; look upon the deerest frinds that ever Christ had in this life, and see whether they had part therof or no. Of his mother, Simeon prophesied and told hir at the beginning;<note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>That the sword of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation should passe hir hart.</hi> Signifieng therby, the extreme afflictions that she felt afterward in the death of hir son, and other miseries heaped upon hir. Of the apostles it is evident, that beside al the labors, travels, needs, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, persecutions, and calamities which were infinite, and in mans sight in tollerable (if we beleeve S. Paul,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 2. Cor. 4.6.11.12. Acts. 20. Rom. 8. Iohn. 21.</note> recounting the same) beside al this (I say) God would not be satisfied, except he had their blood also: and so we see that he suffered none of them to die naturally, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saint Iohn: albeit, if we consider what Iohn also suffered in so long a life as he lived, being banished by Domitian to Pathmos;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tert. lib. de prescrip. he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic. Ierom. lib. cont. Ia. vin.</hi>
                        </note> &amp; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, thrust into a tun of hot oil at Rome (as Tertullian and Saint Ierom do report) we shal see that his part was no lesse than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this cup of his maister. I might rekon up heer infinite other examples: but it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:6188:127"/>
not. For it may suffice, that Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this general rule in the new testament; <hi>He that taketh not up his crosse and followeth me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi> By which is resolved plainly, that there is no salvation now to be had, but only for them that take up (that is, do bear wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly) their proper crosses, and therwith do follow their captain, walking on with his crosse on his shoulders before them.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>An obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answered.</hi>
                        </note>6 But heer some man may say: If this be so, that no man can be saved without a crosse, that is, without affliction, and tribulation, how do al those that live in peaceable times and places, where no persecution is, no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no affliction, or tribulation? To which I answer: first, that if there were any such time or place, the men living therin, should be in great danger; according to the saieng of the prophet; <hi>They are not in the labor of other men, nor yet whipped and punished as others are:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note> 
                        <hi>and therfore pride possessed them, and they were covered with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and impietie: and their iniquitie proceeded of their fatnesse, or abundance.</hi> Secondlie I answer; that there is no such time or place so void of tribulation, but that there is alwais a crosse to be found, for them that wil take it up. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there povertie, sicknes, slander, enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, injurie, contradiction, or some like afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered continually. For that, those men never want in the world, wherof the prophet said;<note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>These that do render evil for good, did detract
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6188:127"/>
from me, for that I followed goodnes.</hi> At the least wise, there never want those domestical eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of which Christ speaketh: I mean,<note place="margin">Matt. 7.</note> either our kinred and carnal frinds, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resist us, if we begin once throughly to serve God: or else our own disordinate affections, which are the most perilous enimies of al: for that they make us war upon our own ground. Again, there never want the temptations of the world, &amp; devil: the resisting wherof is much more difficult in time of peace and welth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Time of peace more dangerous, than of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</hi>
                        </note> than in time of external affliction and persecution: for that these enimies are stronger in flatterie, than in force: which a godly father expresseth by this parable. The sun and wind (saith he) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on a day to prove their several strengths,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A parable.</hi>
                        </note> in taking a cloke from a waifairing man. And in the forenoon the wind used al violence that he could to blow off the said cloke. But the more he blew, the more fast held the travailer his cloke, and gathered it more closelie about him. At afternoon the sun sent foorth his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant beams, and by little and little so entered into this man, as he caused him to yeeld and put off, not only his cloke, but also his cote. Wherby is ment (saith this father) that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of pleasure are more strong &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be resisted, than the violence of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 11.</note> The like is shewed by the example of David, who resisted easilie many assaults of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie: but yet fel dangerouslie in time of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6188:128"/>
prosperitie. Wherby appeereth that vertuous men have no lesse war in time of peace, than in time of persecution: and that never there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth occasion of bearing the crosse, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring affliction, to him that wil accept of the same. And this may suffice for this first point, to proove that every man must enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by tribulation, as Saint Paul saith.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The cause why God sendeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to the godly.</hi>
                        </note>7 Touching the second, why God would have this matter so: it were sufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that it pleased him best so, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any further reason of his meaning heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> even as it pleased him <note n="*" place="margin">There was great reason in it, for that, seing man had sinned by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the justice of God to be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing no man, but he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, could do. Wherby it may seem, that although God hath given to this our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor a very good gift in persuading to godlines of life (for which we have to aesteem of him accordingly:) yet hath he not given him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal so ful a knowlege of the mysterie of our redemption in Christ. So it is lesse marvel, that he is in matters of controversie further to seek, than otherwise by his godly disposition, we may think that he should.</note> without al reason in our sight, to abase his Son so much as to send him hither into this world, to suffer and die for us. Or if we wil needs have a reason heerof, this one might be sufficient for al: that seeing we look for so great a glory as we do, we should labor a little first for the same, and so be made somwhat woorthy of Gods favor, &amp; exaltation. But yet for that it hath pleased his divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, not only to open unto us his wil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination for our suffering in this life; but also divers reasons of his most holie purpose and pleasure therin, for our further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and consolation which do suffer:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6188:128"/>
I wil in this place repeat some of the same, for declaration of his exceeding great love, and fatherly care towards us.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The first cause then, and the most principal,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Increase of glorie.</hi>
                        </note> is to increase therby our glorie in the life to come. For having appointed by his eternal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and justice, that none shal be crowned there,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. Apoc. 2.</note> but such as endure (in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) a fight in this world: the more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter combats that he giveth (togither with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace to overcome therin) the greater crown of glorie prepareth he for us at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. This cause toucheth the apostle in the words alledged of the saints of the old testament, to wit,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> that they received no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from their miseries in this world, to the end they might find a better resurrection in the world to come. This also ment Christ expresly when he said;<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Happie are they which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution, for theirs is the kingdome of heaven: happie are you when men speak evil, and persecute you, &amp;c. Reioice and be glad (I say) for that your reward is great in heaven.</hi> Hither also do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain al those promises; <hi>Of gaining life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10. Mat. 19. Esai. 56.</note> 
                        <hi>by leesing life: of receiving a hundred for one,</hi> and the like. Heerhence do proceed al those large promises to mortification, and newnes of life. In both which are great conflicts against the flesh, world, and our own sensualitie, and cannot be performed but by sufferings and affliction. Finally, Saint Paul declareth this matter fully;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6188:129"/>
when he saith; <hi>That a little and short tribulation in this life worketh a weight of glorie above al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the hight of heaven.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p n="15">15 Of this now ensueth an eight reason,<note place="margin">8 <hi>To manifest Gods power and love in delivering.</hi>
                        </note> why God bringeth his servants into affliction: to wit, therby to shew his power and love in delivering them. For as in this world a prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind desireth nothing more, than to have occasion wherby to shew his abilitie and good wil unto his deer frind: so God, which hath al occasions in his own hands, and passeth al his creatures togither in greatnes of love, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of mind, worketh purposely divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and opportunities, wherby to shew and exercise the same. So he brought the three children into the burning fornace, therby to shew his power and love in delivering them.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.6.13. Iob. 1.2. Gen. 31. Tob. 2.12.</note> So he brought Daniel, into the lions den; Susan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, unto the point of death; Iob, into extreme miserie; Ioseph, into prison; Toby, unto blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: therby to shew his power and love in their deliverance. For this cause also did Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ship to be almost drowned,<note place="margin">Matt. 8.

                     <p n="16">16 And of this one reason,<note place="margin">9 <hi>The ioy of deliverance.</hi>
                        </note> many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and most comfortable causes do appeer of Gods dealing heerin. As first, that we being delivered from our afflictions, might take more joy and delite therof, than if we had never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the same. For as water is more grateful to the waifaring man, after a long drith; and a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6188:133"/>
calm more pleasant unto passengers after a troublesom tempest: so is our deliverie more sweet after persecution or tribulation: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the scripture saith; <hi>Speciosa misericordia Dei in tempore tribulationis:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>The mercie of God is beautiful and pleasant in time of tribulation.</hi> This signified also Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> when he said; <hi>Your sorrow shal be turned into ioy:</hi> that is, you shal rejoice, that ever you were sorrowful. This had David proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> when he said; <hi>Thy rod (O Lord) and thy staff have comforted me:</hi> that is, I take great comfort that ever I was chastised with them. And again; <hi>According to the multitude of my sorrows, thy conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have made ioiful my mind:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 93.</note> that is, for every sorrow that I received in time of affliction, I receive now a consolation after my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And again, in another place; <hi>I wil exult and reioice in thy mercie, O Lord.</hi> And wherfore (good king) wilt thou so rejoice? It followeth immediately;<note place="margin">Psal. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>For that thou hast respected mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement, and hast delivered my soul from the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wherin she was, and hast not left me in the hands of mine enimie.</hi> This then is one most gracious meaning of our loving and merciful father, in afflicting us for a time; to the end, our joy may be the greater after our deliverance, as no dowt but it was, in al those whom I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before, delivered by Gods mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean, Abraham, Ioseph, Daniel, Sidrach, Misach and Abdenago; Susanna, Iob, Tobias, Peter, and the rest: who took more joy after their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6188:133"/>
than if they had never been in affliction at al. When Iudith had delivered Bethulia, and returned thither with Holofernes head:<note place="margin">Iudit. 6.14.15.</note> there was more hartie joy in that citie, than ever there would have been, if it had not been in distresse.<note place="margin">Acts. 12.</note> When S.

From like hartie affect came also those songs of Anna, Debora, and Iudith, mooved therunto by the remembrance of their affliction past.

For proofe and better declaration wherof; I wil enter now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third point of this chapter, to examin what reasons &amp; causes there be, to induce us to this joifulnes and contentation of tribulation.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 And first, the reasons laid down alreadie of Gods merciful,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The third part of this chapter, why tribulations should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
                        </note> and fatherly meaning in sending us affliction, might be sufficient for this matter: that is, to comfort and content any Christian man or woman, who taketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite in Gods holie providence towards them. For if God do send affliction unto us, for the increase of our glorie in the life to come; for drawing us from infection of the world; for opening our eies, and curing our diseases; and for preserving our souls from sin heerafter (as hath been shewed, who can be justly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therwith, but such as are enimies unto their own good? We see that for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of bodilie health we are content, not only to admit many bitter and unpleasant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins: but also (if need require) to yeeld wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly some part of our blood ro be taken from us. And how much more should we do this, to the end that we hazard not the eternal health and salvation of our soul? But now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6188:135"/>
if this medicin have so many mo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities besides, as have been declared: if it serve heer for the punishment of our sin, du otherwise at another place, in far greater quantitie and rigor of justice: if it make a trial of our estate, and do draw us to God: if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods love towards us; yeeld matter of joy by our deliverance provoke us to thankfulnes; embolden and strengthen us: and finally, if it furnish us with al vertues, and do make us like to Christ himselfe: then is there singular great cause, why we should take comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation therin: for that, to come neer and to be like unto Christ, is the greatest dignitie and preeminence in the world. Lastlie, if Gods eternal wisdome hath so ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this shal be the badge and liverie of his Son; the high way to heaven, under the standard of his crosse: then ought we not to refuse this liverie; nor to flie this way, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with good Peter and Iohn to esteem it a great dignitie,<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> to be made woorthy of the most blessed participation therof. We see, that to wear the colors of the prince, is thought a prerogative among courtiers in this world: but to wear the robe or crown it selfe, were to great a dignitie for any inferior subject to receive. Yet Christ our Lord and king is content to impart both of his with us. And how then ought we (I pray you) to accept therof.</p>
                     <p n="22">22 And now (as I have said) these reasons
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6188:136"/>
might be sufficient, to comfort and make joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful al those that are called to suffer affliction and tribulation.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of comfort in affliction.</hi>
                        </note> But yet there want not some more particular considerations besides. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first and most principal is, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of persecution commeth not by chance or casualitie, or by any general direction from higher powers: but by the special providence and peculiar disposition of God: as Christ sheweth at large in Saint Mathews Gospel:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> that is, this heavenly medicin or potion is made unto us, by Gods own hand in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Which Christ signifieth, when he saith; <hi>Shal I not drink the cup which my father hath given me?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> That is, seeing my father hath tempered a potion for me, shal I not drink it? As who would say, it were too much ingratitude. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, is to be noted, that the very same hand of God, which tempered the cup for Christ his own Son, hath done the same also for us, according to Christ his saieng; <hi>You shal drink of my cup.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> That is, of the same cup which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath tempered for me. Heerof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; that, with what hart and love God tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this cup unto his own Son; with the same he hath tempered it also to us: that is, altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our good, and his glorie. Thirdlie, is to be noted, that this cup is tempered with such special care (as Christ saith) that what trouble or danger soever it seem to work:<note place="margin">Luc. 21. Mat. 10.</note> yet shal not one hair of our head perish by the same. Nay
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6188:136"/>
further is to be noted, that which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith; <hi>O Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 79.</note> 
                        <hi>thou shalt give us to drink in tears, in measure.</hi> That is, the cup of tears and tribulation shal be so tempered in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by our heavenly physition, as no man shal have above his strength. The dose of aloes, and other bitter ingredients shal be qualified with manna, and sufficient sweetnes of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consolation; <hi>God is faithful</hi> (saith Saint Paul) <hi>and wil not suffer you to be tempted above your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi> This is a singular point of comfort,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> and ought alwais to be in our remembrance.</p>
                     <p n="23">23 Beside this, we must consider that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing and tempering of this cup, being now in the hands of Christ our Savior, by the ful commission granted him from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> and he having learned by his own suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (as the apostle notifieth) what it is to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in flesh and blood:<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> we may be sure that he wil not lay upon us more, than we can bear. For, as if a man had a father or brother, a most skilful physition, and should receive a purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them, tempered with their own hands, he might be sure it would never hurt him; what rumbling soever it made in his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for the time: so and much more may we be assured of the potion of tribulation ministred us, by the hand of Christ:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> though as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith) it seem unto us unpleasant for a time. but above al other comfortable cogitations, this is the greatest and most comfortable, to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6188:137"/>
consider, that he divideth this cup only of love, as himselfe protesteth, and the apostle prooveth: that is, he giveth out portions of his crosse (the richest jewel that he maketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of) as worldly princes do their treasure,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. Heb. 12.</note> unto none,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of his love.</hi>

This is evident by the examples before set down of his deerest frinds, most of al afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this life: that is, they received greater portions of this treasure, for that his good wil was greater towards them. This also may be seen manifestly in the example of Saint Paul: of whom after Christ had said to Ananias; <hi>Vas electionis est mihi:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>He is a chosen vessel unto me.</hi> He giveth immediatly the reason therof; <hi>For I wil shew unto him, what great things he must suffer for my name.</hi> Lo heer: for that he was a chosen vessel, therfore he must suffer great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Doth not the measure of suffering go then according to the measure of Gods love unto us? Surely Saint Peter knew wel how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter went,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> and therfore he writeth thus; <hi>If you living wel, do suffer with patience, this is a grace (or privilege) before God.</hi> And again a little after; <hi>If you suffer reproch in the name of Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>you are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: for that the honor, and glorie, and power of God, and of his holie spirit, shal rest upon you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24 Can there be any greater reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6188:137"/>
or any more excellent dignitie, than to be made partaker of the honor, glorie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Christ? Is it marvel now if Christ said; <hi>Happie are you when men revile and persecute you?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> Is it marvel though he said; <hi>Gaudete in illa die, &amp; exultate: Reioice and triumph ye at that day?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> Is it marvel though Saint Paul said; <hi>I take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and do glorie in mine infirmities, or afflictions, in my reproches, in my necessities, in my persecutions,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>in my distresses for Christ?</hi> Is it marvel if Peter and Iohn, being reproched and beaten at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> went away rejoicing that they were esteemed woorthy to suffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelie for the name of Iesus? Is it marvel though Saint Paul accounted this such a high privilege given to the Philippians, when he said; <hi>It is given to you, not only to beleeve in Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>but also to suffer for him, and to have the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which you have seen in me, and now hear of me?</hi> Al this is no marvel (I say) seeing that suffering with Christ, and bearing the crosse with Christ, is as great preferment in the court of heaven, as it should be in an earthly court, for the prince to take off his own garment, and to lay it on the bak of one of his servants.</p>
                     <p n="25">25 Of this now followeth another conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of singular consolation,<note place="margin">

This point is marvelously prooved by the apostle unto the Hebrews,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. Luc. 6. Luc. 16. Ps. 27. &amp; 73. Psal. 73. verse. 18.</note> and greatly urged. And Christ giveth a plain signification in S.

And yet this now is objected against him as we see. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid handleth this matter in divers places, but purposely in two of his psalms, and that at large, and after long search and much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his conclusion of wicked men prospered above other in the world is this; <hi>Veruntamen</hi>

                     <p n="28">28 For the last reason of comfort in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I wil join two things togither of great force and efficacie to this matter. The first wherof, is the expectation of reward; the other is the shortnes of time wherin we haue to suffer: both are touched by Saint Paul in one sentence, when he saith;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>That a little, and momentain tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in this world, worketh an eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the height of heaven.</hi> By momentain he sheweth the little time we have to suffer: and by eternal weight of glorie, he expresseth the greatnes of the reward prepared in heaven for recompence of that suffering. Christ also joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both these comforts togither, when he saith;<note place="margin">Apo. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold, I come quikly, and my reward is with me.</hi> In that he promiseth to come quikly, he signifieth, that our tribulation shal not endure long: by that he bringeth his reward with

him, he assureth us that he wil not come emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie handed, but readie furnished, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our labor thoroughly. And what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er means of incouragement could he use than this? If a man did bear a verie heavy burden: yet if he were sure to be wel paid for his labor, and that he had but a little way to bear the same: he would strain himselfe greatly, to go through to his wais end, rather than for spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so short a labor, to leese so large, and so present a reward. This is our Lords most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful dealing, to comfort us in our affliction, and to animate us to hold out manfully for a time, though the poize seem heavie on our shoulders: the comming of our Lord is even at hand, and the judge is before the gates,<note place="margin">Iaco. 5. Mat. 11. Ap. 7.21. Gal. 6.</note> who shal refresh us, and wipe away al our teares, and place us in his kingdome to reap joy without fainting. And then shal we proove the saieng of holie Saint Paul to be tru; that <hi>The sufferings of this world are not woorthy of that glory which shal be revealed in us.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> And this may be sufficient for the reasons left us of comfort in tribulation and affliction.</p>

of God, uttered before in the causes of tribulation. But yet for more ease and better remembrance of the same, I wil briefly run over the principal points therof. First then we have to aspire to that (if we can) which Christ counselleth; <hi>Gaudete &amp; exultate: Reioice and triumph.</hi>

Are not you our Lord and maister? Is not the cause yours? Is not al our trust and hope in you? How chanceth it then, that you sleep, and suffer us to be thus tossed and tumbled, as if we appertained nothing unto you? With this affection praied Esay, when he said; <hi>Attend (O Lord) from heaven:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esai. 63.</note> 
                        <hi>look hither from the holie habitation of thy glorie: where is thy zeale? Where is thy fortitude? Where is the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful bowels?

                        </note>31 But yet heer is one thing to be noted in this matter: and that is, that Christ suffered the ship almost to be covered with waves (as the Evangelist saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> before he would awake, therby to signifie that the measure of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is to be left only unto himselfe: it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us to rest upon the apostles words; <hi>He is faithful,</hi>

His temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations oftentimes do go very deep, therby to try the very harts and reins of men.

For behold, our God is able (if he wil) to deliver us from this fornace of fire, which you threaten, and from al that you can do otherwise against us.

We see that in this world, loving sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do glorie of nothing more, than of their dangers or hurts taken in battel for their prince, though he never took blow for them again.

But if this great example of Christ seem unto thee too high for to imitate: look uppon some of thy brethren before thee, made of flesh &amp; blood as thou art: see what they have suffered before they could enter into heaven: think not thy selfe hardly delt withal, if thou be called to suffer a litle also.</p>

For if a man could touch the very pulse of al those, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, or neglect, or defer this resolution: he should find the foundation therof to be the love of this world, whatsoever other excuse they pretend besides. The noble men of Iewrie, pretended, fear to be the cause why they could not resolve, to confesse Christ openly: but Saint Iohn that felt their pulse, uttereth the tru cause to have been; <hi>For that they loved the glory of men,</hi>

For the first sort of men, are compared to a high way, where al seed of life that is sown, either withereth presently, or else is eaten up by the birds of the aire: that is (as Christ expoundeth it) by the devil in carelesse men,<note place="margin">

The third sort are compared to a field, where the seed groweth up, but yet there are so many thorns on the same (which Christ expoundeth to be the cares, troubles, miseries, &amp; deceveable vanities of this life) as the good corn is choked up; and bringeth foorth no fruit. By which last

go and abound in delites, and in every pleasure that may be had? And I saw that this was also vanitie. I tooke great works in hand, builded houses to my selfe, planted vineyards, made or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and gardens, and beset them with al kind of trees: I made me fish ponds to water my trees: I possessed servants and hand-maids, and had a great familie, great herds of cattel, above any that ever were before me in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: I gathered togither gold and silver, the riches of kings and provinces: I appointed to my selfe singers, both men and women, which are the delites of the children of men: fine cups also to drink wine withal: and whatsoever my eies did desire, I denied it not unto them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I let my hart from using any pleasure, to delite it selfe in these things which I prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                     <p n="7">7 This is the testimonie of Salomon, upon his own proof in these matters: and if he had spoken it upon his wisdome only (being such as it was:) we ought to beleeve him; but much more, seeing he affirmeth it of his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But yet, if any man be not mooved with this: let us bring yet another witnes out of the new testament, and such a one, as was privie to the opinion of Christ heerin: that is, Saint Iohn the evangelist, whose words are these;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6188:154"/>
                        <hi>Do not love the world,</hi>

                        <hi>nor those things that are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of God the father, is not in him. For that, al which is in the world, is either concupiscence of the flesh, or concupiscence of the eies, or pride of life.</hi> In which words, S. Iohn beside his threat against such as love and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the world, reduceth al the vanities therof, unto three general points or branches:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral points of worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi>
                        </note> that is, to concupiscence of the flesh (wherin he comprehendeth al carnal pleasures) to concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of the eies (wherin he containeth al matters of riches:) and to pride of life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he signifieth the humor, &amp; disease of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambition. These then are the three general &amp; principal vanities of this life, wherin world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men do wearie out themselves: ambition, covetousnes, and carnal pleasure: wherunto al other vanities are addressed, as to their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. And therfore it shal not be amisse to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these three, in this place.</p>

                        </note> that is, a certain disordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desire to be wel thought of, wel spoken of, praised, and glorified of men: and this is as great a vanitie (though it be common to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) as if a man should run up and down the streets, after a feather, flieng in the air, tossed hither and thither, with the blasts of infinite mens mouths. For as this man might wearie out himselfe before he gat the thing which he followed, and yet when he had it, he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:6188:154"/>
but a feather: so a vain glorious man may labor a good while, before he attain to the praise which he desireth; and when he hath it, it is not woorth three chips, being but the breath of a few mens mouthes, that altereth upon every light occasion, and now maketh him great, now little, now nothing at al. Christ himselfe may be an example of this: who was tossed to and fro in the speech of men: some said he was a Samaritan, and had the divel:<note place="margin">Mat. 27. Iohn. 8.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said he was a prophet: other said he could not be a prophet, or of God; for that he kept not the sabboth day: others asked, if he were not of God, how he could do so many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? So that there was a schism or division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, about this matter,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9.</note> as Saint Iohn affirmeth. Finally, they received him into Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, with triumph of <hi>Hosanna,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 21. Mar. 11. Mat. 27. Luc. 23.</note> casting their apparel under his feet. But the friday next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, they cried <hi>Crucifige</hi> against him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the life of Barrabas, a wicked murderer, before him.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Now my frind, if they delt thus with Christ, which was a better man, than ever thou wilt be: and did more glorious miracles, than ever thou wilt do, to purchase thee name and honor with the people: why dost thou so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and beat thy selfe about this vanitie of vain glorie?

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:6188:155"/>
where every flatterer may rob thee of them? Hast thou no better a chest to lok them up in? Saint Paul was of another mind, when he said; <hi>I esteem little to be iudged of you,</hi>

                        <hi>or of the day of man:</hi> and he had reason surely. For what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth he that runneth at tilt, if the ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple give sentence against him, so the judges give it with him? If the blind man, in the way to Iericho,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> had depended of the liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the goers by, he had never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the benefit of his sight: for that, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded him from running, and crieng so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently after Christ. It is a miserable thing for a man to be a windmil, which maketh no meal, but according as the blast endureth. If the gale be strong, he surgeth about lustily; but if the wind slake: he relenteth presently. So praise the vainglorious man, and ye make him run: if he feel not the gale blow, he is out of hart: he is like the Babylonians, who, with a little sweet musik were made to adore any thing whatsoever.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note>

And such is the painted dignitie of this world: gotten with much labor; maintained with great expenses; and lost with intollerable greefe, and sorrow. For better conceiving wherof, ponder a little with thy selfe (gentle reader) any state of dignitie that thou wouldest desire: and think how many have had that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.

                        </note> These are the words of Esay, declaring unto us by most significant simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, how dangerous thorns the riches and pleasures of this world are. And first he saith; <hi>They put their hope in things of nothing, and do talk
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6188:169"/>
vanities:</hi> to signifie, that he meaneth of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and vain men of this world: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do talk of the things which they love best, &amp; wherin they place their gretest affiance. Secondly he saith; <hi>They conceive labor, and bring foorth iniquitie.</hi> Alluding heerin, to the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth of women, who first do conceive in their womb; and after a great deal of travel, do bring foorth their infant: so worldly men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great time of travel, and labor in vanities, do bring foorth no other fruit, than sin and iniquitie. For that is the effect of those vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as he speaketh in the same chapter, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng out to such kind of men; <hi>Wo be unto you, which do draw iniquitie in the ropes of vanitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="42">42 But yet to expresse this matter more forcibly, he useth two other similitudes, saieng; <hi>They break the egs of serpents, and do weave the webs of spiders.</hi> Signifieng by the one, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of these worldly cares: and by the other, the danger therof. The spider we see, taketh great pains and labor many dais togither, to weave hir selfe a web: and in the end, when al is done, commeth a puff of wind, or some other little matter, and breaketh al in peeces. Even as he in the Gospel, which had taken great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and care,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> in heaping riches togither in plucking down his old barns, building up of new: and when he was come to say to his soul; <hi>Now be merry.</hi> That night his soul was taken from him, and al his labor lost. Therfore Esay
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6188:170"/>
saith in this place, that <hi>The webs of these weavers shal not make them cloth to cover them withal: for that their works are unprofitable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="43">43 The other comparison containeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great danger and fear. For as the bird that sitteth upon the egs of serpents, by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and hatching them, bringeth foorth a perilous broode, to hir own destruction: so those that sit abroode upon these vanities of the world (saith Esay) do hatch at last their own destruction. The reason wherof is (as he saith) <hi>For that the work of iniquitie is in their hand.</hi> Stil harping upon this string, that a man cannot love and follow these vanities, or intangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with their ropes (as his phrase is) but that he must indeed draw on much iniquitie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: that is, he most mingle much sin and offence of God with the same: which effect of sin, bicause it killeth the soul, that consenteth unto it: therfore Esay compareth it unto the broode of serpents, that killeth the bird which bringeth them foorth to the world. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moises useth the like similitudes, when he saith,<note place="margin">Deu. 32.</note> of vain and wicked men; <hi>Their vineyard is the vineyard of Sodomites, their grape is the grape of gall, and their clusters of grapes are most bitter: their wine is the gall of dragons, and the poison of cotatrices uncurable.</hi> By which dreadful and lothsome comparisons, he would give us to understand, that the sweet pleasures of this world are indeed deceits, and wil proove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

Which practise one king at a certain time considering, by good advise (for al the other, though they knew that fashion, yet through negligence, and pleasures of their present felicitie cared not for it) took resolute order with himselfe how to prevent this miserie: which was by this means; He sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved every day great sums of money from his superfluities, and idle expenses, and so, secretly made over before hand a great treasure unto that iland, wherunto he was in danger daily to be sent. And when the time came that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they deposed him from his kingdom, and turned him away naked, as they had done the other before: he went to the iland with joy and confidence, where his treasure lay, and was received there with exceeding great triumph, and placed presently in greater glory than ever

Who is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by hoping too much? He which saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6188:180"/>
himselfe; God is a good God; a merciful God: and therfore I wil do what pleaseth me. And why so? Bicause God is a merciful God; a good God; a gentle God. These men run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger by hoping too much. Who are in danger by despair? Those, which seeing their sins greevous, and thinking it now unpossible to be pardoned, say within themselves; Wel, we are once to be damned: why do not we then, whatsoever pleaseth us best in this life? These men are murdered by desperation; the other by hope. What therfore doth God for gaining of both these men? To him which is in danger by hope, he saith; <hi>Do not say with thy selfe; The mercie of God is great,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>he wil be merciful to the multitude of my sins: for the face of his wrath is upon sinners.</hi> To him that is in danger by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, he saith;<note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>At what time soever a sinner shal turn himselfe to me, I wil forget his iniquities.</hi> Thus far S. Austen, beside much more which he addeth in the same place, touching the great peril and follie of those, which upon vain hope of Gods mercie do persevere in their evil life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is a very evil consequent, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just kind of reasoning, to say; That forsomuch as God is merciful and long suffering, therfore wil I abuse his mercie, and continu in my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. The scripture teacheth us not to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so, but rather quite contrarie; God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and expecteth my conversion, and the longer he expecteth, the more greevous wil be

his punishment when it commeth, if I neglect this patience. And therfore I ought presently to accept of his mercie. So reasoneth S. Paul, which saith;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Dost thou contemn the riches of his long suffering, and gentlenes? Dost thou not know that the patience of God towards thee, is used to bring thee to repentance? But thou through the hardnes of thy hart and irrepentant mind dost hoord up to thy selfe wrath, in the day of vengeance, at the revelation of Gods iust iudgement.</hi> In which words Saint Paul signifieth, that the longer that God suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us with patience in our wickednes, the greater heap of vengeance doth he gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, if we persist obstinate in the same. Wherto Saint Austen addeth another conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of great dread and fear:<note place="margin">

And yet among them also, the greater part (it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) were not saved; as may be conjectured by the speeches of the prophets from time to time; and specially by the saiengs of Christ to the Pharisies, and other rulers therof.

without any prejudice or impechment to his mercie: why, may not he also damn thee, for thy sins, notwithstanding his mercie, seeing thou dost not only commit them without fear, but also dost confidently persist in the same?</p>

For even they also have their works so unperfect, and their faith so weak, that but in the depth of the mercie of God, they cannot in any wise be saved: no, not the best that ever was. But concerning that he doth so resolutely set down so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands to be damned for one that is saved, it is somwhat more, than the word it selfe doth warrant; or the proportion of the mercie of God (compared with his justice) may seem to bear.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:6188:190"/>
in his service: they change every day this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear into love, until they arrive at last unto that state, wherof Saint Iohn saith;<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note>

that is, upon those which wil not beleeve Gods justice, nor his threats against sin: but presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his mercie do persevere in the same, until upon the sudden Gods wrath do rush upon them: and then it is too late to amend. Wherfore (saith he) if you be wise: be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their folly: but amend your lives presently, while you have time. And this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of Saint Paul, shal be sufficient to end this chapter: against al those that refuse, or defer their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amendement, vpon vain hope of Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Who can remoove (for examples sake) without great difficultie, a long custome of droonkennes? Of swearing? Or of any other evil habit, once setled upon
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:6188:193"/>
us? Secondly, the longer we persist in our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> life, the more God plucketh his grace and assistance from us: which is the only mean that maketh the way of vertu easie unto men. Thirdly, the power and kingdome of the divel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is more established and confirmed in us by continuance: and so, the more harder to be remooved. Fourthly, the good inclination of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our wil is more and more weakened, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by frequentation of sin, though not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished. Fiftly, the faculties of our mind, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> more corrupted: as the understanding is more darkened; the wil more perverted; the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite more disordered. Sixtly and lastly, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> parts and passions are more stirred up, and strengthened against the rule of reason, and harder to be repressed, by continuance of time, than they were before.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Wel then, put al this togither (my frind) and consider indifferently within thy self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more likely, that thou shalt rather make this resolution heerafter, than now.

act of Christ, which maketh no general rule: even as we see, that a temporal prince pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth somtime a malefactor, when he is come to the very place of execution: yet were it not for every malefactor to trust therupon. For that, this is but an extraordinarie act of the prince his favor, and neither shewed nor promised to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> al men. Besides this, this act was a special mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle reserved for the manifestation of Christ his power, and glorie at that hour upon the crosse. Again, this act was upon a most rare confession, made by the theefe in that instant, when al the world forsooke Christ, and <note n="*" place="margin">The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virgin likewise, &amp; other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women were by: but said nothing (that we read of) in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: a plaine breach of the first, fift, sixt, and ninth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> the apostles themselves, either dowted, or lost their faith of his Godhead. Beside al this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of this theefe was at such a time, as he could neither be baptised, nor have further time of amendement. And we hold, that at a mans first conversion there is required no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to beleeve, and to be baptised. But it shal not be amisse to put to Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens very words upon this matter. For thus he writeth.</p>

Secondlie, shew me the faith of that theefe in thy selfe, and then promise to thy self his felicitie. The devil doth put into thy head this securitie, to the end he may bring thee to perdition. And it is unpossible to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber al them, which have perished by the shadow of this deceitful hope. He deceiveth himselfe, &amp; maketh but a jest of his own damnation, which thinketh that Gods mercie at the last day shal help, or releeve him. It is hateful before God, when a man upon confidence of repentance in his old age, doth sin the more freely. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie theefe wherof we have spoken, happie (I say) not for that he laid snares in the way, but for that he tooke hold of the way it selfe in Christ, laieng hands on the pray of life: and after a strange maner, making a bootie of his own death: he (I say) neither did defer the time of his salvation wittingly, neither did he deceitfully put the remedie of his state in the last moment of his life: neither did he despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately reserve the hope of his redemption unto
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:6188:199"/>
the hour of his death: neither had he any kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege either of religion, or of Christ before that time. For if he had, it may be, he would not have been the last among the apostles in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which was made the former in kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 By these words of Saint Austen we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished (as you see) that this particular fact of Christ maketh no general rule of remission to al men: not for that Christ is not alwais ready to receive the penitent as he promiseth: but, for that every man hath not the time or grace to repent, as he should, at that hour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hath been declared before.

And although they do not absolutely condemn it in al, but do leave it as uncertain unto Gods secret judgement: yet do they incline to the negative part: and do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge four reasons, for which, that conversion is to be dowted, as insufficient for a mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                        </note>21 The first reason is, for that the extreme fear, and pains of death, being (as the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher saith) the most terrible, of al terrible things, do not permit a man, so to gather his spirits and senses, at that time, as is required for the treating of so weightie a matter with God, as is our conversion, and salvation. And if we see often, that a very good man cannot fix his mind earnestly upon heavenly cogitations, at such time as he is troubled with the passions of cholik, or other sharp diseases: how much lesse in the anguishes of death can a worldly man do the same, being unacquainted with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:6188:200"/>
that exercise; and loden with the guilt of many, and great sins; and cloied with the love both of his bodie, and things belonging therunto?</p>

                        </note> for that the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which a man maketh at the last day, is not (for the most part) voluntarie, but upon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and for fear: such as was the repentance of Simei, who having greevously offended king David, in time of his affliction: afterward when he saw him in prosperitie again,<note place="margin">2.

                           <hi>The third reason.</hi>
                        </note> for that the custome of sin, which hath continued al the life long, is seldome remooved upon the instant, being grown into nature it selfe, as it were, for which cause God saith to evil men, by the prophet Ieremie; <hi>If an Ethiopian can change his blak skin,</hi>

                        <hi>or a leopard his spots, that are on his bak: then can you also do wel, having learned al dais of your life to do evil.</hi>

                           <hi>The fourth reason.</hi>
                        </note> for that the acts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu themselves cannot be of so great valu with God, in that instant, as if they had been done
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:6188:201"/>
in time of health before. For what great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it (for example sake) to pardon thine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at that time, when thou canst hurt them no more? To give thy goods away, when thou canst use them no more? To abandon thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, when thou canst keepe hir no longer? To leave off to sin, when sin must leave thee? Al these things are good and holie, and to be done by him, which is in that last state: but yet, they are of no such valu, as otherwise they would be, by reason of this circumstance of time, which I have shewed. B. * A fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might be taken of experience: for that we see oft times, that such as repent after that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if they recover again, they are afterward as bad as they were before, and somtimes much woorse: which (without quaestion) was not tru repentance in them.</p>
                     <p n="25">25 These are reasons why there is such dowt made of this last conversion: not for any want on Gods part, but on theirs, which are to do that great act. Mark wel (saith one again) what I say: and (it may be) it shal be needful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound my meaning more plainly, least any man mistake me. What say I then? That a man which repenteth not, but at the end shal be damned? I do not say so. What then? Do I say he shal be saved? No. What then do I say? I say, I know not: I say, I presume not; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise not; I know not. Wilt thou deliver thy selfe foorth of this dowt? Wilt thou escape
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:6188:201"/>
this dangerous, and uncertain point? Repent then whiles thou art whole. For if thou repent while thou art in health, whensoever the last day shal come upon thee, thou art safe. And why art thou safe? For that thou didst repent in that time, wherin thou mightest have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But if thou wilt repent, then when thou canst sin no longer: thou leavest not sin, but sin leaveth thee.</p>
                     <p n="26">26 And heer now would I have the careful Christian to consider (with me) but this one comparison that I wil make. If those which do shew a kind of repentance at the last day, do passe hence notwithstanding in such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dowtfulnes: what shal we think of al those which lak either time, or ability, or wil, or grace to repent at al, at that hour? What shal we say of al those, which are cut off before? Which dy suddenly? Which are striken senseles, or fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik, as we see manie are? What shal we say of those, which are abandoned by God, and left unto vice, even unto the last breath in their bodie? I have shewed before out of Saint Paul,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> that ordinarily sinners die according as they live. So it is as it were a privilege for a wicked man, to have his repentance to be begun, when he is to die. And then, if his repentance (when it doth come) be so dowtful, what a pittiful case are al others in? I mean the more part, which repent not at al: but die as they lived, and are forsaken of God in that extremitie,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:6188:202"/>
according as he promiseth, when he saith; <hi>For that I have called you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prou. 1. Iere. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>and you have refused to come; for that I held out my hand, and none of you would vouchsafe to looke towards: I wil laugh also at your destruction, when anguish and calamitie commeth on you.

When he can live no longer, he wil promise any pains: what hearing or studieng of the word of God you wil; what toil or labor in his vocation you wil; what praier you wil; what fasting you wil; what alms deeds you can desire; what austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie you can imagin, he wil promise it (I say) upon a condition that he might have life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: upon condition that the day might be prolonged unto him: though if God should grant him his request (as many times he doth) he would perform no one point therof: but be as careles, as he were before.

Their bodies may not bear it: they can take no pains in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral callings: and in the general they cannot fast; they cannot watch; they cannot praie. They cannot leave their disports, recreations, and merry companions: they should die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently (as they say) with melancholy, if they did it: yet in their harts they desire (forsooth that they could do the same, which seeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, no dowt (say they) God wil accept our good desires.

                        <hi>Desires do kil the slothful man</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>his hands wil not fal to any work: al the day long he coveteth and desireth: but he that is iust, wil do, and wil not cease.</hi>

Of these men then saith the wise man; <hi>How long wilt thou sleep, O slothful fellow? When wilt thou rise out of thy dream?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pro. 6. &amp; 24</note>

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 52.</note> And the prophet saith of the like; <hi>They shake for fear, where there is no fear.</hi> These men do frame unto themselves strange imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the service of God, &amp; dangerous events, if they should follow the same. One saith; If I should give much; it would without dowt make me a begger. Another saith; If I should stil imploy my selfe to painful labor, it would kil me ere long. A third saith; If I should hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my selfe as is required, every bodie would tread me under their feete.

If you alledge him al the reasons in the world, why we ought to serve God, and why we ought not to offend, and dishonor him: he is not mollified by this consideration of piety. If you would request him and beseech him with tears, even on your knees: he is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If you threaten Gods wrath against him: he yeeldeth nothing therunto. If God scourge him in deed: he waxeth furious, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth much more hard than before. If God bestow benefits on him: he is ungrateful. If he counsel him for his salvation: he obeieth not. If you tel him of Gods secret, and severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: it driveth him to desperation, and to more crueltie. If you allure him with Gods mercie: it maketh him dissolute. If you tel him of his own filthines, he blusheth not. If you admonish him of his perils: he feareth not. If he deal in matters towards men: he is proud
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:6188:216"/>
and uncurteous. If he deal in matters towards God: he is rash, light, and contemptuous. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he forgetteth whatsoever hath passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him towards other men, either in reward of godlines, or in punishment of sinners. For the time present, he neglecteth it, nor maketh any account of using it to his benefit. And of things to come, either of blisse, or miserie, he is utterly unprovident: nor wil esteem therof, lay you them never so often, or vehemently before his face. And what way is there then to do this man good?</p>

                        </note> that there are two kinds of harts in men, the one a fleshlie hart, which bleedeth if you but prik it: that is, it falleth to contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, repentance, and tears, upon never so smal a chek for sin. The other is a stonie hart, which if you beat and buffet never so much with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, you may assoon break it in peeces, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bend it, or make it to bleed. And of these two harts in this life dependeth al our miserie, or felicitie for the life to come. For as God when he would take vengeance of Pharao, had no more greevous way to do it, than to say; <hi>Indurabo cor Pharaonis: I wil harden the hart of Pharao.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 4.7.14</note> That is (as Saint Austen expoundeth) I wil take away my grace,<note place="margin">

Of which, as other ages have ever given suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient testimonie; so this of ours doth most plentifully witnes the same: being so much more fruitful and abundant therin, as it hath pleased God to blesse it with so rare and singular a light of the truth, as (to our knowlege) he never yet bestowed on others. Therfore among us also there are, and those very many, that have taken this argument in hand, and have done so wel therin, that God is glorified, the church is increased, and themselves have gotten a reverend aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation among the people of God therby.

So commeth it to passe, that whatsoever I shal do therin, according to the smal talent that God of his goodnes hath bestowed on me, may seem to be needlesse, and as it were to come out of season, when the church is so wel stored alreadie, with such persuasion; and others long since, seem to themselves halfe cloied therwith. Neverthelesse, seeing that now I was purposed to get foorth this booke of Resolution that goeth before, which so treateth of godlines of life, that (in a maner) it maketh no mention of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or faith (as also it appeereth that the author himselfe was (in some things) of a contrarie judgement to us therin) I thought the case it selfe to be such, as that it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to say somwhat therof, as before in the preface I have declared.<note place="margin">

The reason why they ought to join in profession with vs, is for that it becommeth and behooveth the church of God (in many respects) to be at unitie in it selfe; and yet the case so standeth in this matter, that we are not able in our profession to yeeld unto them; but they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wel may, and of dutie ought to accord unto us. It becommeth and behooveth the

church of God to be at unitie in it selfe, for so many good and substantial causes, that it needeth no confirmation at al: insomuch that it shal not be needful to bestow any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the prooving of it.

                     </note> The reason why we may not yeeld unto them, is for that there can be no other account made of the matter, but that the benefit we should get therby, would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie little; and the inconvenience that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth withal, marvelous great.<note place="margin">

                     </note> The benefite that we should get therby, seemeth to rest but only in a certain persuasion, that we should be in better case, than now we are. For whether we should be so or not, that must needs (as yet) lie in question betwixt us. But this is very tru in deed, that if we were of their profession, then should we be with them persuaded, that our estate were so much the better. And our estate would then seem to be bettered, both for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our salvation in the world to come: and in some things that do concern this present life.<note place="margin">

                     </note> For as touching our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we should account our selves more sure of it, bicause that then we should imagin our selves to have, the mediation and help of angels, and saints in heaven; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6188:224"/>
of our own and other mens merits on earth: wheras by the profession that now we are of, we so rest in Iesus Christ alone, that we seeke for no help by any of those. And if Iesus Christ be not only sufficient to work our salvation (which themselves do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denie) but also sufficient in himselfe, not going out of his own person for any part of his sufficiencie, but keeping only to his own merits and mediation, having no respect at al to the mediation or merits of any others (which also I think very few of them wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, though when they have granted it, they are fain somtime to borrow it again, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the doctrine of those other helps) what special advantage is it to us, for to have any mo besides, when we have inough and inough only in him? For although it were not il to mingle any other with him (which at this present we wil not urge) yet if be but more than needeth, it can be no special be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite to us. He that hath wel dined alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, can very little be holpen by more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of meat, be it never so good, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise welcome unto the taste. Now that Christ is sufficient, even in himselfe, without the help of any other, if it be not in the scripture so plainly set down, and so derived through al antiquitie in the judgement of any, but that stil they wil hold it needful to seeke unto others so far as before they were

                     </note> The things that do belong to this praesent life, wherin it might seem our estate might be bettered, are of two special sorts; wherof some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our inward; and one other concerneth our outward government.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>First of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                     </note> Our inward comfort may seem might be increased un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that profession, two principal wais. First, that then we need not fear the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or curse of the bishop of Rome, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we are now, and long have been; then, for that they have a more copious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation (as they take it) of heavenly comforts than we; for that in sacraments, and ceremonies they far exceed us; and have that use of images also, wheras we have none at al. First, therfore concerning the Popes curse, we do not find it now to be of that force, that heertofore we thought it to be; neither by the word of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by experience it selfe. And if we have little cause to fear it, and then (proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) fear it as little; surely it were no great pleasure to any of us, to be delivered from the hurt therof, that doth not hurt us; nor from the fear of that, wherof we stand in no fear at al. As for the spiritual censure of the church, rightly proceeding against any, we know it is to be feared indeed, of those whom it toucheth. But we are long since
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6188:225"/>
persuaded, that we can so distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two, that we need not take the one for the other. Then as touching those further representations of spiritual comfort (such as they are) which they (I grant) have mo than we, we find no such substance in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them (neither in that they have both sacraments, and ceremonies mo than we; neither in that themselves alone have al the images, and we are utterly void of any) but that we may think our selves to be wel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, with those that we have, although of one sort we have none at al: and can further hope likewise, that if themselves had no mo than we, their inward comfort should be so much the greater. For if in the examination of them, it should fal out, that they have no sufficient groundwork in the word of God (as we are sure, that they have there no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at al) then are they but very cold, and desperate comforts, and never yeeld any sound comfort at al. For though we are not in any dowt, but that they are in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects very il, as they are used by them: yet now we say no more but this, that (al things considered) we find so little comfort in them, that we need not think the want to be great, now that we are without them; nor, that it were any great benefite, for to obtain them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Then of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </note> The benefite that in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward government we should get therby, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6188:225"/>
no more than this, that so we should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of the bishop of Rome; which how good it should proove, I am not able certainly to say. But if first we should esteeme therof by reason, we may very wel dowt, that no one man were able to govern us wel, that should rule al the world besides; notwithstanding al the under-magistrates that could be appointed: and that although some one man could do it, by his rare and singular wisdome (which notwithstanding were such a thing, as never was yet) yet that it were in no wise convenient for so many, and al the whole to hang upon one; and such an one too, as might somtime be so weak a man to bear such a burden, as that many others under his government, might be found much stronger than he. Then, if we come unto experience, and lay before us in what sort he governed us before, when as he had us under his government; or in what sort he governeth yet, those that abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience; whether any thing may be said more hardly or not, as yet I say not; but surely thus much we may be bold to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide by, that in comparison of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which we are now, it were no very singular benefite to be holpen bak to that other again. So for ought that yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth, we cannot see, that any great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite could come unto us, if we should turn
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6188:226"/>

Where first of al we cannot like that we should be so much deprived of the scriptures themselves, as under them we were: partly by the laws that they made against such as should read them, otherwise than themselves thought good; and partly, for that they do so much inhibite al translations in our vulgar toong. Which one thing only we take to boad ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much il, and whatsoever after insueth, to come almost only of it.

                     </note> In matters of religion; first, we dowt that our selves should be much therby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and be occasion to many others, to fal to the same corruption likewise: then also, that on the consciences of many, there should be laid over greevous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Our selves might be corrupted by their profession, two principal wais: in the aestimation of Gods goodnes to us: and in the performance; of our dutie to him. The goodnes of God toward us, is infinite; but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6188:226"/>
now we have to enter no further into the consideration therof, than to this present purpose doth appertain. And that is only in these two things; first, in the work of our redemption; then, in his providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in other matters.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>How it were dangerous in the work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be of that professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them</hi>
                     </note> In the work of our redemption, Christ hath both satisfied for us to the justice of God; and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al himselfe directeth us, towards the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof. In both these points we dowt very much, that by joining with them in their profession, we should be found blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to God, and very hurtful to our own souls health; first, in joining (and that no further, than their selves do) either the sufferings, or else the good works, of any of the saints, in heaven or on earth, with the sufferings, and merits of Christ; then by helping our selves unto it, by the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of angels, or saints, or by the doctrines of men on earth, only so far as themselves do it; and not seeking the same alone by the mediation of Christ, and by the written word of God. For we take the satisfaction of Christ, his mediation, and word to be such, as that, no other satisfaction, mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or word can be found, any thing meete to be so far matched withal. Again, we find not, that the work of redemption that is wrought in Christ, is available to the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any, but only of those, that so cleave
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6188:227"/>
unto it, that they utterly renounce al other helps whatsoever they are. In the former therfore, we see not how it may be avoided, but that needes we must be found to have done great dishonor to Christ; in the other we are persuaded that we should clean over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw our own salvation.

And although we willingly grant, that in divers of these they use such limitation withal, that it seemeth they would be loth for to go over-far ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet, going but so far as they do in their common profession, we see not how we could avoid it, but that if we should join with them therin, we should be far amisse persuaded in that comfortable doctrine of Gods most gratious providence towards us.<note place="margin">

Wheras notwithstanding to make any other media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in such respect, though it be not with Christ betwixt God and us, but only under Christ betwixt him and us, is either directly against, or without the warrant of the word of God.

                     </note> that by our example should take occasion to do likewise: either such as presently live besides us; or the generation that after followeth. For we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of times, that of those that live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,

one doth cast his eie to another, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nation unto the people that doth dwel about them, and make the doings of others a rule for them to walk by; and the same in the service of God, as much (almost) as in any thing else.

If we therfore should give an il example to any of these, either in leading them to do such things in the service of God as were offensive to him; or else no more, but tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, in like sort to venture, in so weightie a matter: how should we be able to excuse our selves, but that we have given them just cause of offence, in laieng such a stumbling stone in the way, that we see they are disposed to walk? And though by the grace and goodnes of God, they would be more warie, and not stumble therat; yet were our fault nothing the lesse, &amp; for to be aesteemed no lesse than murder before him: as Christ himself we know pronounceth an heavie sentence against al those, byw hom there commeth offence to any; that <hi>It were much better for him, that a milstone were hanged about his nek &amp; he cast into the bottom of the sea,

Those that appertain generally to al, are first those heaps of traditions and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which they have abundantly laid upon al men, calling them the traditions of the church, and teach, that al are bound of conscience, inviolably to keepe and observe them every one. Of which sort, though some be sorted unto certain principal feasts and times of the yeer; yet others there are that so commonly hant every weeke, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every day; and are so plentifully pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, throughout our whole life, almost in al things that we are to take in hand, that it is not possible for any to walk uprightly therin, nor ever sufficiently to attend the greater things of the law of God.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is an heavie burden, that al men are bound, so to confesse as they require, both for that they must disclose unto them the very secrets of their harts; and are bound to rekon up al their sins, so far as possibly they can remember; else that they are excluded from al hope of forgivenes. Wherof, the one is very greevous, and abhorring the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the best men that are; the other more, then any man can at any time find,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6188:229"/>
that he hath done fully indeed; both which are unknown to the word of God (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needles) and yeeld no way of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at al; but only a way to torment the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for themselves to practise upon. These that are more proper to some, are cast upon them diversly: somtimes upon some special occasion; somtimes by reason of that kind of life, that the parties are entered into. Of the first I note but one: that is, the burden that they lay upon those, which have confessed their sins unto them. Which commonly they cal poenance,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and ever lightly hath one of these faults: either that the poenance it selfe is wrong (being for the most part, either rigorous, or frivolous; or else that the parties are taught to seeke out forgivenes therin. Of that which is cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, by reason of the trade of life, that they are entered into, I note these two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal branches?<note place="margin">

The former of which (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to speak of the woorst of it) yeeldeth nought else but a fruitlesse labor, such as God never accepteth for any part of his service at al, and yet oft times very tedious, and painful in it selfe, if they follow their rule indeed, and coast not over some neerer

                  <p n="3">3 But in matters of religion (it may be) the controversies seem so dowtful,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that we cannot charge them with any such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience on their side, but that in their judgement they think themselves able to turn it over to us again, as easilie as we did lay it to their charge before. And we also wil be content, to set by religion for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and al matters of faith whatsoever, as if in that respect there were no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at al to be feared; and now consider those things alone, that do concern our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile estate heerin this life; not persuading our selves to the contrarie, but that divers there are, that would be content to join with them in matters of religion, if therby they should bring to themselves no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in this. For divers indeed do not so much respect religion, or looke not so narrowly to the diversitie of these professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that they can be reasonably wel content with either, if in other things: they have their minds contented. Be it therfore, that whatsoever their profession be, yet shal they have many of those that now are with us to join with them, if in this point there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6188:230"/>
be found no lawful impediment, or matter to stay them. But heer, even at the first, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth a mightie let: which is, that no man (we think) can be of that profession, unlesse he be under that government too. Could their church, and court be sundered; could their religion and regiment be parted, the one from the other; then indeed I think that (with many) much might be done; but when as these go so close togither, that no man can professe the one, but that he must be under the other, that goeth (as we take it) somwhat hard with many, that otherwise would finde no scruple at al. And two things there be, wherin we think we have very good cause to finde our selves greeved in that respect; one, that they extend the authoritie therof, so far forth as they are woont to do; the other, that they wil seem to do it upon such ground as they praetend. They stretch out their authoritie we think over far;<note place="margin">

                     </note> first, against al those that are in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign authoritie in their own several countries or kingdomes; then against al other inferior persons generally. With princes, &amp; those that are in highest place in their several states, we think they are a great deal to bold, both in abasing them so much as they do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they do so much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the government of themselves, and their people.

How much higher than kings and princes, and the greatest states of Christendome besides, the bishops of Rome have claimed to be, and according (when opportunitie hath served) have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them, is a thing so very manifest, that I need not to stay therupon; especially when as the remembrance therof is such, as I think many of themselves are loath to hear of, &amp; so might be somwhat irksom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

                     </note> Concerning the ground-work wherupon they wil seem to build their doings in al such cases, that do we finde (in our judgement) so very weak, that although it be greefe inough to be so pinched by that usurpation, as within fresh remembrance we were; yet is this no smal increase of the same, that they wil needs go about to bear us down, that the grounds that they stand on, are very sound, substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and firm. For (by their patience) what may we think? May any suppose, that they themselves are so persuaded? Italian heads (indeed we finde) are of deepe devise; but it would greeve the simplest of al, to be so very plainly <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lluded, in so weightie matters. For their grounds they praetend these two things; that such authoritie should of right appertain to the bishop of Rome; and that accordingly he hath been in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it. That it should belong unto him, somtimes they alledge some reason for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6188:232"/>
it; but for the most part, authoritie only. Their reason is, that it is expedient, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful it should so be. But first they should have considered, whether it had been possible, or not, for the whole world to be kept under the soveraign authoritie of any one. Their authorities they bring, partly out of the word of God: but cheefly out of certain councels, and fathers. For their possessions they alledge Constantines gift; and certain practises of their own, that have been since of latter time. Al which things are so very wel known, that I need not but point unto them. But are these so firm, and substantial groundworks, as they would seem to think that they are? Let them be of what valu they can be; we can hardly be persuaded, but that many of those that did first alledge any of these, did it for that they were disposed to abuse the simplicitie of many others. So we see the force of this inconveniencie, to be very sore: and we finde no cause to condescend therunto; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we are very fowly abused, in those causes that are alledged. And then, what reasons have they so forcible to persuade any, to be of their church, when as therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they must needs be under their court likewise, which is so irksome and greevous a thing. Vnlesse we may hope that they would be content, to allow us to be of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6188:232"/>
profession, and yet notwithstanding free from their government. Of which (I think) we may very wel dowt, for that as yet we do not see them to grant that libertie to any other. Insomuch, that as it was said of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, after that his own child also was slain, in that slaughter of other infants that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, that it was better to be his pig, than his child; so may it (we think) in this respect as truly be said, that it is better to be none of the Popes frinds, to injoy this freedome that now we have; than with his frinds to have it denied, and to be in such bondage therby as they are.</p>

And if any there can be found, that do more aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don al other means in heaven and earth

For as for that, which is indeed the strongest that they have against this point of doctrine, that so we should seeme to hold, that God were some author of sin: we hold it not, neither can it follow therupon. We know that God is verie wel able to cleere himselfe: and we our selves (in some good measure) do see, how he may very easily do it: distinguishing betwixt the deed it selfe, which is ever good, and of God; and the qualitie therof, which somtimes is infected by Sathan with evil.

And this latter, not onlie to avoid the offence of Gods majestie: but also to avoid the mispending of our time in such works, as are needles, or at least uncertain, while we might occupie our selves in such, as we know to be sound indeed.

For first as touching those tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and observations that they lay on al generally, seeing the word of God doth therfore acquite us of al other affairs, to the end, that we should better attend his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: we in like sort, that would gladly do our service to God, should therfore count it a special benefit to be delivered from al such busines and works of others, as any way may incumber our labor therin.<note place="margin">

Otherwise to be found to reckon up our sins to another, and to reckon them al, or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6188:235"/>

Their poenance was oft times very hard, very dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our lives, or very chargeable unto our estate; and yet could never yeeld any sound comfort at al: and therfore it is the greater benefit, for to be rid of so heavie, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les a burden.<note place="margin">

In the place of al which, if we have that, which in everie kind is more agreeable to the word of God, then have we a double advantage therby: both for that we are delivered from that which is wrong; and are restored (at least somwhat neerer) unto our ancient right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And surely (we think) we cannot be charged, but that we do allow al those works, traditions, and ceremonies, that are by the written word to us commended. If in other things we use the libertie that God hath given us, although that therin we may be charged, in divers things, not so much to aesteem of certain traditions of the church,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6188:235"/>
as themselves do, or would think that we should: yet notwithstanding, those things are of such nature, as that seeing God hath left us our libertie in them, it may therby seem, both that we are excusable therin, and that God would have no bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science clogged withal. So our profession yeldeth this benefit, which theirs doth not, that the ancient faith is kept more pure from other mixtures: and the consciences of men more freed, from the venturous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of humane wisdom.</p>

                     </note> The experience of these dais doth plainly witnes, that God is marvelous gratious to those that professe the Gospel, and labor to reform their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings therby: especially in this country of ours, which hath now injoied these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeers, the most peaceable and the most blessed time, that ever it can be found to have had since that the land was first inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. And no matter at al, though many of them that are our adversaries, are in wilful

banishment abroad, or else restrained of some part of their libertie at home. For though themselves be not partakers of any such special blessednes: yet notwithstanding they might if they would (as others of their fellowes are) reserving their consciences to themselves, and conforming their outward demeanor no further, than is needful for the common tranquilitie of al, and as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might lawfully do (aswel as their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes) without impeachment to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their profession. And were not their frinds partakers of it, and that in large and plentiful maner, neither could those that are of the Seminaries abroad, nor those that are in prison at home, live so delicately, and have things at pleasure so much as they have: much lesse be made the richer therby. Insomuch that even in their exile, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment too, the beams of this sun that now I speak of, do reach unto them so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, that they are very warm therby; and may not deny, that in the greatest miserie that they have, they finde very good, and large tokens, that this land is blessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.<note place="margin">

                     </note> The reasons that I speak of, are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two; one of them grounded on the goodnes of God; the other on the nature of that kind of government that we have among us.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>First of the goodnes of God.</hi>
                     </note> Concerning the former, it is known wel inough, that God is ever prone
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6188:236"/>
of himselfe, to do good unto those, that seeke the advancement of his glorie. And howsoever it be with others, that either are enimies, or but sorrie frinds to the Gospel; yet shal it surely go wel with those, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely are bent to advance the same. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be with the residu of the children of Israel; yet the tribe of Iuda shal not be wrapped in the like confusion with others; but ever be more safely praeserved, and more comfortably governed, until the comming of Christ himselfe. In other places may we see the people groning under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; al on heaps, and clean out of order; yea; and very often, their cities destroied, the people slain, the country laid wast, and the princes themselves utterly shaken out of their thrones. But (God be thanked) there is a better, and a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shew in this age of ours, among al those that professe the Gospel: while others are exceedingly troubled in the depth of the sea, these are in safe and quiet harbor. Let the kingdome of God, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes therof be cheefly regarded; and al things else wil insu therupon, to the ful contentation of our harts desire.<note place="margin">

                     </note> In the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the government that is among us, we finde two principal things; that we are governed by one of our own nation; and that we are governed at home in our own

country.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>For that we are governed by one of our own nation.</hi>
                     </note> For in that that one of our own nation is ever in soveraign authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, it is a special benefit to us in these two points: first that such are woont to govern, among their natural subjects, a great deal more mildly, and more favorably than either others would do, or themselves either in other places. Provinces or forrein parts of kingdomes, are ever kept more hardly under, than those that are in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts therof, if the princes be of one, and the selfe same nation with the people themselves. For princes that are far distant from some parts of their kingdoms, are not wel able to hold those parts in ful subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only by rough and hard dealing. So commeth it to passe that they suffer none of themselves to be in any special authoritie among them; and besides that, restrain their liberties; drie them with exactions; and do (upon every smal occasion) very sore execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on them. Of al which we had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, under the bishop of Rome his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment heer. Then also wheras it is the maner of princes to impose paiments upon their subjects, as oft times it is needful to do, to the common use of them al; it is no hard matter with subjects; willingly to part with such paiments, so long as they go not out of the realm to the maintenance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein power, but are imploied, to the honor,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6188:237"/>
and defence, of themselves at home. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if our treasure were carried foorth, and then imploied against our selves (as heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very oft hath been seen) it were no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if the people were very loath to make those paiments; when as even now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of such unreasonable exactions before, doth make the justest paiments that are somwhat irksome somtimes unto the people, on whom they are laid.<note place="margin">

In which one thing there were two discommodities that are very great: one to the hinderance of justice; the other to the discommoditie of the parties besides. Iustice must needs be hindered therby, for that there could be (so far off) no sufficient knowledge of the matter in many cases; and very hard, safely to carrie the proceedings of the courts heer, or whatsoever other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords were needful besides. Again, needs must it be to a further discommoditie of the parties, both bicause it could not be, but both a dangerous, &amp; a chargeable journey for themselves, and such as they should need to have with them; and very hurtful unto their own private affairs at home, by means of their so long absence abroad.</p>

                     </note> In religion, the truth is, that they shal not have in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that varietie of wais, or helps, that otherwise they suppose that they have in their own. For with us they should have no help at al in the martyrdome, bloodshed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or suffering of any saint, or of their own, to satisfie the justice of GOD for their sins; nor the good works that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or others have wrought, for to merit the kingdome of God. For these things should they have with us, no help at al? But only the sufferings, and merits of Christ. If they think this same would be some dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the sufferings and merits of saints; and a great discouragement unto al sorts, either to suffer, or to do good works; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I could say therunto, to shew that they need not so to gather, yet at this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6188:238"/>
I say no more but this; that whether this be any inconvenience, or not, such as it is, they should indeed light upon it, if they joined with us. So likewise in divers other matters that hang therupon, and are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie helps therunto, they would have some want both in heaven, and earth, of that which now they suppose with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they have. For in heaven they should have none at al, either to help them, but only God; or to be a mediator for them to God, but only Christ; and as for any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and Christ, the truth is, that we should allow them none. In earth likewise needs must they leese a great part of their direction, and comfort. For with us they should have no other direction, either of the heathen, or of the fathers of the church, whether it were but one by himselfe, or mo togither; but only the written word of GOD, absolutely, or without limitation; and the wisdome or learning of al the rest, only so far as may be grounded on the written word. And whatsoever comfort they have in their sacraments (having at lest five mo than we) or else in any of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praesentations of comfortable things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do very much exceed, both in their images, and many ceremonies besides; that (I say) must they be content to part withal, if they wil be of our profession; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal

content themselves, with the two sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments only; with few of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and with none of their images at al. In such things as belong to their civile estate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience they should have in their civile estate.</hi>
                     </note> the inconveniences that are, do either touch al generally; or else some one sort of them more than others. That which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth al generally, is (to my knowledge) no more but this, that so they might seem to be in danger, not to be governed wel, when as so they should not have any one on earth,<note place="margin">

                     </note> to hold altogither in one. And indeed, if it be needful, to have al countries, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and nations to be holden togither in one, by some one man heer on earth, that should be soveraign over al others; then it cannot be denied, but that in our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that inconvenience needs must they have. That which toucheth some sorts of them more than others, is divers; some that goeth against their credit; and some that hindereth much of their profit.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>No such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the common sort.</hi>
                     </note> The credit of many of them would indeed be touched, for that they should not be able by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to win that credit with the common multitude, as they may be able by theirs; and that in two principal points. First, their vowing of single life, &amp; excluding al others that would not, both from their preest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and from divers functions besides of special credit. For by this they might both
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6188:239"/>
have greater opinion of holines with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and be in better account of house-keeping besides, as not having, as no wife, so likewise no children, nor concubine nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wheron to bestow such things as they had. And it is very tru, that so doing, &amp; that in such sort as many of them did use it, they might keep better houses a great deal, for bicause that that way they were oft times at much lesse charges, than those that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried can attain unto; both bicause that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, neither had any children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, nor kept any concubines, but did their indevor truly to observe their vow; the residu, that had either concubines at the least, or else both concubines and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren too, yet were they not at such charges with them, as marriage requireth, neither yet would they for that by their more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous house-keeping, they saw that they had a ready way, therby to stop many of those mouthes, that otherwwise for incontinencie would be open against them. The other is, that they were so diligent in outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies &amp; observations: some of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great shew of holines towards God; others, of some terrible streightnes of life. Both which do indeed breed a great aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation among the common people, and are of such force, that somtimes they have made not only Iohn Baptist, but the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6188:240"/>
also, to be of better account than Christ, bicause he used his libertie and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in such cases; and lived (for such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward matters) more like to the common sort, than they. Concerning the profit that many of them have therby, it is very tru, it would decay; as namely with those that are either officers, or artificers that belong therunto; or but in prison (for their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake as they cal it) upon the advantage. For indeed it cannot be denied, but that many of them do live therby; as massing-priests, confessors, friers, singing men, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganists, waxchandlers, image-makers, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founders, and such like; and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of officers besides. Al which should be to seek (at least in respect of their former way of advantage) if that they should turn unto us. Their person I take to be touched only in this; that of many they should be taken for inconstant, and such as had light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned from their former profession; and it should be laid to their charge by some, that if they were right now, then were they wrong before, and so consequently had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many that hoong upon them. Which indeed could not be avoided (would they never so fain) if any of them should turn unto us.

And first as touching those that do hang on religion it selfe, we take it to be no inconvenience at al, to be excluded al other helps: and nothing dowt, but that by the sufferings and merits of Christ, we shal find the justice of God fully satisfied, both to the avoiding of everlasting judgement, and to the obtaining of life aeternal.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Neither do we think that it can be found to be any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace at al to the sufferings and merits of saints, to set them aside in the work of our redemption: when as notwhithstanding we do aesteem of them stil, both as notable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments in the church of Christ; and as woorthie examples for us to follow. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that we stand in no account of help by any of them, when as we account of al suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie in God alone, by Iesus Christ, we do not see, how there can be any want therby: &amp; having therin a delicate feast, we cannot in any wise have any stomak, to the scraps and crusts of a beggers poke, be the man himselfe never so honest, or his poke &amp; his scraps never so clean. And as for any other mediator betwixt God and us, we are sure inough, that we safely hold, that neither do we need any other: neither is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6188:241"/>
in heaven or earth, in such sort qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that he can be in any wise meet, to such a purpose; nor so minded, as that he would. As for any betwixt Christ and us, we think it great dishonor unto him, after that being verie God, he hath so far abased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as to be man for our sakes, and in that his manhood suffered for us such things as he hath: now to cal his goodnes towards us into any such dowt, as to conceive that it should be needful, or at the least that it were not amise, to have some mediator to him. And if it be not for any need or dowt of his goodnes; but onlie of reverence: that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (think we) is no reverence at al; but a faithlesse starting aside, proceeding from a conscience that being guiltie, nevertheles cannot repent, and therupon steppeth aside from the praesence of him whom it feareth. Their direction also that should wholie rest upon the written word alone, we take it to be so very sufficient towards that purpose for which we need it, that we need none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther besides: being alreadie by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the word it selfe so plainly given to understand, that the scriptures onlie are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach al truth, and to convince al error: to rebuke al vice, and to instruct in al godlines: that a Christian may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therby, and fully praepared to everie good work.

The Apostle saith, that in those things that we have alreadie, we may soundly rejoice; and that our joy therin may be such, as that it can receive no increase by any other. And then in such plentie and fulnes of it, how may we finde, that so smal things as those may anie thing eeke? What comfort is it to match those five sacraments of theirs in such account, with the other two, that the Lord did so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly ordain, to be in so common use with us? And when they have that aestimation given them, what new thing have we then by them that we had not before? Their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous ceremonies, and al their images may go togither, as never brought in at the first by the word of God, but long after by the foolish wisdome of man: the former of them (we think) a great deal more burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, than commodious unto them; the other not only burdenous, but offensive too, to themselues, and others; an evident corruption of the truth; and a just provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the wrath of God. If in such cases the hart shal have any sound comfort, it must rise out of some woorthier fountains, than either the wisdome of flesh and blood; or else, better warranted repraesentations, than images are.

                     </note> But as for those other things that follow (their credit, and profit, which before they had) therin I grant, that needs must they come to some want indeed. For if they abandon their forced chastitie, and use the lawful means of marriage; if they lay down their glorious ceremonies, and other observances of unprofitable hardnes; and whatsoever compendious practises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they used, to bring in their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie unto them: there is no quaestion, but that among the common sort, they should leese a great part of that aestimation and profit, that now they have verie long enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But it is no great matter, what others
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6188:242"/>
think of us, so that with God, and good men we have that credit that is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and we ought not to count al that a losse, whatsoever we cannot get howsoever; nor much stik to misse of that, which before we have wrongfully had. As for mariage we know that the children of the world do so uncleanly behave themselves both in their whooredoms, and in marriage also, that it is no marvel if they cannot think that the use of marriage, and the administration of holie things, may go togither, so long as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some reverence of the one, they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the other, by their own most shamful abuse. But the ordinance of God is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to stop the mouthes of al such, when they have said the woorst that they can. And as for house-keeping, if being married and having children for whom to provide, they be not able to bestow upon others so much as otherwise they might, that need to be no greefe unto them. Let every man do as he is able, and before God he shal be discharged. The stream that issueth by many branches, must needs be lesse in every one, than if al joined togither. So that we walk as we are called, it is inough; there can be no more required of any. As for outward worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and voluntarie streightnes in needles matters, it is no sound credit that they get unto any. God is worshipped in spirit and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6188:243"/>
truth; and such only they are in whom he delighteth. Wherunto if outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be added, such as are needful, then are they for the other, welcome withal: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they come, they are abhominable unto him, and never can his soul conceive any delight at al in them. Streightnes is good, &amp; a profitable labor, so long as it is imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in those things, that are commanded; but if it be but our own devise, it is of no account with God. For in such sort it is that many do strive, and yet are not able to enter in. And then, what gain we, to be in glorie among men; and to be abandoned of God? Their gain comming in, so as it doth, they need not think any losse at al, to be without it. Iudas loved the monie wel that he had gotten; but when he perceived how he came by it, by betraieng his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, &amp; consenting to shed innocent blood, he then could have no joy to keep it; and made no account of any losse, to throw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Their poore estate would yeeld unto them, a richer joy, and peace of minde, than al the treasures that by such means they were ever able to gather togither. Better a great deal, to feed on the coursest bread that we use; than on the finest manchet that is, after that once we finde it to be very ful of gravel. Last of al, though it were a shame for them to turn; yet were it none at al, but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6188:243"/>
only with those, that are gracelesse people; and very dangerous in so weightie a matter as this, to hold on our way, after that once we finde we are wrong. And why should the mire that lieth in the streets, be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be gilded over with gold? Why should wretched and sinful man be so desirous, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to let down his own aestimation? So God be glorified, let us not care, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of us. When as al glorie belongeth to him, there is none at al belonging to us. As an ornament, that is for a noble perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, wil not become a meaner person; so glorie likewise, that is only for God, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver become the children of men. But if needs they wil be in some aestimation, can they have greater, than by acknowledging their former wanderings, so much as nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the glorie of God, &amp; to the helping up of others again, who by them were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned to stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble before? So, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these inconveniences, which it seemeth they should fal into: yet the matter being better examined, it would soon appeer, that there is no such inconvenience in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as at the first might be feared to be. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse whether they be inconveniences or not, that do I leave unto them to think of. Those they are, whatsoever they are; be they of what valu they can. Such as they are, let them be for me; I wish them no greater,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6188:244"/>
neither do I labor to make them lesse, than in truth they are. And so consequently, if our profession be compared togither, this is the varietie that they do yeeld, and in these points resteth (whatsoever it is) al the ods that is betwixt us. Which being so, then it is no hard matter to judge, whether of them it is, wherin we may better settle our selves.</p>

The works therfore that may be available to justifie any in the sight of God, must needs be such as are in themselves a ful, perfect, and absolute righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes: for that otherwise they cannot stand in the justice of God. And absolute
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6188:244"/>
righteousnes can never be, but where every deed, word, and thought is very good; and that, in so high degree as is required: nor so neither, unles there be a continual tract of works, words, and thoughts, al our whole life without intermission. Other righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes though we have never so good, yet if it lak any one jot of this, it wil not serve us to this purpose. For the law requireth, both that such things should be done with al the hart, with al the soul, &amp; with al our strength: and that they never depart out of our harts, al the dais of our life. And that solemn diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive sentence of the law compriseth both verie breefly, when it saith, that Everie one is accused, that continueth not in al things that are written in the booke of the law, to do them. If now we would know where to find this absolute righteousnes, the truth is, that somtimes it seemeth that it might be found among men: and yet is no where to be found indeed to our use, but onlie in Christ. It may seem to be found among men, both for that the law requireth such things at our hands: and bicause that some there have been of special commendation for these matters. Howbeit, the law doth not require such things at our hands, as though that now we were able to do them: but to shew that once we were able, and therwithal, how far we are fallen from our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6188:245"/>
first integritie; and that God, that once made us able, may justly require at our hands the performance therof. And as for the best men that ever were, there is no quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but al were sinners, and that very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they daily offended. Besides al which, their good deeds also (but few to speak of) were so imperfect, for want of tru sinceritie and zeal (which never are found since the fal of Adam, in any of the children of men) that if God should deal in his justice only, and not in the depth of his mercie withal, not one of those works could ever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him. Hence is it, that the children of God acknowledge their uncleannes in al their wais, not only in such things as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly go under the name of sin; but in al their holines, and righteousnes besides: too high a point, for the children of the world to attain unto. In Christ we finde most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute righteousnes perfectly wrought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that there was never found any il in him, either proceeding foorth by his deeds, or words; or at any time lurking in his secret thoughts; and whatsoever he did or said, was ever most godly; wherunto the inward disposition of his hart, and al his thoughts did ever accord. And so must it needs be, for that he was both God and man. For so commeth it to passe, that the infinit excellencies of his Godhead, could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6188:245"/>
not have sufficient issu in his manhood to shew foorth themselves to the ful; but after they had thoroughly filled al his manhood with al perfection, and al the organs, and powers therof, needs must there be immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable abundance left besides; al which doth witnes, his manhood first to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly filled. So not only it might be, but also of necessitie it must be, and can be no other, but that he loved God with al his hart, with al his soul, &amp; with al his strength; and his neighbor as himselfe; that al his deeds, words, and thoughts, were ever good, and the same in most absolute maner, to the uttermost pitch, that the capacitie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was able to bear. How to procure righteousnes to our selves, to make it ours, is now to be seen. Where first if we come to that righteousnes that is of man, either of our selves, or others, we shal never be able to do any good. For first as touching our selves, wheras we are not able to fulfil the law, there is not in us any righteousnes at al to be had. If we could fulfil the whole law, (never offending in deed, word, nor thought; but ever having al our deeds, words and thoughts, fully answering to that holines, and righteousnes that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) then might we stand in the favor of God, by our own good works, without any help at al by Christ; and that by the vertu
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6188:246"/>
of the former covenant, commonly called the old Testament. But if we misse any point of this, though we do our best indevor, yet are we nothing holpen therby in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; bicause that God hath not covenanted to accept us as righteous, for doing our indevor therin; but only, by fulfilling the whole law in every point, to the uttermost jot. Neither can he in his justice accept of any other righteousnes, but that which is perfect; no more than the law wil adjudge any sum a just paiment, be it never so much, though infinit thousands, so long as there wanteth any one penie of that which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Then, if we seek unto others, those that now are saints in heaven, to have the help of their righteousnes, to make us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, neither have they any such as the law requireth, but are for that matter as short as we; neither did God at any time make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such covenant with any of us, that their righteousnes should stand us in any such steed. Now therfore to come unto Christ, in him only is that righteousnes to be had, that can serve our turn; and we have it in him, by none other means but only by faith. For wheras God hath made his other cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in him (which he calleth the new, and the last, bicause he never meaneth to make any mo besides) that wheras we cannot be justified before him, by any righteousnes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6188:246"/>
of our own, unlesse we were able to fulfil the law, and he therfore hath taken this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that his Son should do it for us, to the end that al that take hold therof, or rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, should have his holines and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes theirs; hence commeth it, both that such as rest in him, by the vertu of his latter covenant have his righteousnes theirs; and that they are not other wais justified, but only by taking hold on him by faith. For neither hath God made this righteousnes of Christ so common to al, that unbeleevers may have the benefit of it as wel as the faithful; neither hath he by this latter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant declared himselfe to be of purpose to justifie us, by the good works or merits of any, but only of Christ. In other things (without al quaestion) there is a special use, of our own good works, &amp; of the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that the blessed saints have given us; but in this our justification with God, there is no use of them at al.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>How the place of S. Iames may be answered.</hi>
                     </note> Now therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the place of Saint Iames, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to attribute our justification partly to our own works, and not only to faith in Christ, it is evident, that he doth not treat of this our first justification; but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to holines of life; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whatsoever he saith there, it is not to be heerunto applied. Wheras therfore the apostle Saint Paul, concludeth his dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6188:247"/>
of that matter, that <hi>We are iustified by faith, without the deeds of the law.</hi> And Saint Iames in like maner concludeth his, that <hi>Of works a man is iustified, and not of faith only.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may seem, at the first sight, that these two are directly contrarie one to the other, yet the circumstances of the places, and the intent and meaning of either of the Apostles, being considered, it is found very plainly, that they are not contrarie, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divers; that is, one of them doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that which is affirmed by the other, both speaking of one thing; but having two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral or divers matters in hand, ech of them holdeth on his own several way. For Saint Paul is in hand with a point of doctrine, to shew wherin our first justification consisteth before God; and Saint Iames is in hand with a point of exhortation to godlines of life, and to that end sheweth that our faith is but vain, unlesse that it be (in some good measure) fruitful by works. Wheras ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although they both speak of faith and justification, yet the one doth not mean ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that faith, or that justification that the other meaneth; hence may it sufficiently appeer, without any further discourse of the matter, that the one of them is not against the other. If Saint Iames had been of purpose to have shewed, how we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, he would have shewed no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6188:247"/>
other way, but only by faith in Christ Iesus: as in the chapter before he ascribeth the estate that we have in Christ not unto works, but to the free mercie of God. So on the other side, if Saint Paul had purposed to exhort to newnes of life, he would there have told us, as else-where he did, that though we had al faith, and had not love, yet al were nothing. So for the doctrine of justification likewise, I trust there is no such absurditie held by us, that any may have any just cause to fear to join with us therin.</p>

Those lesser hinderances likewise are divers. For some respect their persons especially: and one other there is, that somwhat respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the cause likewise. Those that do most properly respect their persons, are especially two: one that proceedeth from regard of their credit, which was somwhat touched before, as one of the inconveniences that heerby they should have; the other that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth certain hardnes that by bodily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment they suppose themselves to be put

                     </note> untouched as yet. And the discredit that they dowt would fal upon them, is partly with al generally: but especially with those with whom they have so long held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. For with al generally it is like to be some disgrace unto them, for that they have al so professed; and some of them besides have accordingly taught: but yet no such, as of right may hold them stil in the course that now they are in. For as touching their profession, it is very incident to the nature of man to be deceived, especially in the truth of religion. Howsoever we have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable good sight in other things: yet in this, the best of us al are far to seeke, for any thing that we have in our selves to help us withal. Neither are we only to seeke heerin; but also prone to conceive best liking of that which is wrong. But besides their own natural weaknes and inclination, they may wel remember, that the former dais were such, and their own proper education with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that whosoever is of any reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, wil easily pardon (for the former time) such wanderings unto them. For both those things are verie forcible to lead us away with them, whersoever there is not the special grace of Gods holie spirit, both for to teach us a better course, and to lead us therin. So with men, who are al of the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same mould, and have al had our parts of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6188:248"/>
that other infection besides, it is a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable matter, in religion to have held that course that they did: pardonable I say in respect of our own natural impotencie, and inclination; and of those dais of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that were before, togither with our education then, framed according to that praesent time. But if we come to these dais of ours, then is the case altered much. For now it hath pleased the goodnes of God, both to give them a more plentiful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his wil and pleasure; and to offer unto them a readier direction by his holie spirit: that so they may both see, and walk the way to his kingdome, so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Which diversitie of times and graces considered, they may easily resolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that it is no discredit unto them, to alter the course of their former ignorance, when as now, their eies being opened, they have found a better. In the night it is no shame at al, to go awry: in the day time it is a fowl and stark shame indeed, to hold on that course, and not to break it off with speed. Concerning those,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discredit to those that have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taught.</hi>
                     </note> that besides their own profession, have also taught the same unto others, it cannot be denied, but that they have done so much the more hurt: and that their auditorie and disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may charge them with great alteration now, if so they should alter their former
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6188:249"/>
course. Nevertheles, neither were their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doings to be denied their reasonable excuse, with al those that are indifferent: neither can they now continu on their course, but that needs they must therwithal impeach their credit, much more than if they had altered, with al that have attained unto the knowledge of the truth. For their former labors are the rather to be born withal, for that being then persuaded that they were right, it was their parts indeed to commend unto others, that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did think to be needful. But that now it is rather for their credit, to alter their course (besides that other before recited, which they have common with the rest) hence also may they gather, for that finding now, that they have done much hurt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it standeth them upon for to amend the same so soone as they can. The wound they have made, it were meet that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should heal again. Which if they should forsake to do, howsoever it would stand with their credit, or not, it were verie like for to procure them an heavie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the end. For the errors that they should so leave uncorrected, could not but infect manie others; and likely inough so to grow on to the end of the world: by which time, it is not to say what heaps of iniquitie might come therby. For al which they must
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6188:249"/>
needs stand chargeable, before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of God, unlesse while they live heer among us, they seek to amend al their errors delivered before. In which respect Augustine hath left them in his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a point of great wisdome, diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, or calling bak again, whatsoever points of doctrine he found, that he had unadvisedly delivered before; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as it seemeth, and himselfe in the praeface confesseth, thought no shame with it at al; as indeed it was a very good testimonie of his inward sinceritie; and so consequently, as much to his tru and just commendation, as any thing else that ever he did. If it be said that in him there was some further cause, for to retract much of that which he wrote before, both bicause he wrote very yoong; and before he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in the faith of Christ: tru it is indeed that so he wrote; but not so with al, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to them any such advantage. For the quaestion is not, whether Saint Augustine or they had more need to retract some of their opinions; but whether it be meete that those should do it, that have taught unto others that, which now they finde to be wrong. And thogh it were, yet I dowt much, whether upon sufficient advisement any of them would so far urge the ods betwixt them (either his youth to their yeers; or his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6188:250"/>
imperfection before his baptism, to their ripenes now) but that they would with good wil acknowledge, rather that it were their parts, if they have taught any erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous points of doctrine, with him to retract them, than to make any such allegation, that they need not do it so much as he.

And the more that their aestimation savoreth of it, the more quietly may they be able to beare the losse therof. If they be of our discontented countrimen at home, the losse also is so much the lesse, for that none such wil not mislike of them, but so far as themselves are infected with the inchanted cup of forrain power; and then, the more they are infected therwith, the lesse woorth is the best aestimation they are able to give. Again, whatsoever aestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is lost, either with forrain power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or with hollow harts at home; the same wil be much more requited with the

others therto; or stubbornly despise the word of God, are by the sentence of Gods own mouth, accounted woorthie to die the death; and though it may be, themselves do not see, that, by aequitie therof, they are in the danger of his justice for those; yet we are out of dowt that they are, and, but that we do alreadie know, that the blindnes of man is very great, we could not but woonder that they do not see it.

So notwithstanding that which is done of that kinde, we think there might be done much more than there is; and yet, that no bodie had any just cause to finde fault therwith. That certain points of their religion are now made treason, that so they cannot suffer as in cause of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but of high treason, it ought not to be so greevous unto them, if they consider wel, either the very nature of those points that are made treason; or but the maner of our proceeding therin. For some points of their profession are of the nature, as that they are rank treason indeed, to al the states
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6188:251"/>
that are in the world; &amp; that have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto themselves, of al the religions that are professed on the face of the earth. And this treason of theirs that we speak of, resteth especially in these two points; that the bishop of Rome hath power to depose the princes and potentates of the earth, and to place in their roomes whomsoever he wil; and that subjects ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in alleageance to any whom he depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, but to put on armor against them. Which we take to be as rank a treason, as wicked an haeresie, and as open a way to al confusion, as any that ever was heard of before. Neither doth it help them any thing, if he were indeed as they would have it, the vicar general of Christ on the earth: for that therby he might do no more (kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping within the bounds of his master) but only lay their sin to their charge, &amp; utterly exclude them from hope of salvation: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if they governed il; and subjects like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if they went with their princes against their obedience and dutie to God. But as for deposing the one, or loosing the other from their alleageance, in those points we are sure, that they are not only misliked of us, but of many others besides, that other wais are wel willers of theirs. In the maner of proceeding that in this point is used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, there are two points likewise
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6188:252"/>
to be noted. For first as touching the law it selfe, it is in effect but certain ancient sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that were made long since, revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and not sought unto, til that by many naughtie practises, and some rebellions, open forces, and slaughters contrived, we were of necessitie rather constrained, than easilie induced, to take that order; and that for the praeservation of the whole, both in religion, and civile tranquillitie. Then also it is very wel known, that although they have been never so faultie therin, and so have justly deserved to die: yet if they can be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their practising, and utterly renounce and abandon the same, they stand not in such danger of death by their former deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as in the hope and way of life, by their new repentance, if it appeer to be unfeined, as wel as their guiltines sufficiently prooved. The dealings that they use towards us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What it is that they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards us.</hi>
                     </note> is first the rigor that they put us unto, when time did serve them (and yet do, where they are able) in that they raised up persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us in the cause of religion: then also their disloial and unnatural practises now, to recover their former usurpation again. In that persecution of theirs against us, we think they then delt, and yet do, over-hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, for that the cause being no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was, yet notwithstanding their punishment was exceeding greevous. The
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6188:252"/>
cause we think was not so great, for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they persecuted us for nothing else, but either for some tradition of their own: or else for some thing that went against the earthly estate of the church of Rome, either in the commoditie that they supposed to be du unto it; or in the superioritie that they had obtained. Howbeit, neither of these (being better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered) wil be as we take it warrant inough for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to touch us so neer as they did. Their punishment was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, both in that they did to our persons, by imprisonment, torments, &amp; cruel death: and in that they made the cause haeresie, and so overwhelmed us with the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch that could be devised. Wheras not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, neither the traditions that the church appointeth, and wherof there may somtimes be had a verie good use; nor the profit or superioritie of their prelacie, are of that importance, that they may make them matter of death, nor haeretiks those that speak against them. When they saw it come to that point, even common charitie (me think) should have obtained thus much of them, that neither they would have urged their own traditions so far, nor stood so stiff to their profit or honor, but that the life of those their brethren might have obtained some mitigation: especially, when as the substance of christianitie may stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6188:253"/>
them, as in ancient time it is known to have done, for manie hundred yeers togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The practises that they use against us now, are so wel known unto al, and so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous (I think) to the greater and better part of themselves to hear of, that forsomuch as we do not use to greeve those whom we would persuade, it is not needful heer to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play them: although we take them so far to exceed in that kind, as that lightly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be over-matched, with any such like of the former ages. But it shal be sufficient for them to consider but this one point only, whether those practises of theirs be not so contrarie to the civile state, as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand togither; but that the establishing of the one, must needs be the overthrow of the other. If it be so (which I think they wil quikly finde) then may themselves also be able to gather, that such execution as now is done on certain of them, is not onlie just, but needful also; and such as in no wise might be omitted, til themselves do grow to better advisement.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>That our translations seem so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt unto them, as that they cannot think that we have the word of God among us.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 That other hinderance of the lesser sort, that doth somwhat respect the cause in variance betwixt us, is for that they wil seem to suppose (though indeed it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seemeth, that manie of them are not so persuaded: for which cause I have put this,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6188:253"/>
but among their lesser hinderances) that, how much soever we praetend to have the word of God to direct us in al our doings, yet, by the means of wrong translations, we have it nothing at al indeed: and therfore that it may stand with great probabilitie, that so much as we swerve from our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in those our doings, so much also should it seem that we swerve from the word of God it self. And this heertofore they have but seldom, and more faintly alledged: but now of late, they have avouched it with greater confidence, upon the hope of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground that they have conceived, by those quarreling labors of master <hi>Martin,</hi> and certain others of the Seminarie at Remes about the translation of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament that they have put foorth in the English toong. Wherin, how injurious they are unto us, and how far they have overslip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped themselves, although it do alreadie suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeer, both in the weaknes of their own doings; and in the labors of others therin (as also we trust, that so it wil yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeer, every day more than other:) yet to help forward the weaker (and those that are not able to judge of the toongs) by an easier way, I would wish them to be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better advised, what is the advantage they seem to have gotten therby, if the case so stood that we had been overseen in our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6188:254"/>
translations, in al those things that they lay to our charge; and that they had therin at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto the truer sense of the text. For though so it were, yet notwithstanding if we come to the matter, that is, to consider how weightie those points of religion are, that they would seem to have gained therby, although at the first they carrie with them a glorious shew: yet in truth their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would so also fal out to be very smal, both in respect of those places themselves, and in respect of al the residu that they leave unto us untouched by them. For if in those very places wherin they think they have special advantage against our translations, in the substance of the matter, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they gain little therby; then howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our translators have overslipped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet do our adversaries get therby no sound advantage, in respect of the cause that they do defend. So likewise if those places wherin they finde fault with us, be very few in respect of the rest that they leave untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, then do they both justifie our fidelitie in translating of them: and not only make themselves and their doctrines liable unto the trial of them; but also bar themselves for ever to lay to our charge, in so absolute maner as they do, that we have not the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures among us. For unlesse they can shew, that such as we have in such sort translated,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6188:254"/>
as that themselves do finde no fault ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, do not contain the effect and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Christian faith (which as yet I think, not one of them al did ever alledge, or lean unto for his warrant therin) it is not for them to lay to our charge (though in al those points we had been deceived) that we have not the word of God among us, so far as it is needful, for our ful instruction in the faith and doctrine of Christ. Therfore to let passe whether we have rightly transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or not, let us a little enter into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the matter it selfe, and see what advantage themselves may hope to have gotten therby. Which course if we take,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What it is, that they lay to our charge therin.</hi>
                     </note> then do we finde that in their discoverie they do charge us two principal wais: first, with divers things more specially by name, in the first twentie chapters; then with a pak of others togither (as matters belike of lesse importance) in two of the last. We are charged by name, first of al with our inward meaning that of purpose we translate the holie scriptures falsely, in favor of the haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that they suppose us to hold, in the first chapter: then with our open and plain dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, correspondent (as they say) to so il a meaning, in al the rest, unto the end of the twentith chapter. And hitherto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is good, and the order plain: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I set these things down, as they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6188:255"/>
stand there. In that which followeth, it seemeth that it was not the authors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to digest them into a method, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make recital of them, as they came to hand. Nevertheles, that to us both it may appeer more plainly; what they, or we have gained, or lost by our translations, in the pith or substance of religion; it shal be good for both parts, to lay them foorth in some plain &amp; easie method. Those doings of ours therfore that they charge us withal, do almost al concern our translations: but in some points they charge us, for to force the text is selfe. In our translations they finde some faults that concern the words alone: and some that concern the matter too. That which concerneth words only, is, that we turn the ecclesiastical use of them, into their original, but yet prophane significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Vnto which the fourth chapter wholy, and a good part of the sixt, are allotted. As that we cal schism, division; heresie, sect; catholik, general; preest, elder; preesthood, eldership; idols, images; church, congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; sacrament (in some places) secret; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, overseer; baptism, washing; and some others. That which concerneth the matter rather, is, that so we translate, as tendeth cheefly to the overthrow or discredit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers points of their profession: and partly to the maintenance of some of our own.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6188:255"/>
Those points of their profession, that we, as they say, go about to overthrow, do most of al concern matters of doctrine; but some of them tend to the direction of some part of our life heer. Those that concern mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of doctrine, are of two sorts. For in some they may seem to seek the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion only: in others, to advance the power, and excellencie that is in man. Those that concern the meer advancement of religion only, partly concern Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and partly, a few other holie things. Those that concern Christ himselfe, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his descending into hel, and are but two: one, that we seem to impugn that article of the common Creede; the other, that we seem to disallow of one special work that they suppose was done therby, that is, the bringing out of the fathers, which were as they think, in <hi>Limbo patrum,</hi> which we by our translations seem to discredit, both which are handled in the seventh chapter. Those holie things that I speak of are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacraments indeed; and partly certain other ordinances, which they would have to be of that account. In those that are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments indeed, they cheefly mislike in the one, that we partly take it clean away; and partly deprive it of the efficacie therof, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it woorse, or no better than those of the old law: in the other, that we take away the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6188:256"/>
blessing, and do not acknowledge the real praesence that they imagin. Wherof the former of these is in the fourteenth, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the seventeenth chapters. In those other holy ordinances, which are, poenance, confession, orders, and matrimonie, the fault that they finde with us, is cheefly this, that in our translations, we do not allow them the name and dignitie of sacraments; and in some points varie from them, even in the very nature of them: as appeereth in the 13.14.15. and 16. chapters. Those that tend to the advancement of the power and excellencie, that is in man, further than we can think convenient to go with them, partly concern the righteousnes of man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally; and partly some things that are more proper to the church alone. Vnto the righteousnes of man generally it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, that first, as touching man, they hold, both that in him there is freedome of wil, as in the tenth chapter; and that he is able, both to merit favor, as in the ninth; and to satisfie for sins, as in the thirteenth chapter: then, as touching God, that it is seemly for his justice likewise, to reward those works of man for the woorthines of them, as appeereth in the eight chapter. Those that concern the church, do partly concern the whole togither: and partly one special function in the same. Those
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6188:256"/>
that concern the whole togither are but two: one, that by other words we so open the name of the church, that therby we seem to go against it, chapter the fift: the other that we allow not of that authoritie, that they do think it should have in ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or giving credit to certain traditions, as delivered from the Apostles, as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter. Those that concern that one special function, do concern the office it selfe; and a certain power therunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The office it selfe would they have to be a mightie preesthood in al respects, as in the sixt chapter. And therfore are they urgent to have, both the terms accordingly given, as the name of preest, to the person, chapter the sixt; and of sacrifice to the deed, chapter the seventeenth: and to have altars left them wheron to offer, as in the seventeenth chapter likewise. That one kinde of power to this office belonging, is to help out of purgatorie, which we seem over much to discredit, when as those places wheron they build, we so translate, as though they ment no such thing: which matter is handled in the seventh chapter. Those that tend to the direction of some part of our life heer, are but two: one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning worshipping: the other concerning marriage. Concerning worshipping, they contend but for the parties, whom they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6188:257"/>
would have worshipped: and for the maner of worship that they would have given unto them. The parties are, first the saints; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them especially the blessed virgin, then also images: wherof, this is handled in the third chapter, that other in the eighteenth. The maner of worship, which they would have given unto these, they apportion forth by distinguishing betwixt two kinds of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, wherof the one they cal <hi>Dulia,</hi> the other <hi>Latria,</hi> both set down in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter. Concerning mariage, it is no more, but that they allow, neither preests, nor other votaries, to marrie: and mislike of our translations, for that they leave it free unto them, as appeereth in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter. For the maintenance of our own opinions, that which they do lay to our charge, is but very little, and resteth only in these two points: first, that we labor to establish putative justice (as they term it) against the tru inhaerent justice, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, chapter eleven; then, that in like sort we seek to establish (as it pleaseth them to term it) special faith, vain securitie, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, chapter twelfe. Concerning the text it selfe, they charge us with adding therunto in some few places, as may be seen in the twentith chapter. Those others that in the titles are wrapt up togither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming of any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are these: first
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6188:257"/>
certain other trecheries as they term them, both haeretical, and worth the observation, chapter the one &amp; twentith; then also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other faults that are, as they say, Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, prophane, meer vanities, follies, and novelties, chapter two and twentith. But these two latter charges are not of any such importance, but that if we could agree in the other, I think we should not long have any great disagreement in these.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 So are these the principal faults,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>How little cause they have, to find such fault with our translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     </note> as touching the matter, that our translations are charged withal, according as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal author himselfe in his discoverie hath gathered them. Wherin although it must needs be, that divers particular points are in the booke it selfe, that cannot wel be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in so breefe a collection of the whole: yet, both these are inough to condemn whatsoever translations are so false as these praetend; and, if these wil not serve, those other by-matters that are left behind, are much more unable, and never need to come to the muster. And therfore I thought it best, to rip no further into the particulars, leaving that course to the answerers onlie: but rather to make the whole trial (that I do mean) by those very points, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have thought woorthie the place of best account for this matter. And first I must
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6188:258"/>
needs protest thus much, that how greevous soever the things are, that they lay to our charge in these our labors: yet for my part, I can now more quietly bear it (and think that others do so besides) for that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves begin to translate (howsoever) the scriptures likewise. For though they have not done it, without their affections, but so favorably as they could on their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; and with such limitation besides, as laboreth to chase men away over-much from the reading of it; and lastly, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great bitternes against our translations, and us, and against the truth it selfe: yet, notwithstanding al this, and whatsoever else might be laid therunto, now that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do also translate, let them find fault so much as they wil. We shal better find out the matter betwixt us: and their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the most of ours, shal witnes with us. Hitherto it was thought by divers, that we might have been charged with great matters indeed: now they begin themselves to espie, that there is little else against us, but quarrel of words. Now as touching the things they lay to our charge, and first as touching our purpose, or inward meaning, in translating so as we have translated, it is good for every one to judge the best in al such causes: and not to be over-hastie, in so secret matters to give foorth our judgment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6188:258"/>
when as none other, but God alone, can thoroughly know the bottom therof. As for us, notwithstanding that we are undowted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persuaded, that in these matters, those our adversaries are very wrong: yet do we make no dowt at al, but that divers of them mean very wel, and do not wilfully go about to suppresse, or yet to resist the open truth. The same persuasion if it may please them to conceive of us, we think that they may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it: and that it is not to be thought any more, than both the truth, and charitie too, do justly require. It were meet that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure were on al parts laid aside: for the wrath of man can never accomplish that which is right. Concerning the matter, two things there are that I wish to be considered of them: whether those points for whose sakes they account our translations so faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be not as yet in controversie betwixt us; and, whether these points are of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as that if we should be faultie therin, they might then account the residu of the scriptures by us translated, to be no part of the word of God. That they are in controversie betwixt us, it is so evident, that I need not busie my selfe to declare it: saving onlie that one point, of Christs descending into hel. For as touching it, there is no quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion at al betwixt us, whether he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend or not, so far as is sufficient for to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6188:259"/>
us thence: but onlie as touching that maner of his descending, which they have set down, without sufficient warrant of the word of God (as we do take it) not refusing the trial therof by any sound translation whatsoever. As for the rest, there is no quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but that as yet they are in quaestion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us: and that we are in conscience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that our selves have gotten the surer side, both in the points that are in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie; and in the truth of the text it selfe. If it be so, then must they needs first know thus much, that they leave the way as open to us, to lay to their charge, that in dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from us in their translations, they do it to maintain their own opinions: as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, so to aesteem and judge of us. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time of controversie betwixt us, if needs they wil so resolutely over-rule the case to their advantage, though to some of their own fellows they may seem to have done stoutly, and wel: yet so manie as are indifferent, would rather like, that first they would obtain the principal matters, afore that ever they invade as their own, those other advantages that hang therupon. Then also, themselves wil not denie, but that it is the dutie of everie one, to take so good heed as they can that they give no offence; neither to the Iew, nor to the Gentile, nor especially to the church of God: and, if it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6188:259"/>
be the duty of al, then is it the duty of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators also; especially those, that have to translate the word of God. For the more needful that any thing is to the use of man, the more must it be of al frequented: and the more that it is frequented of al, the more hurt doth come, if there be any danger. Fire and water, are so needful, that we cannot be without them: and therfore there commeth much hurt therby, when they are not warily handled. The word of life is much more needful: unto the fountain of living waters, al the children of God daily resort, to draw to their use as need requireth. If therfore there should be any danger therin, either in the thing it selfe, by other corruption min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled withal; or for that there is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent provision made about it, for those that should resort therunto: it cannot be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that much hurt must come therby. So our translators are not to be blamed, if having their choice, they forbeare those words, out of which the deceived may suk the maintenance of their wrong opinions: and use such others, as cannot so easily be mistaken by any. Sure we are of this, that the holie Ghost useth no such speech, as may justly give offence unto any: and that none can interpret the holie scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but by the selfesame spirit, by which they were written at the first. Which spirit,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6188:260"/>
whosoever followeth, he can never find in his hart, wittingly to lend foorth his pen, to that which may tend to advance any error or il: and if he could, yet should he find no help in the text (being rightly taken) to bear him out. Insomuch, that so long as these controversies are undecided, or at least, until they shal find more substantial grounds to establish their conceived opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than to our knowledge they have any as yet, we cannot but think, that whatsoever want of supportation there is to those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the same is rather in the text it selfe, than in our translations. Concerning the other, that is, the validitie of those points of religion, or whether they be of that force, or necessitie rather, that for their sakes so hard a censure may proceed against us, that we have not among us the tru word of God: I would wish them to consider withal, that holding so much, as themselves do know, and wil grant that we do, it wil be verie hard to devise, how the same might be brought to passe, unles both we had the word among us, and highly did aesteem of the same. Them selves I trust think no otherwise of us, but that we are persuaded, that we fully hold togither with them, whatsoever is catholik: if it be so, the matter is not so verie great, if we varie somwhat in these. Though a man want an arm, or a leg; yet notwithstanding

                     </note>14 That other hinderance that is of more special force with them al generally, is that they have a certain persuasion, that they can not join with us in our profession, but that so they should depart from the catholik church. Which thing indeed is of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that if it were tru, it were not for any that loved his own salvation, or the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, to join with us in our religion. For there is but one church, as also there is but one faith: and whosoever they are that depart from either of both, they cannot be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6188:265"/>
of sound religion, whatsoever it is they do professe. Therfore to examin this matter a little, first we may do wel to search out, what it is that maketh them to think, that, if they should reform their profession so far foorth as we have done, they should then depart from the catholik church, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deprive themselves of aeternal life: then, how the same opinion of theirs may be amended. Concerning the former,<note place="margin">

                     </note> me think that the principal cause of this their persuasion is, for that they do not rightly gather, neither what the church it selfe is: nor yet what it is to depart from the same. And then, if the groundwork it selfe be wrong, it is no marvel if the building that be set therupon, be awrie likewise.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What they imagin to be the church.</hi>
                     </note> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them is, that in the aestimation of the church, they take not unto them a right tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to teach them which is the church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. For the levels that they commonly use, are especially two: one taken out of the first foundation of it; the other, the successe that since it hath had, to this praesent time wherin we live. Out of the foundation of their church, they go about to establish the certaintie of it, by two conveiances: one, from Christ, unto Peter; the other, from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto them. For first they imagin that Christ made Peter the cheefe of al, and his general substitute heer on earth: that he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6188:266"/>
should be, under him, the head of his church, and have the feeding of al that are his. Out of this they gather, that those onlie are the church, that acknowledge Peter next under Christ, to be their cheefe &amp; principal head. Then do they conceive, that Peter was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to leave this primacy with the church of Rome, and to those that should be the bishops therof: and that for that cause he left other places, and came unto Rome, and was bishop there five and twentie yeers. And therupon they think they may safely gather, that whosoever is not under the church of Rome, he also is none of the church of God. These conveiances do we take to be of very little force: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no matter of substance to assure us of the truth of this matter. For first that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had any such praerogative or primacie, we find it not set down by Christ himselfe, or by any of his Apostles: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing must needs have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quaestion, if it had been tru, being, as it was, of such importance. Then, as touching any assigment over from him to the church of Rome, and to those that should be the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops therof, neither do we find (by undow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted authoritie) that he ever did it: nor, if he had at any time done it, yet that he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie so to do; and that God would ratifie his assigment. But I mean not to enter into
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6188:266"/>
that discourse, sufficiently handled by many others: neither is it needful, when as our adversaries themselves do of late so much mislike that part of their groundwork, that none of them al (of any account) can finde in their harts, to build so much as their own credit theron. The other, which standeth in the successe that their church hath had,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>How they ground upon the successe that they have had.</hi>
                     </note> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of greater force to such a purpose: but yet notwithstanding, such as being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, yeeldeth no assurance to the matter that we have in hand. The successe which the church of Rome hath had, resteth in two principal points: in continuance; and consent of others. By continuance I mean, that it hath not fallen bak again to Paganism, or heathenish vanitie; neither yet stept aside to the sect of Mahomet, as the Turks, and manie others have done: but ever continued after a sort in the profession of the faith, since the time that by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles it was delivered unto them. Which surely is a very special blessing of God: an evident work of the holie Ghost: and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good cause, why al those that wish wel to the Gospel of Christ, should have the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent church of Rome so much the more in reverence for it. So commeth it to passe, that they have not onlie had, after a sort, a continual succession of bishops, &amp; teachers: but also have in some maner praeserved, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6188:267"/>
hitherto maintained both the word, and the sacraments, that Christ himself did leave unto us. The consent also that they have had, hath been verie great: yet not ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but somtime more, than at some other. So long as it kept the faith undefiled; and was earnestly bent to advance the kingdom of Christ; and would in no wise break, but carefully maintained the unitie of the church: so long they had the consent of al that dwelt about them, or by any means could have any dealing with them. And that, not altogither for the antiquitie, and dignitie of the citie (bicause it had been of great continuance; in a florishing estate; and was now the imperial seat:) but also, even for the sinceritie of the faith, and for divers excellent gifts, that God had powred upon that church in plentiful maner. But after that (the former zeal being abated) it began to fal in love with earthly things, and to break the peace of the church to advance it selfe, then began manie to let down their former good liking of it: al the East chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches generally; and manie of the better sort in the West likewise. Nevertheles, even then also, the greatest part of al Europe, and some others else-where besides, did cleave unto it: partly of themselves, for the former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the place, or for that they perceived not how they began to slide away from the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6188:267"/>
sinceritie of their profession; but especially, bicause of the great power that the church of Rome did after obtain, from which they saw not how to withdraw themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some praesent displeasure, or danger. Hence commeth it, that they have had their doings allowed, and their opinions confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not onlie by manie several persons of best account: but also by Provincials a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and by general Councels at home: themselves, or their frinds, in these latter ages, ever bearing the sway in them both. So that indeed the church of Rome hath had such successe in these parts of the world among us, that (to our knowledge) there hath not been the like for earthlie pomp any where else. Yet notwithstanding, this also is over weak, wherupon to set that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of theirs: needs must it have a faster ground, else can it never be able to stand. Although therfore, that in their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their church hath had a special founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and although it hath had indeed such successe since, as themselves do stil imagin: yet notwithstanding, when they point us unto the church, and undertake to shew us undowted tokens therof, then we allow not that they should think to put us over onlie to this, and shew us no better tokens than these. We do not denie them to be of the church: but we allow not the bounds of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6188:268"/>
the church to be so taken in; nor these things to stand for sufficient proofe, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such praeeminence belongeth to them.</p>

                     </note>15 The other point that seemeth to yeeld some part of the groundwork of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, is for bicause that they do conceive, that to be a departure from the church, which is none indeed, after that once the truth is tried.

Hence commeth it, that both they do so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily urge that point, and would have neither us, nor others, to make (at al) any quaestion of it: and so readily apply to that sense what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they finde in our writings, that doth import a division betwixt us. Those on our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6188:268"/>
part by whom it commeth, are (most of al) those that are most zealous: who being much mooved with the manifest corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the adversarie part maintaineth, and with their unreasonable thirst of innocent blood in the quarrel of religion, are by that occasion carried so far somtime, that they do not ever speak and write in so sensed maner, but that when they acknowledge that division that indeed is, and ought to be, betwixt them and us (so long as they stand in such sort as they do) they may seem to acknowledge that we are altogither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: that we are a distinct visible church from them; and they but a synagog, in no sense appertaining to the visible church. Wheras notwithstanding by the whole course of al our writings it is cleer again, that we do not sunder our selves from them, nor them from us, but only in those points that are in controversie betwixt us: and for the rest, agree togither, and acknowledge likewise, that in those we are one. But bicause that whensoever we speak of the division that is betwixt us, we do not therwithal shew, how far we agree, therupon it seemeth to them that we can easily be content, to be altogither abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from them, and to have no societie at al with such a people. So commeth it to passe, that as they (upon the advantage)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6188:269"/>
disclame in us, and bear us in hand, that both they and we cannot be the members of any one, and the selfesame church (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in some sense we cannot, and in that sense is by us acknowledged) so we likewise seem unto divers to be in that point of the selfesame mind with them, and as fully to disclame in them as they do in us; and as absolutely to hold, that both sorts of us cannot in any sense or construction be members of one, and the selfesame bodie, especially of that which is ancient and tru, and the catholik or apostolik church, as notwithstanding we are generally. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience that this mistaking dooth breed in the end,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience commeth therby.</hi>
                     </note> is very great, and hurtful to the cause of religion: but some branches therof there be, which are common to both parties; and some that are proper to either. Common to both are these two: the inward hart burning, and greefe of mind that is betwixt us, one towards another; and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentions insuing theron, whensoever occasion is offered. And touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we need go no further, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, every one to his own conscience. For there shal we finde, both that we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greefe, one towards another: and that we think we may (and ought) maintain the same in the cause of religion that we have in hand. Our contentions are so apparant,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6188:269"/>
and known unto al, that al Christendome, is witnes of them. Which also are for the most part so bitterly handled, as if in religion we were utterly sundered, one from another, and had no point of faith at al, that were common betwixt us: to the increase of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, among our selves; and to the great hinderance of many of those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and otherwise might be woon to the Christian faith. Proper unto our adversaries it is, that, if it do fal out in the end (as I trust it wil anon appeer) that there was no such cause in us as deserved, so to be abandoned from the church of God: then abideth an heavie judgement for them, that have been so bold as to set down, that we are not of the church of Christ; and therwithal, for to power forth, whatsoever curses they had, against us. And no marvel, if they stand in such danger in the judgements of God, when as (being so) they sin very greevously both against God, and against their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. Against God, for that they fight against his truth; and abuse the place of justice, that he hath given them: against their neighbor, for that so they discourage, and terrifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the weak ones that are among us; and among themselves, are the only cause, that many of the simpler sort that belong unto them, are persuaded that we are none of the church, and behave themselves accordingly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6188:270"/>
towards us. Then also, if it should be so (as we hope it wil appeer) that we have a better title to be of the church, than they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves have: then would their subtiltie and fearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes return to them again, and conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves, that if we do not belong to the church, much lesse do they. Proper unto us are two others likewise, if we at any time suffer them to make such an absolute divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt us. For so commeth it to passe, first, that by consenting so far with them in this error, we also must stand chargeable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, for whatsoever il fruits do spring of the same: ratably at the least, so far as the proportion of our fault requireth. Then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, we bring our selves to needles trouble, for that it is great probabilitie with them, that so we make our selves answerable for to finde out a distinct &amp; a several church from them, from which we descend, which hath continued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles age to this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: else, that needs we must acknowledge, that our church is sprong up of late; or, at least, since theirs. Wherin, although they could never be able, either to condemn us, or else but to justifie themselves: yet is it more than we need to give them; and more, than (we think) they use wel, when they have it. Therfore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude both these points, as I said before, so say I again, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if divers of them think, that joining
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6188:270"/>
with us they should utterly depart from the church, so long as they do wander so far, both in determining what the church is, and what it is to depart from the same.</p>

                     </note> The former of these is, when as we go about to compas those things, that are beyond our reach, and cannot come under our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. As namely, when we labor to finde out the church, in heaven, either in the secret election of God; or in the glorie, wherunto it shal come in the end: or on earth, by the largenes of the bounds which it hath, being spred al over the face of the earth. For thogh
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6188:271"/>
it be very tru, that that indeed is the tru church, which is chosen from the beginning, and which shal be glorified in the end: yet are not we able, by either of those to finde out, who they are. For we cannot looke into the secret purpose of God; nor, in the end it selfe, espie the end before it come: we must either have better tokens than these, or else can we do no good at al. So likewise the earth is so very large, that we are not able to reach foorth our knowledge unto the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most bounds therof: and so consequently can never see, what faith it is that is there professed, nor so much as whether there be any people at al, that there inhabit. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should take such a course, as that we could not (in our conscience) set down with our selves, that we knew the church, until we could get the view of the whole: then could we never resolve our selves, but must needs remain uncertain so long as we live. And in this, our adversaries have (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at the first) a just occasion ministred unto them, to turn aside their adhaerents eies to the church of Rome, being such, as for neernes and evident shew that it hath, may easily come under our knowledge; and, for that many others hang therupon, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a special credit withal. Howbeit, althogh they have rightly espied the inconvenience on the one side: yet have they not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6188:271"/>
holpen the same on the other. They see in deed what is the disease: but the medicin that they give for the same, wil not serve. Therfore now concerning that other way that wil serve our turn,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The other way, that wil plainly shew foorth what the church is.</hi>
                     </note> we have the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alreadie given, as in manie other places of scripture besides, so namely, by a special place of Christ himselfe, at his last going up to Ierusalem, a little before the time that he suffered. At what time being disposed, to leave that point decided unto them, before he should leave them, he first asked his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, what opinion others had of him: and, when that came short, what was their own persuasion of him. Wherunto when Peter answered in the name of himselfe &amp; the rest, that they beleeved that he was the Christ, the son of the living God, he plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that that was the tru profession indeed: that it was not an opinion, or conceit of mans wisdome; but was given unto them from his father in heaven: that it was the rok, &amp; plot of ground, wherupon he would build his church: that against it the power of hel should never praevail: and that by it they should open and shut the kingdome of heaven to al the world; setting at libertie from the danger of hel those that beleeved, and binding up al others to aeternal perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In which place we have to consider, what is the faith that is so commended: and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6188:272"/>
what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation is given unto it. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to the praesent purpose that we have in hand, we need but the former of these two: therfore in the other we need to consider no more but this now, that there is so special co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation given unto it, as that it cannot be, but that whosoever are of the same, they must needs be of the church indeed. The faith it selfe that is there professed, resteth in two principal points: one, that he was the Christ; the other, that he was the son of the living God. Of which two, the latter is, with so ful consent, received of al, and so cleer from al maner of dowt among us, and every point therunto belonging, that it again may for this time be set aside, though otherwise in it selfe, it be as needful as the other. And so to find out what is the sense of the former of them, that is, that he was the Christ, it is as much to say, that he was the annointed, or that very savior, which before was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto them. In which his annointing there are two things to be considered, that he was appointed, and made able, to be our savior: and so consequently, appointed, and made able, to be our preest; our prophet; and king. Our preest, to make a ful attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, betwixt God and us, to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of aeternal redemption in him; and to the attainment of the same: our prophet to teach us, whatsoever is expedient for us to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6188:272"/>
know: and our king, under whom we have to live, until by his government he shal bring us thither. Out of which we may safely set down, and that by the authoritie of Christ himselfe, who they are that may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the church of God: that is, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal assemblie of those, that professe the Son of the virgin Marie, to be the promised savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; by God himselfe, both ordained and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to save, so manie as do beleeve in him. Or, if we go more specially to work, those that rest in Iesus Christ alone, for the whole work of their salvation: in his preesthood, for the ful satisfaction of the justice of God, both to escape hel, and to come unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in his doctrine and scepter, to bring us unto it. So commeth it to passe, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever there be any countries or nations, that do professe this faith in Christ, those must we needs acknowledge for to belong to the church of Christ: as on the other side, whosoever they are, that have not this faith, that those are none of the church of Christ, whatsoever thing else they can praetend. So that the church, of which we speak at this praesent, is that universal assemblie or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring togither of al those, whether congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or several persons, in any part of al the world, that beleeve in Christ, or professe the same that we cal christianitie or the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith. Concerning the members, it may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6188:273"/>
sufficiently appeer by this that is said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who they are that do appertain to that account: whether they be whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or several persons that come in quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For whosoever they are that professe according to the pattern aforesaid, those must needs be very good members: and those that swerve from it, whether more, or lesse, are in like sort to be accounted, to be in the like proportion departed from the sinceritie of the better sort. So that in any wise we must take heed, that in this account we measure not the goodnes of any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, either in the secret election of God, for that it is unknown unto us; or in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the conversation to outward sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, or holines of life, wherin we may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soone guiled: but only that we now seeke out, those that are visible members alone, measuring the woorthines of everie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by the profession before set down, until that once having found out the truer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church, we then examin among themselves, who they are, that more sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer their holie calling.</p>

other tokens for to teach us, when we are wrong, than only that same wherby we have lerned when we are right. For as a sea mark on the shore, or a beakon upon the hil, doth by one, and the selfesame labor teach them both: so the same likewise that before is set down, is sufficient to declare unto al, that do walk by direction therof, who they are that are right; &amp; who on the other side do wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amis out of the way. We have therfore, first to resolve our selves, that for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we wil take our aim therat: then to seek out by direction therof, who they are that depart from the church. That we should so resolve our selves, we have as good reason as can be desired: for that otherwise we may be deceived; but never if we take our aim by this. The reason,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>How we may therin be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
                     </note> that otherwise we may be deceived, is, for that al things else wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others do commonly judge what is the course that they hold, are nothing else but either points of lesse importance, if they do belong unto this: or else are of some other kind, either directly contrarie to it, or divers from it. If it be of the former, that is, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining indeed to sound religion, and yet nevertheles not so material, or very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but that christianitie may stand without it: then, if any man depart from it, although that therin he do withdraw himselfe from the truth; yet may not that be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6188:274"/>
departing away from the church, so long as he keepeth unto the substance of christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie. As for example the truth is, that of al that were born of women, Christ only was without sin: and yet, for our sin that he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained, &amp; for which he had to satisfie the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, he was hartily touched with the horror of death. Nevertheles, if any there be that cannot be as yet persuaded, but needs he must think it more honorable for the blessed virgin (yea &amp; for Christ himselfe, that tooke flesh of hir) to have been without sin, &amp; therupon for his part do rather think, that by special praerogative she also was prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> original corruption; or els do but dowt it to be somwhat reprochful to Christ, that being, as he was the son of God, he should be so much afraid of death: although that heerin he do indeed depart from the truth in those two points, or at least in his weaknes come short therof, yet bicause that neither of them is so much of the substance of religion, but that christianitie may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, where nothing else but these or such like are wanting, therfore may we not by any aequitie account any such to be out of the church, that holding al things else besides, only sticketh in some of these. So likewise, if any should depart from that which hath been for a long time received, and yet is either against the truth of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6188:274"/>
as the worshipping of images; or but more than the scripture teacheth, as the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the sabboth, to another day than was woont to be observed: as in the former he were so much the rather of the church of God; so in the latter, he were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as no member therof, holding al things else sincerely. For though our selves do like the altering of the sabboth new, from that which was observed of the Iews, unto the day of Christs resurrection: yet must we needs grant with al, that it was somwhat more than needed, and that if it had stood as it did, it had not been against the Christian faith, which is so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be noted, for that not only divers of the antient fathers in times past have been, but we also at this praesent in like sort are, a great deal too hastie to condemn in such cases, al that do not fully accord in al points with us. In these cases therfore, or any such like, whosoever wil condemn al those to be none of the church, that are not fully persuaded as we are therin: he might soone condemn many such as might after be found to be the children of God, when himself and his fellows should be excluded; and besides that, in the mean season com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, an uncharitable part towards those his brethren, and that which might grow to an il example for others to follow.

that we cannot in any wise be deceived,<note place="margin">

                     </note> if we cleave to the other, hangeth on two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points: the one, that there is no other way to the kingdome of God; the other, that it is the only faith that is common to al, that unto this kingdome do appertain. That there is no other way than Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, it is in it selfe so very cleer, that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no further help. Out of it likewise must the other very necessarily arise, that seeing there is none other way but it alone, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many as belong therunto must needs be of the same profession. In which respect, that which is the substance of this profession,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Catholik.</hi>
                     </note> by divers of the fathers of old, hath bin termed catholik, &amp; yet is so called to this praesent day. For howsoever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian churches have at al times varied in certain by-matters concerning their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; yet that which is the very substance indeed, have they ever professed togither, so long as themselves abode in Christ: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon acknowledged ech other for catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, notwithstanding the diversitie that in those other points they stil maintained. As also we see in the law of arms, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever countries and kingdoms are divided among themselves; yet therin do they agree togither: notwithstanding the diversitie of government, or laws; and notwithstanding the mortal enmitie, that otherwise may be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6188:275"/>
betwixt them. For even so is it in the church of God: very much divided, in many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of lesse importance; but in the substance of Christian religion, which we term the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik faith, agreeing togither. And as it is in men, and al other creatures that God hath made, that generally al are like unto the kind of which they are; but otherwise varieng among themselves: even so is it in this likewise, al that are Christians holding togither that which is the common faith of al, the material and essential points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion; and yet very often greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in other matters therunto appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but not of the very substance indeed. Seeing therfore that the substance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, &amp; the very effect of the whole, is to rest in Christ alone, for the whole work of our redemption (in his preesthood, for our attonement; in his doctrine, for al our wisdome; and in his kingdome, for our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) whosoever they are that hold the same, they hold without quaestion the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik faith: whosoever they are, that diminish of this, or put to any other, they dowtles do that, which hath not ever been in the church of God, nor whersoever it hath been spread, and so conseqvently, that which in neither of these respects, nor in any other, can truly be aesteemed catholik. For whatsoever it is, that is catholik indeed, it must needs have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6188:276"/>
the testimonie of al ages, and of al Christian churches: which only agreeth to that which is taught by the written word. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not such, that also (to abide by) is not catholik.</p>

For the plainer demonstration wherof, we are to justifie; that, of departing from the church, there ought to be no quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion at al among us: but only, of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therof, who they are, that more truly answer unto their calling.<note place="margin">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6188:276"/>
is no redemption in any, but only by him: the canonical scriptures we both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be the undowted word of God; and likewise observe those two sacraments, that God ordained to be in perpetual use among us: we both acknowledge, that it behooveth Christians to mortifie the flesh, and to walk in holines of life, that one day we shal be raised up again, and stand at the judgement seat of Christ; and, so manie as have done wel, shal go to fruition of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting joies, but al the rest to everlasting pains. So that, as touching the profession of the faith generally, both sorts of us do so far agree, that neither of us may justly account the other, to be none of the church of God. And therfore as it was very il done, of those that first urged such a separation; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those that seemed so easily to accept therof, as though that both sorts of us could not be of one, and the selfesame church ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, did unadvisedly likewise. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie of profession is, there whosoever make such division, they are not able to justifie their doings therin, bicause that so they make an utter separation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithstanding in general profession they are reasonably wel united togither,<note place="margin">

heerunto appertaining (whether they be whole congregations, as national churches, or but ordinarie parishes; or whether they be but particular persons) therin may we be bold to determin, that both are not right; but that one part, whosoever it light on, must needs be wrong. For though by their outward profession generally, we are both sorts to be accounted of the church: yet in such diversitie as is betwixt us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both sorts, be tru members of the same. If they be right, then we are wrong: if we be right, then they are wrong. Such is the diversitie that is betwixt us, and of so material and needful points, though both sorts be of the catholik church: yet is it not possible,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Why in them.</hi>
                     </note> for both sorts to be catholik mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same. Whether of us therfore it is, that is wrong, is now to be seen. Where first as touching them, we cannot account them to be catholik members, for two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal causes. First bicause that they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse &amp; maintain divers opinions, that very directly go against the Christian faith that generally they do otherwise hold. For they do not content themselves only with Christ, nor with his word, nor with his sacraments, or at the least not so fully as we: but set them up other mediators in heaven; other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, &amp; sacraments on earth. And though it may be they wil say, that they have not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6188:277"/>
done these things in such sort, or not in such measure as we would seem to charge them withal; yet can they not denie, but that they have done it, and do it stil, more than we: and then, if the quaestion lie betwixt them, and us, whether are the truer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, needs must we in that respect, praevail against them. The force and power of his annointing they impeach very much, when as they do not content themselves with him alone, whom the father appointed, &amp; made able to serve our turn. Then also, bicause they do so earnestly impugn the truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in divers points: and so bitterly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the persons of those, that either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse religion sincerely; or join not with them in al their corruptions, and usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For so doing, we can make no other account of them, but that they have suffered themselves to be made the members of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, or man of sin, that sitteth in the church of God, and insolently confoundeth al at his pleasure. Concerning our selves,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Why not in us.</hi>
                     </note> they wil not charge us, but that we rest in Christ alone, for the whole work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: seeking none other to be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, or to help forth, with the attonement betwixt God and us; coveting none other doctrines, than those that himselfe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto us; neither yet giving over our obedience to other observations, than such

as the written word doth teach us. But the cheefe thing they charge us withal, is for that we receive not more, than Christ, &amp; his Apostles in the written word hath delivered unto us: as the supremacie of the church of Rome; worshipping of images; their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous praesence of Christ in the sacrament; ordeining our service to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a toong that they do not understand; praier to saints, and for the dead; and many others such like as these. Concerning which, the truth is, that we do not receive them: and the reason is, bicause they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik; but devised, or crept in of latter time, and not professed in al ages, nor of al Christian churches generally. In which one point they do unto us a very great, and a double injurie: both for that they denie us the name of catholiks, that nevertheles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the catholik faith, both in the whole, and in every point; and for that they take that name to themselves, who mingle with the catholik faith, many inventions of their own devise, and sufficiently hold not much of the truth, that they do professe. But when we do constantly hold al the holy scriptures without exception; and al such sums of the Christian faith, as have been gathered by the fathers of old, and now are authentik in the church among us (as that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apostles creed, the Nicene likewise,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6188:279"/>
and that other of Athanasius) and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the churches agreed on togither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves in the four first general councels; and last of al, whatsoever at any time since, hath been ordeined by the church of Rome, or whomsoever else, that is not contrarie to the holy scriptures: and they on the other side, have mingled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the catholik faith, with the truth and substance of religion, which in al ages, and in al churches hath been professed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other novelties besides, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, not only to the scriptures, but also to the fathers of old, &amp; yet notwithstanding hold many of these, as fast as they do any thing else: let any indifferent man be judge, whether they or we be better catholiks; and then, if it please him, whether they are meet so resolutely to judge of others, that are so far overshot themselves. So for this matter we resolve our selves, that we are no several church from them, nor they from us; and therfore, that there is no departing at al out of the church, for any to depart from them unto us, nor from us unto them. Al the difference that is betwixt us, is concerning the truer members, whether they, or we, may be found more woorthy of that account. In which point of controversie we dowt not for to praevail against them: and as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we allow no such quaestion to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

If any of these have been set on, to do as they do, it wil not acquit the cost in the end: if they have done it of their owne accord, it is not like to scape unpunished, if they see
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6188:280"/>
not unto it betime. The Ephramites were of the people of God, and yet revolted away from the law, though stil they held (after a sort) the profession therof: and having so done, they so continued a long time after, as a wanton, untamed, and unrulie heifer; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding al the most earnest warnings, that GOD by his prophets did give unto them. But yet is it recorded of them, that at the length they turned again, smiting upon the thigh, and acknowledging that they had committed very shameful things. If with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim they have so erred and stept aside, pittie it were, but they should be as readie, with him to repent and turn again: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, seeing that they have greater provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, than ever had Ephraim before. The Iewes that put their savior to death, and utterly renounced whatsoever salvation was offered by him, did notwithstanding yeeld from among them very shortly after, three thousand persons at once, that diligently inquired of the Apostles what they should do, and immediately therupon were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed likewise. And it is not to be denied, but that many thousands of these also are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die come in: but yet is it pittie (if it might be amended) that any one of them al, should so far have crucified the Lord again, and yet be so long before that he do repent him of it. S. Thomas an Apostle himselfe, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6188:281"/>
dowted very much for a time, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Iesus Christ: and would in no wise beleeve, the others affirming the same, but upon very hard conditions, and such as agreed not with the nature of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For needs would he find the badges of mortalitie, in his glorified and immortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: or else he would in no wise beleeve. But when Christ condescended therto, and for the time, by special dispensation, allowed those badges of his mortal nature, in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal bodie now, reteining for the time his wounds: he quikly forsooke his unbeleefe, and foorthwith acknowledged him to be as he was, his Lord &amp; God. These also beleeve not that the Gospel of Christ is risen again: they suppose it is either manifest haeresie, or, at least, but some newfangled doctrine: the ancient, Christian, and catholik faith, they can in no wise think that it is. The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also that they require, are as hard as the others (for manie of them:) such as are verie seldom found in the most glorious truth of Christ, but commonly haunt the corruption of faith, and those beggerly rudiments of the world, the doctrines of men. But wheras God hath so disposed and ordered this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they may find it sufficiently witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by such things as are in credit with them, Antiquitie, and Vniversalitie; Fathers, and Councels: the harder dealing that it is, stil

notwithstanding to resist this resurrection of Christ, in the Gospel restored unto us, &amp; so plentifully as it is confirmed; the more is it to be wished, that our unbeleeving Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masses also would in some good time take up, and at length acknowledge their former unbeleefe, &amp; glorifie God in this day of his gratious visitation.

When light and grace in so special maner is offered unto us, the goodnes of God doth not only therin tender it selfe to serve our turn, but giveth us also to understand, that we stand in special need therof, though our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6188:282"/>
selves do not see it. And then, what follie is it, to remain in darknes, when we may have light: &amp; in the bondage of sin, when we are offered to be inlarged, and set at libertie? What oversight likewise, so much to dwel in the opinion of our own sufficiencie for those matters, that we espie not our selves to want those needful graces, when from the Lord himselfe we are so plainly told that we do? To want these things is a greater losse, than to want whatsoever is in the world besides: but, not to take them when they are offered, and so to want them in the midst of plentie, is not only a bare losse in it selfe; but such as calleth for of others a just reproch, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth up in their own harts a gnawing worm, that, when once hir teeth are grown, wil give them no rest, but vex them stil with irksom thoughts, for that having had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and so fair opportunities, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing have missed them al. Where these things want, how is it possible that GOD should be glorified? And then to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is it they live? Nay, how can it in any wise be avoided, but that God must be very much dishonored, and very highly offended by such? And then how much better had it been for them, never to have lived at al? Is it so easily granted of al, that to be cast into a dungeon, and there to be in continual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in filthie corners, with noisom vermin;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6188:282"/>
or to be in greevous thraldom by captivitie or bondage, under cruel &amp; violent tyrants, is indeed a very greevous and miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: and yet can it be so hardly beleeved of these, that, to abide stil in their palpable darknes, when now they may have light inough: and to remain in the filth and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie of sin, from which they may in like sort be delivered, is not so lothsom and greevous as it? Are the senses of the outward man so quik in the one; and doth the inward so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle perceive the like in the other? Whether they perceive it or not, it must notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding needs be tru, that whersoever such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God are so little regarded, there are they for the most part withheld from those despisers: and where they are withheld, or kept bak from them, there is nothing clean or sound, but altogither polluted and il, in the sight of God and man. So do they misse of that, which would have made them verie good instruments in the church of God, to the glorie of God; to the aedifieng of others in the way of godlines; &amp; to their own aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal comfort: and they procure by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, to be given over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense, for so little regarding their visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therby to become in the end, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither closed up in their ignorance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate in sin, or powred foorth to al naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and that with greedines, and without

And the woonted judgements of God do plainly declare, that in this life he giveth some tast of his wrath in the world to come. The unthankful Iewes that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been the people of God, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding at length cast off, and utterly given over, as to great loosenes, so likewise to the depth of distresse, bicause they had so little regard to the word of life, that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them.

Of which sort sith many others might be alledged, this matter is so abundantly witnessed unto us, that no man may dowt, but to see it once performed indeed, that it shal be easier for Sodom and Gomor in the day of judgement, than for those that so plainly refuse the word of life offered unto them. And it is no marvel, though being so patient in other things, yet notwithstanding he cannot but punish this, in the children of unbeleefe, in most sharp and rigorous maner. The greatest kindnes

that ever he shewed to the children of men, bestowing on them his only son, to be so lightly esteemed as it is, and to be had in so great contempt as it is with many: how can it but boade some marvelous judgement that is to come upon the offenders, and such severitie, as in proportion may som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing answer so great iniquitie?</p>
