            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have been long a loſer by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and muſt own I have been led to think that every thing there went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, becauſe my own Concerns did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. So that even before, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince the diſcovery of this Helliſh Plot, I have very liberally helped on, what-ever I heard to the diſadvantage of the Government there, whether in the management of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> or the Administration of the Council. But having found by ſome turn of the Tide, That the great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of neglect and evil doing, hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome Parties concerned, to give an Account of their Proceedings; I have
<pb facs="tcp:47967:3"/>
been much changed in my Opinion, not only by particular Letters, but by ſight of a Paper lately given in by the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> to the Houſe of Lords. So that I know not well how to expiate for all the uncharitable and injurious Reflections, which I confeſs I have contributed to, but by helping to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive others at my own Charge, and by putting the ſaid Paper, with what I have ſince learn'd, into Print.</p>
            <p>And truly, beſides this way of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which in Juſtice I owe to thoſe concerned, I think it ſome ſervice to the Publick Safety, that the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our Dangers and Security be known, and that we do not rend our Friends in pieces, inſtead of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For ſuch a method cannot fail to make our defence hopeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47967:3"/>For my own part ſince my Opinion hath turn'd to better thoughts of things in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it muſt honestly be owned by us all, That the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> hath been ſtill on the Loyal ſide, as alſo firm in all turns to the Proteſtant Cauſe. And when I conſider with my ſelf, how great a Fortune he hath in ſeveral parts of that Kingdom, which draws naturally on him a dependence of great Numbers; and that he hath alſo many Relations, among thoſe of the <hi>Popiſh Party;</hi> and how, on the other ſide, the preſent quiet of that Kingdom can hardly ariſe from the terror of a ſmall Army, or the poor proviſion of Stores, where the Papists are ſo very diſproportionable in Numbers to the Protestants: I do plainly think that he ſaid Duke is acting an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary part; that by his Influence and
<pb facs="tcp:47967:4"/>
Interest he comes to know and divert the Evils that might happen: and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently turns his Perſonal Advantages to the ſervice and ſafety of the Public.</p>
            <p>This is plain, Things are there in full Peace and Plenty, and for ought I hear, they fear nothing there, but what we fear here alſo. And my day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers are, for a Bleſſiing on the publick Counſels, that it may be better with us both.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THat when News of the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Plot, and his Majeſties Order of the firſt of <hi>October</hi> laſt, came to the Lord Lieutenant, which was about the 7<hi>th</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: his Lordſhip was then at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> newly returned from a Progreſs made by him into <hi>Munſter,</hi> to view the Forts and Places fit for Fortification; and in particular from ſeeing the new Fort begun by his Order the <hi>March</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, for the defence of the Harbour of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi>

which work hath ſince gone on, and upon which is already expended above the value of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> it being a work of great Importance to the Safety of that Kingdom, and the ſecurity of all Ships reſorting to that Harbour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That according to the ſaid Order the Lord Lieutenant did preſently give a Warrant for the Seiſure of <hi>Peter Talbot</hi> and of his Papers, and he was accordingly ſeiſed and made cloſe Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi>: where he now ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and the Examinations taken were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Majeſty in Council, and from thence to the Houſe of Lords the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with a Paper writ in his own hand, being an account of Treaſon laid to his Charge by one <hi>Sergant,</hi> which Paper 'tis probable he deſired ſhould be found; for no other Paper of moment could be found either in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or in his trunks, he having had time enough to put all out of reach, by the tidings it is likely he and many other Papiſts did receive of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot, by Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> at the Council-Board, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and the Intelligence ſent away that Night.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47967:8"/>
might conduce to the ſafety of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if ſuch Heads were in reſtraint, and that their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would not then preſume or adventure to run into Rebellion. But upon ſerious Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it was thought, That ſuch a proceeding might rather quicken a Rebellion than prevent it. For the Numerous Followers who depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly upon their Maſters Intereſt and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the ſupport of themſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, being angred or afrighted at the ill uſage of their Principals, and being looſned from all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances, might rather put themſelves upon ſome unlawful way of Living, by turning <hi>Tories,</hi> than intruſt themſelves to the pleaſure of the Government, and in the quality of <hi>Tories</hi> they would be equally miſcheivous, and eſpecially to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſperſed in their remote Dwellings, as a ſmall Rebellion. Beſides this, further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did diſſuade the taking up theſe chief men as Hoſtages. For if their Followers were but few, they could not do the <hi>Engliſh</hi> much hurt, as they are, but if ſtrong and numerous it would be eaſily in their power to ſurprize ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen living in their remote and ſcattered Dwellings in the Country, as would ſoon redeem ſuch Hoſtages, and thereby render
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47967:9"/>
all the Charge and Care of ſuch an Undertaking fruitleſs, and only ſerve to breed ill blood. So that the Lord Lieutenant hath in ſome meaſure ſteered a different Courſe, by ſhewing civility, and giving good words, to ſuch of the Heads of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as come neer him; whereby he finds out early what is doing among their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and hath conceived this method of obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dangers more ſafe, than either by Rigors to compel them or their Followers to live always in Conjunction, and talk of their misfortunes, or by Impriſonment of ſo many of the Nobility of a Kingdom without Crimes objected, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from hence, incur the Cenſure of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Proceedings, which are neither ſafe or fit for him to bear.</p>
            <p>Another Point which hath been under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration before the Lord Lieutenant and Council, was a Propoſal for dreyning the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations (eſpecially thoſe that are Garriſon'd) from the numbers of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in order to prevent any Surpriſe or Private Conſpiracy. But when it was reflected on, That notwithſtanding the ſeveral Orders and Proclamations that have from time to time
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47967:9"/>
been iſſued from the Government for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Inhabitants and Servants from the Towns and Garriſons; and that very few in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the number complained of were Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to return: It was manifeſt that it was the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> themſelves, who did in moſt places receive them in again for their own advantage, not knowing well how to live without them. They wanted Servants and Tenants and Tradeſmen (for of ſuch are theſe numbers in the Towns conſtituted) and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts ſupplied them with ſuch: and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not conceive this ſort of People to be ſo dangerous as beneficial unto them: So that the Lord Lieutenant and Council do only forbear their expulſion in whole or in part, for convenience and gratification to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> However 'tis certain there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a true Remedy herein, as to the ſecurity and improvement of that Kingdom, unleſs by a large acceſſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants there. And untill that ſhall happen, all other Trials upon thoſe ſort of <hi>Iriſh</hi> will be in a manner but to lay ſome Towns, and very much of the Lands of the Proteſtants quite waſt and unte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted. And yet it ſo falls out, That many on this ſide not conſidering the diſproportion of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47967:10"/>
               <hi>Iriſh</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor the difference of the Laws there as to Capital and pecuniary Mulcts from what they are in <hi>England,</hi> do think many things are defective, becauſe they are not there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted as they are, and may be executed in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and other reaſons of weight, the two Propoſitions forementioned were thought impracticable. But the principal and preſent ſecurity of that Kingdom conſiſting in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing the Numbers of <hi>Iriſh</hi> with a ſuperiority of ſtrength and leaving them naked, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> in Arms, The Lord Lieutenant and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did think fit to revive the Commiſſion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, ſo that the Militia of that Kingdom hath been raiſed in all parts, and is now found in a better Condition than ever it was known to be. And to ſupply the defect of Arms for ſuch Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, there were not only appointed ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants as publick Undertakers to bring in Arms from abroad: but withal not wholly to depend upon their performance, the Lord Lieutenant hath procured a ſupply out of his Majeſties Stores here of Powder and Arms to the value of about 13000 <hi>l.</hi> which are now actually landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for payment of which he himſelf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47967:10"/>
ſtands engaged to the Office of Ordnance here, until a Parliament do meet in <hi>Ireland</hi> to make proviſion for things of this Importance. But ſurely to have proceeded with any Degree of Precipitation while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo unfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, had not been very prudential.</p>
            <p>As to his Majeſties Forces in that Kingdom, they are well diſciplin'd and well paid, and it hath pleaſed his Majeſty lately to ſend over a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of about 1200 Men. And the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſo diſtributed, as that the Cities (which are the Garriſons of that Kingdom) are ſecured as well as it is poſſible for the proportion of ſuch a Militia, and ſuch an Army to make them.</p>
            <p>There is all the diſcountenance given to Maſs-Houſes in all places, which the Laws of that Kingdom will bear. Nor is there Licence for any Arms given to any but ſuch as need them, and for no more than is neceſſary for their ſecurity againſt Tories in their remote and ſcattered Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, and for whoſe Loyalty and peaceable Demeanour, the Lord Lieutenant is firſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently certified by ſome Proteſtants of Note.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47967:11"/>The Forts are in as good a Condition as the Stores and the Revenue of that Kingdom will allow, and perhaps ſomewhat better. But it is manifeſt that much more is needful in every kind in caſe of Forreign Attempts. And therefore ſeeing the Charge of the Government, and the Income of the Revenue are ſo exactly ballanced by a ſetled Eſtabliſhment, that it is not in the Power of the Lord Lieutenant to alter the ſame, and that no Money can be raiſed from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject but by Act of Parliament; Therefore the Lord Lieutenant hath been long endeavouring to have a Parliament called, and to that end ſeveral Bills were tranſmitted the laſt Summer from the Lord Lieutenant and Council, which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the Council-Board here, together with a large Repreſentation of the State of Accounts depending with the Lord <hi>Ranelagh</hi> and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were late Undertakers for the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of that Kingdom. And until there ſhall be leiſure (which ſince the diſcovery of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Plot there ſcarce hath been) to ſend back theſe things, with the mature Conſiderations they deſerve, there is no viſible means left for the raiſing and augmenting the Publick Revenue to ſuch a proportion as may put that Kingdom in a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47967:11"/>
ſufficient poſture of defence, as to Army, Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Stores, in caſe of any powerful Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But for the preſent all things are there in full Peace and Quietneſs.</p>
            <p>And for further account of the preſent State of that Kingdom, and of what hath there been done, or further reaſon of the particulars here mentioned, or of any other thing which may have been left undone; There is no doubt but full ſatisfaction will be given by the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and Council, when ſuch particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and Demands are made as ſhall be thought convenient.</p>
