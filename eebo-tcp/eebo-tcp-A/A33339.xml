         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But certainly the Name of God is wonderful still: His arme is not shortened that it cannot save, nor his eare heavy that it cannot heare: So that we may assure our selves, that either

And like as a prudent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander makes not choice of white-livered Souldiers for hot service &amp; high attempts; but of those of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est experience, and most approved valour: so God singles out his valiantest Souldiers for strongest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, his best Scholars for the largest lessons, his choicest armour for the highest proof, the most cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Christians for the sorest afflictions.

               <p>ABstinence orders a man in the use of meates, that it be neither unseasonable for the time, nor unreasonable for the measure: nature is content with a little: grace with lesse.

               <p>THey have their souls (saith one) meerly for salt to keep their bodies from putrifying, whose whole life is to eat, and drink, and sport, and sleep, as if they came into the world as Rats, and Mice, onely to devour victuals, and run squeeking up and down; whereas nature in framing of man teacheth him temperance, by giving him a little mouth, with a narrow throat, and a lesser belly then other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have; Yet such is the prodigious unnaturalness amongst most, that (as the <hi>French</hi> Proverb hath it) <hi>They digge their Graves with their teeth,</hi> whilest their Kitchin is their shrine, their Cook their Priest, their Table their Altar, and their belly their god. Hence also it is said, That Meat kills as many as the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. <hi>Plures pereunt crapulà quàm capulo; lancibus, quàm lanceis;</hi> The board kills more then the sword. And as it's thus noxious to the body, so also to the estate; whilest the spend thrift entombes his Ancestours in his own bowels, turning his Rents into Ruffes, and his Lands into Laces. And lastly, to his soul also; for Gluttony is the gallery of Incontinency: <hi>Nutritiva facultas est ossi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Romane Emperour was eight foot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> high, his body great, and joynts proportionable; and according to his limbs, so was his diet; for he daily devoured fourty pounds of flesh, and drank thereto six gallons of wine. When he besieged <hi>Aquileia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Citizens wives cut off the hair of their heads, to make bowe-strings for resistance of this Tyrant.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Alexander M.</hi> had overcome <hi>Darius,</hi> and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> possession of all his Dominions, and riches, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to degenerate into the <hi>Asian</hi> Luxury: His chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and moderation were turned into pride and lust. He esteemed his countrey-manners, and the discipline of the former <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, too light and mean for him. He imitated the pride of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings: He made him a Crown, and robes like unto <hi>Darius:</hi> He grew so proud, and insolent that he suffered his <hi>Macedonians</hi> to fall down and worship him like a god: Yea he commanded his servants, and slaves to do so. He clothed his Captaines and horse-men after the <hi>Persian</hi> manner, which though they disliked, yet they durst not refuse. He gat him three hundred sixty five concubines, of the beautifullest Virgins that could be found in <hi>Asia,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Kings: of these he had one that lay with him every night: He had his troop of <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> He spent dayes, and nights in profuse feasting, and revelling. He gat many Musicians, Jesters, Singing women, &amp;c. All which was very offensive to his old Captains, and Souldiers. <hi>Q. Cur.</hi>

               <p>THe way to heaven is up the hill all the way, and the uncleane adulterer with his rotten Lungs, and wasted Loines cannot climbe up it.

The frequency of the sinne of uncleannesse amongst Christians, brings dishonour to God, scandal to their profession, and a wound to their own souls, and many of the Heathen will rise up in judgement in the last day against such: as these following Examples will more fully declare.

               <p>Anger is sometimes lawfull, yea a duty, when a man is angry at his own sinnes, or others, or at whatsoever hindreth the glory of God: this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</p>
               <p>Examples of it: <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 16. 20. and 11. 8. and 32. 19. Lev. 10. 16.

               <p>But most commonly it's sinfull, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, Eccles. 7. 9. Mat. 5. 22. Eph. 4. 26. Col. 3. 8. Tit. 1. 7.</p>
               <p>The evils of it, Prov. 14. 17. and 21. 19. and 22. 24. and 25. 8. 23. and 29. 20, 22. and 27. 4. Jam. 1. 26.</p>

               <p>SOme of the Heathens have attained to a great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie in this vertue of Patience: but Christians are to adde it to the number of their graces, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. And indeed it is that that gives a great lustre to all the rest: Humility is the root whence it springs, and

It makes all burthens light, and is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by exercise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Moses</hi> his meeknesse, and <hi>Jobs</hi> patience are exemplary, and so held forth in the Scripture: And these which follow also may be useful to quicken us to an earnest pursuit after this so excellent a vertue.</p>

for they told him that all such knowledge was but Notional, carnal, and hanging upon the Tree of Knowledge: adding, <hi>Cursed is every one that hangs on this Tree.</hi>

               <p>At his next meeting the Speaker urged him to take up the crosse daily, saying. <hi>Carry the crosse all day, and it will keep thee at night:</hi> He urged him to hearken to a voice within him: Spake much of a light within them, which <hi>Gilpin</hi> not yet finding, was much troubled, desiring that he might fall into quaking, thinking that thereby he should attaine to the immediate discoveries of God to him.

               <p>Presently after he went to another of their meetings where <hi>Atkinson</hi> was again the Speaker, with which he was more affected then formerly; for that (as he conceited) he could inwardly witnesse to what he spake. <hi>Atkinson</hi> having done, one <hi>Iohn Audland</hi> spake, in the time of whose speaking <hi>Gilpin</hi> was by the devil within him drawn out of his chaire, and thrown upon the ground where he lay all night; all which time his body and members were all in motion, being turned from his back on his belly, and so back again several times, making crosses with his legs, and his hands mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the ground as if he had been writing: and he heard (as he thought) a voice saying, <hi>that that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his hand on the ground signified the writing of the Law in his heart:</hi> then were his hands moved to his head, and he heard the voice saying, <hi>Christ in God, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56671:134"/>
God in Christ, and Christ in thee.</hi> Which words he was compelled to sing forth in a strange manner, and with such a voice as was not his own, he sung also divers phrases of Scripture which were given in to him: then the devil raised him up, and <hi>bade him be humble,</hi> then brought him on his knees again, and he heard the voice saying, <hi>Stoop low, low:</hi> and when his face was almost at the ground, it said to him, <hi>Take up thy crosse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi> Then rising he was led out of the house by the devil at a back doore to the River, and back again, and then into the Town, where he was drawn down the street, to a doore that he knew not: whereupon two of them that followed him, said, <hi>Whither will you go? This is the Fidlers house. Gilpin</hi> answered: <hi>Be it whose house it will, Christ leads me hither, and hither I must go:</hi> then was his hand forced to knock at the doore, and a voice bade him say, <hi>Behold, Christ stands at the door, and knocks.</hi> The Fidler opening the doore, he went in, and taking down a Base-viol, he was forced to play on it, and to dance whereupon he questioned what power led him to such actions? and the voice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently answered him, <hi>This is not because I love Musick, for I hate it, but to signifie to thee what joy there is in heaven at thy conversion: as also, what spiritual Melody thou shalt have hereafter.</hi> Then was he led out of the house, and carried thorow the Town, being forced, as he went, to proclaime, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> Then went he to his own house, and there by the devil was thrown down, and forced to make circles with his hands, the voice telling him, <hi>that he was now putting off the old man.</hi> His hand also was forced to take up a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to the spectatours, he was forced to say, <hi>Except you see signes, and wonders, you will not believe;</hi> And throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the stone amongst them, he said, <hi>Lo, here is my heart of stone.</hi> Then was he cast upon his back on the ground, and the voice said, <hi>Thou shalt have two Angels to keep thee:</hi> and immediately two swallows came down the Chimney, and sat on a shelfe neere him; whereupon he cried, <hi>My Angels, my Angels,</hi> and withal he held out his hand to them, expecting they should have come to him; but they flew up the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney again, though the doore, and windows were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Then was he carried upon his hands, and knees out of the doores into the street, and when his wife would have stopped him, he said, <hi>he must not be stopped, he must forsake wife, children, and all to follow Christ.</hi> Thus went he up the street, thinking that he bore a crosse upon his neck, till some pulled him out of the mire, and dirt, and by force carried him into his house, whereupon pointing at one of them, he said, <hi>Christ points at thee, thou art a wicked woman, and hast hindred the work of the Lord.</hi> Then the voice asked him, <hi>Where is thy crosse?</hi> upon which he thought he saw a visible crosse hanging in a thread, which with his hand he put behinde his neck: Thus he continued till the evening, when many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> coming to him, said, <hi>Be lowly minded, and hearken to the voice within thee,</hi> and so they left him, his strength being almost quite spent with his restlessenesse.</p>
               <p>His wife and family going to bed, he remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when he began to question, whether these strange actions were Divine, or Diabolical? whereupon he trembled, and his hand was forced to take up a knife, which lay by, and to point it to his throat, and the voice said to him, <hi>Open a hole there, and I will give thee eternal life:</hi> But he threw away the knife, and his

               <p>Shortly after the devil came to him again, and told him, that it was Satan that had possessed, and seduced him hitherto, but now Christ was come, and had cast out Satan, and told him also <hi>that what he had done the day before was in obedience unto Satan, and that as he had served Satan the day before in his cloathes, so now this day he must undo all that he had done in his shirt in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ:</hi> whereupon he rose out of his bed, went into the street in his shirt, but some stopped him: whereupon the devil within him told him, <hi>that he must be carried into the house by four women, or else that he should for ever stand there like a pillar of salt, as</hi> Lots <hi>wise did.</hi> Then foure women carried him into his bed; whereupon he told them, <hi>that the day before he had been doing the devils work, but now he must do Christs work, &amp;c.</hi> Then he fell to acting in his shirt upon the bed, as he had done the day before upon the floor, playing top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey turvey from one bed to another: the devil bidding him not to fear, for (saith he) <hi>I will give thee strength:</hi> then it told him, <hi>that the day before the devil bade him bear his crosse, but now Christ bade him lay it aside, for Christ takes no pleasure in Crosses, nor will be worshipped as yesterday he had done:</hi> It said farther: <hi>Yesterday the devil made thee lie all day on the ground, but now I have provided a bed for thee:</hi> For <hi>my yoak is easie:</hi> He promised also to <hi>give him bread of life to eat, and water of life to drink, and that out of his belly should flow rivers of living water:</hi> Then were his teeth moved as if he was eating, and he thought that he felt in his belly

               </p>
               <p>A while after he began again to question whether in all this he were not deluded by Satan, which made him fall into a great fear, and then the devil told him that <hi>all this while he had been serving him, and blaspheming God: and that now it was too late to repent:</hi> Hereupon he fell into despaire for a time, thinking that every thing which he either heard or saw was the devil that came to fetch him away: Sometimes he thought that he should be taken away in a flame of fire; other sometimes that the earth would open, and swallow him: Yet at last it pleased God (as it seemes) to give him repentance and peace in his conscience; whereupon he published a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of these things to discover the danger of these ways, and to be for caution to others to take heed how they go out of Gods wayes, and forsake his Ordinances, least falling into the error of the wicked, they decline from their former stedfastnesse, and lest not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the love of the truth, that they might be saved, God give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie. <hi>This is attested under the hand of the Major of</hi> Kendal, <hi>the Minister, Schoolmaster, and some others.</hi>

We have had much experience hereof, in these unhappy, bloody, civil warres: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our great victories, and successes, have been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and carried on most happily, when the enemy hath been most elated, and our selves most weak, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in despaire: neither is this any new thing, but according to Gods dealings in former times, as these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Scriptures, &amp; Examples will more clearly evince.

               <p>The command of the Sabbath hath a special <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> or Remember prefixed unto it: that by timely thinking of it, we might lay aside our worldly businesse, and get our hearts into an holy array, and readinesse for entertainment of God into them. It is the market-day of the soul, wherein the Lord useth to meet his people to dispense his blessings, and graces in, and by his Ordinances, to those which humbly, and reverently attend upon him therein. The carefull san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of it keeps up the power of godlinesse in our hearts, and lives. And if worldly labour is unlawfull upon that day, much more are carnal delights, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes: <hi>Melius arare, quàm saltare in Sabbato:</hi> It is better to plow then to dance on the Sabbath, was St. <hi>Austines</hi> judgement: and when men neglect to punish the profanation of it, the Lord usually takes the sword into his own hand, and by visible judgements plagues the profaners of it: as will further appeare by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples following.</p>

               <p>MAn, and wife, are as the two branches in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hand, inclosed in one barke, and so closing together, that they make but one piece: and therefore marriage is rather a fellowship of the dearest amity, then disordered love: and though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage we may endeavour to fit our choice to our minde, yet after, we must fit our minde to our choice: yea though all other contentions betwixt man, and wife are unlawful, yet may they contend each, who should love other most: and the more to quicken us hereunto, observe these Scriptures, and examples following.</p>

are but remember againe that I am</hi> Cato's <hi>daughter, and</hi> Brutus's <hi>wife: either nature from my father, or custome from my husband hath made me valiant, and constant so as not to fear any danger.

These two men being condemned, and sent to work in the Mettal-Mines, for a small difference fell into so great a Schisme; that they drew a partitian-wall between each other in the Mine, and would not hold Communion each with other in the service of Christ, for which they both were sufferers: which dissension of theirs caused such a rent in the Church, that it did more hurt then an open Persecution from the enemy.</p>

Army to besiege <hi>Syracuse,</hi> but prevails nothing: then he called the <hi>Cathaginians</hi> to his assistance, yet could not prevail; at last he gat the Kingdom by craft, and subtilty: turned Tyrant, murthered the Princes, and people: then passing with his Army into <hi>Africk</hi> he makes war with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that had holpen him to the Kingdom: and strangely prevails in many Battels, yet at last was beaten, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken by his Army, Children, and Friends, so that almost alone he returned into <hi>Sicilie:</hi> keeps his Kingdom.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:56671:239"/>
the Emperour marking it well, knew that it was the same which he had sent to his wife: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he goes to her, and asks her for the apple he sent her, she rashly affirms, that she had eaten it: he asks again more earnestly, and she affirms the same with an oath: Then the Emperour being very angry produceth the apple; and suspecting that <hi>Paulinus</hi> was too familiar with his wife, he causeth him to be slain; and divorceth his wife: she here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon went to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> where she led the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her life holily, and chastly. <hi>Lipsius.</hi>

So also they served a boy called <hi>Simeon, Anno Christi</hi> 1476. And another in <hi>Fretulium</hi> five years after. At another time they took a Carpenters sonne in <hi>Hungary,</hi> in contempt of Christ, whom they called the son of a Carpenter, and cutting all his veines sucked out all his blood with quills: And being apprehended and tortured, they confessed that they
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:56671:256"/>
had done the like at <hi>Thirna</hi> four years before, and that they could not be without Christian blood, for that therewith they anointed their Priests: But at all these times their wickednesse being discovered, they suffered just punishment, by hanging, burning, or some other cruel death.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1492. one <hi>Eleazar</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> bought the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> holy Host of a Popish Priest, and most despight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thrust it through with his knife, for which he was burned; and the like have others of them done at several times. <hi>Fincel.</hi>

               <p>The people made the Images of great Tyrants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and honoured them, that so they might by this flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery live the more peaceably under them.</p>
               <p>The ambitious skill of the workman, that through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the beauty of the work the multitude being allured, took him for a god, that a little before was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but as a man.</p>

Adde hereunto their impartial faithfulnesse in relating the naked truth, though to the discredit (as it might seem) of themselves, and their best friends. <hi>Moses</hi> repeats the sin and doom of his grandfather <hi>Levi:</hi> of his brother <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

sister <hi>Miriam,</hi> nay, of himself how he sinned, and was sentenced at the waters of strife. <hi>David</hi> shames himself in his preface to the 51. Psalm. <hi>Isaiah</hi> tells the world of the wickednesse of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his natural Princes. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> makes honorable mention of <hi>Daniel</hi> his coetaneous, and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> though he took him up publickly for halting at <hi>Antioch. I was a blasphemer, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressour, a persecutor,</hi> saith that blessed Apostle, whereby we see that it's free from partiality, and flattery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the matter of the Scripture, it's proved to be the Word of God; By the Majesty of it, which (besides the stately plainnesse of the stile) far surpasseth the creatures capacity, the fathom of flesh, and reach of reason. There is no jot, or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it that savours of earthlinesse: Every word of Gods mouth is pure, precious, and profitable, not a syllable superfluous. The very majesty of the sentence is such as cannot be conceived, and yet it's alwaies more powerful in matter then in words. It sets forth such an admirable concurrence of Gods mercy, and Justice in mans Redemption, by the man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> as no creature could possibly contrive: or if they could, yet certainly would not. Not good men, or Angels, for they would never have put upon the world such a notorious imposture: Not evil men or Devils, for it crosseth, and controlleth their contrary courses, and condemnes them to the pit of hell. It utterly overturns the Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who therefore sharply eggeth, and edgeth all his instruments against it: yea, and tempteth better men sometimes to doubt of it: whereas if it were forged, and false, he would (like a liar as he is) foment, and fight for it, promote, and propagate
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:56671:282"/>
it, as he doth <hi>Turcisme,</hi> and <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and other falshoods abroad in the world though never so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and impious.</p>
               <p>Lastly, look upon its admirable effects, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible power to effect the thing whereunto it's appointed, as to break the stubborn, to binde up the broken-hearted, &amp;c. Not onely to inform as other writings, but to reform, yea, transform the soul from glory to glory, till it be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to that heavenly pattern: Adde hereunto, that it's effectual for the conversion of a sinner from the errour of his way: Not from errour of his mind onely, but of his manners also: For the mind may be thorowly convinced, and yet the man not truly converted; yea, and when the spirit feeles it self dead, and decayed (as by a relapse into some foul sin) this good Word revives it, as the breath of God did those dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Humane writings may shew some faults to be avoided, but give no power to amend them: But, <hi>Now are ye clean by the Word that I have spoken,</hi> saith <hi>Christ: Sanctifié them by thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie may civilize, not sanctifie: hide some sins, not heal them: cover, not cure them. So then, the efficacy, and virtue of the Scripture to produce the love of God, and our enemies, to purifie the heart, to pacifie the conscience, to rectifie the whole both constitution, and conversation of a man, to take him off from the delights of the world, and the flesh, to make him glory in afflictions, sing in the flames, triumph over death: all these, and more do necessarily conclude the divine authority of the Scriptures. What words of Philosophers could ever make of a Leopard a Lamb: of a viper a child;
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:56671:283"/>
of a Leacher a chaste man; of a <hi>Nabal</hi> a <hi>Nadib;</hi> of a covetous carle, a liberal person?</p>
               <p>Besides this real, there is also a vocal testimony from God to the Divinity of the Scriptures, which yet is heard by none but Gods houshold, and is confined to the communion of Saints, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences he secretly perswadeth of this truth, and sweetly seales it up to them: Promised, Isa. 52. 6. <hi>They shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 7. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. <hi>He that believeth hath the witnesse in himself.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 15. <hi>The spiritual man discerneth all things: for he hath the mind of Christ: and an unction within that teacheth him all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20, 27. So that he no sooner heareth, but believes, and is <hi>sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</hi> Ephes. 1. 13. whose inward testimony of the truth, and authority of the Scriptures, is ever met by a motion of the sanctified soul, inspired by the same Spirit, more steadfastly resting it self on that testimony, then if he should hear from heaven, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did, <hi>Tolle, Lege,</hi> take, and read this book of God: or than if some Angel should bring him a Bible, and say; This is the very Word of God: For he might suspect these as delusions of the Devil But the testimony of the Spirit we know to be true; <hi>Job.</hi> 14. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is both a Spirit of truth, and a searcher of the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. Onely it must be remembred, that this inward witnesse must not be brought for confirmation of this Doctrine to others, nor for confutation of adversaries: But that every one for himself might hereby be certified, and satisfied in his conscience, that the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:56671:283"/>
are the Word of God. The Churches testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony without this is but of little value, and validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it being meerly <hi>informativum et directivum, non certificativum, et terminativum fidei:</hi> And whereas St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>I should not have believed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel but that the authority of the Church moved me thereto:</hi> he speaks there of himself as unconverted to the faith, and so not acquainted with the Spirits testimony. Now no marvel though such be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the consent, and authority of the Church; which is to them an introduction whereby they are better prepared to believe the Scriptures, yea, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at first to think them to be the Word of God, and so made willing to read, and hear them.

                  <hi>Cimon,</hi> General of the <hi>Athenians</hi> triumphed over the <hi>Persians</hi> twice in one day: for first he fought a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> great Battel with them by Sea upon the Confines of <hi>Asia,</hi> wherein he gave them a great overthrow;

fourth wall was begun by <hi>Agrippa:</hi> In humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had this wall been finished, the City could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been taken: For he began to build it with stones 20. cubits long, and 10. cubits broad, so that it could neither be easily undermined, nor bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with Engines: but he built this wall but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 10. Cubits high, and then fearing lest <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> should think that he had a purpose to rebell, he gave it over: yet afterwards the Jews raised this wall 20 Cubits high: made a battlement 2. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and the Tower 3. cubits, in all 24. cubits high: Besides upon the wall were three Towers 20. cubits broad, and twenty cubits high, built four square very strongly; within these Towers were rooms for men to dwell in, and Cisterns to receive rain-water. The third wall had ninety of these Towers, and between every Tower were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cubits space: The second wall had fourteen Towers; and the old wall had threescore, and the compasse of the whole City was 33. furlongs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the North, and West-part of the City upon the outmost wall stood the Tower <hi>Psephina,</hi> which was raised seventy Cubits high; so that in a clear day a man might from thence discover <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the utmost confines of the <hi>Jewes</hi> even to the Sea. Just opposite to this was the Tower <hi>Hippicos</hi> built by <hi>Herod</hi> upon the old wall, which for bignesse, beauty, and strength surpassed all others in the world: It had four corners, each of which was 25. Cubits broad, as many long, and 30. Cubits high, and in no place hollow: On the top was a Well to receive rain-water twenty Cubits deep. On the Top of all were houses 25. Cubits high divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many roomes: Above them were battlements two Cubits high, and Turrets three Cubits high, so
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:56671:310"/>
that in all it was eighty five Cubits high. He built also a second Tower in breadth, and length fourty Cubits, and as many high in Figure of a square pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, all solid, and not hollow within: And above this, a porch ten Cubits high adorned with Turrets, and Pinacles: Over the middest of this Porch he built another Tower distinguished into goodly roomes, and sumptuous Baths; and on the top it was beautified with Turrets, and Pinacles, so that the whole height was almost fourscore, and ten Cubits: Lastly, he built a third Tower, which he called after his Queens name, <hi>Mariamne</hi> twenty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and twenty broad, all of solid stone, and not hollow, having more stately and magnificent lodgings in it then either of the former: it was in all fifty five Cubits high. These Towers though they were very high, yet by reason of their situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they seemed far higher: For the old wall whereon they were built stood upon rock that was 30. Cubits high, whereby their height was much encreased: They were not built also of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary stone, but all of white Marble, whereof each stone was 20. Cubits long, and ten Cubits broad, and five Cubits thick; and so curiously joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that every Tower seemed but one stone; within the City was the Kings Palace surpassing all that can be spoken of it, and for greatnesse, and curious workmanship may be compared with any other in the world: It was environed with a wall 30.

In every room also were many vessels of gold, and silver, and many Porches round about adorned with most curious Pillars: There were in it very many pleasant walks adorned with all sorts of trees, and gardens beset with Fountains that spouted up water on high, and Cisterns beautified with many brazen Statues from which ran out water continually.</p>
               <p>The Temple was built upon a Rocky Mountain; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the plain on the top whereof was at first scarce big enough for the Temple, and Court, the hill being very steep: But the people every day bringing earth thither, at last made it plain, and large enough, and enclosed the hill with a treble wall, which was a work passing all expectation; to the effecting whereof many ages were spent, and all the holy treasure offered to God from all parts of the world: The foundations of the Temple were laid three hundred Cubits deep, and in many places more. The stones of it were 40. Cubit: The Porches were double, and every one was supported by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stately Pillars, twenty five Cubits high all of one piece of white Marble; the Tops of them were of Cedar so exactly wrought as astonished the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: These Porches were 30.

within it was twenty five Cubits high: At the top of the fourteen staires within the wall was a level compassed with a wall of three hundred Cubits, which had eight Gates in it; and between the Gates were Porches opposite each to other reaching from the wall to the Treasury, supported with great, and stately Pillars. All the gates were covered with Plates of gold, and silver, onely one was covered with <hi>Corinthian</hi> brasse, which for beauty far excelled the other, dazling the eyes of the beholders: In every gate were two doores, each of them thirty Cubits high, and fifteen broad; and on each side they had seats 30. Cubits long, and 40. Cubits high, each one supported with two Pillars twelve Cubits thick: Onely the Gate which was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> covered with <hi>Corinthian</hi> brasse was fifty Cubits high, the Gates were fourty Cubits, and it was more richly adorned then the rest.</p>
               <p>The Holy of Holies was situated in the middest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of all, and had twelve staires to go up to it. The forepart of it was an hundred Cubits high, and as many broad: Backward it was fourty Cubits; on each side it had as it were two shoulders rising up in height twenty Cubits: The first Gate was seventy Cubits high, and 25. wide, and had no doores to shew that heaven was alwaies open, &amp;c. All the foreparts were gilded, and all within was covered with fine gold. The inward part was divided into two rooms, whereof the first onely might be seen, which was in height fourscore, and ten Cubits, in length fourty, and in breadth twenty: Round about the Wall was a golden vine, whereon hung many grapes in clusters all of gold, every cluster being about six foot long: It had golden gates fifty five Cubits high, and sixteen Cubits broad. It had
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:56671:312"/>
curious hangings of the same length, admirably wrought with purple, violet, and Scarlet silk, all the fabrick was so exquisitely, and richly wrought, that none could possibly imagine any workmanship that it wanted: For it was all covered with a massie plate of pure gold which dazled the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: The top was all set with rods of gold, sharp like pikes at the ends, lest birds should sit thereon, and defile it. The stones wherewith it was built were fourty five Cubits large, five in length, six broad, and as many long. <hi>Josephus</hi> l. 6. c. 7.</p>

The river <hi>Tiber</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> is four hundred foot broad, and so deep that it will carry ships of the greatest burden. Its about sixteen miles distant from the Sea. It was almost round in compasse. The suburbs in processe of time grew so great, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Emperour built new walls, which were amost fifteen miles in compasse:
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:56671:312"/>
and again, the suburbs in a little time grew so great that one of them was fifteen miles long, and raught even to the Sea, and in <hi>Augustus</hi> his time there was numbred in <hi>Rome</hi> above three hundred, and twenty thousand poor people that received relief from the publick: Besides, the number of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was very great: few rich men but they had an hundred, and some four hundred a peece: <hi>Seneca</hi> saith in his time that the inhabitants were so many that the spacious and innumerable houses were scarce able to contain them: that a great part of them were forreigners that came from all parts of the world to live there: So that the number of inhabitants was reckoned to be at least four milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. These people were sustained with provisions brought out of all Nations; so that <hi>Rome</hi> seemed to be the common Mart of the whole world. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalns</hi> to shew the greatnesse of the City caused all the spiders to be gathered and put together, which being weighed amounted to ten thousand pounds weight: and a great Plague breaking out at <hi>Rome</hi> for many dayes together there died ten thousand persons. The houses were generally built very high, that so they might be the more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, insomuch as <hi>Augustus</hi> was feign to make a Decree that their buildings should not exceed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty foot in height, conceiving that they marred the delicacy of the air by their over-much shadow: but this extended onely to private mens houses, for the great men were not limited. But besides, the great height of the houses, they were beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the matter whereof they were built, by the Architecture, and by the Symmetry of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Art, and Elegancy strove for priority. And for

that end what exquisite workmen soever <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Asia</hi> brought forth, they were either sent for, or came of their own accord to beautifie this Imperial City, especially in <hi>Augustus's</hi> time, who made his boasts, <hi>Marmoream se relinquere, quam lateritiam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepisset:</hi> that he should leave <hi>Rome</hi> built of Marble, which he found built of Bricks. <hi>Nero</hi> also when he had burned a great part of it, at his own charges built it up again, beautifying it with excellently composed streets, large wayes, and curious porches to all the houses, which three things were a great Ornament to the City: whereupon <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> saith, <hi>Our forefathers tells us of the seven wonders of the World: The Temple of Diana at</hi> Epesus: <hi>The costly Tomb of King</hi> Mausolus: <hi>The brazen Statue of the Sunin the Isle of</hi> Rhodes <hi>called the</hi> Colossus. <hi>The Image of</hi> Jupiter Olympicus <hi>made by</hi> Phidias: <hi>The house of</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of the</hi> Medes, <hi>and</hi> Persians <hi>built by</hi> Memnon: <hi>The walls of</hi> Babylon <hi>built by</hi> Semiramus: <hi>And the</hi> Pyramides <hi>of</hi> Egypt: <hi>But now</hi> (saith he) <hi>the City of</hi> Rome <hi>is the greatest miracle of them all.</hi> There were in it four hundred twenty four Temples erected to their Idol-gods.</p>
               <p>There were two Capitols in <hi>Rome;</hi> The old built <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by <hi>Numa,</hi> the new, begun by <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> and <hi>Superbus,</hi> finished by <hi>Horutius Pulvillus</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, upon the <hi>Saturnian,</hi> or <hi>Tarpeian,</hi> or <hi>Capitoline</hi> hill. It was eight acres, or eight hundred feet in compasse, almost four square. It was ascended unto by one hundred steps on the South part which looked towards the Market-place, and Palace. It would hold eight thousand men. It was covered with brasse-tiles all gilt with gold. There were three Chappels in it; to one of which (<hi>viz. Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi>)

                  <hi>Augustus</hi> gave sixteen thousand pound weight of gold, and jewels worth almost as much more, twelve thousand Talents were spent in gilding of it. The gates were cover'd with thick plates of gold.</p>
               <p>Next after the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the <hi>Pantheon</hi> is worthily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> noted. It was built by <hi>Agrippa</hi> son in Law to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> in the year of the City 729. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of it was admirable, the beauty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of all the parts most exquisite: The breadth of it was one hundred and fourty four feet, and the height as much: It was wholly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with very great tiles of brasse richly gilt. In the Reign of <hi>Trajan</hi> it was burnt by lightning, and re-built by <hi>Hadrian.</hi>

               <p>The Temple of <hi>Peace</hi> was built by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hundred foot long, and two hundred broad: It was the most beautiful of all the Temples in the City, and enriched with gifts of inestimable value: It was adorned with Statues, and pictures of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite workmanship: yea and all the rarities were collected into this Temple for the sight whereof men formerly used to travel through the whole world. And here also he placed those vessels which formerly belonged to the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and were brought from thence by <hi>Titus</hi> at the sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. It was burnt down in the time of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> either with fire from heaven, or arising out of the earth after a little earthquake.</p>
               <p>There were an infinite number of Baths both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> publick, and private in <hi>Rome.</hi> Some of which baths were all paved with plates of silver, and set with rowes of Pillars for ornament. <hi>Antoninus's</hi> bath had sixteen hundred slates of polished Marble in it.</p>

It was made of hard flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stones, hewen and laid so close together, (yet without any morter or claspes of iron) that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all of one stone; the stones were three, four, and five feet square: nine hundred yeares after it was made the stones were not one whit disjoynted, or broken: Ever and anon on the sides were stones whereon persons might sit, or lay their burdens, or get on horseback, and at every miles and, high stones (or pillars) were raised, whereon were engraven the number of the miles. Likewise there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Monuments on both sides with witty inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or pretty inventions on them, yielding both matter of mirth, and seriousnesse to the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>

               <p>There were an infinite number of Statues, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Images in every part of the City, costly for their matter, and curious for their workmanship: some Authours say that there were neer as many of them, as there were living people in the City; some of them were of polished Marble; Infinite of brasse, some of Ivory, some of silver, and some of gold. <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour commanded that no statues should be made for him in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> but such as were all of silver, or all gold, solid, and not hollow, each of them weighing at least an hundred pound weight. <hi>Commodas</hi> the Emperour had a Statue made for him of gold that weighed a thousand pound weight: Together with a Bull, and a Cow of the same metal as if he had been the founder of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

It's walled with brick, and stone intermixed order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having twenty four Gates, and Posternes: It's about thirteen miles in Circumference. The world hardly affords a more delicate object if beheld from the Sea, or adjoyning Mountains. The lofty, and beautiful Cypresse-trees are so intermixed with the buildings, that it seems to present a City in a Wood to the pleased beholders. It's built on seven hills, whose aspiring heads are crowned with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent <hi>Mosques,</hi> or Churches, all of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, round in form, and coupled above; being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished on the top with gilded spires that reflect the Sun-beams with a marvellous splendor: some having two, some four, and some six adjoyning Turrets, exceeding high, and slender: Tarrast aloft on the outside, like the main top of a ship, in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces equally distant, whence their Priests with elated voices (for they use no bells) call the people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their Mahometan service.</p>

                     <hi>Pyramids,</hi> the greatest whereof is situated on the top of a rocky hill which riseth above the plain about an hundred feet, with a gentle, and easie ascent, the height of the situation adding beauty to the work, and the solidity of the rock giving the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure a permanent, and stable support: each side of this <hi>Pyramid</hi> is six hundred ninety three feet according to the <hi>English</hi> Standard; so that the whole <hi>Basis</hi> contains four hundred eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand two hundred, and fourty nine square feet, or eleven <hi>English</hi> acres of ground. The height is the same with the breadth, <hi>viz.</hi> six hundred ninety three feet. The ascent to the top is contrived in this manner: From all the sides without, the ascent is by degrees; the lowermost step or degree is about four foot in height, and three in breadth which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the <hi>Pyramid</hi> in a level, makes on every side of it a long but narrow Walk; the second row is like the first, retiring inward from the first three feet, and so runs about the <hi>Pyramid.</hi> In the same manner is the third row placed above the second, and so in order the rest like so many staires rising one above another to the top, which containes about nine foot square. The degrees by which men ascend are not all of an equal depth, for some are about four foot, others scarcely three, and the higher they ascend the more they diminish both in breadth, and thicknesse: so that a right line exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from any part of the <hi>Basis</hi> to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of every degree.</p>
                  <p>These are all made of Massie, and polished stones,

hewen out of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Mountaines which bound the upper part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being so vast, that the breadth and depth of every step is one single, and intire stone, so that in most of them is contained thirty feet of stone: The number of these steps is two hundred and seven.</p>
                  <p>On the North side ascending thirty eight feet upon an artificial bank of earth there is a square, and narrow passage leading into the inside of this <hi>Pyramid</hi> containing in length ninety two feet, and an half: The structure of it hath been the labour of an exquisite hand, as appears by the smoothnesse and evennesse of the work, and by the close knitting of the joynts: it is now an habitation for great ugly batts of about a foot long: At the end of this entrance you must climb up a massy stone, eight or nine foot in height, where you enter into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, the pavement consisting of smooth, &amp; polished white Marble; the breadth is about five foot, and the height the like: the length of this Gallery is an hundred, and ten feet: At the end whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a second Gallery, a very stately piece of work, and not inferiour either in respect of the curiosity of Art, or richnesse of materials, to the most sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous or magnificent buildings: It's divided from the former by a wall; At the end whereof is a Well about three feet in the diameter, the sides whereof are lined with white Marble, it's eighty six Cubits in depth, hewen through the rock on which the <hi>Pyramid</hi> stands: Beyond the Well about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot is a square passage, the stones whereof are exceeding massie, and exquisitely joyned, which containes one hundred and ten feet, at the end whereof is an arched Vault, or little Chamber, the length about twenty feet, the breadth seventeen,

the height about fifteen. The length of this second Gallery before mentioned is 154 feet, of white, and polished Marble both roof, walls, and bottom; the joynts are so well knit that they are scarce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable: The height of this Gallery is twenty six feet, the breadth six feet, bounded on both sides with two banks, like benches of polished Marble; At the end of this gallery you enter into a square hole which brings you into a little room lined with rich, and speckled <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble, out of which through another passage being all of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble most exquisitely cut, you land at the North end of a very sumptuous, and well proportioned room wherein art seems to contend with nature, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work being not inferiour to the rich materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: It stands in the heart, or center of the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid,</hi> equidistant from all the sides, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest between the <hi>Basis,</hi> and the top: The floor, sides, and roofe are all made of vast, and exquisite tables of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Marble: From the top to the bottom are but six ranges of stone, all of an equal height. The stones which cover this room are of a strange, and stupendious length, like so many huge beams lying flat, and traversing the room, and bearing up that infinite weight, and masse of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid</hi> above. Of these there are nine which cover the roof; the length of this room is thirty four <hi>English</hi> feet: the breadth somewhat above seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet, the height nineteen feet and a half.

It stands in a great plain, having no other hill near it by thirty leagues, the form of it is round: the rock is cut so smooth without any unequal swelling, that to him that stands beneath, it's like an high wall: the top is overhanged with rocks, jutting forth for the space of a mile: It's above twenty leagues in the circuit, compassed with a wall on the top well wrought, that so neither man, nor beast in chase may fall down. The top is a level, onely towards the South is a rising hill beautifying this plain, whence issueth a pleasant Spring which passeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all that plain, and paying its tribute to every Garden that will exact it, and making a Lake at length, whence issueth a River that from thence runneth into <hi>Nilus.</hi> The way up to it is cut out of the rock not with staires, but by an easie ascent, so that one may ride up with ease, at the foot whereof is a fair Gate with a <hi>Corps du Guard:</hi> Half way up is a fair, and spacious Hall cut out of the rock with three large windowes to it, and at the top is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gate with the like <hi>Guard:</hi> The air above is wholsome, and delectable, so that they live long there without sicknesse: There are upon it thirty four Palaces standing by themselves, spacious, sumptuous,

On both sides were the bodies of their deceased Kings, embalmed, set in seates of gold placed on planks of gold: All the doores about the Temple were lined with plates of gold; without the Temple on the top of the walls ran a champhered work of gold above a yard broad round about the Temple: Beyond the Temple ran a cloister of four squares, round about the top whereof was such a crown of champhered gold above a yard broad: In the corners of the cloister were Chappels; One whereof was dedicated to the <hi>Moon,</hi> all which with the Gates thereof were covered with plates of silver: the Image was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as that of the Suns, with the face of a woman, all of one plank of silver.

                     <hi>Mosaique</hi> work, and yet the furniture of the Church surpasseth the Fabrique in richnesse; Her walls are inlaid in many places with precious stones of divers colours, and in such a manner that they seem rather to be the work of Nature then of Art.</p>
                  <p>It's built in the form of a Crosse, whose corners are highly vaulted, and covered with bright Lead, as all the rest of the Church is. The whole Bulk is supported with most curious Arches joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by marvellous Art. The inside from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the highest part thereof glistereth with gold, and the concavity of the vaults is enriched with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers curious, and antick pictures. That which is from the gilding down to the pavement is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently joyned together with goodly Tables of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by whose pleasant veins in form of raies the eyes of the beholders are rather fed then satisfied. The seats below are of an extraordinary red stone like to <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> the Pavement is all of Marble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven with divers Figures wholly different, and of various colours: There are sundry Columnes and Tables of <hi>Parian, Spartan,</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> work that environ the seats on both sides the Quire. The
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:56671:330"/>
entrance into the Church on both sides is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the same trimming; while gilded Arches are sustained without by more then three hundred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Pillars, the space between those Pillars being filled with choyce Tables of Marble. On the height of this entrance are four great brazen horses all gilded over, in a posture as if running, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All this beares up the highest top of the Church divided into six Steeples, every of which is like a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> and hath on the sharpest point thereof a white Marble Statue of a naked man standing upright. Divers other representations delightful to the eye, and wrought with exceeding skill do beautifie the spaces between the Steeples, and all that which is vaulted underneath is covered with gold. In sum, there is no place in the whole Church, either within, or without, but it's either adorned with Marble, gold, or precious stones; so that the two Columnes of Alabaster, and the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedony</hi> stones which are in the middest of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are accounted the least curiosities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arsenal</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is one of the greatest Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Armes in all the world: It's three miles in compasse, wherein there are above three hundred Artificers perpetually at work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who make, and repair all things that belong thereto. This <hi>Arsenal</hi> hath Armes to furnish two hundred thousand men, and hath constantly belonging to it two hundred Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Dock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or abroad in course, besides Gallias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Galleons, with all provisions necessary for them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Treasury</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is cryed up through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the world: They say there is enough in it to pay six Kings Ransomes. There are Jewels of all sorts, and sizes, <hi>Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, Emerauds,</hi>

There are also twelve Corslets of Gold beset with precious stones. There is an huge gold Chain that reacheth from Pillar to Pillar: Divers Chests of Gold, and amongst others one great Iron Chest with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>When this Chest shall open the whole Earth shall tremble.</hi> There are two large <hi>Unicorn's horns.</hi> A great Bottel made of a <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> stone tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent, and clear, which will hold above a quart.

There are many Crosses, and Crucifixes of massie Gold beset with Jewels of all sorts: There are the Crownes of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Candie,</hi> as also that of the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> all inlaid with choice rich <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> great <hi>Rubies, Emerauds, Saphires,</hi> and other stones that would beget astonishment in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In that of the Dukes there is one great <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> worth an hundred thousand Crownes. There are Cups of sundry formes cut out of rich stones, with Dishes of sundry kinds. There are divers Presses full of Plate, huge, and massie, with Statues of silver, and large Chalices of gold, and variety of other rich things, the worth whereof no eye is able to judge.

This City is divided into two by the River <hi>Arno,</hi> over which are built four Bridges of stone; upon one of the two chief is the Goldsmiths street: upon the other, which is a very stately structure, stand the four quarters of the year in Marble: Opposite unto which stands a vast Columne with a Statue of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in <hi>Porphyrie</hi> at the top: Hard by is the Palace of <hi>Strossie</hi> admirable for the immensity of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick; on the left hand whereof is the Merchants Vault supported with many fair Pillars, and before it a brazen Boar jetting forth water: Before that is the great Place in the middest whereof is the great Duke <hi>Cosmus</hi> on horseback in brasse, neer unto which is a Fountain the like to which <hi>Italy</hi> affords not. Round about the Laver is the Family of <hi>Neptune</hi> in brasse, with his <hi>Colosse</hi> of Marble in the middest, born up by four horses. In this same <hi>Piazza</hi> is a Porch arched and adorned with some Statues, amongst which that of <hi>Judith</hi> in brasse, with the rape of the Sabines, three persons in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral postures cut all out of one stone. Just against it is the <hi>Palazzo Vechio,</hi> at the entrance whereof stand two <hi>Celossi,</hi> the one of <hi>David,</hi> the other of <hi>Hercules</hi> trampling on <hi>Cacus,</hi> excellent pieces. Within is a Court set about with Pillars of <hi>Corinthian</hi> work. Above is a very spacious Hall with divers Statues. Neer to it is the richest of Treasures, the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:56671:333"/>
Great Duke's Gallery, in the uppermost part whereof are contained as many wonders as things: some to be admired for the preciousnesse, and Art; others for their Rarity, and antiquity: On each side of the Gallery stand above fourscore Statues: One an Idoll brought from the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos:</hi> Another of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> holding up his gown under his Arme: Then two curious Triumphant Pillars: Over the Statues hang rare pictures, the most famous Scholars on the one side, and Souldiers on the other.</p>
                  <p>At the right hand of this Gallery are severall <hi>Stanza's</hi> full of curiosities, wherewith the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are astonished both in regard of the richnesse, and rarity thereof. In the first Room is an Altar totally compacted of Jewels, and precious stones: The value inestimable. In the next is a Table with Flowers, and Birds in their natural colours of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, with a Cabinet worth two hundred thousand Crownes covered with <hi>Agates, Emerauds, Amethists,</hi> &amp;c. Within it is the History of Christ's Passion, with the twelve Apostles all in Amber. In the third is a Cabinet with <hi>Calcedonie</hi> Pillars, filled with ancient Medals of gold. Round about this Room are an infinite number of Natural, and Artificial curiosities: As the Emperour's head cut on a <hi>Turquoise</hi> bigger then a Walnut, with thousands more. Next is the Armory, wherein are the habits, and divers sorts of Armes of several ages, and people. There is likewise a Loadstone that bears up fourscore pounds weight of Iron. In the last Cabinet is the curious turned works of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; A Pillar of Oriental Alabaster, &amp;c. In another Room are twelve great Cupboards of silver Plate
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:56671:334"/>
of all sorts, and another of all pure Massie Gold. A Saddle all Embroydered with Pearles, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; besides many other things of great worth.</p>
                  <p>From hence is a private passage to the Duke's Court on the other side of the River: The front of which edifice is very Majestique, towards the Basis of <hi>Dorick</hi> work, in the middest of <hi>Ionick,</hi> and the uppermost story of <hi>Corinthian.</hi> In the Court is a <hi>Grotto</hi> with Statues, and a Fountain over it; and a Loadstone of a most prodigious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>The Gardens belonging to it for their large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse have the Face of a Forrest, for their variety of a Paradise. Here are Cypresse Groves, their Walks with Statues: Here a Sea of Fountaines; There Swans, Ostriches, and other delighting Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>The Cathedral Church is of a vast Bulk, and exquisite workmanship, made of Red, White, and Black Marble. The <hi>Cupola</hi> is so high, that the brasse Globe at the top will hold sixteen persons: No lesse excellent is the Steeple composed of the same stone, and materials with the Church, but with more Art, and Ornaments.</p>
                  <p>The Chappel of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> seems more then terrestrial: It's wholly overlaid with fine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished stones, neither is there any colour upon Earth but it's there in stones naturally.
