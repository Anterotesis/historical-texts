            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HIS MAJESTIES REASONS Againſt the pretended Iuriſdiction of the high Court of Iuſtice, which he intended to deliver in VVrititing on <date>Munday Ianuary 22. 1648.</date>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Faithfully tranſcribed out of the Originall Copie under the Kings own Hand.</head>
            <p>HAving already made my proteſtations not onely againſt the illegality of this pretended Court, but alſo that no earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can juſtly call me (who am your King) in queſtion as a Delinquent, I would not any more open my mouth upon this occaſion, more then to referre my ſelfe to what I have ſpoken, were I alone in this caſe concerned. But the duty I owe to God in the preſervation of the true Liberty of my People, will not ſuffer mee at this time to be ſilent: For, how can any free-born Subject of England call life or any thing he poſſeſſeth his owne, if power without right daily make new, and abrogate the old funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Law of the Land, which I now take to be the preſent caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would have indeavoured to have ſatisfied me concerning theſe grounds, which hinder me to Anſwer to your pretended impeachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge me, nor indeed the meaneſt man in England; for I will not (like you) without ſhewing a reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a beliefe upon my Subjects.</p>
            <p>There is no proceeding juſt againſt any man,<note place="margin">Hereabout I was ſtopt, and not ſuffered to ſpeak any more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reaſons</note> but what is warranted either by Gods Lawes, or the municipall Lawes of the Country where he lives. Now I am moſt confident, that this daies proceeding cannot be warranted by Gods Law, for on the contrary the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and new Teſtament; which if denied, I am ready inſtantly to prove: and for the queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is Power, and who may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou: Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. Then for the Lawes of this Land, I am no leſſe confident, that no learned Lawyer will affirme that an impeachment can lie againſt the King, they all going in his name; and one of their Maximes is, <hi>that the King can do no wrong.</hi> Beſides the Law upon which you ground your proceedings, muſt either be old or new; if old, ſhew it; if new, tell, what authority warranted by the fundamentall Lawes of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judicature, which was never one it ſelfe (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge; And it were fall as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Lawes without King or Lords-Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Lawes of England.</p>
            <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the people of Englands Commiſſion could grant your pretended power, I ſee nothing you can ſhew for that; for certainly you never asked the queſtion of the tenth man of the Kingdome, and in this way you manifeſtly wrong even the pooreſt Plough-man, if you demand not his free conſent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your pretended, Commiſſion without the conſent at leaſt of the major part of every man in England, of whatſoever quality or condition, which I am ſure, you never went about to ſeek; ſo farlare you from having it. Thus you ſee that I ſpeak not for my own right alone, as I am your King, but alſo for rhe true Liberty of all my Subjects, which conſiſts not in ſharing the power of Government, but in living under ſuch Lawes, ſuch a Government as may give themſelves the beſt aſſurance of their lives and propriety of their goods. Nor in this muſt or do I forget the Priviledges of both Houſes of Parliament, which this daies proceedings doth not only violate, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occaſion the greateſt breach of their Publike Faith that (I beleeve) ever was heard of, with which I am far from charging the two Houſes: for all the pretended Crimes laid againſt me, bear date long before this late Treaty at Newport, in which I having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as much as in me lay, and hopefully expecting the two Houſes agreement there unto, I was ſuddenly ſurprized, and hurried from thence as a priſoner, upon which accompt I am againſt my will brought hither, where ſince I am come, I, cannot but to my power defend the ancient Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome, together with my own juſt right; then for any thing I can ſee the higher Houſe is totally excluded.</p>
            <p>And for the Houſe of Commons, it is too well known that the major part of them are detained or deter'd from ſitting, ſo as if I had no other, this were ſufficient for me to proteſt againſt the lawfulneſſe of your pretended Court. Beſides all this, the peace of the Kingdome is not the leaſt in my thoughts, and what hopes of ſettlement is there ſo long as power reigns without rule of Law, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the whole frame of that Government under which this Kingdom hath flouriſhed for many hundred yeares, (nor will I ſay what will fall out in caſe this lawleſſe unjuſt proceeding againſt me do go on) and beleeve it the Commons of England will not thanke you for this change, for they will remember how happy they have been of late years under the Reign Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King my Father, and my ſelfe, untill the beginning of theſe unhappy troubles, and will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo happy under anie new. And by this time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Armes I tooke up were onely to defend the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdom, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed my power hath totally changed the ancient Government.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons, why I cannot ſubmit to your pretended authority without violating the truſt which I have from God, for the welfare and liberty of my People; I expect from you either clear Reaſons to convince my Judgement, ſhewing me that I am in an error (and then truely I will readily anſwer) or that you will withdraw your proceedings.</p>
