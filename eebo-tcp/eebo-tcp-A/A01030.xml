            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMonge our manifold enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, there is not any one, which more grieues the Lord Ieſus, and vvhich doth make him more to be offended vvith vs, then vvhen vve abuſe, either himſelfe, or his bleſſed ordinances to peruerſe ends: therfore of all things vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, vvee are to looke to, in our

            <p>VVe knovv vvhat fearefull iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Corinthians did bring vpon themſelues, for not eating the Lords ſupper, as they ought. For vvhich abuſe of that holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, the Lord plagued them, vvith ſundry diſeaſes, and ſickneſſes, and diuerſe kinds of deaths: ſo zealous is the Lord, of keeping his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, from the abuſe, &amp; contempt of men. See 1. <hi>Cor chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>VVee are not ignorant alſo of the ſeueritie vſed by God, againſt <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for offring of ſtrang fire before the Lord, in conſuming them both vvith fire

            <p>The like example haue vvee of the teſtimonie of Gods anger, againſt <hi>Vzzah</hi> (as example to all them, that vſe not the holy things of God aright nor reſpectfully) vvho preſuming co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Let vs remember vvhat the Lord did to king <hi>Vziah,</hi> for attempting to enter in to the ſanctuary, to offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe before the Lord, vvhich belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged only to the Prieſt to doe, in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him vvith a leaproſie all the daies of his life, 2. <hi>Chro. cap.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah</hi> are docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this day of the Lords ſore diſpleaſure againſt all thoſe, vvho
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21565:4"/>
pretending faith, loue, and zeale, and liberalitie to Chriſt, and his Church, dealt hipocriticallie vvith counterfeit ſhevve, and not trulie vvith God, in any thing, concerning his vvorſhip, his glory, his ordinances, and his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. vvho both of them vvere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by death, for dealing falſelie vvith the Lord, in their prophane, &amp; counterfeite ſhevve, of imitating the charitable liberalitie of the Primitiue Churches, in ſelling their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bringing the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Apoſtles feet, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thoſe that did vvant. See <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>All theſe do let vs ſee, that the Lord can not abide, that any man ſhould prophane, any of his holy ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, or for any by-prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to make ſhevv, of zeale to his glorie, or deſire of his holy things: it is not poſſible, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21565:4"/>
hee ſhould ſuffer vs to goe long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, if vve doe not ſerue him in all his ordinances vvith ſinceere, &amp; vpright hearts. The truth vvhereof is confirmed by this Hiſtorie: For theſe Ievves comming vnto Chriſt, did make a great ſhevve, and deſire, to enjoy the bleſſed fellovvſhip, and communion of the Sonne of God: &amp; yet Chriſt is diſpleaſed vvith them, becauſe they ſought him not vvith vpright hearts: therfore hauing chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and reproued them, in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting, and opening the poyſon of hypocriſie, which was in their hearts, in the preceding verſe of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In this verſe vvhich vve haue novv read, hee laboureth to cure by vvholeſome medecine, the ſicknes of their ſoule, if poſſible the peruerſe diſpoſition of their hearts could be reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21565:5"/>The euill that he reproues in them is this, that they ſought not after Chriſt aright: becauſe they did not ſet before themſelues, the right vſe of Chriſt in comming vnto him. They ſhould haue ſought after him, firſt, and principallie, for ſpirituall things, tending to the vvelfare of their ſoules, but they ſought after him for nothing but the foode of their bodies, and the vvelfare of this their tanſitorie life: therefore Chriſt is offended at them, &amp; ſo hee is vvith all others, vvho follovving their footſteps, come vnto him, or his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the like manner.</p>
            <p>Novv to remedie this euill, the Sonne of God, labours to giue them ſome vvholeſome inſtruction, in which, theſe points are to be marked. Firſt, <hi>VVhat it is that he enioynes them to? vvhich is to labour.</hi> Secondly, <hi>For
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21565:5"/>
vvhat he vvill haue them to labour, &amp; that is for ſpirituall things, namely, the meate of their ſoules, and the food of eternall life.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>vvee haue to conſider, the preparation vnto this, by remouing the hindrances hereof, in repreſsing the loue of the vvorld in mens hearts. Commanding them not to labour for that meate which periſheth.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>vve haue heere ſet downe by Chriſt, an information, &amp; an inſtruction vvhere to finde this bread of life, ſince it vvere in vaine to labour for it, if vve knew not vvhere to find it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee tells them the Sonne of man ſhall giue it vnto them.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Here is ſet downe an argument, or reaſon of confirmation to make this good, and to ſecure the ſoule of him, that ſeeks this bread of life from Christ, that Chriſt is able, yea not only able, but alſo vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ready to giue it vnto them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21565:6"/>
and that is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then let vs ſpeake of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation vvhich is to labour for that meat, vvhich endureth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
            <p>By this exhortation vve ſee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, that it neuer vvas the purpoſe, nor mind of God, ſince the vvorld beganne, that men ſhould feede on any meat, either corporall, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, vvithout labour, and pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for it: you knovv, that lavve of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſ.</hi> the ſecond <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. <hi>chap. verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>If there be any that vvill not vvorke, the ſame man ſhall not eate</hi>: that man therefore ſhall neuer be vvorthie of heauen, that vvill take no paines for it, for if it be Gods vvill, that vvee ſhould labour, if vve vvould enioy the food
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21565:6"/>
of our bodies: it muſt needs be much more his vvill, that vvee ſhould labour for the food of our ſoules. It is therefore in vaine for men euer to looke to be made pertakers of the ſupper of the lambe, and bread of heauen, if they vvill take no paines for it, there is an neceſſitie layd vpon vs to labour, for the food, both of ſoule, and bodie: it is no ſlothfull, nor careles man that God vvill feed: ſuch men therefore as thinke, to goe, to heauen ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, vvithout ſeeking after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and doe hope to haue Chriſt brought vnto them, vvhile they reſt in their beds, and vvill not doe ſo much, as to riſe, and let him in, vvhen he calles, and knocks at their doores, and looke to be fed vvith the food of Angels, and yet vvill not ſtir hand, nor foote to labour for it.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21565:7"/>
I ſay ſuch men can neuer expect, to haue it from God. VVe knovv it ſufficiently, rhat it is Gods vvill, and ordinance, that touching this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, a man ſhould eate his bread in the ſvveat of his brovves, &amp; vve doe vvillingly vndergoe paine, &amp; labour for it: But here is all our fault, that hovvſoeuer vve be buſied, and pained for temporall things, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this life: yet vve haue neither heart nor mind to take any paines for ſpirituall things. And this is one of the greateſt ſinnes of this miſerable age, vvhere in men are ſo diligent, &amp; laborious, for the things of this life, and yet ſo careles, &amp; miſerablie neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in things concerning eternall life. VVell this vve ſay, (&amp; that truly) the greater diligence men vſe, &amp; the more paines they take about vvorld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſes: the greater ſhalbe there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21565:7"/>
conviction, and their iudgment the more terrible, in the daie of Chriſt his appearing: If they haue not beene much more painfull about ſpirituall things, vvhich do concerne eternall life. VVe ſhall heare here after vvhat need vve haue to vveane our ſelues from the cares of this vvorld, and of earthly things: becauſe it is the maine hinderance, and let, of our care, and ſolicitude for heauenly things, and therefore it muſt be firſt rooted out of the heart, before the heart can be ſet as it ought vpon ſpirituall things.</p>
            <p>But novv let vs conſider vvhat is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder this word <hi>Labour,</hi> and vvhat are the things, that the Son of God requires of vs, to be done for the attaining to this bread of life. Chriſt himſelf here after in the ſame chapter ſhevves this, in anſvvering the Ievves queſtion, vvhen they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21565:8"/>
aſked him, <hi>vvhat ſhall vve doe, that vve maye worke the vvorkes of God?</hi> Ieſus anſvvered, and ſaid vnto them, <hi>this is the vvorke of God, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, vvhom he hath ſent,</hi> heere in ſteed of all vvorkes, Chriſt places but one, and that is the vvorke of beleeuing: a vvorke not of the hand, nor of the body, but a vvorke of the heart. For as a man muſt haue a mouing hand, &amp; a ſtirring body, in the buſines that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to this world: ſo for obtaying of ſpiritual bleſſings, he muſt haue a ſtirring, and a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heart: his heart muſt vvorke by faith, if euer he thinke to haue any ſpirituall bleſſing from God: for it is by faith alone, that vve draw all good things from God in heauen, and by faith alone it is, that vve render to God any thing, that can be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him, for all though in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21565:8"/>
Scriptures, our actions are attributed to loue: yet they are in this life more properlie attributed to faith: ſeing that <hi>faith vvorks by loue</hi>: and ſo loue being but the inſtrument of faith, and that by vvhich faith vvorketh: and this is the reaſon vvhy all the doings, and ſuffrings of the children of God, are attributed vnto faith, as you may ſee in the 11. of the <hi>Lev.</hi> for the vvhole operation of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man, conſiſts maynly in the vvork of beleeuing, vvithout which, vve ſhall neuer receiue ought from God, that is able to ſaue our ſoules, neither ſhall vve be able to doe ſo much, as to ſend vp one ſound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or petition vnto God.

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:21565:15"/>And yet further to conſider this point, mark, hovv the Apoſtle makes it a ſtrong reaſon, in the 1. <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. vvhy men ſhould not eate of any meat vvith offence of their brethren: ſaying, meat is ordained for the belly, and the belly for meat, and God ſhall deſtroy them both, if men had hearts to conſider this, what reaſon could they haue, to be carefull for meat which ſerues to ſatisfie their bellie, vvhen both meat, and bellie, ſhall periſh. It is an ydle dreame for men to thinke, that theſe parts of our bodies, vvhich are only giuen for temporall vſe, in this life. That I ſay vvee ſhall haue any vſe of them in heauen, for there vve ſhall haue no vſe of ſtomacks to diſgeſt, or bovvels to make convayance of our meat, for nouriſhing theſe our bodies, ſeing our bodies in heauen, ſhalbe

immortall, &amp; glorious, like vnto the glorious bodie of the Sonne of God, vvhen therefore vve are feeding our bodies, and ſatisfying our bellies, it is good for vs to thinke, and remember that vve are feeding that, vvhich ſhal periſh: &amp; that with food which ſhall likevviſe periſh, that vve may learne neither to care too much for the bellie, nor for food requiſite vnto it.</p>
            <p>Novv let vs conſider the argument of the contrarie parte, vvherby Chriſt perſwades vs to labour for ſpirituall meat, in vvhich vve are to obſerue tvvo things:</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the nature of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly food in it ſelfe, all though vve neuer do enioy it, vvhich is declared by this [that it endureth.]</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is the effect of it in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that get it, vvhich is that it makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo to indure &amp; to liue eternally.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:21565:16"/>For the firſt, vvee are to conſider, that all the ſpirituall gifts, that God giues vs in Chriſt Ieſus, are all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and ſuch as ſhall neuer periſh: vvhatſoeuer God gaue by creation, it might be defaced, and vtterlie vndone: yea, euen the chiefeſt gift, that euer vvas giuen in nature to Adam, (vvhich vvas Gods Image) vvas by Sathan extinquiſhed, and defaced, and as the Scripture tells vs, at the comming of Chriſt to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the elements ſhall melt vvith fire, and the earth, and all the vvorks thereof ſhall periſh, and the heauens ſhall vvax ould as a garment, and this vvhole vvorld ſhall come to an end, but the gifts of ſauing grace, giuen vs in Chriſt, can neuer be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinquiſhed, or defaced, for as it is impoſſible to deſtroy the Sonne of God himſelfe, or that the ſorrovves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21565:16"/>
of death, ſhould haue held him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, or that the graue ſhould haue povver to retaine him, ſo is it impoſſible, that Chriſt giuen vnto vs, and his fleſh vvhich vve eate, and his blood vvhich vve drinke, or the vertue of them in vs, can euer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie bee defaced in vs, and this is the reaſon that Chriſt ſaith, that his fleſh is meat in deed, and his blood is drinke in deed for his fleſh is not a periſhing meat, nor his blood a decaying drinke, vvhich cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, as the nature of all other meat, and drinke is: but his fleſh is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting food, and his blood euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting drinke, and his grace as a vvell, ſpringing continuallie, to euerlaſting life, men might thinke, that by the death of our bodies, the vertue of Ieſus Chriſts fleſh, and blood, vvere vtterlie periſhed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21565:17"/>
but it is not ſo, they that eate this fleſh, and drinke this blood, ſhall find the vertue of his fleſh, &amp; blood, euen vvhen they are rotten in the graue, &amp; by the ſame povver, vvhere vvith he rayſed himſelfe from the dead, hee ſhall likevviſe rayſe them, from the povver of death, this then is the firſt thing, vvhich vve are to conſider in this food, that it is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during meat.</p>
            <p>But the next thing is a greater comfort vnto vs, for this is not all the bleſſednes of this food, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this argument, to knovv that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, are in themſelues permanent, and eternall, but that vvhich chiefly refreſheth our ſoules is this, to know that vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer pertakes of them, ſhal pertake of eternall life vvith them, this is a bleſſed thing in deed, vvhen I knovv,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21565:17"/>
that not only the things vvhereof I am made pertaker are eternall, but that I my ſelfe, by pertaking of them ſhall be eternall as vvell as they. VVhat can moue a man to ſeeke this meat, if this doe it not? vvhen vvee vnderſtand that it hath this povver to vvork ſuch a bleſſed effecte in him that is pertaker of it. It is vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the miſerable ignorance of (this benefit, vvhich comes by the fleſh, &amp; blood, of Chriſt,) that makes men ſo careles to enioy them, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the vvorld, that a man more deſires then to liue for euer, all that euer a man hath he vvill giue for his life, that he may not ſee death, but as Dauid ſaith in the 49. <hi>Pſal.

eternal life, no not all the means that can be diuiſed, eate vvhat a man can eate, &amp; drink vvhat a man can drink, yet he ſhal dye, but heere is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Chriſtian, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, he is fed vvith that meat, that ſhall make him to liue for euer: in ſuch ſorte, that <hi>the gates of hel ſhal not preuaile againſt him,</hi> neither death nor the graue ſhal haue povver ouer him, but he ſhall haue a glorious triumph ouer them both, ſo as he ſhall ſing that ioyfull ſong, <hi>o death, where is thy ſting, o graue, vvhere is the victory?</hi> And this is no vvo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, ſeing the cauſes of this life are eternall, it cannot be but that the life that flovveth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them muſt be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and they that are fed vvith him muſt needs liue eternally, for all that we receaue from Chriſt, is eternal, the peace eternall, the ioy, &amp; life eternall, &amp; this is that vvhervvith Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21565:19"/>
the blood of Chriſt, ſhall liue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie. Should vvee not in our hearts deſire it, and beg of Chriſt to make vs pertakers of it, and earneſtly long to enioy it: ſurely it muſt needs be a moſt luſt thing vvith God to povvre dovvne heauie iudgment vpon this ſenceles age, and ſinfull generation of men, vvho take greater pleaſure to ſeeke after the ſtinking delights of this fleſh, and to vvallovv in their beaſtly luſts, then to enioy this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bread, that endures to euerlaſting life: for it is impoſſible for any man to haue perpetuitie of being vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, vvhen therefore vvee ſee other men to call their lands by their names, ſo to perpetuate their names on earth: let vs not follovv their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh footſteps, but if vve deſire to liue for euer, let vs labour for this meat, vvhich endures to eternall life, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21565:19"/>
thus much for the reaſon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning alſo a diſcription of that, for vvhich vvee ſhould labour.</p>
            <p>Seeing then vvee ſee vvhat great reaſon, vvee haue to ſeeke this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall food, it is neceſſarie for vs to knovv vvhere vvee ſhall find it, and that is the next point vve are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, [<hi>vvhich the ſonne of man ſhall giue vnto you.</hi>] In theſe vvords, let vs marke theſe tvvo things: Firſt vvho it is, of vvhom vvee muſt haue this meat: That is the Sonne of man: The ſecond is, hovv vve ſhall haue it, and that is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, he ſhall giue it vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, vvee are to mark, that it pleaſeth Chriſt through out the Scriptures, to name himſelfe more by this name (the Sonne of man) then by any other, eſpeciallie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21565:20"/>
vvhen he ſpeaks of the vvorks of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace: and for the comfort of his elect ones: it muſt therefore be a matter of great moment, and of ſingular inſtruction for vs, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues Chriſt to take this name vpon himſelfe, and certainly it is ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not perceaued, nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, by euerie man. In this ſame chapter vvhen Chriſt had told the levves, that <hi>vnles they did eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, they had no life in them, many of his diſciples murmured at it, and ſaid, this is a hard ſaying,</hi> and in deed no maruell, that it ſeeme hard to a naturall man, for hovv can he thinke, that the fleſh, and blood of man, ſhould haue the vertue of eternall life in them, but Chriſt opens this miſtery in the ſame place, telling them that it vvas <hi>the ſpirit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21565:20"/>
that quickeneth, the fleſh proſitteth nothing:</hi> for it is true, that all though vvithout this fleſh and blood, vve can haue no life in vs, yet certainly euen the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, nakedly conſidered, as fleſh and blood, or yet, as the fleſh and blood of a man, could neuer giue life to them, that eate and drinke it, but as being the fleſh, and blood of God, in the vvhich fleſh, all the fullnes of the God-head dvvels bodily, it is no maruell that it giues life to them, that eate and drinke them, for as much as the eternal ſpirit is neuer ſeparated from this fleſh, nor from this blood, &amp; therfore all though their can be no eternall life, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this eternal ſpirit, yet it is the pleaſure of God, that no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vertue of the Diety, nor life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the God head ſhould euer be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated vnto man, but in, &amp; through
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21565:21"/>
the fleſh, and blood of Ieſus Chriſt the Lord: Let no man therefore Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe this fleſh, &amp; blood, nor the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard means, vvhereby our fellovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and communion, in this fleſh, and blood is ſealed vnto vs, ſince vvithout this fleſh, and blood, it is not the purpoſe of God to ſaue vs, let vs therefore lay vp this miſterie in our hearts, that as the fleſh of Chriſt can neuer quicken, but by the ſpirit, euen ſo alſo the ſpirit ſhall neuer quicken but by the fleſh.</p>
            <p>There is yet more in this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and that is, that as God vvill diſpence no ſauing grace, but in the fleſh, and blood, of Ieſus Chriſt the man, ſo he vvill not diſpence it, but by Chriſt as hee is man, for God hath giuen all iudgment to the Sonne, not as hee is God ſimplie, but as he is the Sonne of man, and by him as hee is

hee is be come our brother in our nature, that being man, hee might bring vs that are men to God.

            <p>Theſe vvords comprehend a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chlefe moment for our conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deration, for if this vvere not, all the knovvledge of Chriſt vvere but ſmall comforte, to a poore ſinfull ſoule, but this it is that giues vs ioy, in the contemplation of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, that vve knovv, that God the Father hath ſealed him.</p>
            <p>To conſider this place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a right, vvee are to knovv, that it is taken from the cuſtome of men, vvho vvhen they vvill haue any thing to be made ſure, and ſted-faſt, and vvhen they vvill make it to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21565:26"/>
haue authoritie, and ſtrength, they are accuſtomed to adde their ſeale to it, to confirme it, by vvhich vvhatſoeuer is promiſed, is made more ſtronge: ſo God by this ſorte of ſpeech doth ſhevv vs, that not only, he hath giuen Chriſt to be our Sauiour according, as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his VVord, and that hee is that Lambe of God, that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the ſinnes of the vvorld, and that hee hath not only reconciled al things, by the blood of his croſſe, but alſo to make all things ſure, and firme, that vvee might neuer call this into queſtion, hee hath rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all this, by adding his ſeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>Out of this, vve are firſt to learne: <hi>That the naked knovvledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Christ, and vvhat God hath made him vnto vs, is not ſufficient
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21565:27"/>
to ſaluation, except vvee know, that God the Father hath ſealed Christ to be all in all vnto vs,</hi> that hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and vvhich he hath made him to be, vvhereby I may be confirmed, that vvhatſoeuer God ſaith, Chriſt is, or vvhatſoeuer God is ſaid to haue made him for mee, is vndoubtedly ſo, here vve may ſe, that in our minds vve muſt aſcend higher then Chriſt himſelfe, or the promiſe of God in him, to ſeeke the chiefeſt ground, or ſtay of our faith, vvhich allthough it can haue no ground vvithout Chriſt, and vvithout the promiſe, yet neither the promiſe, nor Chriſt (in vvhom the promiſe is yea, and amen) could be any ſure ground of life, &amp; ſaluation to me vnleſſe both came from this, and vvere ſtamped vvith this ſeale of the Father in Chriſt, for all though, that Chriſts
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21565:27"/>
fleſh be ſaid to giue life to thoſe, that are pertakers of it: yet the ground, and reaſon of this ſtands in this, that the Father hath ſealed him in his fleſh to be the life of the vvorld, ſo that vvithout knovvledge of this, our hope and faith vvere vaine.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore come to conſider this ſeale of God. Firſt in generall, vve knovv that a ſeale vvhen it is applied doth leaue the impreſſion of it ſelfe, moſt liuely in the vvax vvhere into it is ſet, ſo that all the forme, the ſhape, and marks, that are in the ſeale are liuely imprinted in the vvax, thus hath God the Father dealt vvith his Sonne, for there is no promiſe of mercy, of grace, of holines of life, or glorie, vvhich God hath made in Chriſt to ſinners, but he hath ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſame in Chriſt the man, ſo that euerie man that ſees the fleſh of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21565:28"/>
Chriſt, vvith true ſpirituall eies, may ſe that his fleſh, is ſtampt vvith righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, vvith the life of God, and vvith immortall peace, &amp; euerlaſting glory. But to come nearer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this ſeale, it is true, that many men run to his Diety, to find this ſeale, and that becauſe it is ſaid in the firſt of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt, <hi>that hee is the brightnes of the glorie, and the expreſſe, or in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen image of the Fathers</hi> perſon, for vvhich cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>that he that ſees the Sonne, ſees alſo the Father:</hi> but not vvithſtanding all this, if the Sonne of God had bene ſealed by the Father, only in his diuine nature, as he is the ſecond perſon of the trinitie, &amp; that this ſeale of God had neuer reached from his God head, to his humanity, his fleſh could neuer haue bene the bread of life, therfore we muſt labour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21565:28"/>
to ſee this ſeale of God, ingrauen in Chriſt the man, elſe hovv can vvee knovv, that by eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, vve haue eternall life, ſince vvith out this ſeale, his fleſh, and blood could haue no more force, to giue life, then any other fleſh, or blood, of any other man: therfore let vs conſider, vvherin this ſealing of the Son, as he is man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts.</p>
            <p>This ſeale hath fiue ſpeciall things in it, to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Gods eternall ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherby he did ordaine Chriſt the man, and none but Chriſt the man, to be the food of our ſoules, to be the mediator betvveene God, &amp; vs, &amp; ſo to be the only King, Prieſt &amp; Prophet, of Gods houſe for euer, by vertue of this appointment of God, Chriſt comes to bee, that to vs, that hee is, and this eternall decree
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21565:29"/>
of God, concerning Chriſt in his fleſh, to bee our redeemer, is made manifeſt in the Scripture, vvhen it is told vs, <hi>that God ordained him before the vvorld vvas,</hi> in the 1. of <hi>Peter</hi> the 1. <hi>chap.</hi> and againe vvhere it is ſaid, <hi>that there is not a name giuen vnder heauen, by vvhich a man can be ſaued, but the name of Ieſus only,</hi> and this is ratified in the Scripture, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, both of God himſelfe, and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and of the Apoſtle. The Father from heauen did vvitnes ſo much, vvhen as he ſaid, <hi>this is my vvell beloued Sonne, in vvhom I am vvell pleaſed,</hi> there by declaring, that in Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne, (novv made man) his vvrath tovvards vs, vvas taken avvay: and he vvell plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vvith vs, not vvithſtanding our manifold ſinnes, committed againſt him, and all thoſe ſpeeches of God,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21565:29"/>
vvhereby God ratifies, that Chriſt the man, is his Sonne, ſaying, <hi>thou art my Sonne, this day haue I be gotten thee,</hi> &amp; vvhere by he confirmes him, to be our euerlaſting Prieſt, for euer, <hi>after the order of Melchiſedeke,</hi> and vvhereby hee vvitneſſes him to be made Lord of his church, ſaying, <hi>the Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit at my right hand, till I make thine ennemies thy footſtoole,</hi> all theſe do make manifeſt the truth of this point, that it is Chriſt the man, vvhom God hath decreed to be, both the Author, and matter of our ſaluation. And this is the firſt part of this ſeale of God, this knovvledge, that God hath ordained him only, and none but him, to be the bread of life.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of Gods ſeale, vvhere by he hath ſealed Chriſt the man, appeares in the vvorks of Gods
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21565:30"/>
ovvne power, which the Father gaue him to doe, as in <hi>raiſing the dead, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of the ſeas, and tempeſts, the reſtoring ſight to the blind, curing of all diſeaſes, yea, and commanding the very diuels, &amp;c.</hi> therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith in the 5. of Iohn verſ. 6. after this manner, <hi>The vvorkes vvhich the Father hath giuen me to finiſh, the ſame vvorkes that I doe beare vvitnes, that the Father ſent me,</hi> &amp; the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vvhich hath ſent mee beares vvitnes of mee, and againe in the 10. of Iohn verſ. 25 <hi>If I doe not the workes of my Father beleeue me not:</hi> But if <hi>I doe them,</hi> though you <hi>beleeue not me,</hi> yet beleeue <hi>the vvorkes, that you may knovv, that the Father is in me, and I in him,</hi> verſ. 37.38. Theſe vvorkes vvhich none could doe but God him ſelfe, being done by Chriſt the man, are the ſecond part of Gods ſeale,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21565:30"/>
vvhereby God the Father doth let vs ſee, that this man <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of vvhom vvee all muſt looke for life.</p>
            <p>The third parte of this ſeale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that God the Father hath laid vpon Chriſt the man, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſments of our peace, that by his ſtripes vvee might be healed, for by inflicting vpon him in his fleſh, all the puniſhments, and vvrath of God, vvhich vvee by our iniquities haue deſerued, hee thereby ſealed his manhood to be the food of life, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him as a Lambe roaſted vvith fire for our food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for this cauſe, it is ſaid of Chriſt (Hebr. the 5. and the 9,) <hi>That he being conſecrated, vvas made the Author of eternall ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto all them, that obay him:</hi> for vvhen God did take vengeance vpon Chriſt his Sonne for our iniquities,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21565:31"/>
he made him ſinne for vs, that vvee might be made the righteouſnes of God in him: and by his croſſe, killed hatred, and brought in euerlaſting peace, therefore in as much as it is hee alone, that hath vndergone the curſe of the lavve, and the vvrath of God for vs that are ſinners: it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that God giues none to be the bread of life to our ſoules, but him alone, and this is the reaſon, vvhy the Apoſtle to correct that great ſchiſme, in the church of Corinth: vvhen one ſaid he vvas Pauls, another Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, &amp;c. and to force them all, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge none but Chriſt for their Sauiour, he vſes this forme of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vvas Paul crucified for you? &amp;c. as if he vvould ſay none but he vvho is crucified for you, are you to depend vpon for life, and ſaluation: and the ſame is the reaſon, vvhy the ſame
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21565:31"/>
Apoſtle vvritting to the Corinth: the firſt Epiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapt. 2. ſaith, <hi>that he did determinate to know nothing among them but Ieſus Christ, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and againe he ſaith in the 6. of Gal verſ 14. <hi>God for bid, that I ſhould reioyce, but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth part of this ſeale ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this, that God the Father hath raiſed Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne from the dead, and hath taken him out of the povver of the graue, and hath ſet him at his right hand in heauen, and crovvned him vvith glorie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, making him the head of men, and Angels giuing him all povver in heauen, and in earth, and aboue all, giuing him to be the head of his church, thus ſetting him in that fleſh, vvherein he vvrought our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuffered the chaſticement
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21565:32"/>
of our peace, in the full poſſeſſion of the kingdome, life, and glorie, vvhich hee hath purchaſed vnto vs, filling him in that his man-hood, vvithall fullnes of grace, and glorie, that out of his fullnes, vvee might dravv grace, ſo fitting this his fleſh thus glorified, to be the effectuall means of communicating life, and glorie vnto vs in our fleſh, and for this cauſe it is, that the Apoſtle doth proue, that God ſhall iudge the vvorld by Chriſt the man, by this argument, to vvit, becauſe God had raiſed him vp from the dead, Acts. 17.31. and the Apoſtle: for this cauſe, makes this the chiefe point of the knovvledge of Ieſus Chriſt, to vvit, <hi>that vve haue ſuch a high Prieſt, that ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of the maieſtie, in heauen</hi>: Hebrevves the 8. and the 1.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21565:32"/>
for allthough hee had beene man, and in mans nature had ſuffered all puniſhments due to vs, for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, yet not vvithſtanding if he had neuer beene raiſed from the dead, and triumphed ouer the graue, vvee could neuer haue hoped, to haue attained to eternall life by his fleſh, for if that fleſh of his, had beene ouercome by death, vve could neuer haue ouercome death, in our fleſh, therefore it is, that the Apoſtle builds our hope of life, vpon the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead: 1. Pet. chapt. 1. verſ. 3. ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Christ, vvho according to his aboundant mercie, hath be gotten vs againe to the hope of life, by the reſurrection of Ieſus Christ from the dead</hi>: And againe in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21565:33"/>
the ſame chapter verſ. the 21. he ſaith thus, <hi>that God raiſed him from the dead, and gaue him glorie, that our faith, and hope might be in God,</hi> and this is the fourth part of this ſeale.</p>
            <p>The 5. and laſt part of this ſeale, vvhich is the ground, and foundation of the reſt, is this: <hi>That this man in his fleſh is not only by Gods eternall decree appointed, and by the Fathers voyce from heauen ratified, to be the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and life of the vvorld, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be this, by his vvorks, his ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and his glorious exaltation, at the right hand of God, but chiefly, and principally, becauſe in this his manhood, thus abaſed, and againe exalted, doth dvvell all the fullnes of the God head bodily, Coloſ.</hi> the <hi>verſ</hi> 2.9. for if this vvere not, all the former part of this ſeale vvere not ſufficient to make his fleſh the bread of life, for immortall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21565:33"/>
life cannot come to vs, but from that fleſh, vvhich hath immortall life in it ſelfe, and this is the reaſon that Chriſt vſes that ſpeach, in the 6. of Iohn, vvhen he vvould proue, that he that eats his fleſh, and drinks his blood hath euerlaſting life, ſaying, <hi>as that liuing Father hath ſent me, and I liue by the Father, euen ſo hee that eats my fleſh, euen he ſhall liue by me, in the</hi> 57. <hi>verſ.</hi> this therefore is the greateſt parte, of this ſeale vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith God the Father hath ſealed Chriſt the man: to vvit that he hath ſtamped the fleſh of Chriſt vvith the Diety it ſelfe, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvith life it ſelfe: it is no vvonder therefore, that this fleſh, and this blood do giue life to thoſe, that eate and drinke it, ſeeing it is the fleſh. and blood of God himſelfe, therfore it is ſaid in the 20. of Acts. verſ. 28.
