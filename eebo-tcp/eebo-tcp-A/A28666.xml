         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe inumerable multitude of Pamphlets,
which have beene ſurreptitiouſly inſerted
above this twelve months and halfe to the
ignominious ſcandall of the State, did not only
exaſperate his Majeſties juſt indignation againſt
them, but alſo highly incenſed his Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſame. Who to give plenary ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well to the whole kingdome in generall, as
alſo to his Majeſtie in particular, intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
an exemplary puniſhment on the Authors
thereof. And it being my hard fortune, or rather
misfortune to bee found culpable in one peculiar
Letter; (though thouſand more ſcandalous Libils,
and more invective againſt the State have beene
publiſhed, whereof I am innocent) yet I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>publico dedecore,</hi> to the publike ſhame of the
world; as the ſole contriver of them all. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
impartially, I acknowledge the ſublimity of
my crime, and errour, without which there is noe

man living: for according to the grave, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(I had almoſt ſaid oraculous) ſentence of
<hi>Cato, Neme ſine crimine vivit.</hi> It was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
no voluntary Act of criminall offence in
me, but rather an aſtimulation, and inducement
of impendent, and urgent neceſſitie, <hi>et ingens telum
necesſitas eſt.</hi> Moreover I ſpeake before God, and
the whole world, I was ſuggeſted to write the
ſame by a calumnious inſtigator. In all which, my
cogitations in the compoſiting thereof may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly
bee conceived to bee innocent though
it is not innocence that I muſt plead now ſo much
as penitence.</p>
            <q>Artificis ſcelus eſt, arte perire ſuâ.</q>
            <p>Thus <hi>Perillus</hi> invented and made a brazen Bull,
which was the ſole cauſe of his owne deſtruction,
thus <hi>Daedalus</hi> haveing framed an irremiable <hi>Labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynth,</hi>
was firſt expoſed thither himſelfe. So that
which was extracted out of mine owne braine, (as
<hi>Minerva</hi> was from <hi>Ioves,</hi> though ſhe was more
divinely guided, and inſpired) was the prime cauſe
of my miſerie, whereupon I am involved in that
Condoleable Laborynth of durance, that unleſſe

But I wonder with a repercuſſive amazement, that

Since I perceive that the Muſes have all forſaken
me henceforth I will never dip my pen in <hi>Helicon</hi> to
embroyder my words with Poeticall elocutions: I
will rather ſoake my Quill in <hi>Acharon,</hi> that all thinges
(what ſoever I have written either dependent, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any reference, or againſt the ſtate) may be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
with oblivion. But it is very ſtupendious,
that thoſe thinges, which naturally diſcend from
any man, ſhould oppreſſe him with miſery. Thus a
Viper Produceth young, and ſhe is macerated and
ſometimes killed by thoſe, which ſhe did once bare
in her owne wombe. Thus <hi>Casſiodora</hi> was betrayed
by the Crying of her owne Child: And thus I was
both introduced into this deplorable eſtate by the
crying of my owne Poetick babe, promulgated by
the ſtreet-cantors, and alſo wrapt up in this indigence
by the ſame. The <hi>Capitolium</hi> was delivered, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from conſpirative machinations by the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and tumultuous noyſe of Geeſe, that frequented
there: but in a meere antipathy and Contradictory
Mytholagie I was betrayed by a Gooſe quill, ſo that
both fortune, time, and example did all conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. Firſt fortune was mine enemy, that I
ſhould be induced to do that by the palpable, and
Paraſiticall incitements of others, which now is
like to ſubvert both me and my fortunes alſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
time was malevolent, in regard it was done
in the period of things, when they were all queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and amongſt the the reſt, that this eſpetially
ſhould reflect on mine owne detriment. Thirdly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
conſpired againſt me, for in reſpect ſuch a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64410:5"/>
multitude of Libels being publiſhed, whereof there
were many Authors, that my fate eſpetially ſhould
be ſo diſaſtrous to ſuffer exemplarily for all. And now
I do moſt ſubmiſſively recant in all humility, and
what I have offended in I am heartily ſory, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for the ſame. Yet I was never invective either
againſt the ſtate or diſtreſſed Delinquents: only I
confeſſe ſome times I was converſant in innocent
things: and I hope the apprehenſive eye of the world
will not miſ-interpretate what I have don. And I doe
with all obſequious devotion implore forgiveneſſe
and abſolution of the whole world, for what I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
culpable in, and peccant: but more eſpetially
I moſt humbly ſupplicate the propitious reflection
of the high Court of Parliaments mercy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,
promiſing hereafter before God, and
their Honours an abſolute Reformation in my pen
hereafter.</p>
