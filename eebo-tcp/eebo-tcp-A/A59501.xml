            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>If I be not aſham'd of my Souldiers, I am a ſowc't Gurnet:
I have miſ-us'd the Kings Preſs damnably. I have got, in exchange of
a hundred and fifty Souldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I preſs
me none but good Houſe-holders, Yeomens Sons: enquire me out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Batchelors, ſuch as had been ask'd twice on the Banes: ſuch a
Commodity of warm Slaves, as had as lieve hear the Devil, as a Drum;
ſuch as fear the report of a Caliver, worſe than a ſtruck-Fool, or a hurt
Wild-Duck. I preſt me none but ſuch Toſtes and Butter, with hearts
in their Bellies no bigger than Pins heads, and they have bought out
their Services: And now my whole Charge conſiſts of Ancients, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Lieutenants, Gentlemen of Companies, Slaves as ragged as <hi>Lazarus</hi>
in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> painted Cloth, where the Gluttons Dogs licked his Sores; and
ſuch as indeed were never Souldiers, but diſ-carded unjuſt Servingmen,
younger Sons to younger Brothers: Revolted Tapſters and Oſtlers, Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln,
the Cankers of a calm World, and long Peace, ten times more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable,
ragged, than an old-fac'd Ancient; and ſuch have I to fill
up the Rooms of them that have bought out their Services: That you
would think, that I had a hundred and fifty tatter'd Prodigals, lately
come from Swine-keeping, from eating Draff and Husks. A mad fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
met me on the way, and told me, I had unloaded all the Gibbets,
and preſt the dead Bodies. No eye hath ſeen ſuch Skar-Crows: I'll not
march through <hi>Coventry</hi> with them, that's flat. Nay, and the Villains
march wide betwixt the Legs, as if they had Gyves on; for indeed, I
had the moſt of them out of Priſon. There's not a Shirt and a half in
all my Company: and the half Shirt is two Napkins tack'd together,
and thrown over the Shoulders like a Heralds Coat, without ſleeves:
And the Shirt, to ſay the truth, ſtoln from my Hoſt of S. <hi>Albans;</hi> or
the Red-Noſe Inn-keeper of <hi>Dayntry.</hi> But that's all one, they'l find
Linnen enough on every Hedge.</p>

the Counterfeit of a Man, who hath not the Life of a Man: But to
counterfeit dying, when a Man thereby liveth, is to be no Counterfeit, but
the true and perfect Image of Life indeed. The better part of Valour, is
Diſcretion; in the which better part, I have ſaved my Life. I am afraid
