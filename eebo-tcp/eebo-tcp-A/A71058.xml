            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

brethren, and branding those with impiety that answer with <hi>Cain, Am I my brothers keeper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The drift of my speech tendeth to the reproofe of a custome grown up amongst <hi>us Christians,</hi> not heard of, I suppose, among the <hi>Barbarians, Selling of graves and the duty of buriall;</hi> wherein I desire a little libertie to expresse my selfe somewhat at large, as beeing one of the motives that led mee the rather to this discourse.</p>
            <p>There seemeth if not a warrant, yet a president for it in the booke of <hi>Genesis,</hi> Chap. 23. where <hi>Ephron</hi> selleth a burying place to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Jerome</hi> censureth <hi>Ephron</hi> verie hardly touching that matter, even as though hee had committed some point of <hi>Symonle,</hi> or of great impietie; and saith, that for this taking of money for the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, <hi>O,</hi> the letter of perfection was struck out of his name, and that in stead of <hi>Ephron,</hi> which signifieth <hi>perfect,</hi> hee was afterwards called <hi>Ephran,</hi> that is <hi>unperfect.</hi> The Scripture I confesse maketh no such mention, nor <hi>Josephus,</hi> nor any other ancient that I can finde: I blame not therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> that hee accepteth it not, but for that hee sleighteth that noble Father so lightly as to terme it a very toy. I hold <hi>Calvin</hi> much inferior to<note place="margin">Meras nugas.</note> 
               <hi>Austen,</hi> yet <hi>Austen</hi> professed himselfe inferior to <hi>Jerome:</hi> what warrant <hi>Jerome</hi> had for it I know not, all men take him for no Imposter; I suppose (and so might <hi>Calvin</hi>) that hee had it from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> because hee entitleth that booke of his <hi>Quaestiones et traditiones hebraica in Genesin:</hi> but all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58886:4"/>
are not of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s minde, many of the Fathers and Councels do well accept it.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I incline with <hi>Calvin</hi> to the excusing of <hi>Ephron;</hi> for both hee and the <hi>Hethites,</hi> as though it were against nature to take any thing for burying of the dead in their soile, gave <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> free libertie, not onely to bury, but to do it where hee would, even in the chiefest of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres. This contented not <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would not onely have <hi>usufructum rei,</hi> the fruition of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but <hi>dominium loci,</hi> the inheritance of the soile itselfe. To sell this I should thinke it lawfull, though not the other in any case: lawfull to sell the Patronage of a Church, not the Presentation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or Induction. <hi>Pretium loci in quo human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>est,</hi> a man may take by the civill law, but there was a necessitie that <hi>Abraham</hi> must have the very soile proper and solely to himselfe: for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised might neither dead nor alive mingle with the uncircumcised, as at this day the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians not with Infidels, the Faithfull not with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques or Excommunicate persons. In this also <hi>Ephron</hi> was content to satisfie <hi>Abraham,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee requested no more then the cave of <hi>Mesche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelah, Ephron</hi> not onely granted him the cave, but the whole field also wherin the cave was, and that as a free gift, if <hi>Abraham</hi> would so accept it; but <hi>Abraham</hi> refusing to have it by gift, bought the whole field and by right of appendencie had the cave with it. Nothing in all this do I see but noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and bounty in <hi>Ephron,</hi> nor any just impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58886:5"/>
why hee might not at first have demanded the price of the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much lesse why hee might not take it, beeing pressed upon him, aswell as <hi>Araunah</hi> tooke more money of <hi>David</hi> for the threshing floore, where hee was to build an Altar and to sacrifice unto God. All this notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because the scope of the money taken by <hi>Ephron</hi> was for buriall of the body that then wanted it, and not for the soile of the field, but for the Sepulchre, as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> testifieth, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7. 16.</note> utterly condemneth it, and the rather (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) for that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were said to bee bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, for of such monuments hee was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what curious.</p>
            <p>Yet did hee not so much reprove this taking by <hi>Ephron,</hi> as the vice and sinne of our time in requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exacting money for buriall, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then to creepe into the world, gave the Church a just occasion both to censure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it by many Constitutions, Canons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; whereof I will recite some, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are at this day in force (as touching the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them) in our Church, though neglected and not observed by our Church-men.</p>

               </hi> blushed not to require a hundred shillings for the buriall of her Daughter; <hi>Gregory</hi> by a decretall Epistle to him, saith, Wee have utterly forbidden this vice in our Church, and do not suffer so bad a custome should in any case bee usurped. If <hi>Ephron</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58886:5"/>
a Pagan were so considerate as to refuse it, how much more ought wee to doe it that are called <hi>Priests?</hi> We therefore admonish, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth none attempt this vice of covetousnesse in any Churches. But if at any time you permit any to bee buryed in your Church, and that his next kinsman or heires will of their owne accord offer any thing for lights, wee forbid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that to bee taken, but to exact or aske any thing, wee utterly forbid, lest that (which were most irreligious) the Church peradventure might bee said to bee sold (which God forbid,) and you also to seem glad of mens deathes, if you reape any commodity out of their carcases.</p>

               </hi> for it is written in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus, Deny not courtesie unto the dead, for wee all shall dye:</hi> And againe, <hi>All things that are of earth, doe returne to earth.</hi> Earth, why sellest thou earth? Remember that thou art earth, and shalt goe to earth, that thou must dye, and that death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards thee and lingereth not.

Cum in Ecclesiae corpore,</hi> saith, The buying and selling that is reported to bee in some Churches is too horrible; as that somewhat is required for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling Bishops, Abbots, and all kinde of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persons in their seates; for inducting Priests into their Churches, and for sepulture and funerall rites, for benediction of the married couple, and for other sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verily many think it lawfull, because they suppose the law of custome hath got authority by long continuance; not considering that offences are so much the more grievous, by how much the longer they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared the wicked soule of man. Therefore, lest these things should be done hereafter, <hi>Wee</hi> straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid any thing to bee exacted either for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of Ecclesiasticall persons to their seats, or for Institutions of Priests, or buryall of the dead, or benediction of them that marry, or for other Sacraments, either conferring, or collated. But if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58886:7"/>
any man shall presume to doe the contrary, let him know that hee hath his portion with <hi>Gehezi;</hi> that is, that he standeth accursed, and, as the glosse inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth it, that hee is a Symonist.</p>
            <p>The next generall Councell, a very great one in<note place="margin">Canon. <hi>VI.</hi> Circa an. 1198.</note> the same place, under <hi>Innocens</hi> the third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the same prohibition touching buriall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees: but because the former bridled the Clergy in taking that was not their due, this curbeth also the perversenesse of the Laity, in with-holding their just duties: the words be these, <hi>Ad Apostolicam, &amp;c.</hi> It is common to the Apostolick eare by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent relation, that some Clerks, for the buriall of the dead, and blessing the married couple, doe exact and extort money: and if it chance that their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous desire bee not satisfied, they fraudulently alledge some feigned impediment. On the other side, some lay-men, levened with hereticall pravity, under the pretence of canonicall piety, doe ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to break a laudable custome brought into the Church by the godly devotion of the faithfull. Hereupon wee forbid all exactions to be made, and command all godly customes to bee observed; that Ecclesiasticall Sacraments be freely conferred: but that they which maliciously endevour to change a laudable custome, may upon knowledge of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be suppressed by the Bishop of the place. Note, that the customes protected by this Canon must be godly and laudable.</p>
            <p>As for the Canon <hi>Abolendae,</hi> which aimeth<note place="margin">Can. <hi>VII.</hi>

               <hi>Pessulan,</hi> will not suffer the ground to be broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be paid for the grave, I purposed to passe it over, supposing none that serveth in the house of God to bee so covetous or cautelous, as not to stay for his money till hee had delivered his ware: But in the meane time, a complaint was brought unto us of a Church-man (since deceased) and his Clerke, that came together to the house of one of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, who was then newly dead, and speaking with the Executors, would not suffer the body to bee brought out of the house, till hee had 14. l. paid to him and the Parish Officers, according to a bill of particulars then shewed unto them: nor could the Executors compound with them for any abatement more then ten shillings in the Clerkes share, and paid them thereupon 13. l. 10. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Against such, amongst other, is this Canon under the Rubrick, <hi>Terra caemiteriata pro sepultura vendi non debet,</hi> in these words, <hi>Abolendae consuetudinis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitas, &amp;c.</hi> There is growne up (as is reported) a perverse custome that must be abolished at <hi>Mount Pessulan,</hi> where they will not suffer the grave to bee digged open for them that die, till there bee a certaine price for the ground, wherein they are to be buried, paid unto the Church. <hi>Wee</hi> command, that you, being Bishop of the place, doe prohibit the Clerkes from exacting any thing at all in this case. The complaint was for exacting of money before the grave was opened, but the Canon forbiddeth it both before and after. <hi>Nota</hi> (saith the Glosse) <hi>quòd pro terra in qua sepeliendi sunt defuncti, nihil est exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum.</hi>

But admit that neither these, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther positive Constitutions extended to our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, will they not bee a law unto themselves, and abstaine from that which is declared to bee wicked and unjust by so many godly men, so many Fathers, Councels, and Decrees of the Church?</p>
            <p>Let us then consider the Councels and Canons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58886:8"/>
that wee have recited; and see first, what opinion they have of money taken for burialls: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how they censure and decree touching it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, for their opinion, they declare it to bee a<note place="margin">Can. I. Greg. ad Januar. Regist. lib. 7. Epist. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>vice,</hi> a <hi>vice</hi> of covetousnesse, a bad custome, that may bee said most irreligious, as a selling of the Church, a cause of joy to the Parson when men dye, and a reaping of commodity out of carcasses of the dead, and sorrow of the living.</item>
               <item>2. A discourtesie to the dead by him that must<note place="margin">Can. II. Concil. Tribur.</note> dye, a selling of earth by him that is earth, a selling of that is none of his owne, a selling of what was given freely to give freely, a denying of buriall.</item>
               <item>3. A thing too horrible, that bringeth the portion of<note place="margin">Can. V. Concil. general. Literan.</note> 
                  <hi>Gehezi</hi> upon the offender, that is the brand of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as the glosse expoundeth it, a curse, an unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and cause of separation from common society.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Lastly, as maladies are the most grievous and<note place="margin">Can. VII. Concil. Turon. Can. V. Concil. gener. Lateran. Can. VII. Decr. l. 3. &amp; 28. c. 13.</note> contagious that continue longest: so they conclude this to bee so much the more grievous, by how much the longer it hath continued; and declare it to bee <hi>abolendae consuetudinis perversitas,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of a custome is to bee abolished.</p>
            <p>I am loth to use these heavie termes of aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet they proceed not from mee, but from the Clergie themselves against the Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, from the body against a member, from the Fathers, the Doctors, the Decrees of the Church, and great generall Councels, against some private, particular and incorrigible offenders.</p>
            <p>The summe of their censure and decrees is this,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That nothing bee exacted or required for any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58886:9"/>
sepulture; which word the glosse declareth to<note place="margin">Cap. Abolendae ver. Sepultura, col. 1207.</note> comprehend the ground or place of buriall, and the ministery of the Priest or Parson about the same. And in some of the Canons it is particularly so expressed.</item>
               <item>2. That all customes for such taking, are evill, impious, and voyd.</item>
               <item>3. That the offence in taking is Simony.</item>
               <item>4. That the cognisance thereof belongeth to the Bishop of the place.</item>
               <item>5. That gifts of pietie for use of the Church, may notwithstanding be taken.</item>
               <item>6. That none should bee buried in the body of the Church.</item>
            </list>
            <p>There is a fiction that <hi>Achelous</hi> fighting with <hi>Hercules,</hi> and not able to resist his force, shifted himselfe into divers formes, thereby to illude it. So the Canonists try many evasions to help their Masters of the Clergy in this point of taking, by distinguishing the places of buriall, the persons that take, the time of taking, and the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</p>
            <p>For the place, they say there bee three sorts, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the place.</note> 
               <hi>Locus religiosus,</hi> and <hi>Locus sacer:</hi> according to the civill Law, <hi>locus purus</hi> is that which is more<note place="margin">Locus purus.</note> secular ground, never used for buriall, nor having any kinde of consecration. To this they say the Canons doe not extend, for that it is some private<note place="margin">Decr. Greg. cap. Abolend. ver. Sepultur. <hi>And</hi> Grat. Can. 12. q. 2.</note> mans; and the owner, if hee will, may take money for a grave there; for, <hi>Nemo tenetur de suo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium facere,</hi> No man is tyed to give his ground to a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58886:9"/>
charitable use. <hi>Locus religiosus</hi> is that which is<note place="margin">Locus religiosus.</note> assigned to some office of Religion, and nominately where the body of a dead person hath been buried. For by the very buriall of that body, the nature of the soyle is changed from secular, and, in reverence of this new function, counted to bee religious; and now therefore by the Canons nothing may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for any more graves there. Some such places (I suppose) are about this City adjoyning to Church-yards, for enlarging thereof, and some of them for which the owners doe take a yeerely rent of the Parish that useth it, letting it unto them to sow dead mens carcasses in, as it were to sow corne, and as though the carcasses should grow up (like the fable of <hi>Cadmus</hi>) and bring them a crop to pay the rent with. This the Canons doe meerely forbid, as doth also the civill Law, and Law of humanity, the Fathers, the Councels, and the opinion of <hi>S. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in the case of <hi>Ephron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For mine owne part, I take it to bee a kinde of usury to let that for money, whereof the hirer can make no kinde of profit. It may be said, that they might have chosen, when they first hired it, whether they would use it so or no; and it is true: but after the thing is done, and the place thereby become religious ground by being made a burying place; now to let it in that kinde, is (I say) against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. <hi>Locus sacratus</hi> is that which by the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Locus sacratus.</note> of the owner is setled upon God and the Church for some divine and Ecclesiasticall service, and then consecrated thereto by the Bishop, is thereby
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58886:10"/>
severed from humane property, as be our Churches and Church-yards; the meere property whereof, which wee call Fee-simple, is said to bee <hi>in nubibus,</hi> and <hi>abaiance,</hi> though the Parson, Patron, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, for necessities sake, might make a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them. But to dispose them, or any part of them contrary to the will of the Donor, the nature of the gift, and the glory of him that is the Supreme owner, (God Almighty) is by these Canons Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Sacriledge, and extreme impiety. Hereof there must therefore bee no buying or selling; and in this, no doubt, the Canonists are right. Thus much for the <hi>place</hi> of Sepulture.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>parties</hi> that take money for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">Of the parties.</note> or ministery of buriall, they say that the Canons extend not universally to all Clergy men, but to such onely as are beneficed, or have pensions for doing the Church duties, or serving the cure; not to those which are <hi>sine titulo, sine salario,</hi> without benefice or stipend, and that they may therefore take what they can get; for, <hi>It is not inconvenient</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nec est incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens quod Clericus locet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras suas, cùm non habeat undè vivat. <hi>Decr.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58886:10"/>
money, and then deliver their ware: but, <hi>expleto</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non ergò prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur quam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beraliter oblat. satis benè possit recipi sine pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, exclusa cupiditatis labe. <hi>Jo. de Athon, tit. de Sacram. §. 1. v. labe.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>officio,</hi> when the duty is once performed, they may take what is voluntarily given them, without danger of the Canons, which wee shall further examine in the next Paragraph. Yet marke in the meane time the tenor of the first Canon, <hi>Quaesta est: Nereida</hi> complained that the Bishop <hi>velit exigere,</hi> would exact 100. s. of her for the buriall of her daughter; which complaint must needs bee after the buriall, it being in Sardinia, and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> writing from Rome, or those parts; yet <hi>expleto officio,</hi> the buriall being past, <hi>Gregory</hi> would suffer nothing to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, no not upon voluntary gift to the use of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; but for the publick use of the Church, as for ligh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. hee allowed that to be taken that was voluntarily offered, and no otherwise. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth the Canon, <hi>praecipiendum,</hi> or third Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. The second Canon also giveth liberty to offer somewhat for the soule of him that is dead, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be given for the grave, or buriall service.</p>
            <p>The manner of taking is of three sorts, by exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> demanding, and voluntary gift. <hi>Exaction</hi> is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily conceived to be a wringing of that is not due from the party, or of more then is due, like the Monks of <hi>Mount Pessulan,</hi> to refuse burying of the body till they had their pretended duty: or like them in the Canon <hi>ad Apostolicam,</hi> that alledge fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned impediments and excuses to raise the market by delaying the buriall: or when the buriall is past, like <hi>Januarius</hi> the Bishop of Sardinia, to urge and insist upon the demand. These no doubt are sharpe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58886:11"/>
exactions; but the word includeth smoother cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:<note place="margin">Tit. Symonia ca. firmit. verb. exigatur. lib. 4. Etymolog. &amp; division, juris u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversi exposit. John Calvin ab Cuble Lexic.</note> 
               <hi>Lindewode</hi> expoundeth it to require or take <hi>à nolente,</hi> of him that would not part with it. <hi>Calepine</hi> saith, that <hi>Lactantius</hi> useth it for <hi>convenienter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulare: John Bellonus,</hi> that <hi>exigere est petere, exactio est petitio,</hi> and that the <hi>exactores tributorum</hi> were so called <hi>à petendis tributis,</hi> which the <hi>Lexicon</hi> of the Civill and Canon Law doth also deliver: So that to exact is not onely to wring it from the party, but to demand or require; and to demand or require, is to exact. In this manner the fifth Canon either useth them Synonimally, or complaineth of one abuse in the preamble, or provideth against another in the decree. To put it out of doubt, the first Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non useth both the words, <hi>Peti verò aliquid, aut exigi omnino prohibemus:</hi> We utterly forbid any thing to be either asked or exacted: and it setteth <hi>exigi</hi> in the later place, as though <hi>exigere</hi> were lesse then <hi>petere;</hi> or, as <hi>Lactant.</hi> taketh it, <hi>convenienter postulare.</hi> Note also, that this Canon was made against <hi>asking</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting</hi> after the buriall, as before we have touched.</p>
            <p>All this notwithstanding, I must truely confesse (for I deale with <hi>Argus</hi> and <hi>Briarius,</hi> them that have all perspicuity and assistance) that there is no expresse word in any of these Canons, against gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or taking simply, though I thinke there bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to satisfie indifferent judgements. Yet if it bee a defect in them, I have a helpe for it here at home in our own Provinciall Constitutions, where, in a Synod at Westminster, assembled by <hi>Richard</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, I finde it thus decreed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58886:11"/>
under the <hi>Rubrick, Ne quid exigatur pro Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
               <note place="margin">Statuimus ergo ut de caetero.</note> 
               <hi>conferendis Ca. Dictum est, &amp;c. Wee therefore ordaine, that from henceforth neither for Ordination, nor for Chrisme, nor for Baptisme, nor for extreme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor for Sepulture, nor for the Communion, nor for Dedication, any thing bee exacted, but that the gifts of Christ bee given with free dispensation, and let him that doth the contrary bee accursed.</hi> So that if they must be given freely, nothing surely must bee taken for them, either <hi>ex obliquo,</hi> or by evasion.</p>
            <p>It may bee said, they require nothing by way of price for the ground or Sepulture: for the fourth Canon is, <hi>ut nulla cujusquam pretii exactio attente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> but as a reward from the party by way of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity. Who knoweth not that <hi>pretium</hi> signifieth a <hi>reward,</hi> aswell as a <hi>price?</hi> and for mine owne part, I doubt not but that the Canon doth so intend it: yet, to cleare the point, the words of the third Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non are expressely, <hi>ut nihil muneris exigatur,</hi> that no reward be required.</p>
            <p>I suppose by this time the offenders in this kinde have left the plaine field of the Canons, and taken themselves to their last hope and Castle of refuge, <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>prescription,</hi> where it now resteth to beat them out. Every man knoweth that evill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes are in their owne nature to bee abolished; and those that be good, yet if there bee a positive law against them, they are also voyd. The nature of this custome by the collection wee have made out of the Canons, is not onely declared to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively bad, but, by the great generall Councell of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58886:12"/>
               <hi>Dateran,</hi> to bee very horrible, and consequently to be abolished; but being positively against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, it is <hi>in ipso hoc</hi> directly void; though there were no clause or provision in them so to denounce them, yet <hi>ad majorem cautelam,</hi> the fourth and fifth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons doe expressely overthrow that custome, and besides doe brand it with this note of infamy, <hi>the elder the worse, and the longer it hath continued, the more grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parsons have now a shrewd Crow to pull, for the Canonists themselves will confesse all this to be true. What then remaineth with <hi>Achelous, seu versare dolis, seu certo occumbere? Corax</hi> must now help them with a quirke to cosen the Canons, and to slide from them, or they are undone. Well, heare <hi>Jo. de Athon,</hi> one of the pole-starres of our English Canonists; <hi>Let him</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that asketh any thing in this case, take heed to himselfe; for if hee aske and take it for his duty, or for the ground, or for sepulture, he is gone, for it is Simony:</hi> And for proof thereof, all alledge some of the Canons wee have recited, with divers other, and the opinion of <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis;</hi> and saith further, that <hi>a custome will then doe him no good, as appeareth by the Canon of</hi> Otho, which hee is there in hand with, and that of <hi>non sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> in the <hi>Extravagant,</hi> by us also expressed &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> (saith hee) <hi>if hee demand it when his duty is done, in this manner, for that every one that dieth, or is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled, hath used to give so much to the Priest or Church, then he shall prevaile, and doth justly require it.</hi> For confirmation hereof, hee produceth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58886:12"/>
of <hi>Innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other Authorities: And that <hi>Hostiensis</hi> saith infallibly, <hi>that this is true, touching the duty of the Laity towards the Church; in so much, as though this exhibition of the Lay men tends to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-filling of the belly of the Clerks; yet it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as hee noteth in the Extravagants, Tit.</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>ca.</hi> Jacobus: And <hi>Athon</hi> saith, <hi>That hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth it to bee true, not respecting the inordinate gluttony, but the right of the Church,</hi> alledging other Authorities to confirme it. <hi>F.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>To the same purpose is the opinion of <hi>Lindewode,</hi> the other pole-starre of our English Canonists, and with the same words in <hi>part. tit.</hi> Simonia, <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture</hi> (saith hee) <hi>must not be sold,</hi> and (<hi>citing</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 2. §. <hi>Item queritur per</hi> Jo. &amp; Co. <hi>ibi sequentibus, de sepult. ca. abolendae</hi>) saith, <hi>that it appeareth there in the text and glosse, that in a sacred place, as in a Church or Church-yard, nothing must be required for sepulture, no nor yet for the office of buriall, as</hi> Bernard <hi>there noteth. And this is true as touching his office, because a Clerk by reason of his benefice is tyed unto it. But it is otherwise, if hee bee not tyed thereto by reason of his Benefice, and so that hee doth not contract to have it, for then it is Simony; (Extrav. eod. tit. ca. in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, secundum</hi> Hostiens. &amp; <hi>ca. non satis) yet the Glosse saith, in the end of the said chapter,</hi> abolendae, <hi>that though Clerks may not require any thing for such sepulture, yet the Laity may bee compelled to observe godly and laudable customes. And marke, according to the note of</hi> Hostiensis, <hi>in the same Chapter, That hee that requireth to have the custome performed to him,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58886:13"/>
               <hi>must take heed to himselfe; for if hee demand it for the ground, or for his duty, hee is downe, and it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him nothing to alledge a custome</hi> (ut dicto capite abolendae:) <hi>But if hee saith that for every dead body so much hath been usually given to the Priest, or to the Church, then he shall obtaine it: as in ca. ad Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam Extrav. eod. &amp; vide gloss. hic similem</hi> 13. <hi>q.</hi> 2. §. <hi>Item quaeritur.</hi> Linw. <hi>fo.</hi> 201.</p>
            <p>Here is a left-hand way to slip by all the Canons, let us consider it. May the Parsons frame their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome as they list? Is it like a <hi>Proteus,</hi> or <hi>Lesbian</hi> Ruler? Are they not tyed to the matter of fact, to the manner and forme of payment? Are Mood and Figure onely University observations? Let them bee well advised in laying their customes so, lest the Jury finde an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> It hath fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee to bee an unworthy member of that most noble and most gratious Commission of <hi>exacted fees and innovated offices,</hi> and thereby to have notice by certificate of divers Parsons, Vicars, and chiefe Parishioners of most of the greatest Parishes of London, yet none of them hitherto (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) have made any such claime, nor know I how they should prove it if they did.</p>
            <p>I will stirre no coales, nor prosecute this point any further, for the duty, love, honour, and great obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I beare unto them; but I intreat, with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that both they and the rest of their coat will thinke seriously of it, and if not alwayes, yet when in their Sermons they justly fall upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, extortions, raising of rents, &amp;c. by Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58886:13"/>
and lay-men. For this bird of theirs is a wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sinne, hatcht of late within this Citie, but crept already into the neighbour Towns, and will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flye (if the wings be not clipt in time) over all the Kingdome. Oh, let not that of <hi>Jeromy</hi> bee once spoken of this noble Citie, <hi>From the Prophets</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As this sinne, and the Canons lie sore upon the Ministers, for taking money for graves in the Chancell, and for their paines in burying the corps wheresoever: so doe they upon some other, who little dreame of it, the Church-wardens of Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes that sell graves in the Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard like ware in their shop, and when they thinke fit, make lawes in their Vestry for raising the price, as they doe in their Halls for the price of their ware. If they looke the third Canon, they shall finde themselves contained there under a faire stile, <hi>Them that have the government of the place,</hi> (meaning, of the Church, and Church yard, and Parish) so that though they bee lay-men, yet by misusing the things of the Church, they fall into the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and penalty respectively that Church men doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have their portion assigned them with <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>zi,</hi> as in the fifth Canon. I have heard what some of them answer; That it is no benefit to our selves, it is for the good of the Parish, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Church, the Bells, the Steeple, to help out some extraordinary charge that falls upon the Parish; and if some small matter bee spent upon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58886:14"/>
a Parish Audit, or a Quest-house dinner, it is an <hi>Agape,</hi> or Feast of love, and no man will grudge or repine at that, our Predecessors did it before our time, and our Successors will doe it when wee are dead and gone. All is done by an assembly of the Vestrie, by consent of the Masters and chiefe of the Parish subscribed, and testified under their hands. Well, let their Vestrie on Gods name bee a Consistory for well ordering of the things of the Church, it is fit it should bee so; but let it not bee a Parliament, that a dozen or sixteene private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (I will not meddle with their trade or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) should change or abrogate any superiour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, much lesse those of Synods and generall Councels, nor to make orders to bind, like a law, the rest of the Parish that consented not.</p>
            <p>What they have used to doe time out of minde, I call not into question; but those Vestries that within these thirty yeeres or thereabout, have left their ancient forme, supported by a lawfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and contrived to themselves a now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, power, and jurisdiction over the rest of the Parish, countenanced by an instrument from the Ordinary, under the Seale of his Chancellor; and (as new things must have new names) are commonly stiled <hi>Selected <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops names are used in them, whether their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents and knowledge, I am doubtfull. I assure my selfe their Lordships would doe nothing against the Law, and I understand not by what Law they may at this day erect such Societies, or endow
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58886:14"/>
them with such Authority as is pretended. But to deale plainely, I thinke those Instruments conferre more money upon the Chancellors, then authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Vestries; for (by those that I have seene) the Bishop or Chancellor granteth nothing to them, but relating that they have considered the forme of a Vestrie desired by some of the Parish, they <hi>allow, approve, or confirme it,</hi> and yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then (with a <hi>Quantum in nobis est</hi>) as farre forth as lawfully they may, and no otherwise. Nor have they this shadow of authority otherwise then upon condition, that they shall doe nothing that may trench upon the jurisdiction or profit of the Ecclesiasticall Court. What have they now for their money? Or more (in effect) then if a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man had granted them as much? No doubt, many of the wise Parishioners doe perceive it, and some Parishes have renounced it, and are turned back to their ancient Vestrie: yet neither of them keep their bounds; for the one and the other take upon them not onely to make orders in the nature of by. Lawes to binde their Parishioners, but to set and raise fees and duties of the Church, and Church-Officers at their pleasure, as appeareth by many Tables produced before us. But see what they have gotten that claime their fees or duties by such Vestry Orders, or unlawfull Authority: for prescription will not now help them, in so much as the originall of their fees appeareth to be by the Table, and the Table cannot defend them, for that the Authors of it had no authority to make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58886:15"/>
such assessements, and so consequently they can neither justifie the clayming of their fees or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, either by the one or other; and the Vestry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men perhaps may bee in danger of an unlawfull Assemblie to change Lawes, or to have their offence strained very high, if severity should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave to present to you what I finde in a Vestrie-Constitution lately made, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Parson and Church-wardens,<note place="margin">24. Nov. 1627.</note> with twenty three more of that Assembly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Bishop, approved by his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, declared to bee a laudable custome of that Parish, and in testimony thereof entred (as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Act) in the principall Registry of the Lord Bishop of the Diocesse; and finally, ratified with<note place="margin">Dat. 25.

            <p>All these double of every Stranger.</p>
            <p>I meddle not with the Constitutions of 4. <hi>L.</hi> to the Parson for a Pew in the Chancell, nor of 15. <hi>ss.</hi> 20. <hi>ss.</hi> 3. L. 3. L. 10. <hi>ss.</hi> for places and Pewes in other parts. But these and many other of the like sort fall in one Certificate. In another Parish I finde six shillings eight pence to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the duty of buriall in the Church, when himselfe doth it not, but his Curate, who for his paines hath by the same Certificate ten shillings more, besides other ten shillings for a Sermon (though there be none.)</p>
            <p>But to goe a little backe to the first demand, touching burying in the Chancell, which is not definite <hi>in quoto,</hi> but positive <hi>ex imperio,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will be buried there, shall pay to the Parson as shall be agreed.</p>
            <p>It is to bee noted, that here is no custome,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58886:16"/>
and consequently then, whereas the Parson thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the advantage lyeth on his side, to take what hee list, hee is now excluded by all the Canons from taking any thing at all: For the buckler that should defend them is the Canon <hi>Ad Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> and the breadth of that extendeth no further then to protect them that fight under a Custome, which also must bee pious and laudable, otherwise it covereth not any. And consequently, whilest they stand upon termes, and alledge the Chancell to bee their free hold, and that they may as freely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it at their pleasure, as Lay-men may of their lands, they fall into the foule pit of Simony, if they were looked after.</p>
            <p>The grave is the onely inheritance that wee are certainly born to, the inheritance which our <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother</hi> the earth hath left to descend in <hi>Gavelkinde</hi> among all her children: Shall one enter, and hold another out, or drive him to pay a fine <hi>pro adeunda haereditate,</hi> as they say in the feodall Law, or <hi>pro ingressu habendo,</hi> as wee in the common Law? Is our tenure base like a copy-hold <hi>ad voluntatem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> and not rather noble by <hi>francke Almoigne,</hi> free from all payments and services? How doe<note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 13.</note> the dead rest from their labour, if they bee vexed with payments? How goe they to their grave in peace, if they pay for their peace? <hi>Laborat aere alieno qui debito tenetur,</hi> and his peace is not worth thanks, if hee must pay for it: Hee payeth for his peace, if hee payeth for the place where his peace cannot otherwise bee had: Hee payeth for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58886:16"/>
his rest, if hee cannot enjoy it without payment: Hee payeth for his Inheritance if hee cannot enter into it without a fine <hi>pro ingressu;</hi> his inheritance settled upon him by the great Charter, <hi>Terram dedit filiis hominum:</hi> A royall gift, but as it is used, <hi>malè collocatum,</hi> ill distributed. The poore man (alas) hath nothing of all this for his portion but the grave, and may not now have that, unlesse hee pay for it. Well, To whom should he pay? <hi>Reason</hi> answereth, If to any, to the owner of the soyle. True, But the owner of the soyle was the Founder of the Church, and hee, out of piety, zeale, and charity, gave the Church freely for Prayer, the Church-yard freely for Buriall, <hi>absque ullo retene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> without any rent, any service, any reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor could hee (if hee would) have done otherwise, for the Canons would not suffer him: Nor though hee were the absolute owner, yet if hee had reserved but a pepper corne out of a grave, it had beene not onely voyd, but execrable. A pepper corne? what talke wee of a pepper corne? no ground in the Kingdome is now sold so deare as a grave. That poore little Cabinet, that is not commonly above five foote long, and a foote and halfe in breadth, where there is no roome to stirre either hand or foote, and the roofe, as Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> saith, lyeth so low, as it toucheth the nose, this silly Cabinet is sometimes in the Church-yard sold to the poorest man for sixteen pence, sometimes for two shillings eight pence, sometimes three shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, sometimes sixe shillings; in the Church it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58886:17"/>
selfe at ten shillings, twenty shillings, forty shillings, three pound, foure pound, &amp;c. in the Chancell; at twenty shillings, forty shillings, three pound, foure pound, five pound, yea, ten pound: and yet the purchaser hath no assurance of it, but is constrained to hold <hi>ad voluntatem Domini,</hi> or as a Tenant for seven or ten yeeres, within which terme hee is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cast out, and another put into his roome, and no Writ of <hi>Quare ejecit infra terminum</hi> lyeth for him. Shall I tell what I was ashamed to heare? A grave or burying place let to farme at twenty shillings a yeere, the rent duely paid for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeeres, and being then behinde, the Parson threatned to uncase the corps by pulling downe the Monument if it were not satisfied; and shame was so farre from him, as hee spared not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it even before the Commissioners: To whom it was likewise testified, that another had made forty pound of one grave in ten yeeres, by ten pound at a time; Strange things to mee, what to others I know not, but I suppose, <hi>cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis;</hi> the oldest man living hath not heard the like. Is it not time that his Majestie should doe as hee doth, that like <hi>Josias</hi> hee should reforme the Temple, the House of God? God bee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that put it in his heart, and grant him well to finish the work in hand, being so noble, so pious, and so full of necessity.</p>
            <p>I said the Church was given freely by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Prayer, and the Church-yard freely for Buriall; what reason can then bee alledged, why
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58886:17"/>
the dead should rather pay for going into the grave, then the living doe for going into the Church? Or why doe not the living pay as well for the one, as the dead for the other. Alas, <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo leoni &amp; lepores insultant,</hi> a little childe may pull a dead lyon by the beard, but the least dogge alive will turne againe upon the tallest man. I have here a faire occasion to speak of another great abuse, the extreame exacting money for pewes; but I will hold me to the matter in hand, and for a conclusion, give mee leave to upbraid our Ministers with that<note place="margin">Iliad. 7. pag. 128.</note> golden Edict of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> touching the slaughtered <hi>Trojans,</hi> his enemies.</p>

            <p>O shame to our religion that heathens and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers should be more gracious to their enemies, then a Christian Minister to his friends and brethren. But, <hi>ferrea nunc aetas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am now led, where I was loath to come, to shew the nature and penaltie of this sin. But that nicenesse is too late, since <hi>Jo. de Athon, Hostiensis,</hi> divers Canons, and some other former passages have alreadie so manifestly discovered it to be Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,<note place="margin">Decr. Greg. lib. 3. cap. 6.</note> under which title it therefore standeth ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the books of Canon-Law with this censure and penaltie, <hi>sicut simoniaca pestis,</hi> &amp;c. as that pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58886:18"/>
disease of Simony doth exceed in greatnesse all other diseases, so immediately assoone as the signes thereof shall appeare by the relation of any person, it ought to be cast out, and banished from the house of God; So odious is the contagion thereof in the Canon Law, as it receiveth all criminous and infamous persons to become accusers, even the bondman against his Lord. It induceth suspension,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. seq.</note> irregularitie, excommunication, curses, depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. many penalties not put in execution.</p>
            <p>The cognizance and reformation thereof, as of all other enormities in Church and Church-men, were anciently in the Clergie themselves; till <hi>King Henry</hi> the second perceiving that many horrible crimes committed by Clerkes were either smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up in secret, or smoothed over upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with some slight punishment; (for nothing in the Canon Law is mortall) he therefore obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the great Councell of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> to have them tried for Capitall matters before his secular Judges, which first cut the ham-strings of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Jurisdiction, and became a perpetuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for the laiming of it afterward in other members: for hereupon the succeeding Parliaments from time to time, as they found the Clergie either sleeping or exorbitant in using their Jurisdiction, pulled somewhat <hi>à Consistorio Cleri ad Praetorium Regis,</hi> from the Canon-Law to the Common-Law; and by little and little have brought the great sea of their old authority to a narrower compasse; which, if my Lords the Bishops look not the better
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58886:18"/>
to, will (I feare) be yet contracted and diminished. They are not ignorant what hath been attempted against them in this kinde in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> time and since, and that there be about foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred persons which observe their courses very strictly. Their Lordships trust their Chancellour, Commissaries, Arch-Deacons, and Officialls with the Canonicall government of their flocks, and these, in many places, desiring money rather then amendment, doe so shave and pelt the people, that the cry thereof is very grievous, and will (no doubt) produce some other reformation, if it bee not (as I said) helped by themselves in time.</p>
            <p>They were wont to limit their owne fees and the fees of their officers in the Provinciall Synods, as appeareth by diverse of them. But their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours kept them so badly, that although the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod<note place="margin">Steph. Mepham. Archiep. Cancer. Jo. Stratford in Synod. London.</note> of London in the yeare 1342. had given a good smart allowance for the probate and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a testament, as twenty shillings at least, of the money of that time for every hundred pound of the Inventory: yet the market by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth his time was growne to that height, that a thousand markes were said to be exacted for the probate businesse of one mans testament (Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Comptons</hi> by name;) which gave the Parliament in the twentie second of the same <hi>King</hi> such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, as they would trust the Clergy no longer to be their owne Carvers, but made a speciall Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute<note place="margin">See Hollinsh p. 911.</note> in that point to bridle their exactions: And so likewise about <hi>Mortuaries</hi> and <hi>Corps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> present.</hi>

               <p>But when all is done, it must not be forgotten that somewhat doubtlesse may be due unto the Parson upon the buryall of the dead, for why else should divers Canons provide that the bodyes of those which dye, be not carried to buriall out of

For they made hereby the place of buriall, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, to become their owne in private; and then, selling it for money, shew themselves more impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the barbarous <hi>Ephron,</hi> that freely offered <hi>Abraham</hi> his buriall field.</p>
               <p>It is now therefore to be considered, which be those laudable customes that may come within the protection of this Canon: for they doubtlesse are inexpugnable though not easily to be expressed, for that they may differ according as devotion hath begotten them in any place or Parish. But be they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58886:20"/>
what they may (I labour not on that;) my drist is onely to shew that they must not be those which are now in use, to take money for the grave or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of buriall; for these cannot be said to be godly or laudable customes, since so many Canons have declared them to be vitious, impious, injurious, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious, too too horrible, &amp; the more grievous by their longer custome and continuance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore damneth and annulleth them by expresse words, how ancient or how generall soever they be.</p>
               <p>If you will put me to name some such custome as may seeme laudable and Canonicall, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with that which <hi>Hostiensis, Athon,</hi> and <hi>Lindewode</hi> deliver upon their credit to be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in the Parish, where it hath been so used; viz. <hi>That for every one that dyeth there, so much hath usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been given unto the Priest or Church.</hi> This they say will hold out water; but, as I said before, I feare me none of our Parsons can maintaine it in this forme. Another is that we call a <hi>Mortuarie;</hi> which was thus paid: The Lord of the fee had the best beast of the defunct by way of an <hi>Heriot,</hi> for the support of his body against secular enemies; and the Parson of the Parish had the second as a <hi>Mortuarie</hi> for defending his soule against his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall<note place="margin">Lib. 1. tit. de consuet. c. 1. Lindew. 161. in gloss. fo. 15.</note> adversaries. I know the <hi>Provinciall,</hi> and <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode</hi> following it, doe say that the <hi>Mortuary</hi> was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given in recompence of personall tythes forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or omitted; but, under correction, I doubt of that; because, that in the ancient <hi>Formularie</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58886:20"/>
wills, and by the Canon of the Synod of <hi>Exeter,</hi> it is expresly directed, that in all of them, there shall be an especiall Legacy of some what to the Parson for tythes and oblations forgotten or pretermitted; and if a <hi>Mortuary</hi> were for the some reason, then had the Parson in many places two severall recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for one and the same thing. It were very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable also that a poore man having nothing ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thable but three horses, should give the second of them to the Parson for tythes omitted, when hee whose tythes are worth 40. or 50. pounds a yeere giveth no more; nor is it like an <hi>Heriot,</hi> which by contract between the Lord and Tenant was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the originall grant. But the Statute of 21. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. hath turned these kind of <hi>Mortuaries</hi> into certaine summes of money, according to the value and estate of the Parishioner deceasing, and forbiddeth any thing to be otherwise taken either for <hi>Mortuarie</hi> or <hi>Corps present</hi> (which I conceive to be, when the corps is carried either thorough or into another Parish) then where it died.</p>
               <p>Other customes there may be also, which the Canon accompteth laudable; as where money was anciently given for lights in the Church, or for praying for the soule of the deceased. The Parson it may be doth enjoy it at this day not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the originall, and so it behooveth him to doe, lest the King be entituled to it by the Statute of <hi>Superstitions uses.</hi> And it may be that the money now paid for graves, was anciently the same that was given for praying for the soule of the dead.

and <hi>Wulstan</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, about the yeere 1009. in the time of King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and now in a secular Parliament (as I may call it) confirmed by <hi>Canutus.</hi> But the old Latine manuscript copy of that Synod cleareth the question, in these words: <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Munera nec non defunctorum animabus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruentia puteo impendantur aperto; Let the gifts also that are given for the behoofe of soules of the dead be paid</hi> (or delivered) <hi>at the opening of the grave.</hi> This Canon neither commandeth any thing to be paid for the grave, nor yet for the soule, but onely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth the time when that which is given for the soule should be paid. He therefore that translated <hi>Canutus</hi> Lawes out of Saxon, did not truely expresse <hi>saulesceat</hi> by <hi>pecunia sepulturae,</hi> nor M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lambard</hi> (who rather affected eloquence then propriety) by <hi>pecunia sepulchralis:</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fox</hi> more unfaithfully by englishing the Latine. It is meet and right that in Funeralls money be given for opening the earth, as though the Law required that money should be paid for the grave, whereas that it speaketh of, was onely for praying for the soule, which by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons might lawfully be taken, and is that, which they also intend should be paid unto the Parish Church of the deceased, when the body is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where buried; for so an ancient paraphrasticall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of <hi>Canutus</hi> Lawes doth expresse it: <q>
                     <hi>Si quis cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus parentis aut amici sui ex propria parochia aliàs portare ad sepeliendum voluerit, faciat priùs certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem parochiae ad quam pertinet, scilicet redditus quod Angli saulesceat vocant, quod rectè per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvi</hi>

               <p>Now it appeareth how this grave-silver or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for graves grew up to be taken.

And to say what I thinke, doe now take that which was given for praying for the soule, under their fee for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of burying the Corps, and this for the grave besides, for they take them both.
