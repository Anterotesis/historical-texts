         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, Sir, it is too late: I rather wiſh to be diſſolved into Tears, then to be revived with Mirth; for the glory of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is departed.

Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> a formal, out-ſide Preaching and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like the fig-tree curſed by our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> bearing no fruits

And where will the glory of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, whoſe revenues depend upon Sheep and Wool, ſoon after be? Laſt of all, where will the glory of our Army and Souldiery be, if they conquer not all <hi>Europe,</hi> or at leaſt quit themſelves againſt the Power and Forces thereof? For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifeſtly, that they have provoked moſt part thereof to be enemies to our Nation. Woful will our Lamentations be: I ſhall not be able to weep enough: I ſhall even wiſh to be a <hi>Niobe,</hi> that I might be diſſolved into tears. <hi>Tantum relligio potuit ſuadere malorum?</hi> as the Poet. <hi>Simon, John, Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar;</hi> Prelate, Independent, Presbyter.

Our Laws have depended upon Monarchy, although enacted (which was our happineſs, if we had well conſidered it) not by Monarchy alone, but by Ariſtocracie, and Democracie: Therefore, without all three, our Laws are diſſolved, and we fall into Anarchy. Is Peace ever to be looked for without Law? If the Sword be our Law-giver, ſhall we not become Aſſaſſinates and Heathens? Where will Truth and Religion be? Without them, farewel Peace. We feel with ſorrow and ſmart, that <hi>Inter Arma ſilent Leges.</hi> And if there be neither King, Law, nor Religion, What will become of Parliaments? Our caſe will be the ſame with the Iſraelites, when they had no King: Every deſperate man will dare to ſay to a Parliament-man, as an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hebrew ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Who made thee a</hi> man of Authority, or <hi>Judge over us?</hi> But <hi>is there go balm</hi> left <hi>in Gilead?</hi> Is there not one man left, who by grave and ſeaſonable counſel might

               <p>It is daily done by zealous Preachers of God's Word in the Pulpit, and by them and others in Printed Papers, with ſolid and weighty Motives; but with little effect: For moſt mens hearts are hardened, and their underſtandings ſtupified: God hath ſtricken us, but we have not ſorrowed; he hath conſumed us, but we have refuſed to receive correction: we have made our faces harder then a ſtone, and have refuſed to return. We may now, with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, in his fifth Chapter, <hi>Run to and fro in the ſtreets of</hi> our Engliſh <hi>Jeruſalem, and behold now, and know, and enquire in the open places thereof, if</hi> we <hi>can finde a man, or if there be any that</hi> ſpontaneouſly <hi>executeth judgement, and ſeeketh the truth;</hi> and then hope that the Lord will <hi>ſpare</hi> the Land. Where is the man, who payeth his Vows to God? Where is the Patriot of his Country, fearing God and hating Covetouſneſs? Where is the Juſticiary? Do we not ſee almoſt every mans Self to be his own Country? Many <hi>great men</hi> ſay, they <hi>know the way of the Lord, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their God; but theſe have altogether broken the yoke, and burſt the bonds.</hi> The ſins for which moſt often and moſt ſeverely God puniſhed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were Idolatry, breach of Covenant, and Perjury. Did God puniſh them for thoſe ſins, and can other Nations, now in being, hope to be quit, and go free? We expected an iſſue of our miſeries by the Sword; but they are augmented, and aggravated: our hopes fail us. What will become of that People in the end, which repoſe confidence in their own ſtrength of Charets, Horſe-men, and Horſes? <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (in his 31 Chap. verſ. 1.) telleth them what attendeth them. God is the God of Order, and not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Will not the Lord <hi>viſit for theſe things? Shall</hi> he not <hi>be avenged on ſuch a Nation?</hi>
