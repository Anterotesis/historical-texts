            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>the World!</hi> Thy glorious Majesty is Excellent; but that brings nothing to me; Thy Justice is Excellent, but That brings me to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: It is thy Mercy, that must doe mee good: and therefore, thy other Excellencies I Adore; but This I Invocate. To Invocate thy Justice, I dare not; Thy Glory, I cannot: but thy Mercy, I both Dare, and Can: For, why should I not Dare; when Feare gives me Boldnesse? How should I not be able, when weaknesse gives mee strength? Why should I not Dare, when Thou Invitest me to it? How should I not be able, when Thou Drawest mee to it? Dost Thou Invite mee, and shall I not Come? Dost Thou Draw mee, and shall I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:666:5"/>
draw backe? Can there be a Patron so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as Thou? Can there be a Supplyant, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as my selfe? Of whom then, is it fitter, to aske for Mercy; than of Thee, O God, who art the God of Mercy? and for whom, Is it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to aske for Mercy, than for mee, who am a creature of Misery? If I were not so miserable; Thou couldst not be to mee so Mercifull: and have I not reason then to aske that of Thee which thou couldst not have so much occasion, to manifest to mee, as by mee? If it were not for sinne; there should be no Misery; and if no Misery; no exercise for thy Mercy: and wilt thou let it stand Idle, where it hath so foule sinnes; for so faire Fields, to walke in? Hast thou Mercy, and wilt thou not shew it? Or wilt thou shew it to others, and not to me? To say, I have not deserved it, were to make it no Mercy; for, if I deserved it; it were Justice, and not Mercy. Is not thy Mercy over all thy Works; and am not I the worke of thy Hands? The more Mercy thou shewest, the more is thine Honour; and wilt thou not doe that which is most for thine Honour? Thou didst shew Mercy to <hi>Adam;</hi> who was the first sinner: and thou didst shew Mercy to the <hi>Thiese</hi> on the Crosse; who was the longest sinner: and wilt thou not shew Mercy to mee, who am not the first; and hope, not to be the longest? Hast thou shewed Mercy to so many, that thou hast not Mercy left for me also? If thy Mercy were finite, and could be exhausted; It were no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:666:5"/>
charity to aske it, lest others might want it; but seeing it is Infinite, and can never be spent; why should I be sparing to aske it, or Thou to bestow it? Thy Mercy is Infinite, or none at all; for all thou art is Infinite; and wilt thou by shewing thy Mercy, lesse; shew thy selfe to be Mercilesse? If thy Mercy be Infinite, it must extend to all; and how extends it to all, if not to me? Thou hast as much Mercy for me, as if thou hadst none to have Mercy on but me: and can it be, thou shouldst have so much for mee, and let mee have none of it? Can my daily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities alien thy Love? This were to thinke, thou didst not love me, but for my goodnesse: and alas! what goodnesse is there? What good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ever was there in mee, that thou shouldst love mee? Can thy Love aliened, turne away thy Mercy? This were to thinke, thy Mercy did reach no further than thy Love; and so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know, thou lovest not sinne, I might justly feare, thou wouldst never have Mercy upon sinners. But, O gracious God, Thou lovest for thy loves sake; and Thou hast Mercy for thy Mercies sake; and seeing thy Love, which is thy selfe, can never leave Thee; It makes mee assured, thy Mercy, which is thy Nature, will never leave mee. If I refused thy Mercy, thou mightst justly with-hold it: but now, Behold, I hold my Brest open to receive it; Or if I did not aske thy Mercy, thou mightst for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to shew it; but now Behold; I begge it upon my knees. I am none of <hi>Zebedees</hi> sonnes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:666:6"/>
that aske to sit at thy right hand, and at thy left; I desire not Exaltation, but Absolution; It is not thy Bounty I aske, but onely thy Mercy; <hi>Have mercy upon mee, O God, according to thy loving kindnesse; and according to the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies, doe away mine offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be thought severity in God, to cast <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> for only One sin: But was <hi>Adams</hi> sin, but onely One? but One perhaps in Action, but a Million in Affection. For, say It was Pride? hath not Pride more branches than a Tree hath? Say it was Gluttony? hath not Gluttony more dishes than <hi>Dives</hi> had? Say it was Curiositie; hath not Curiosity, more Eyes than <hi>Argus</hi> had? Say it was Disobedience? hath not Disobedience, more faults than <hi>Absolon</hi> had? For how else could <hi>Manasses</hi> sinnes come to be more than the sands of the Sea, if it be not, that a sinne, though but in Thought, may justly be thought a Million of sinnes? And as it is said in the Gospel, that a man was posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with an uncleane Spirit; but that uncleane Spirit was a Legion: So wee may say of every sinne; It is but One sinne; but that One sinne is a Legion. Here therefore, O my soule, take heed thou mis-take not thy selfe, in casting up the Audit of thy sinnes; and thinke, thou hast perhaps but One or Two sins, to answer for to God; when in Gods sight, every sin thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittest is a Legion; and for a Legion of sinnes thou must make thy account, thou shalt make account. And now, seeing my sins are in number
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:666:6"/>
so many, and so great in measure; have I not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to aske for mercies, of equall proportion? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore I aske not thy Bounty, but thy Mercy; yet the Bounty of thy Mercy I aske; to aske lesse than would serve, would prejudice my wants, and not relieve them; and how then can I aske lesse than a multitude of great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to doe away my offences; who have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of great offences, to be done away? But hath God then, a multitude of Mercies, whereof some be greater, and some be lesser? Is not his Mercv, as himselfe is, onely One and <hi>simplicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus?</hi> No doubt, It is so in it selfe; One and single as himselfe; but yet in relation to us, and to our understanding; It is said to be, as it is applyed: To every sinne, a Mercy; to great sinnes great mercies; to a multitude of sinnes, a multitude of Mercies. But is not this, a Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in praying; to pray for that, for which we should rather give thankes? to pray for a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of great mercies, as though we had them not already? When wee should rather give thankes for them, which wee have so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? For is it not Gods great mercy to us all, that wee be not all consumed? and this great mercy multiplyed unto us; when thousands fall on our right hand; and ten thousands on our left; yet we in the midst of these dangers, are kept safe from danger? Is it not his great mercy, that hee gives Riches and Plenty; and this mercy multiplyed unto us, when so many are pined away with penury; yet our Land
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:666:7"/>
floweth, with Milke and Honey? Is it not his great mercy, that the light of the Gospell shines upon us; and this mercy multiplied unto us, when so many live in darknesse; and in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death? These indeed are great Mercies; yet they are but the mercies of his Patience: or of his generall Goodnesse and Bounty; and of these mercies, we may justly be afraid: as it is said; <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayest be feared:</hi> but it is the mercies of his speciall Love, that I desire; and of these mercies, there can be no feare; for, <hi>Love casteth out Feare.</hi> The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Patience, and of his Bounty; are not his tender mercies; wee may have them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, and to our hurt: as long Life; but to heape up wrath against the day of wrath; Riches and Honours, but to make our Camell the greater; and the unfitter to passe thorow a Needles Eye; The light of the Gospell; but to make us the more guilty, and subject to be beaten with more stripes: but his tender mercies, are the mercies of his Love; and can never be had, but for our good; for, <hi>Love covers the multitude of sinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:666:7"/>
according to the multitude of thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Doe away mine offences. It was a great mercy, even of thy Love; that with great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, thou diddest bring the Israelites out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but, that thou didst endure to be grieved with that Generation, fortie yeeres together; and yet bring them at last, into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> this was a multitude of great mercies. And yet more than this: It was a great mercy, that thou diddest suffer our first Parents, after their great sinne, to live; and to propagate their sinfull Race; but, that thou didst send, thine onely Sonne, to Expiate their sinne; and to make satisfaction for it, with infinite Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, in Life and Death; this was a multitude of great and tender mercies. And now, that I have the multitude of Gods tender mercies at the heighth; what would I have it to doe? Even to doe away mine offences: For this is a worke, for a multitude of mercies; and of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy only. Thy Power O God, is Almighty, and yet cannot; Thy Justice most perfect, and yet will not; Thy Wisedome Infinite, and yet knowes not, how to doe away offences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Mercy; but thy Mercy alone, and of it selfe, both Can, and May, and Will; and therefore, thy Mercy is the Sanctuary that I flie unto; and seeing thou delightest, in shewing of mercy, Behold, I shew thee a large Field here, wherein thou mayst shew it; a Multitude of my great sinnes, for a Multitude of thy great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And because sinnes are Pollutions; and

            </p>
            <p>I must confesse, I was at first afraid of thy washing; for thou didst once wash the whole World; and then, thou didst wash away the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but not the sins; and if thou shouldst wash mee so; It were as good for me, to be unwasht; but I consider, that washing was in thy Iustice: the washing I desire, is in thy Mercy; and I should not have dared to pray thee to wash me: if I had not prayed thee first, to have mercy upon me; for it is thy washing in mercy onely, that washes cleane; thy washing in Iustice, washeth cleane away. But why is <hi>David</hi> so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous in making his sute? To pray God, to wash away his sinnes; before he make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and tell what his sinnes be? As a man, that should require his Physician to cure his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; without telling what hee ailes; and what his disease is. But is it not, that the ardour and burning heat, which <hi>David</hi> felt of his sins; made him, as it were, to leape into the water, at the very first; crying out to be washed; quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all order, through the violence of his ardour? much like to Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> who through heat of desire, to be instantly with Christ whom hee saw upon the water; never stayed, but girt his coate about him, and leapt into the water, clothes and all. Or is it, that <hi>David</hi> might well require to be cured of his disease, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it; being come to a Physitian, who knew
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:666:8"/>
his disease better than himselfe? Or is it indeed, that to tell our disease, is part of our curing; to confesse our sinnes, is an act of our washing, and therefore no preposterous course in <hi>David,</hi> to pray for washing, before confessing; seeing no confessing is truly sound; which hath not its beginning, and is not proceeding from Gods washing?</p>
            <p>But how can wee answer this to God? Hee saith unto us by <hi>Esay; Wash you, Make you cleane;</hi> meaning, it seemes, we should wash our selves; and now we come to him to wash us; as though wee should say; If you will have us be washed, you must come and doe it your selfe? Indeed, both must be done; God must wash us, and we must wash our selves: but Gods washing, is not like our washing; Gods washing is by the fire of his Spirit; our washing is by the water of contrition: Gods washing is by pardoning; our washing by repenting. <hi>Peter</hi> washed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when having denied his Master, he went out, and wept bitterly: Christ washed him, when he prayed for him, that his faith might not faile. <hi>David</hi> washed himselfe, when for griefe of his sinnes, he watered his bed with teares; God washed him, when hee sent him word by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> that his sinne was forgiven. And indeede, if God wash us not with his water of pardon; the water of our owne teares, will doe no great good: It may wet, but not wash; or wash, but not cleanse, if God put not our teares into his bottle, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:666:9"/>
onely can give them the power of cleansing. For <hi>Esau</hi> had a floud of teares to wash himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but God never put them into his bottle: they were teares for his punishment, but not for his sinnes; and therefore they might wet, perhaps, but they never cleansed. Oh then, Put my teares into thy bottle, O God: for they are teares for my sins, and not for my punishment; and then <hi>wash mee with them, and I shall be cleane.</hi> My teares, God knowes, are of themselves too cold, unlesse they be warmed by the fire of Gods Spirit; but if wee bring the water, and God bring the fire: then indeed a fit Lexative will be made to make us cleane. O then, warme the cold teares of my repentance with the fire of thy Spirit, O God; and then wash me with them; that my repentance it selfe being first cleansed, may be made effectuall to cleanse mee from my sinne. Our owne washing is of it selfe imperfect; and makes us ne're a whit the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: because wee mis-take the water, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did; who washed his hands from Christs blood, where hee should have washed them in Christs blood; but thy washing, O God, is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cleansing; for thou canst not mis-take the water, who art the water thy selfe; and not in a Cesterne, but the Fountaine it selfe. We wash our selves commonly, but as the Pharisees wash their cups; onely the out-side; and this makes us but Hypocrites: but thy washing. O God, is alwaies inward; for, <hi>Thou searchest the hearts and reines;</hi> and this is the washing that makes the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:666:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
true Israelite, in whom there is no guile. When <hi>Naaman</hi> was cured of his leprosie, by washing in <hi>Iordan;</hi> did God then wash him; or did <hi>Naaman</hi> wash himselfe? Indeed both; <hi>Naaman</hi> washed himselfe, by obedience and confidence in Gods power; God washed him by giving power to the water, and confidence to <hi>Naaman.</hi> But this power, was but a personall estate to <hi>Iordan;</hi> it hath no such power in cleansing of mee: the water that must cleanse me, is the water that flowed out of my Saviours side; and in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the power of that water, I humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate my selfe before thee, O God, and say; <hi>Wash mee thorowly from mine iniquities, and cleanse mee from my sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why should <hi>David</hi> speake so superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously? Vse two words, when one would serve? for, if wee be cleansed, what matter is it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by washing or no? Yet <hi>David</hi> had great reason for using both words; for hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not, that God would cleanse him by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, but by the ordinary way of cleansing; and this was washing; he names therefore, washing as the meanes; and cleansing as the end: hee names washing, as the worke a doing; and cleansing as the work done: he names washing, as considering the agent; and cleansing, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to the patient: and indeed, as in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Law there was not; so in the Verity of the Gospel, there is not any ordinary meanes of cleansing, but only by washing: and therefore out of Christ our Saviours side, there flowed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:666:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
water and blood; water to wash us, and blood to cleanse us: water, to make the laver of our regeneration in Baptisme; and blood, to make the laver of our expiation in Christs sacrifice: but though the words seeme here, to be thus distinguished; yet otherwhere, they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times promiscuously used; and as well clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as washing referred to this water: as well washing as cleansing, referred to this blood.</p>
            <p>But what meanes <hi>David,</hi> to say, <hi>Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse mee from my sinne;</hi> as though hee would be washed from one thing, and cleansed from another? and not be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from that for which hee is washed? But is it not, that iniquity and sinne, though called by divers names, are both the same thing; but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iniquity, as being a transgression of the Law; called sinne, as being an offence against God? Or is it, that in sinne there is both a staine, and a gu lt?; and hee prayes to be washed from the staine, and cleansed from the guilt? Or is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that he useth divers words, to shew that he askes forgivenesse for all his sinnes, by what name or title soever they be called?</p>
            <p>But is not this an indignity, to the great Majestie of God? we put our meanest servants to wash our clothes, and will we put God to so meane an office, to be a Launderer of sinnes? Yet see the humility of Majesty, an humility, even to extasie: he descends yet lower; not onely to wash our sinnes, but to take our sinnes upon him. It seemes Saint <hi>Peter</hi> indeed, was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:666:10"/>
in this errour, to thinke it an indignity: and therefore would not by any meanes suffer, that Christ should wash him; untill he heard Christ say; unlesse I wash thee, thou canst have no part in mee; and then hee cried, Not my feete onely, but my hands and my head: and is not this my case also; that unlesse God wash mee, I can have no part in him? And will I lose my part in God, for want of washing? Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my soule, prepare thy selfe for this wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; put off thy clothes, and strip thy selfe starke naked; keepe not so much as fig-leafes about thee, either to hide thy sinnes by contumacy, or to cover them by hypocrifie, or to sleight them by indulgency; but lay them all open and bare before the face of God; that whil'st no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is interposed betweene Gods water and thy sinnes; it may without impediment have full liberty to worke upon thee.</p>
            <p>But what though God doe wash us? are wee <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</note> sure his washing will alwaies cleanse us? Why is it then, that he saith; <hi>I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged:</hi> for may he not as well say; <hi>I have washed thee, and thou wast not cleansed?</hi> and if not cleansed, as good not washed. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Not wash me onely; but cleanse me from my sinnes; that as in washing, thou shewest thy Love: so by cleansing, thou mayest shew thy Power; seeing it is an office, which as none will be willing to undertake, but he whose love is unspeakeable: so none can b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

can washing be without touching? And would any man foule his fingers, to touch so foule a thing as my sin; if hee did not love exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Can cleansing mee, be without doing a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle? for seeing it cannot more truely be said, that I have sinne, than that I am sinne; what is it now to cleanse mee, but even <hi>laterem lavare?</hi> which was never counted lesse, than either a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour lost, or a miracle wrought: and can any doe mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh then, <hi>Wash mee from mine iniquitie,</hi> that I may praise thee for thy Love; <hi>and cleanse mee from my sinne,</hi> that I may magnifie thee for thy Power; which, as I shall doe both, if once I be cleansed: so I am able to doe neither; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I be washed. For alas! O Lord, what am I, but as a filthy ragge before thee? Who am I, but the man by the high way side, lying bound and wounded? No meanes at all left mee; to wash, much lesse to cleanse my selfe; They must be both thine owne, thine only worke, O God, both to wash me, by thy preventing grace; and by thy assisting grace to cleanse mee: Oh then, cleanse mee from my sinnes, O God; let not the foulenesse of my sinnes, make thee unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wash mee: Let not the reluctancy of my flesh, make thee unable to cleanse me; but make thy worke of washing mee, to prosper in thy hand. Oh wash mee; but not as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was washed; who came fouler out of the water, than he went in; but as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was washed; who came so cleane out of the water, that hee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:666:11"/>
was ready to runne thorow fire and water, for thy names sake: and by his washing, was made a fit Minister, for the washing of others. And now, O great God, since it hath pleased thee, to descend to so low a worke as washing mee; O wash mee thorowly; not rince mee onely; as though I were but lightly stained; and had but some small spots upon mee; but wash mee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, as having a leprosie that over-spreads mee; a foulenesse that is deeply engrained in mee; so deeply, O God, that nothing but a washing by thine owne hand can fetch it out. And yet stay; why should I put God to this trouble of washing me at all? seeing I have an easier way of cleansing, taught me by the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> in the Gospell; <hi>Speake the word onely, and I shall be cleane;</hi> or, if this be still too much; an easier way yet taught mee by another; <hi>Si vis, potest me mundare;</hi> If thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I know mine iniquity, and my sinne is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me;</hi> although, perhaps, it be a knowledge, I were better be without: For, Christ knew no sinne; which wee may be sure, hee should have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:666:12"/>
done, if it had beene worth the knowing. Christ indeed knew no sinne in himselfe; but he knew sinne in it selfe; he knew no sinne by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; but he knew sinne by understanding it. My misery is not that I know sinne; but that I know my sinne; that I have sin of mine owne to know. Christ knew no sinne, because he could not say; I know my sinne: but I know my sin, because I cannot say, I knew not sinne: And yet who will believe, that a man knowes sinne, that will be medling with it? Wee say, there are no miracles now adaies in the world; and can there be a greater wonder than this; that a man should know sinne, and yet commit it? should know the foulenesse of sinne; and yet lie wallowing in it? should know the horrour of sinne; and yet runne head-long into it? But is it not, that wee are all in this, the children of <hi>Adam?</hi> Our eyes are not opened, till wee have eaten of the forbidden fruit; wee know not sin truely, till wee have committed it; wee see not the foulenesse, till we feele the guiltinesse; and this makes mee say now, which I could not so well say till now; <hi>I know mine iniquities, and my sinne is ever before mee:</hi> for, they were strangers to me before; and I knew not their conditions; but now I finde what they are; and am sicke of their company: They were indeed pleasing to me in the doing; but are now most loath some, being done: They stood behind me at first, as servants waiting upon mee; but are now ever before me, astormenters seazing upon me; that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:666:12"/>
if ever I loved them before; I hate them now a thousand times more.</p>
            <p>But why should <hi>David</hi> make it so great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to say, I know my sinne; as though a man could commit a sinne, and not know it? as though <hi>Adam</hi> could eate of the forbidden fruit, and not know hee had eaten it? <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed knew his eating; yet hee knew not his sinning; he knew his nakednesse, but he knew not his guiltinesse; if when he answered God; <hi>I know my nakednesse,</hi> he had said, <hi>I know my sinne;</hi> hee might, perhaps, have tarried in Paradise still; that we may see, how hard a thing it is to say, I know my sinne, which cost <hi>Adam</hi> no lesse than Paradise before he could say it. And how much easier came <hi>David</hi> to be able to say, <hi>I know my sinne?</hi> For, doe wee thinke hee could say it, as soone as hee had committed it? No, nor almost a whole yeere after; that as we may say of <hi>Adam;</hi> it cost him a great place: so wee may say of <hi>David,</hi> it cost him a long time, to learne to say, <hi>I know my sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>I know my sins;</hi> and yet in another place, said, <hi>Forgive me my secret sinnes?</hi> For, if hee know them; how be they secret? and if they be secret, how doth he know them? Indeed, both <hi>David,</hi> and every one of us, hath sinne enough to serve both turnes; not onely, because sinne is of a greater size in Gods sight, than it is in ours; and therefore leaves much for him to see, which to us is secret; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause also, there are many actions in our life;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:666:13"/>
which we so lightly passe over, as if we thought them no sinnes; perhaps, thought them Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; when yet in Gods sight, they are grievous sinnes. <hi>David</hi> had committed a great sin, which hee could not choose, but know to be a sinne; and therefore might justly say; <hi>I know my sinne;</hi> but that his sinne had caused Gods Name to be blasphemed; this was a sinne he knew not, till God himselfe did tell him: and from hence he might justly suspect hee had cause enough in other sinnes, to say; <hi>Forgive me my secret sinnes.</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>In many things wee offend all;</hi> this wee all know; and gives us all just cause, to say; <hi>I know my sinne;</hi> but what those many things are, in which wee offend; and what those offences be, which in many things wee commit; this, many times we know not: and gives us as just cause to say, <hi>Forgive mee my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! my soule, I must not stay here, onely to know my sinne; and keepe it to my selfe, as though I thought it a Jewell, which none might know of, for feare of losing it; but in this, I acknowledge the great favour of God, that as I know my sinne; so I acknowledge my sinne: For, farre be it from mee, I should be found of <hi>Sauls</hi> disposition; to thinke to make God believe, that I saved the fat of the sheepe for sacrifice; when I saved them for mine owne profit; this hiding a sin, is a greater sin than the sinne it hides: For, it is an affront to Gods omnipotency; <hi>Adams</hi> Fig-leafes proved
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:666:13"/>
as hurtfull to him as the forbidden fruit; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laies our sinnes so open to God, as our seeking to hide them; and although it be often times dangerous to acknowledge a fault to a civill Magistrate, who without our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging could not know it; yet there can be no danger, to acknowledge our sins to God; who knowes them already, whether wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them or no: Our acknowledging them to him, is not a discoverie, but the first degree of recovery; and seeing I am now travelling to repentance; how is it possible, I should ever come at it, if I acknowledge not my sinnes; which is the first step to it? and therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I am guilty of many great and hainous sinnes; yet of this sin, of hiding my sinne; thou canst cleare mee, O God; for, <hi>I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sinne is ever before me.</hi>

Yet in judgement, O Lord, remember mercy; consider not how foule I am become; but how I am become foule; for though my sinne be great, yet I was not the beginner of it; for, <hi>Behold, I was borne in iniquity; and in sinne hath my mother conceived me;</hi>

But though it be naturall to mee to sinne; yet it is not naturall to me, to sinne so grievously as I have done; for then every one should be as great a sinner as my selfe; but now, that I must say with Saint <hi>Paul, Of all great sinners, I am the greatest;</hi> this is an estate of sinne, which I have not by Inheritance, but by Purchase; and I cannot blame Nature, but my selfe for this: all the help is, that though I might be ashamed to doe it; yet I am not ashamed to consesse it; and is not a sincere confessing, in the ballance of thy Mercv, O God, of even weight with the not doing? and therefore, although the sinne I conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Superficiall and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wisdome, is the gift oft-times of Nature, sometimes of Art; but this wisedome in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the heart, is onely Gods Advowson; none can give it; none bestow it; but God himselfe, and hee alone. Wherefore, O God, though I have not hated that which thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, the committing of sin; yet seeing I have loved that which thou lovest, the truth of heart; thou hast taught me wisdome in the secret of my heart; though thou didst not give me the grace to prevent sin; yet thou hast taught me the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to repent sinne; a wisedome which none can haue, unlesse hee be taught; and none can teach but onely thy selfe; a wisedome which cannot be had, but in the heart; and no where in the heart, but in the secret of the heart. A man may have the wisedome to see his sinne, by the outward eye of the heart; and hee may

have the wisedome to understand his sin, by the common sense of the heart; but he cannot have the wisedome to repent his sinne; but onely in the secret, and innermost of his heart. And we need not wonder, that God only is the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of this wisedome; seeing the wisedome of the world is not capable of it; it is a secret, hidden from carnall eyes: It is as hard a matter to feele the power of repentance, in the soule; as to believe the resurrection from the dead, in the body; both great secrets; but this, perhaps, the greater; as being indeed, the ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It seemes, that washing was but onely for a preparative to purging; to make it worke the better; at least it went not so farre, as the secret of the heart: And seeing the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my sinne, hath pierced my heart to the very bottome; no remedy now, but I must be purged, if I will be cleansed. But doe I well, to prescribe to God, with what hee shall purge mee; as though I knew, all Gods Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as well as himselfe? and which is worse; I to prescribe, and he to minister? But excuse me, O my soule; it is not I that prescribe it to God; it is God, that prescribes it to me: for Hysop is his owne receit; and one of the ingredients pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by himselfe, to make the water of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for curing the leprosie. But why then with Hysop; and not with Ellebor, or Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tather? For how else happens it, that Gods purging should not worke; as he saith himselfe: <hi>I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged;</hi> but that hee gives purges of too weake operation? for Hysop, God knowes, is but a weake purger; it searce reacheth to amend the errours of the first digestion; and how then is it possible, it should ever be able to purge away my sins; which have tainted my blood; and are growne, as it were, a part of my very substance? But is it not, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:666:19"/>
Gods arme, is of a strange strength; and can put force into the weakest Instruments; and therefore, can doe more with Hysop, than all the world besides can doe with E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lebore? But it is indeed the great Love, or rather indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of God; that he will never use Ellebore where Hysop will serve; never use roughnesse and severity, where lenity &amp; mildnesse may be effectuall. Reserve then, O God, thy Ellebour and thy Scammony for more stubborne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant humors; <hi>`Purge me with Hysop only, and I shall be cleane.</hi> I must confesse, I was glad at heart, when I first heard Hysop spoken of; to thinke, I should be purged so gently; and with a thing, that may so easily be had; for Hysop growes in every garden; and then I thought I might goe fetch it thence; and purge my selfe; but now I perceive, this is not the Hysop, of which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> writ, when hee writ from the Cedar, to the Hysop: but this Hysop is rather the herbe Grace; which never grew in garden, but in that of Paradise; and which none can fetch thence, unlesse God himselfe deliver it. The truth is; this Hysop was sometimes a Cedar; the highest of all trees, became the lowest of all shrubs, only to be made this Hysop for us: For, Christ indeed is the true Hysop; and his blood, the juyce of Hysop that onely can purge away my sins; that I need not now feare the weaknesse of Gods purge; seeing this Hysop farre exceeds, not only Ellebore and Scammony, but all the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest drugs, that ever the earth brought sorth.

Indeed, such retrogradation is no worke of humane art; it must be onely his doing, who brought the Sun ten degrees backe, in the Diall of <hi>Ahaz:</hi> for God hath a Nitre of grace, that can bring, not onely the rednesse of scarlet sins; but even the blacknesse of deadly sins, into its native purity and whitenesse againe.</p>
            <p>But say it be possible; yet what need is there of so great a whitenesse, as to be whiter than snow? seeing snow, is not as <hi>paries dealbatus;</hi> a pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet, a whiter whitenesse than this, too; for being purged from sin, we shall <hi>induere stolam albam;</hi> put on the white robe; and this is a whitenesse, as much whiter than snow; as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall

whitenesse is more than Elementar.</p>
            <p>But may we not conceive rather, that in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Purge mee with Hysop;</hi> it is not meant <hi>purgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> but <hi>aspergendo;</hi> that so, there may be two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees exprest, of using the juyce of this Hysop: one when it is, but a sprinkling only; yet enough to take away the foulenesse of sinne; another, when it is a full and thorow washing; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the cleannesse, addes also a beauty; and that to admiration. Indeed, the least drop of Christs blood, the true juyce of this Hysop; makes fit to stand in the congregation of the righteous; but a full bathe of it gives a high degree, in the Hierarchie of Saints and Angells. Howsoever, we may plainly see a great difference, betweene the washing that was spoken of before; and the washing that is spoken of here; as great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as betweene cleannesse and whitenesse; for that washing was to cleanse us; but this washing is to whiten us; of that it was said; <hi>Wash mee, and I shall be cleane;</hi> but of this, it is said; <hi>Wash mee, and I shall be whiter thau snow:</hi> and therefore upon this, it presently followes; <note place="margin">Verse <hi>8.</hi>

But we must be whited first; for while the blacknesse of sinne remaines in the soule; there can be no Embleme of whitenesse engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it: but if once we be whited by Gods

washing; and have the Embleme upon us; this Motto, wee may be sure, will be added to the Embleme; Hee will make us heare of joy and gladnesse. And the like may be seene, in the kindly order of Gods Physicke: First, a Purge; and then, a Cordiall; having purged us with Hysop; hee will make us to heare of joy and gladnesse; but wee must be purged first: for while the peccant humours remaine in the soule; there is no place fit for the Cordiall of joy, but if the humors be purged by the Hysop of repentance; then the heart will be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; and the spirits refreshed; and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall of joy and gladnesse will have its full ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>But had <hi>David</hi> ever any returne of this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did God ever heare it, or grant it?

Indeed, as happy in this, as <hi>David:</hi> for though wee have not the same <hi>Nathan,</hi> in <hi>individno,</hi> yet we may truely say, wee have him in <hi>specie;</hi> and the same message of joy, which that <hi>Nathan</hi>

            <p>But why should <hi>David</hi> pray to God; to make him heare of joy and gladnesse; and not rather doe, as his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> did afterward; gather Gold and Silver; get him men-singers, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-singers; and so make joy and gladnesse to himselfe? Alas, my soule! these are joyes to be repented of; and not joyes to repentance; for, but for such delights as these, I had never fallen into these sorrowes; they have been my snares, and cannot now be comforts; it is not all the delights and pleasures of the world, that can ease one pang of a penitent heart. The sorrowes are spirituall, and must have spirituall joyes; thou, O God, hast caused the sorrowes, and thou on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly canst Minister the comforts;

            <p>But say, O my soule; how came thy bones to be broken? hath this beene the worke of Gods Hysop? Is the breaking of bones, the gentle purging that was talk'd of? What could Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore or Scammony have done more? and yet thou canst not wonder so much, at the force of Gods purging, to breake thy bones; as thou mayst wonder at the force of his Cordiall, to make thy broken bones rejoyce; and that which

thou mayest wonder at more; the same Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop is both the Cordiall and the Purge: won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull indeed, that the same thing, should both breake the bones; and make the broken bones rejoyce: yet so it is; for this Hysop, is not only a cleanser; but a knitter and binder together: and as by the force of cleansing, it breakes the bones; so by the vertue of knitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it makes the broken bones rejoyce; for, what greater joy, to broken bones, than to be knit together; and made whole againe? It was not I, God knowes, that broke my bones; I could never have had the heart to doe it: It is thou, O God, didst breake them; and that, in Mercy; for thou knewst, that unlesse my bones were broken; my sin, that is bred in the bone, could never be thorowly purged away. And now, O God; if I be not purged enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; purge mee yet more, and purge mee still; untill I be made more white than snow: but then, make mee to heare of joy and gladnesse: for, without this Cordiall, I shall faint in my purging; and shall never be able to goe thorow, with thy course of Physicke: For my bones are already broken; and I have scarce any blood left me in my veines; but if thou give me this Cordiall of joy and gladnesse; my strength will returne; and my broken bones will be made whole againe.</p>
            <p>But why is it said; <hi>Make mee to heare of joy and gladnesse;</hi> and not said rather; <hi>Make mee to feele joy and gladnesse?</hi> For, were it not better to feele
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:666:22"/>
joy; than onely to heare of joy? but indeede, wee cannot feele this joy, unlesse wee heare it first: and if once wee heare it; it is then our owne fault, if wee doe not feele it. For, what is this joy, but that, of which the Angels brought tidings to the Shepheards; <hi>Behold, I bring you tidings of great joy; This day is borne to you a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi> one that shall make whole againe all broken bones; seeing he is one, of whom there shall not a bone be broken. But what is this to us, that, his bones be not broken, if ours be? Great good to us, if wee be purged with this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop; for then wee shall be united, and knit unto him; made flesh of his Flesh; and bone of his Bone; that if his bones be sound, and not broken; our bones shall quickly withall, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover soundnesse. And yet a greater joy, to be heard of, than this; for then indeed, wee shall heare of our greatest joy; when wee shall heare this voyce: <hi>Arise, thou that sleepest, and stand up; and God shall give thee light;</hi> for at the hearing of this voyce; all bones, though broken into a thousand pieces; though burnt, or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to dust and ashes; shall all come together, and be knit together; and shall be covered againe with this very flesh; and in this flesh, I shall see my Redeemer. And now, O my soule, thou mayst comfort thy selfe in hope; that though thy bones be broken now, yet a time will come, when they shall rejoyce; and should never indeed rejoyce, if they were not now broken; for this is a world for breaking of

               </gap>ones; but we look for a new heaven, and a new earth; when for their breaking now, they shall have beautie for ashes; and a garment of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for the spirit of heavinesse. But, O mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, put mee not off so long for my joy; my broken bones, will be in a worse case, than <hi>Lazarus</hi> body was after foure daies burying; if thou let mee lie so long in the grave of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; my case requires a present remedy; and a remedy may be applyed, in the turning of a hand, at least with the turning of a face: <note place="margin">Verse <hi>9.</hi>
               </note> onely <hi>Turne away thy face from my sinnes;</hi> and my broken bones will quickely rejoyce: For, to turne away thy face from my sinnes, is to turne away thine anger for my sinnes; and to turne away thine anger, is to receive mee into grace; and if of this I might be once assured, it would make my broken bones more nimble to leape for joy, than <hi>Abraham</hi> was to see thy day; for, as it was the apprehension of thine anger, that broke my bones; so nothing can set them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and put them in joynt againe; untill I be secured of thy Grace and Favour.</p>
            <p>But am I well advised, in praying God, to turne away his face from my sinnes? For, am I not so wholly over-spread with sinne; that if he turne away his face from my sinne; he must needes turne it away from me too? and then, in what horrour of darknesse should I be left? But is it not, that thy Wisedome, O God, is so transcendent, that thou canst easily abstract the sinner from the sinne? and then the more thou
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:666:23"/>
turnest thy face from my sinne; the more thou wilt turne thy face upon mee; and the more I shall enjoy the light of thy countenance. If thou shouldst not turne away thy face from my sinne; but stand looking upon it; alas, O God! it would be a worse sight, than that which <hi>Cham</hi> saw in his fathers nakednesse; and a good sonne turned away his face from that; and canst thou be a good Father, and not turne away thy face from this? God forbid, thou shouldst ever say to me, as thou didst once to our first Parent; <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> a question that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver asked, but when it was followed with a curse. For why shouldst thou aske, where I am; but that thou canst not see, where I am? and how can it be, thou shouldst not see, where I am, but that thou canst not see mee, for sinne? Vse then, O God, the transcendency of thy Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; abstract mee from my sinne; and make my sinne and me, two severall objects; that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thy face from my sinne, thou mayest turne it upon mee; and not need to aske me where I am; but mayest see mee where I am; and by seeing mee, make mee enjoy the light of thy countenance.</p>
            <p>But is my sinne so pleasing a prospect; that I should need to feare, lest God should stand loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon it? Indeede, after his first creation, he looked upon all his creatures; and saw them all exceeding good, and this was a prospect, worth his looking on; but my sinnes, O God, are none of thy creatures; there is no goodnesse
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:666:23"/>
at all, to be seene in them: therefore looke not upon my sinnes; but upon my repentance; and in this thou shalt find, <hi>veter is vestigia formae;</hi> that thou needst not to alter thy style; but say still; <hi>It is exceeding good.</hi> But seeing, if thou turne away thy face from my sinne; thou must needs turne it, upon something else; upon what is it indeed, I would have thee to turne it? Vp on mee? No. Vpon my repentance? Neither; but though not upon my sinnes, yet upon him that hath taken my sinnes upon him; that as in him, thou art well pleased; so through him, thou mayest be well pleased with mee; and with my repentance.</p>
            <p>But what safety is it to me, that God turne away his face; if his eares stand open? for my sinnes are crying sinnes; and it may be, as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, that God heare their cry, as see their foulenesse: For, what brought <hi>Caine</hi> to all his misery, but that God heard the cry of his sinne? but know, O my soule, that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not of parts; though our weake capacities expresse him so; and if wee expresse him by parts; know also there is an absolute and sweet harmony betweene them, in God; that if his face be turned away from seeing the foulenesse of our sinnes; his eares shall never stand open, to let in their crying. But what am I the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou turne away thy face from my sin; if my sin continue, and remaine upon me still? For it is not the bold Nature of sinne, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pressing into thy sight; and as it were,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:666:24"/>
forcing thee to see it, whether thou wilt or no? Oh therefore, not onely, turne away thy face from my sinnes; but blot my finnes out; that as <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</note> by turning away thy face, thou mayest not see my sinnes: so by blotting them out, I may have no sinnes to be seene. But if God turne away his face from my sins; how shall he seee, to blot them out? Not therfore, <hi>faciem cognitionis; faciem</hi> but <hi>indignationis,</hi> not his face with which, he sees all things: but his face, with which, he frownes upon evil things. But are not my sins themselves blots? and how can blots be blotted out? they are blots indeed upon my soule; but they are faire Characters in Gods Booke; and there is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betweene Gods Booke and my soule; that if they be blotted out in his Booke; they shall never be legible in my soule. But, O gracious God; I dare not trust to this neither: for though by blotting them out, they may be made not legible; yet the very blotting them out, will be a marke of remembrance, that they were once there; and is it not a fearefull thing, to thinke, thou shouldst but once remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them?

We made thee first, our Landerer to wash us; then our Physitian, to purge us: and now our Creatour, to new make us; and indeed there was no staying, till we came hither: Our Dove can find no rest, for the sole of her foote, till she returne into this Arke againe; for if my sin were only a foulenesse; it might be help'd with washing; or if only a stei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; it might bee help'd with purging; but seeing it is a totall and absolute corruption; now nothing can helpe it but a new Creation.</p>
            <p>But how should <hi>David</hi> come to be so foule? was it by conversing with <hi>Bathsheba?</hi> but what foulenesse could hee take from her, who came but then, newly out of her Bathe?

               <hi>Purge me with Hysope, and I shall be cleane; Create in me a cleane heart, O God;</hi> All for cleanenesse still; for hee knew, if hee could get cleanenesse, hee should have a Beauty which the Starres want: for the Starres are not cleane in Gods sight; he knew, that by having a cleane heart, he should not onely be fit for God to see; but fit to see God; as Christ said: <hi>Blessed are the cleane of heart, for they shall see God:</hi> and then, if to be seene of God, be the greatest glory; and to see God the greatest happinesse; O how glorious and happy, must a cleane heart needs be, that is made cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to enjoy them both!</p>
            <p>O therefore, <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me:</hi> for thou hast not so finished thy worke of creation; but that thou reteinest thy power of creating still: and wherein canst thou better imploy that power, than in creating of cleane hearts? It was a worke of infinite glory, to be the Creatour of Heaven and Earth; yet to bee the Creatour of cleane hearts; is of all thy workes of glory, the most glorious worke. And indeed, were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me, and more ease for God; to create in me a cleane heart, once for all; than to be so troubled, with continuall purgings and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as now he is? as now I am? for alas, O Lord! thou maist sooner purge my heart out of my body; than purge sinne out of my heart; but that it will alwaies, be returning to its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and I shall breake thy rest continually, with importuning thee to wash me.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:666:25"/>
But why doe I pray to God, for a cleane heart; and not as well for cleane eyes, and cleane hands; seeing these also, have there share in foulenesse, as well as that? But is it not, that these are but the Emissaries of the heart; and do all they do, by the hearts direction; that if the heart bee cleane, these also will bee cleane of course; mine eyes will be cleane; and never looke more, after any more <hi>Bathshebaes;</hi> my hands will be cleane; and never bee more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued in the blood of any <hi>Vrias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, did not God, create in me a cleane heart once already? &amp; yet how foule is it grown now? and what hope is there, if he create in me, a new cleane heart; but that it will grow as foule, as this I now have? But can it properly be said, that God did ever create in me, a cleane heart before? He made me one indeed, but he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me none; hee onely created Heaven and Earth: as it is said; <hi>In the Beginning, God created Heaven and Earth;</hi> and of that Earth, he made me a body; and in that body, a heart; so I had a made heart, before; but no created heart till now; for made, is of matter praeexistent; but created is of nothing: although therefore my made heart, being made of dust, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beene apt to gather dust; yet my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heart, as made of nothing; will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, from whence to gather foulenesse.

If thou wilt needs put a veile upon thy face, to keepe mine eyes from seeing thee; yet let it be, but as the veile upon <hi>Moses</hi> face; to keepe mine eyes from dazeling. It is potion bitter enough, to be deprived of thy presence, though done in never so faire a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but to be cast out of thy presence, as done in anger; what is this, but to give mee gall and wormewood to drinke? If I needes must die; let it be upon the top of <hi>Nebo;</hi> where I may see the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> before mee; for there, thy presence is to comfort me; but let it not be in the valley; where there is no representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy glorious presence, to give me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. My sinne, O God, I know is such, that may justly make mee to flie from thy presence; as it once made <hi>Adam.</hi> when hee hid himselfe from thee; yet in this case, I may hope thou wilt looke after mee; as thou didst then vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to looke after him: but if thou cast me our of thy presence; and that it be done, by thine
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:666:28"/>
owne hand; Alas, O Lord! what hope is there left mee, of ever comming into thy presence againe? As long as I am in thy presence, there is hope; I may intreat; and thou art apt to be intreated; I may fall downe and humble my selfe; and thou givest grace to the humble: but if it should once come to this, that I were cast out of thy presence; alas, O God! thou wouldst then be quite of sight; cleane out of hearing; that no intreaty could be heard; no humbling, be seene; either to give mee the comfort of hope; or to put me in hope of any comfort. If thou, O God, shouldst cast me off from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; whom could I hope, to have present with mee? The Angells would be my guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans no longer; for they would soone take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thy displeasure; and would never regard, whom thou rejectest. The Saints would be my Associates no longer: for if they found me not in thy presence; they would presently know, I were none of their society; and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion extends no further. And what compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then could I hope to have? <hi>Cain,</hi> perhaps, and <hi>Cham;</hi> the damned crew; miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters; or rather no comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs but augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my misery. But yet, O God; if my sins unexpressable, have made thee unexorable; and that thou wilt needs cast me off, from thy <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</note> presence; at least, <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from mee:</hi> For, what were this, but to put me out of thy service; and then to take away thy Livery too? Yet as long as I have thy Livery on; it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:666:28"/>
keepes me in credit; it gives me countenance; it leaves me hope, I may be entertained againe; as long as thy holy Spirit staies with me; I have one to comfort mee; one to put me in hope I may be received into favour againe; in no worse case, than <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler was; who in disgrace for a time, was afterward restored to his former place; but if thou take thy Livery from me; if thou take thy holy Spirit from me; Alas, O Lord! I am then utterly undone; none left to comfort me; none, to speake for mee: in as ill a case as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Baker; nothing left me to hope in, but a dreame; and that dreame, nothing but of white Baskets; out of which, the Birdes shall eate; but nothing that is good, for mee to taste. If thy holy Spirit, should of himselfe depart from me; it would be a parting, exceeding grievous unto me; but for thee, O God, to take him from me; where the manner of losing, is as much as the losse; what griefe can be spoken of, so unspeakable?</p>
            <p>But having said, <hi>Cast mee not off from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi> it may seeme superfluous to say; <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me;</hi> seeing, this of necessity followes upon that; for how can Gods holy Spirit be, but where hee is himselfe? and how can it tarry with mee, if I tarry not with him? They both indeed, grow upon one tree; yet are severall fruites; Gods presence brings with it, a passive influence; his holy Spirit an active; although therefore, O God; thou barre mee of thy presence, and leave me inglorious; yet take
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:666:29"/>
not away thy holy Spirit from me, to leave me prophane. Thy holy Spirit, is the sanctifier; and wilt thou leave me to impiety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse? Thy holy Spirit is the Directour; and wilt thou leave mee, without a Guide, in the most dangerous passages of this wicked world? Thy holy Spirit is the Comforter; and wilt thou leave mee Disconsolate, in my mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold miseries? If thou take thy holy Spirit from me; what spirit will be left mee, but a spirit of errour? a spirit of uncleannesse? a spirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire? and canst thou for pitty, leave me a prey, to such outragious spirits? O Lord, though my sinnes be as great as <hi>Cains;</hi> yet suffer mee not to despaire like <hi>Cain;</hi> though my sinnes be greater than <hi>Sauls;</hi> yet suffer me not to distrust thee like <hi>Saul;</hi> but, as it is a benefit; so let it be a pledge of thy presence; and of thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that I can pray unto thee for thy presence, and for the continuance of thy holy Spirit. When I remember, the sweet comforts, I have sometimes found in the motions of thy holy Spirit; and when I thinke of the joy, I have conceived of thy salvation; Oh, how my heart seemes to leape within me; and how am I ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, with extasies of delight? and now to thinke this comfort should be taken from me; this joy should be bereft mee: Oh, what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what death; what hell can be so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous!</p>
            <p>But how can God cast mee off from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, though hee would: Is not God, every
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:666:29"/>
where? and am not I somewhere? and must I not then, be needs where he is, and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? God indeed hath a presence of Being; and this is every where; and he hath a presence of Power; and this is every where; but he hath a presence of Grace and favour; and this is not every where. His presence of Power, is as well in the Ant, as in the Elephant; yet it maketh not the Ant an Elephant; and therefore, this is not the presence, that I desire: his presence of Being is as well in hell, as in heaven; yet it makes not the hell a heaven; and therefore, neither is this the presence that I desire; but his presence of grace and favour, is not as well in the wicked, as in the penitent; for if it were, it would make the wicked penitent; and therefore, this is the presence, which I so much long to keepe; which I so much feare to lose.</p>
            <p>But why should I feare, least God should cast me off from his presence? Is not his delight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the children of men? and am not I, one of that Generation? And why should I feare, lest hee should take his holy Spirit from mee? was it not hee, that gave it mee at first? and is he one, that will give a thing, and then take it away againe? Yet my sinnes make mee, that I cannot but feare; for why should hee not cast me out of his sight; who hath wrought so much wickednesse in his sight? why should he let his holy Spirit stay there, where it is so much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? for, what doe my grievous sinnes but grieve it? Oh vile sinne; of what cause thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:666:30"/>
art the effect; I know not; but this I know, thou art the cause of most vile effects; for thou onely art the cause, that God is like to cast me off from his presence; thou onely the cause, that God is like to take his holy Spirit from me; and seeing in Gods presence, there is fulnesse of joy for evermore; alas, in being cast out of his presence; what is left mee, but the fulnesse of misery for ever more!</p>
            <p>But seeing thou hast not cast me off from thy presence; but onely removed thy presence from me, because thy pure nature could not endure to stay in a polluted heart; yet now that I am new made; and that thou hast created a cleane heart within mee; Now thou maiest returne; and restore to me the comfort of thy presence; the joy of thy salvation; and by this, thou shalt shew thou didst not take it away, to keepe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but to make it more precious in restoring; thou shalt shew, thou didst not leave mee, to forsake mee; but to make thy selfe more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in returning. But though some things are of such condition, that we finde their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, more by wanting, than by enjoying; as sicknesse makes us more sensible of health; yet this needed not, in the comfort of thy presence, seeing of this there can be no satiety; and wee can never so well learne to desire thee by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee; as we are taught to embrace thee by enjoying thee.</p>
            <p>Although the fuites I make to thee, O God, be many; yet they are all so subordinate to one

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:666:31"/>
house top; desolate and disconsolate; which is more to mee, than for <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> to have no compauions but the beasts of the field: and yet, O Lord, onely <hi>Restore to mee the joy of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> and it shall be more to mee, than for <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> to be restored to his Sense; his Reason; his Kingdome againe. This joy is to mee, as <hi>Isaak</hi> was to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my life; and thou restored'st him to his Father in great compassion; and wilt thou have no compassion on me; and not restore my <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak</hi> to me againe? O mercifull God; take away my goods; take away my health; take away my life; but take not away this joy from mee, unlesse thou meane to restore it againe; for without this joy, my goods will doe mee no good; I shall be sicke of my health; I shall be weary of my life; all joy without this joy, is but shadow of joy; no solidnesse; no substance in it; other joyes I can want, and yet want no joy; but how can I want the joy of thy salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I must needes fall into the hell of my owne perdition?</p>
            <p>Indeed, all these graces, and specially these foure, A right Spirit, and Gods presence; his holy Spirit, and the joy of his salvation; are all, I may say, of a covey; like Partridges that alwaies keepe together: or if at any time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by violence; they never leave calling after one another, till they meet againe: and thus, a right Spirit calls after Gods presence; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, after his holy Spirit; his holy Spirit, after
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:666:31"/>
the joy of his salvation; and the joy of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, calls after them all. O then, <hi>Restore to me the joy of thy salvation:</hi> that this covey of thy Graces may be kept together; and that the mournefull voyce of calling after one another, may no more be heard, to disquiet my soule.</p>
            <p>But how can God restore that, which hee tooke not away? For, can I charge God, with the taking away the joy of his salvation from mee? O gracious God; I charge not thee with taking it; but my selfe, with losing it; and such is the miserable condition, of us poore wretches; that if thou shouldest restore no more to us, than what thou takest from us; wee should quickly be at a fault in our Estates; and our ruine would be as sudden, as inevitable.</p>
            <p>But why am I so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arenest for restoring? for what good will restoring doe mee, if I cannot keepe it, when I have it? and how shall I more keepe it, being restored; than I kept it before, being enjoyed? and if I so enjoy it, as still feare to lose it; what joy can there be in such enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? O therefore, Not restore it onely; but <hi>establish me with thy free Spirit:</hi> that as by thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing, <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>.</note> I may enjoy it entirely; so by thy esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing, I may enjoy it securely. Indeed, if thou shouldst only restore it; and then leave it for me to keepe; I should presently runne a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of losing it againe: but when thou restorest it; and then confirmest it; and that with the seale of thy free Spirit; this gives me an indefea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible estate; and absolutely frees me from feare
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:666:32"/>
of losing it any more for ever. Alas my soule! what qualmes have these beene? what floatings betweene feare and hope? all the comfort is; that as Hope sets out first, and gets the start of Feare, so it keepes the field last; and gets the goale from Feare; For, Hope set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what mysterie is it, that <hi>David</hi> intends here, by his triplicity of Spirits? A right Spirit; a holy Spirit, a free and principall Spirit? Are they not all one holy Ghost; but divers opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? called therefore, the right Spirit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it directeth us: the holy Spirit; because it sanctifieth us; the free and principall Spirit; because it governes us? And thus understood; wee may see, from whence the Collect in our Liturgie was gathered; which saith: <hi>Direct, Sanctifie, and governe us in the waies of thy Lawes; and in the workes of thy Commandements.</hi> Or is it, that hee makes three sutes for three spirits; as intending to every person, in the Deity, one? intimating the second person, by the right spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as being the way and the truth; the third
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:666:32"/>
person; by the holy Spirit; as being the Author of sanctification; the first person; by the free and principall Spirit; it being Hee, that must say, <hi>Fiat,</hi> to all that is done? And thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, we may see from whence is framed, that Versicle in our Letanie, which saith: <hi>O Holy, Blessed, and glorious Trinity; three Persons, and one God; have mercy upon us miserable sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now is <hi>David Monte potitus:</hi> gotten up, I may say, to the toppe of Mount <hi>Gerizim;</hi> after many wearisome and painefull steps. Hee was indeed so oppressed with the burden; and so fettered with the chaine of his sinnes; that he seemed as a man distracted; not knowing in the world what course to take: yet not willing to be wanting to himselfe; he tries all the waies; and useth all the meanes hee can possibly devise or thinke of. First, he prayes God, to wash him from his sinnes; and lest washing should not be sufficient; hee praies next, to be purged from his sinnes; but not trusting to these outward meanes; he thinkes upon a new course; and praies, to have his sinnes blotted out; as much as to have Gods Debt-booke cross'd; yet not satisfied with this neither; he then flies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes; and praies, not onely to have a cleane heart created; but a right Spirit renued in him; that so he may be <hi>Purus corpore &amp; spiritu:</hi> and now one would thinke, he were certainely past all danger: yet even here he falls into the most dismall frights, that ever seized upon a perplexed soule; for he feares, least God should
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:666:33"/>
cast him off from his Presence; and lest hee should take his holy Spirit from him: most dismall frights indeed; yet recovering his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, he bethinkes himselfe at last, of a way; that either will serue to make him a free-man; or he must never looke to be: and that is, to bee established with Gods free Spirit; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed strikes the stroke; and therefore this hee makes his <hi>Murus Aheneus;</hi> for being now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with Gods free Spirit; he findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so free; that he thinkes himselfe, able to set up a Free-schoole; and is confident to say; <hi>Then will I teach thy waies to the wicked; and sinners</hi>

            <p>But am I a fit man, to teach thy waies to the wicked; who have walked, all my life long, in the waies of wickednesse? Am I likely to be a meanes for converting of sinners; who have hitherto beene occasion of perverting the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Thou, O God, that tookest <hi>Amos</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heard-men of <hi>tekoa,</hi> to make him a Prophet; thou also canst take me from among the wicked of the world, to make me, a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sinners. I take not upon me, to teach the godly, who may better teach me; I teach onely the wicked; None but sinners, are for my Schoole; I am not a Shepheard to tend the fold; but to fetch in, strayers: The title of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is <hi>Dux conversorum;</hi> A guide of converts; all my Doctrine, is onely Repentance; and if any such be, that need no repenting; they need not my teaching; nor belong to my Schoole. But if any man, thinke repentance, a lesson so easie, that he can take it out, and learne it, without a teacher; let him but heare the lesson read, which I have learned, and he must; if he will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert. Let him see my eyes swolne, with the floods of my teares; and so must his be: Let him see me lie groveling under sackcloth and ashes; and so must hee doe: Let him see my knees
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:666:34"/>
brawned with kneeling at Prayer; and so must his be: Let him see mee goe fasting with bread and water; and so must hee doe: Let him see my backe goared with stripes of contrition; and so must his be: Let him see my breast torne, with sighings and groanings; and so must he doe; and if all this be not enough, to make a hard lesson; let him see my heart broken, and shivered with sorrow; and so must his be. And now let flesh and blood tell me, if this be a lesson to be learned without a teacher?</p>
            <p>But if Repentance be so hard a lesson to learne; how can <hi>David</hi> be so confident of his teaching, to say, that sinners shall be converted by it? Indeed, when Kings become Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters, no marvell, if sinners become converts: For, who knowes not the force of <hi>Regis ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum?</hi> But is <hi>David</hi> then the only Phoenix in this kinde?

But what neede <hi>David</hi> pray God, to deliver him from blood-guiltinesse? For what blood had hee shed? much, no doubt, in warre; but, that was lawfull; and left no guiltinesse; and therefore needed no deliverance. But what blood did hee shed unlawfully? No more did <hi>Ahab:</hi> No more did <hi>Iezabel;</hi> yet as guilty of blood, as if they had shed it. When Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates command a thing to be done; they doe it: When a malicious person, imprecates a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to be wrought; hee workes it: When a man plots a villany to be acted; he acts it; and in all these waies, though <hi>David</hi> actually shed no blood; yet he was as guilty of blood, as if he had shed it. <hi>Peralium</hi> here, is as much as <hi>Perse;</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi> knew hee had cause enough to say; <hi>Deliver me from blood guiltinesse, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there any hope, that this sin of blood, may ever be remitted? seeing God hath spoken it peremptorily; he that <hi>sheddeth mans blood; by man, shall his blood be shed;</hi> and can I looke, that God will breake his Word, to doe me a pleasure? But is it not that Gods threatning, is ever with condition? For, was it not so in <hi>Ninive?

No doubt, Repentance too; but with ths Codicill annexed: <hi>His blood shall be shed, unlesse hee can finde some other, that will shed his blood for him.</hi> And alas! if this be the condition, What am I the neere? For, where can I finde out any, that will shed his blood for me? and if I could finde one willing; where can I find one able? An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; and yet a man may live; but blood for blood, and who can live, unlesse he be a God? An Angell cannot doe it; for hee hath no blood to shed. A man cannot doe it; for he cannot lay downe his life, and take it up againe; Thou onely canst doe it, who art both God and man; Thou God of my salvation; for thou art the Lamb that was slaine; and is alive; and I know, that my Redeemer liveth.

            <p>But why should <hi>David</hi> pray to be delivered from bloods; as the words indeede are? For seeing he shed but the blood of <hi>Vriah</hi> only; the singular number might well enough have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Is it, that the plotting of <hi>Vriahs</hi> death, drew with it the deaths of many others? and so, just cause of praying to be delivered from bloods?

               <hi>Vriah;</hi> made his blood, as so many severall bloods, in Gods account?

            <p>And now wee may conceive, a match, as it

were, to be tryed here, betweene Blood and Repentance; which of them shall cry loudest, and be soonest heard of God; Blood cries for vengeance; and God is the God of vengeance. Repentance cries for mercy; and God is the God of mercy; and so they seeme both, upon equall termes yet: but if wee mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the order of Gods Titles; wee shall finde his Mercy to take place of his Justice: <hi>Misericordia superex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altat judicium;</hi> and therefore Repentance which cries for Mercy; shall be heard before Blood, which cries for Justice. But if Repentance cannot get it with crying; shee will at least with singing; for shee never sung till now; and now shee sings; <hi>My tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteousnesse;</hi> where, Blood onely cries, but cannot sing: and seeing singing makes better musicke in Gods eares than crying; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance shall be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But how loud will the singing be, when not onely Repentance sings; but Joy also, which is a loud singer, shall joyne in consort, and sing with her? and if ever Joy sung, it will sing now: For what geater joy; than for a bond-man to be set at liberty? For a man condemned for blood, to be delivered from blood? and if no joy can be greater than this; then certainly no singing can be louder than that. But what this song is that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Ioy joyne in consort to sing; seeing the <hi>sweet singer of Israel,</hi> hath not vouchsafed to deliver himselfe: It is not for any man now
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:666:37"/>
living, to deliver it: onely wee may conceive, that Repentances part, is <hi>Deprofundis;</hi> and that Ioyes part, is <hi>In excelsis;</hi> Repentance sings the <hi>Hosanna;</hi> and Ioy, the <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may we not wonder at <hi>David;</hi> how hee dares speake thus to God: <hi>Deliver mee from blood; and my tongue shall sing of thy Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</hi> as though he thought, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a wilfull murther; and then have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, for a song? and what should his song be of? of Gods Righteousnesse. But what Righteousnesse is in this; to suffer a righteous person to be murthered; and then to set the murtherer free? As much righteousnesse as this, we may finde in a Iew; who cryed, <hi>Crucifie Christ;</hi> and <hi>Deliver Barbas.</hi> But, O my soule, forbeare such thoughts; or rather, tremble at such blasphemies: Remember first, that this song is not for getting of pardon; but for giving of thankes; and what thankes so acceptable, as that which is cheerefully spoken; and what spoken so cheerefully, as that which is sung? And then consider, what Gods Righeousnesse is: Hee saith himselfe; <hi>His waies are not, as our waies;</hi> and may not wee as well say; his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is not as our righteousnesse? Our righteousnesse is blood for blood; but Gods Righteousnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> may be a song for a murther. But then consider withall, what this song is; and how hard a thing it is, to sing of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; the Angels have enough to doe to sing it; it is their <hi>Allelujah:</hi> and seeing the

singing this <hi>Allelujah,</hi> is the chiefest service of an Angell; what deserves he lesse than an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels place, that can sing of Gods Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? And that we may see, how transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a matter it is, to doe it; Behold <hi>David</hi> here, a man farre abler than any of us; yet finds himselfe not able, so much as to open his lips towards it; but is faine to call to God for help: <hi>O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew</hi>

               <hi>offer to God, for all his loving kindnesses hee hath</hi>

               <hi>shewed mee;</hi> and I thought upon <hi>sacrifices;</hi> for they have sometimes beene pleasing to him; and he hath oftentimes smelt, a sweete odour from them; but I considered, that sacrifices were but shadowes of things to come; and are not now, in that grace they have beene; for <hi>old things are past; and new are now come;</hi> the shadowes are gone; the substances are come in place; the Bullockes that are to be sacrificed now, are our hearts; it were easier for me, to give him Bullockes for sacrifice, than to give him my heart: but why should I offer him that hee cares not for? my heart, I know, hee cares fore; and if it be broken and offered up by Penitence and Contrition; it is the only sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that now hee delights in.</p>
            <p>But can wee thinke God to be so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; that he will accept of a broken heart? Is a thing that is broken, good for any thing? Can we drinke in a broken Glasse? Or, can we leane upon a broken staffe? But though other things may be the worse for breaking,; yet a heart is never at the best, till it be broken: For, till it be broken, wee cannot see what is in it, till it be broken, it cannot send forth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s sweetest odour: and therefore, though God love a whole heart in affection; yet hee loves a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart in sacrifice. And no marvell, indeed; seeing it is even hee himselfe that breakes it: for, as nothing but the blood can breake the Adamant; so nothing, but the blood of our scape-goate Christ Iesus, is able to breake our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:666:39"/>
Adamantine hearts. Accept therefore, O God, my broken heart, which I offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thee, with a whole heart; seeing, thou canst neither except against it, for being whole; which is broken in sacrifice: nor except against it, for being broken; which is whole in affection.</p>
            <p>But is not this to make God a cruell God; to make him delight, in broken hearts; as though hee tooke no joy, but in our sorrowing? No pleasure, but in our tormenting? It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede; God delights to be mercifull; but yet hee delights not to be mercifull unjustly: and justly hee cannot be mercifull, but where hee findes Repentance: and seeing Repentance can never be without sorrowing; and such sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as even breakes the heart with sorrow; this makes the broken heart a pleasing sacrifice to God; because, as a just mans Prayer ties up his hand, as it were, from doing of justice: so a sinners Repentance, sets him at liberty, for shewing of mercy.</p>
            <p>And now, that I have prayed, and offered sacrifice for my selfe; shall I forget my Mother <hi>Sion?</hi> For, is not <hi>Sion,</hi> the common <hi>Mother of us all?</hi> Shall I forget the glorious City <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> whereof I am a member; and a Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now, that we have heard the penitent <hi>David,</hi> make his confession; and say his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: seene him, make his Oblations, and offer his Sacrifices to God: It may not be unfit, to draw an observation or two; from the manner of his Leiturgie: and first, that this whole Psalme hath in it, thorowout; <hi>Bimembres sententias;</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, consisting of two parts: whereof the later, is ever an augmentation of the former; as when he saith; <hi>Wash me from mine iniquity:</hi> It followes, <hi>and cleanse mee from my sinnes;</hi> which is more than washing; and so an augmentation. When he saith; <hi>I know mine iniquity;</hi> it followes, <hi>and my sinne is ever before me;</hi> which is more than knowing his sinne; and so, an augmentation. When he saith; <hi>Against thee onely I have sinned;</hi> it followes; <hi>I have done this evill in thy sight;</hi> which is more than sinning against him; and so an augmentation. When he saith, <hi>I was borne in iniquity;</hi> it followes; <hi>and in sinne hath my mother conceived mee;</hi> which is more than to be borne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:666:41"/>
in sinne; and so still an augmentation: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in all the rest, if we run them over; which shewes the great hast that <hi>David</hi> makes in his journey of Repentance; and therefore takes two paces at one stride; and climbes, as it were, two staires at one step.</p>
            <p>A second observation may be; that almost all the Psalme thorow, but most apparently in the middle verses. One deprecates the evill; and the next following obsecrates the good: One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth a detestation of his sinnes; and the next following, an application of Gods Mercies; like a Gardiner, that with one hand, pluckes up weeds; and with the other, plants sweet flowers. For, in saying, <hi>Purge mee from my sinnes;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates the evill; and pluckes up weeds: and in the next following; <hi>Make mee to heare of joy and gladnesse;</hi> hee obsecrates the good; and plants sweet flowers. In saying, <hi>Turne away thy face from my sinnes;</hi> he deprecates the evill; and pluckes up weedes: and in the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Create in mee a cleane heart;</hi> he obsecrates the good; and plants sweet flowers.

And by this, he seemes, as it were, to besiege God round with his Petitions; and to hold him fast with both hands as <hi>Iaakob</hi> did the Angel: that he may leave him no way to escape; and be sure not to let him goe without a blessing.</p>

Another observation, may be this; that in all this Psalme, <hi>David</hi> arrogateth nothing to himselfe, but sinne and misery; lying wholly at Gods Mercy, for the remission of his sinnes; and so farre from any ability to satisfie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; that hee acknowledgeth in himselfe an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter disability, but to speake a good word; or but to thinke a good thought: and indeed, we may truely say; that all the spirits in the Arteries; all the blood in the vaines of this Psalme; are but blasts, and drops of the Antheame in Christs Prayer: <hi>For Thine is the Kingdome; the Power; and the Glory, for Ever and Ever, Amen.</hi>
