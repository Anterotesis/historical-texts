            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU would have needed no <hi>pardon</hi> for <hi>taking the same Liberty,</hi> with me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 1.</note> that I took <hi>with the Author of the Letter concerning Toleration.</hi> But I fear it will be found, that instead of <hi>considering</hi> my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endeavouring to shew</hi> me <hi>the Mistakes of them,</hi> you have taken another sort of <hi>Liberty</hi> which does need <hi>pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are pleas'd to tell me here in the beginning, that I have <hi>plainly yielded up the Question</hi> to that Author,<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</note> by <hi>owning that the Severities he would disswade Christians from, are utterly unapt and improper to bring Men to embrace that Truth which must save them:</hi> As if those <hi>Severities</hi> which I condemn, <hi>viz. Prosecuting Men with Fire and Sword, depriving them of their Estates, maiming them with corporal Punishments, starving and tormenting them in noisome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, taking away their Lives to make them Christians, &amp;c.</hi> were <hi>all</hi> that our Author would <hi>disswade Christians from:</hi> Whereas you your self own,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> that <hi>the purpose of his Letter is plainly to depend Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43698:4"/>
exempt from all Force,</hi> from all sorts and degrees of Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoever, even the lowest and most moderate that can be assigned. But it is well if this prove to be the greatest instance of the <hi>Liberty</hi> you have taken with me.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 1.</note>Whether you, or I have <hi>more carefully and impartially weigh'd the whole matter</hi> in controversy between us: Whether I do <hi>yet favour some Remains of Persecution,</hi> or not: and, Whether what appears to you <hi>so very clear and evident,</hi> be the <hi>Truth,</hi> or not: Of these things, Sir, we must leave others to judge. But whether it would be <hi>reasonable and just</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> or <hi>me, were either of us in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to use any Force upon the other, upon any pretence of want of Examination</hi> of our present Controversy, is no part of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For no Man, I suppose, will pretend that every private Person is bound to examine this Controversy. And therefore how <hi>unreasonable and unjust</hi> soever it might be, for either of us to <hi>use Force upon the other,</hi> to make him <hi>examine</hi> this Controversy, it may still be true nevertheless, that Authority may <hi>reasonably and justly</hi> use some degrees of <hi>Force,</hi> where it is needful, to bring Men to consider and <hi>examine</hi> those, Controversies which they are <hi>bound</hi> to consider and examine; <hi>i. e.</hi> those, wherein they cannot err, without dishonouring God, and endangering their own and other Men's eternal Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>The first thing,</hi> you say, that I <hi>seem startled at in the Author's Letter, is the largeness of the Toleration he proposes.</hi> For he claims it,<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> as I observ'd, not onely for <hi>Christians, in their different Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion,</hi> but likewise for <hi>Iews, Mahumetans, and Pagans</hi>; who, he saith, <hi>ought not to be excluded from the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, because of their Religion.</hi> Now to let me see that I ought not to <hi>think this strange,</hi> you put me in mind that <hi>we pray every day for their Conversion</hi>; and you say you <hi>think it our Duty so to do.</hi> And so far I agree with you. But you say further, that you <hi>fear it will hardly be believed that we pray in earnest, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the other ordinary and probable means of Conversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iving them from, or persecuting them when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</hi> So that <hi>excluding them from the Civil Rights of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> is, in your opinion, <hi>driving them from, or persecuting them when they are amongst us.</hi> Now I confess I thought Men might live quietly enough among us, and enjoy the protection of the Government against all violence and injuries, without being <hi>endenizon'd,</hi> or made Members of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>; which alone can entitle them to the <hi>Civil Rights</hi> and Privileges of it. But
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43698:4"/>
as to <hi>Iews, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> if any of them do not care to live among us, unless they may be admitted to the <hi>Rights</hi> and Privileges <hi>of the Commonwealth</hi>; the refusing them that favour, is not, I suppose, to be look'd upon as <hi>driving them from us,</hi> or <hi>excluding them from the ordinary and probable means of Conversion</hi>; but as a just and necessary Caution in a Christian Commonwealth, in respect to the Members of it: Who, if such as prosess <hi>Iudaism,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetanism,</hi> or <hi>Paganism,</hi> were permitted to enjoy the same Rights with them, would be much the more in danger to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them; seeing they would lose no worldly advantage by such a change of their Religion: Whereas if they could not turn to any of those Religions, without forfeiting the <hi>Civil Rights of the Commonwealth</hi> by doing it; 'tis likely they would consider well, before they did it, what ground there was to expect that they should get any thing by the exchange, which would countervail the loss they should sustain by it. And whether this be not a reasonable and necessary Caution, any Man may judge, who does but consider, within how few Ages after the Floud Superstition and Idolatry prevail'd over the World; and how apt even God's own peculiar People were to receive that mortal Infection, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that he did to keep them from it.</p>
            <p>If therefore a just care of the Flock of Christ, requires us to <hi>exclude Iews, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the <hi>Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, because of their Religion</hi>; 'tis plain, we may <hi>pray in earnest for their Conversion,</hi> though we so <hi>exclude them</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though we are bound to <hi>desire</hi> their Conversion, and so to <hi>pray</hi> for it; yet we are bound to <hi>seek</hi> it, no further than we can do it, without endangering the Subjects of Christ's Kingdom, to whom he has a special regard.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But as to <hi>Pagans</hi> particularly, I confess I am so far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Author, that they <hi>ought not to be excluded from the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, because of their Religion,</hi> that I cannot see how their <hi>Religion</hi> can be suffer'd by any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that knows and worships the onely true God, if it would be thought to retain any jealousy for his honour, or even for that of Humane Nature. For how early or generally soever their Idolatries obtain'd in the World, through that blindness which Vice brings upon the Minds of men; and how deep rooting soever they have taken in it: yet as they are the greatest Dishonour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to God Almighty, and to Humane Nature it self; so they are utterly incapable of any manner of <hi>excuse</hi> or extenuation;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note>

being contrary to the natural Sense and Apprehensions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isai.</hi> 44.18, 19, 20. and 46.8.</note> as God himself, in the Prophet, plainly intimates. For which reason at least, I think I might well be <hi>startled</hi> at the <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our Author's Toleration. For whereas you say, you <hi>do not see why Pagans should not be tolerated as well as others, if we wish their Conversion</hi>; whatever may be said for the tolerating of <hi>others,</hi> I think it is plain enough as to <hi>them,</hi> that we ought not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the opportunity of <hi>conventing</hi> them, by suffering them to commit those Indignities and Abominations among us, which they call Religion, till they are <hi>converted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>converting Iews, Mahumetans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, I fear there will be no great progress made in it, till Christians come to a better agreement and union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 17.20, 21.</note> I am sure our Saviour pray'd that all that should <hi>believe in him, might be one in the Father and in him</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> I suppose, in that holy Religion which he taught them from the Father) <hi>that the World might believe that the Father had sent him.</hi> And therefore when he comes to make inquisition, why no more <hi>Iews, Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> have been converted to his Religion, I very much fear that a great part of the blame will be found to lie upon the Authors and Promoters of Sects and Divisions among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it: Which therefore I think all that are guilty, and all that would not be guilty, ought well to consider.</p>
            <p>In what sense I allow, that <hi>Force is improper to convert Men to any Religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> has already been sufficiently declared in my <hi>Answer</hi>; and I shall have occasion to speak more of it afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note>Where I say that <hi>some seem to place the advancement of Trade and Commerce above all other Considerations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note> you tell me that if I do not <hi>know that the Author places the advancement of Trade above Religion,</hi> my Insinuation <hi>is very uncharitable.</hi> But I thought I had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prevented such an interpretation of my words, by acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting the Author but just before, of any ill <hi>design</hi> towards Religion. That there are some Men in the World, who are justly suspected of the Crime I mention, I believe you will not deny.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43698:5"/>
does that appear? Why, you say the Christian Religion was then <hi>better preserv'd, more widely propagated (in proportion) and render'd more fruitful in the lives of its Professors, than ever since; though then Iews and Pagans were tolerated, and more than tolerated, by the Governments of those places where it grew up.</hi> And is this your <hi>Experiment</hi> of the true Religion's being a <hi>gainer by Toleration?</hi> The Christian Religion prosper'd more, you say, in those times than ever since, <hi>though then Iews and Pagans were tolerated, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> it was a <hi>gainer by the Toleration of Iews and Pagans.</hi> Is there any manner of Consequence in this? That the Christian Religion prosper'd more in those times, than ever since, <hi>though</hi> then <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> were tolerated, I readily grant you. But whoever does but understand what <hi>though</hi> means, must needs see that this is so far from proving what you inferr from it, that it strongly proves the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Toleration of Jews and Pagans was rather an <hi>hindrance</hi> than an <hi>advantage</hi> to the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>But let us see the utmost you can make of this <hi>Experiment</hi> of yours.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 3.</note> You say you hope I do not <hi>imagine the Christian Religion has lost any of its first Beauty, Force, or Reasonableness, by having been almost</hi> 2000 <hi>Years in the World; that</hi> I should <hi>fear it should be less able now to shift for it self, without the help of Force.</hi> And you doubt not but I <hi>look upon it still to be the Power and Wisdom of God for our Salvation; and therefore cannot suspect it less capable to prevail now, by its own Truth and Light, than it was in the first Ages of the Church, when poor contemptible Men, without Authority, or the countenance of Authority, had alone the care of it.</hi> In which words I understand you to say these three things; 1. That the Christian Religion prevail'd at first meerly by its own <hi>Beauty, Force, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness, without the help of Authority, or Force.</hi> 2. That that Religion has still the same <hi>Beauty, Force, or Reasonableness</hi> which it had at first. 3. Lastly, that therefore it is now <hi>as well able to shift for it self,</hi> and to <hi>prevail, without any assistance of Authority,</hi> as it was then. Now to clear this matter, I must observe, that in the <hi>Beauty, Force, or Reasonableness,</hi> by which you say the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion prevail'd at first, without the Assistance of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either you include the <hi>Miracles</hi> done by the <hi>poor contemptible men</hi> you speak of, to make their Religion <hi>prevail,</hi> or you do not.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43698:6"/>
had, <hi>separate</hi> from those Miracles: Which I believe you will not undertake to defend. But if you do include the Miracles; then your second Assertion is manifestly false: For I am sure you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say that the Christian Religion is still accompanied with <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as it was at its first planting: And so the Conclusion you draw from thence, That <hi>therefore the Christian Religion is now as well able to shift for it self, and to prevail, without any Assistance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as it was at first,</hi> falls to the ground.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 3.</note>You add, <hi>This, as I take it, has been made use of by Christians generally, and by some of our Church in particular, as an Argument for the Truth of the Christian Religion, that it grew and spread, and prevail'd, without any Aid from Force, or the Assistance of the Powers in being.</hi> Wherein I hope you are mistaken: for I am sure this is a very bad <hi>Argument.</hi> That the Christian Religion, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the nature of it as well to Flesh and Bloud, as to the Powers of Darkness, should <hi>prevail</hi> as it did; and that not onely <hi>without any Assistance</hi> from <hi>Authority,</hi> but even in spight of all the opposition which <hi>Authority</hi> and a wicked World, join'd with those infernal Powers, could make against it; This, I acknowledge, has deservedly been insisted upon by Christians, as a very good Proof of the Truth of their Religion. But to argue the Truth of the Christian Religion, from its meer <hi>prevailing</hi> in the World, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Aid from Force, or the Assistance of the Powers in being;</hi> as if whatever Religion should so <hi>prevail,</hi> must needs be the <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> (whatever may be intended) is really, not to defend the Christian Religion, but to betray it. For neither does the true Religion always <hi>prevail, without the Assistance of the Powers in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; nor is that always the <hi>true Religion,</hi> which does so <hi>spread</hi> and <hi>prevail:</hi> As I doubt not but you will acknowledge with me, when you have but consider'd, within how few Generations after the Floud, the Worship of False Gods prevail'd against the Religion which <hi>Noah</hi> profess'd, and taught his Children (which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the true Religion) almost to the utter exclusion of it (though that at first was the onely Religion in the World) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Aid from Force,</hi> or the <hi>Assistance of the Powers in being,</hi> for any thing we find in the History of those Times, and as we may reasonably believe, considering that it found an entrance into the World, and entertainment in it, when it could have no such <hi>Aid,</hi> or <hi>Assistance.</hi> Of which (besides the Corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) I suppose there can no other Cause be assigned, or none more probable than this, that the <hi>Powers</hi> then <hi>in being,</hi> did not do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43698:6"/>
what they might and ought to have done, towards the preventing, or checking that horrible Apostasy.</p>

               <hi>And if it be a mark of the true Religion, that it will prevail by its own Light and Strength; (but that false Religions will not, but have need of Force and foreign Helps to support them) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly can be more for the advantage of true Religion, than to take away Compulsion every where.</hi> But if this be not <hi>a mark of the true Religion</hi> (as you have not proved it to be;) then what you conclude here, may not be true. That the true Religion has always <hi>Light and Strength</hi> of its <hi>own,</hi> sufficient to prevail with all that consider it seriously, and without Prejudice, I readily grant. But if, when you make it <hi>a mark of the true Religion,</hi> that it will <hi>prevail by its own Light and Strength,</hi> you mean (as it is plain you must) that it will always prevail in the World against other Religions, <hi>meerly</hi> by its own Light and Strength, without the Assistance either of <hi>Miracles,</hi> or of <hi>Authority;</hi> then I must tell you, that <hi>prevailing by its own Light and Strength,</hi> is so far from being a <hi>mark of the true Religion,</hi> that it is not <hi>true,</hi> that the <hi>true Religion</hi> will <hi>so prevail</hi> by its own <hi>Light and Strength.</hi> The Instance but now given, is too great a proof of this. For if you admit that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Religion was the <hi>true Religion,</hi> you must admit like wise that it had <hi>Light and Strength</hi> enough to <hi>prevail</hi> with all that should but fairly consider it. And yet, however, we find that it was so far from prevailing against false Religions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>foreign Help,</hi> that though at first it had quiet possession of the World, without any false Religion to contest its Title; yet it did not long maintain its advantage, but notwithstanding all its <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> was within a few Generations, almost extinguish'd and lost out of the World: Idolatry prevailing against it, not by its own <hi>Light and Strength,</hi> you may be sure, (for it could have nothing of either;) nor yet by the <hi>help of Force,</hi> as has already been shew'd; but meerly by the advantage which it had in the Corruption and Pravity of Humane Nature, left (as it is most reasonable to suppose) to it self, unbridled by <hi>Authority.</hi> For to the corrupt Nature of Man, false Religions are ever more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the true. For whatever Hardships some false Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may impose; it will however always be easier to carnal and wordly-minded men, to give even <hi>their first-born for their Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> than to mortify the Lusts from which they spring: which no Religion but the true, requires of them. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, though there is nothing more certain than that false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43698:7"/>
will never prevail <hi>by their own Light and Strength;</hi> yet it seems contrary to Reason (as well as to Experience) to say that they always <hi>have need of Force and foreign Helps to support them.</hi> On the contrary, I see no reason to doubt, but the meer Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of false Religions to Flesh and Bloud, may very well <hi>support</hi> them, without <hi>foreign Helps;</hi> whilest the true Religion may stand in need of them, not for any defects of its own, but by reason of the Folly, Perversness, and Wickedness of Men. If therefore it be no <hi>mark of the true Religion, that it will prevail by its own Light and Strength, but that false Religions will not, but have need of Force and foreign Helps to support them</hi> (as you have not proved it is, and I think I have proved it is far from being so;) then it does not yet appear, that <hi>nothing can be more for the advantage of the true Religion, than to take away Compulsion every where.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43698:7"/>
then it would be tolerated in <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, &amp;c.</hi> where now it is not: Yet I think it is manifest enough that it does not follow from thence, that in <hi>England,</hi> or wherever else the true Religion is Nationally received, it would reap any advantage by having its present Establishment taken away, and our <hi>Author</hi>'s, <hi>i. e.</hi> an <hi>universal Toleration</hi> of Religions <hi>set up</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of it.</p>
            <p>But I suppose your meaning is, that if all the World would agree to such a Toleration; though then the true Religion would lose by it in those few places where it is now establish'd as the National Religion; yet upon the whole matter, it would be a <hi>gainer</hi> by the bargain; because then it would stand upon even terms with all other Religions, in so many more places, where now it is either not at all suffer'd, or at least under great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>If this be the thing you aim at: then, 1. I suppose you do not hope you shall perswade the whole World to consent in your To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, or that you shall prevail with Pagans, Mahumetans, and Papists every where to allow true and sound Religion the same terms with their own, (supposing you could prevail with those of that Religion, to do this to them.) And if that Religion alone should tolerate all other Religions, whilest it self is tolerated by none; I think it is not easy to conceive how it would be a <hi>gainer</hi> by so doing. But, 2. Supposing your Toleration were <hi>set up</hi> all the World over: Even in that case, it is so far from being proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the true Religion would be any way advantaged by it, that on the contrary I think there is great reason to fear, that, without God's extraordinary Providence, it would in a much shorter time than any one that does not well consider the matter would imagine, be most effectually extirpated by it throughout the World: Considering (what has already been observ'd) that even when the true Religion was the onely Religion in the World, it did not long continue so, but the depraved Nature of Man soon found out other Religions, more agreeable to it self, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail'd, and overspread the World.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Inquisition, Dragooning,</hi> or any other such <hi>Severities,</hi> which are any where used, to <hi>keep or force men to the National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> I suppose I need not put you in mind that I condemn them as much as you do.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43698:8"/>
it is, lies at the bottom; And you build all you say upon this lurking Supposition, that the National Religion now in</hi> England, <hi>back'd by the Publick Authority of the Law, is the onely true Religion, and therefore no other is to be tolerated.</hi> How <hi>useful to Truth,</hi> or <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangeous to true Religion</hi> I think Toleration would be <hi>in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> or <hi>all the World over,</hi> I suppose I have by this time suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared.

If you will take my word for it, I assure you I think there are many other Countries in the World, where (whatever their <hi>Air</hi> be) your <hi>Toleration</hi> would be as little <hi>useful to Truth,</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi> For notwithstanding the <hi>lurking Supposition</hi> you speak of, I am far enough from thinking that the true Religion is confined to this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or this <hi>Island.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to my <hi>supposing</hi> that the <hi>National Religion now in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>back'd by the Publick Authority of the Law,</hi> is the <hi>onely true Religion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. <hi>p.</hi> 9.23, 24.</note> if you own, with our Author, that there is but <hi>one</hi> true Religion, I cannot see how you your self can avoid <hi>supposing</hi> the same.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 35.</note> For you own your self of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and consequently you own the <hi>National Religion now in</hi> England, to be <hi>the true Religion;</hi> for that is her Religion. And therefore if you believe there is but <hi>one</hi> true Religion; there is no help for it, but you must suppose, with me, that the <hi>National Religion now in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>back'd with the Publick Authority of the Law, is the onely true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all the <hi>lurking Supposition</hi> you speak of. For you suspect me likewise to <hi>suppose,</hi> that <hi>no other Religion is to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi> By which if you mean, that as this onely true Religion ought to be received wherever it is preach'd; so, where-ever it is receiv'd, I <hi>suppose</hi> all other Religions ought to be discouraged in some measure, by the Civil Powers; I own that I do <hi>suppose</hi> it: And I think I have shewn good reason why.</p>
            <p>But you go on, and (speaking of this <hi>lurking Supposition,</hi> That <hi>the National Religion now in</hi> England, <hi>is the onely true Religion, and therefore no other is to be tolerated</hi>) you say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Which being a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition equally unavoidable, and equally just in other Countries</hi> (<hi>unless we can imagine that every where but in</hi> England <hi>men believe what at the same time they think to be a Lie</hi>) <hi>will in other places exclude Toleration, and thereby hinder Truth from the means of propagating it self.</hi> How, Sir?

If so, then I fear it will be equally <hi>true</hi> too, and equally <hi>rational.</hi> For otherwise I see not how it can be either <hi>equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,</hi> or <hi>equally just:</hi> For if it be not equally <hi>true,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cannot be <hi>equally just;</hi> and if it be not equally <hi>rational,</hi> it cannot be <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unavoidable.</hi> But if it be <hi>equally true,</hi> and <hi>equally rational;</hi> then either <hi>all</hi> Religions are true, or <hi>none</hi> is true: For if they be all <hi>equally</hi> true, and any one of them be <hi>not</hi> true; then <hi>none</hi> of them can be true. And then the least that will follow is, that we must <hi>unsuppose</hi> again, what we <hi>supposed</hi> but now, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Religion now establish'd in <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>onely true Religion.</hi> For whether we admit that <hi>all</hi> Religions are true, or that <hi>none</hi> is true; we must unavoidably admit that there is no <hi>onely true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> And if there be no onely true Religion; then neither the Religion now establish'd in <hi>England,</hi> nor any other can be the <hi>onely true Religion.</hi> There is therefore no remedy, but you must either recall this Assection of yours, or own these Consequences which flow from it.</p>
            <p>But I hope, when you have thought a little more of the matter, you will be so far from asserting that the Supposition, <hi>that the National Religion is the onely true Religion,</hi> is in all Countries <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unavoidable, and equally just,</hi> that you will acknowledge that it cannot be <hi>at all unavoidable,</hi> or <hi>just,</hi> where any false Religion is the National Religion. Otherwise, you will be forced to own that men may be bound to embrace false Religions. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Religion any man does <hi>unavoidably,</hi> and <hi>justly suppose,</hi> or judge, to be <hi>the onely true Religion,</hi> that Religion he must needs be bound to embrace: because he has all the reason to embrace it, which any man can have for embracing any Religion whatsoever; and he can no more reasonably reject it, than any other man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the onely true Religion.</p>
            <p>Now if this <hi>Supposition,</hi> that <hi>the National is the onely true Religion,</hi> be indeed neither <hi>equally unavoidable,</hi> nor <hi>equally just</hi> in <hi>other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> as it is where the True is the National Religion; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Supposition, that therefore <hi>no other Religion is to be tolerated,</hi> be either <hi>equally unavoidable,</hi> or <hi>equally just</hi> in other Countries, as it is where the True is the National Religion.

But if <hi>you</hi> except these things, and will not allow them to be call'd by the name of <hi>Vice;</hi> perhaps other men may think it as reasonable to except some other things, which they have a kindness for.

            <p>But, Sir, whether the Magistrates <hi>setting themselves severely and impartially against</hi> what I suppose you call <hi>Vice;</hi> or the <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of</hi> found <hi>Creeds and</hi> decent <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> does more conduce to the <hi>spreading true Religion,</hi> and <hi>rendering it fruitful in the Lives of its Professours,</hi> we need not examine.

Vid. Let. p.</hi> 8. But you might have consider'd, that this Argument, from the <hi>Magistrate's being as liable to Error as the rest of Mankind,</hi> concerns none but those, who assert that every Magistrate has a Right to use Force to promote his own Religion, whatever it be: Which I think no man that has any Religion will assert: And that for this reason, I could not be obliged to consider it as a distinct Argument.<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25, 26.</note> However, where it came in my way, I took as much notice of it as I thought it deserved.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> you deny that the <hi>Fourth Proposition is any Proposition of the Author's, to be found in the Pages</hi> I quote, <hi>or any where else in the whole Letter, either in those terms, or in the sense</hi> I take it in. And yet you immediately add, that <hi>in the eighth Page,</hi> which I quote, <hi>the Author is shewing that the Magistrate has no Right to make use of Force in Matters of Religion, for the Salvation of men's Souls;</hi> And that <hi>the Reason he there gives for it is, because Force hath no efficacy to convince men's Minds; and that without a full perswasion of the Mind, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the true Religion it self is not acceptable to God.</hi> And then you set down the words of the Author to which I referr, <hi>viz. Upon this ground I affirm that the Magistrate's Power extends not to the establishing any Articles of Faith, or Forms of Worship, by the force of his Laws. For Laws are of no force without Penalties; and Penalties in this case are absolutely impertinent, because they are not proper to convince the Mind.</hi> Now in what respect, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, are <hi>Penalties</hi> here affirm'd to be <hi>absolutely impertinent?</hi> Is it not plain that the Author means they are so, as used to bring men to believe <hi>any Articles of Faith,</hi> or to approve <hi>any Forms of Worship?</hi> And is not this exactly the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?</hi> The other place of the Letter, p. 27. to which I referr, and which you here set down, does clearly enough contain the same Sense; and therefore I need not add any more words concerning it.</p>

that I remember, does the Author say that it is impossible that Force should any way, at any time, upon any Person, by any Accident, be useful towards the promoting of true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls; for that is it which you mean by utterly of no use.</hi> By <hi>utterly of no use,</hi> I mean the same thing which the Author does by <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impertinent.</hi> And whether he does, or does not <hi>say that it is impossible, &amp;c.</hi> I am sure the least he can mean by saying that <hi>Penalties are absolutely impertinent,</hi> is, that they are so little ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable towards the purpose we speak of, that, generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they do at least as much harm as good: For nothing less than that can make them <hi>absolutely impertinent:</hi> And that is all that I mean by <hi>utterly useless.</hi>

to ask, How it does it?

               </gap>s, join'd with the like Necessity, will not as well do it in the case before us. I confess I see no reason why it should not: nor do I believe you can assign any.</p>

There is no doubt but God, who can do what he pleases, by what means he pleases, and even without any means, can make many things <hi>occasions of good</hi> to men, which are not apt in their own natures to be so. Nor do I doubt but sometimes, what in his infinite Wisdom he sees would be hurtful and pernicious to all other men, he sees will be good and salutary to some particular persons, and accordingly in his Goodness orders it for them. But if men should thence take occasion to apply such things generally; Who sees not, that however they might chance to hit right in some few cases; yet upon the whole matter, they would certainly do a great deal more harm than good?<note place="margin">

it may, but what it is likely to produce: And the greater Good or Harm like to come from it, ought to determine the use of it.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can easily grant you, that as <hi>Running a man through,</hi> though once upon a time it chanced to <hi>save a man's life by opening a lurking Impostume,</hi> is nevertheless no <hi>lawful or justifiable Chirurgery;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is always much more likely to let out men's lives, than to <hi>open lurking Impostumes:</hi> So though <hi>Loss of Estate, &amp;c. the Gallies, and the Torments suffer'd in the late Persecution,</hi> might possibly, as directed and managed by divine Providence, bring some Persons to <hi>Repentance, Sobriety of Thought, and a true sense of Religion, &amp;c.</hi> and so <hi>indirectly and at a distance serve to the Salvation of their Souls:</hi> Yet since consider'd in themselves, and with respect to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men,<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 13.14.</note> these Methods, for the reasons alleged in my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> are justly to be look'd upon us more apt to hinder, than to promote that end; the Success which God was <hi>pleas'd</hi> perhaps, but not <hi>bound</hi> to give them, will by no means justify them, or prove that the <hi>French King had Right and Authority to make use of them.</hi> This, I say, I can easily grant you. But how will this serve your purpose? Will it follow from hence, that the Magistrate has no Right to use any Force at all, for the bringing men to the true Religion? Or will any man say, that because the Magistrate may not use those <hi>Severities</hi> which are more apt to <hi>hinder,</hi> than to <hi>promote</hi> true Religion, therefore he can use no <hi>lower Penalties,</hi> though they be never so <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to promote it? If you say you think no Penalties at all are fit to promote Religion: to make me of your opinion, you must prove it some other way, than by alleging the unfitness of those <hi>Severities.</hi> This, I suppose, may serve to shew with how little reason you say here, that if my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and at a distance Serviceableness may authorize the Magistrate to use Force in Religion, all the Cruelties used by the Heathens against Christians, by Papists against Protestants, and all the persecuting of Christians one amongst another, are all justifiable.</hi> (Not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at present, how odly it sounds, that that which authorizes the Magistrate to use <hi>moderate Penalties,</hi> to promote the <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> should justify all the <hi>Cruelties</hi> that ever were used, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Heathenisin,</hi> or <hi>Popery.</hi>)</p>

                  </gap>st allow, not to be a fault. But yet you would have men punish'd for not being of the National Religion; that is, as you your self confess, for no fault at all.</hi> In which words you <hi>take a liberty</hi> to put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pon me what you please. For I neither <hi>allow,</hi> nor <hi>confess,</hi> nor <hi>would have,</hi> what you are pleas'd to impute to me. But how far that is to be <hi>allow'd,</hi> which you <hi>say</hi> I do <hi>allow, and all the World</hi> with me <hi>must allow,</hi> will quickly appear.</p>
            <p>For (to come to the Point;) the <hi>National Religion</hi> is eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t: And it is no <hi>fault</hi> in him that is not bound to believe it, not to <hi>profess</hi> it. If it be true; then either there is sufficient provision made for instructing men in the truth of it, or there is not. If there be not; then all men are not bound to <hi>believe</hi> it; And (as was said before) in those who are not bound to believe it, it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l be no <hi>fault</hi> not to profess it. But if there be sufficient means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction provided for all; then it must be a <hi>fault</hi> in all not to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi> it; because, in that case, it is a <hi>fault</hi> in all not to <hi>believe</hi> it. And the like is to be said concerning <hi>Communion with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in Divine Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I take to be very plain. And from hence these two things will unavoidably follow. 1. That no man ought to be punish'd for not being of any false Religion, though it be the <hi>National Religion:</hi> Because it is no <hi>fault</hi> not to be of any false Religion. 2. That all who have sufficient means of Instruction provided for them, may justly be punish'd for not being of the <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> where the true, is the National Religion: Because it is a <hi>fault</hi> in all such, not to be of that Religion. And so <hi>all Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the sake of Religion, will not be <hi>unjustifiable S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If the first part of this be true; then an <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> and <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> are more necessary than ever I thought them. For if the <hi>greatest part of Mankind be not able to discern betwixt Truth and Falshood,</hi> in matters concerning their Salvation, (as you must mean, if you speak to the purpose;) their condition must needs be very hazardous, if they have not some <hi>Guide</hi> or <hi>Iudge,</hi> to whose determination and direction they may securely resign themselves. But for my part, as I know of no such <hi>Guide</hi> of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so I think there is no need of any such; because notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>the long and many Proofs, and remote Consequences, the false Grounds, and the captious and fallacious Arguments of Learned Men vers'd in Controversies,</hi> with which you (as well as those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) endeavour to amuse us, through the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, the Truth which is necessary to Salvation, lies so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and exposed to all that sincerely and diligently seek it, that no such person shall ever fail of attaining the knowledge of it. Nor is the famous instance you give us, of the two <hi>Rainoldses,</hi> of any moment to prove the contrary; unless you can undertake that he that err'd, was as <hi>sincere</hi> in his enquiry after that Truth, as you suppose him <hi>able to examine and judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (whatever you think of this matter) 'tis plain the <hi>Force</hi> you here speak of, is not Force <hi>my way applied; i.e.</hi> applied to the promoting the <hi>true Religion</hi> onely, but to the promoting of all the National Religions in the World. And therefore I can easily grant you all that you would have, without any the least preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to my Cause. For how much soever <hi>the National Religions are more of them False or Erroneous, than such as have God for their Author, and Truth for their Standard;</hi> and how much soever <hi>the greatest part of Mankind may be exposed, by the Force which is used to make them hearken to the Information and Instruction of Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to it by the Magistrate, or those of his Religion, to be led into Falshood and Error, than they are likely this way to be brought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Truth which must save them:</hi> Yet every one sees that it may be true nevertheless, that convenient Force used to bring men to the <hi>true Religion,</hi> (which is all that I contend for, and all that I allow,) may be very serviceable for that purpose, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to that <hi>Consideration,</hi> which nothing else (besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Grace of God) would bring them to: Which is that which I mean by <hi>doing service indirectly, and at a distance,</hi> toward

the bringing men to the true Religion, and so to Salvation.</p>

            <p>But as to the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of such Force as I take to be useful for the promoting the true Religion; I must again put you in mind, that I do not ground it upon the bare <hi>Usefulness</hi> of such Force, but upon the <hi>Necessity,</hi> as well as Usefulness of it: as any man must acknowledge that reads my <hi>Answer</hi>: Where as I shew at large, that Force is generally <hi>necessary</hi> to bring those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>It is not for the Magistrate, or any body else, upon an imagination of its Usefulness, to make use of any other means, for the Salvation of men's Souls, than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed.</hi> Which, how true soever, is not, I think, very much to the purpose. For if the Magistrate does only assist that Ministery which our Lord has appointed, by using so much of his Coactive Power for the furthering their Service, as common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience discovers to be useful and necessary for that End; there is no manner of ground to say, that <hi>upon an imagination of its Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> he makes use of <hi>any other means for the Salvation of Men's Souls, than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, <hi>the Author and Finisher of our Faith</hi> has given the Magistrate no new Power, or Commission: nor was there any need that he should, (if himself had had any Temporal Power to give:) For he found him already, even by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the <hi>Minister of God to the People for good,</hi> and <hi>bearing the Sword not in vain, i.e.</hi> invested with Coactive Power, and obliged to use it for all the good purposes which it might serve, and for which it should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iob</hi> 31.26, 27, 28.</note> was an <hi>iniquity to be punish'd by the Iudge.</hi> But though our Saviour has given the Magistrates no new Power; yet being <hi>King of Kings,</hi> he expects and requires, that they should submit themselves to his Sceptre, and use the Power which always belong'd to them, for his service, and for the advancing his Spiritual Kingdom in the World. And even that <hi>Charity</hi> which our great Master so earnestly recommends, and so strictly requires of all his Disciples, as it obliges all men to seek and promote the good of others, as well as their own, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their spiritual and eternal good, by such means as their several Places and Relations enable them to use; so does it espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially oblige the Magistrate to do it <hi>as a Magistrate, i.e.</hi> by that Power which enables him to do it above the rate of other men.</p>
            <p>So far therefore is the Christian Magistrate, when he gives his helping hand to the furtherance of the Gospel, by laying conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Penalties upon such as reject it, or any part of it, from <hi>using any other means</hi> for the Salvation of men's Souls, <hi>than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed,</hi> that he does no more than his Duty to God, to his Redeemer, and to his Subjects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him.</p>

This I take to be the meaning of those words, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moses <hi>and the</hi> Prophets, (<hi>i.e.</hi> if they hear them not <hi>effectually,</hi> so as to be <hi>perswaded</hi> by them; as appears by the next Clause, where the same thing is express'd by that word;) <hi>neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the dead.</hi> But how does this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the matter before us? Is there any thing in my Assertion like this Mistake of <hi>Dives?</hi> Do I any where say that the <hi>means appointed</hi> for the satisfying men's Minds concerning the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are not sufficient to do it, without the Assistance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Force? Or, that the Magistrate is more likely to convince men's Understanding, by inflicting Penalties, than Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are, by preaching the Gospel? If I had said any such thing, you might reasonably enough have put me in mind how <hi>Dives</hi> was <hi>mistaken</hi> in what he <hi>thought useful.</hi> But if I do expresly deny that Force has any <hi>proper Efficacy</hi> to convince men's Minds, and do place all its <hi>Usefulness</hi> in its Subserviency to the <hi>means appointed</hi> for that purpose, as it is apt to take off that unreasonable Aversness and Prejudice, which usually keeps those who reject the Truth, from applying themselves to those <hi>means:</hi> then though <hi>Dives</hi> was <hi>mistaken</hi> in thinking that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be able to convert his Brethren, though <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> had not done it; it may, however, be no <hi>Mistake,</hi> to think Force <hi>useful</hi> for the purpose for which I affirm it to be so.</p>

But it seems you think there is. <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>Miracles, we know, were once useful for the promoting true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls; which is more than you can say for your Political Punishments. But yet we must conclude that God thinks them not useful now, unless we will say (that which without Impiety cannot be said) that the Wise and Benign Disposer and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner of all things does not now use all useful means for promoting his own Honour in the World, and the good of Souls.</hi> And then you add, <hi>I think this Consequence will hold, as well as what you draw in near the same words.</hi> But I think it is easy to shew it will not.

And therefore though, as I affirm, it cannot be said without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, that <hi>the Wise and Benign Disposer and Governer of all things
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43698:20"/>
has not furnish'd Mankind with competent means for the promoting his own Honour in the World, and the good of Souls;</hi> yet it is very agreeable with <hi>Piety</hi> and with Truth too, to say that he does not now use all <hi>useful</hi> means: Because as none of his Attributes obliges him to use more than <hi>sufficient</hi> means; so he may use <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> means, without using all <hi>useful</hi> means. For where there are many useful means, and some of them are sufficient without the rest, there is no necessity of using them all. So that from God's not using Miracles <hi>now,</hi> to promote the true Religion, you cannot conclude that he does not <hi>think them useful now,</hi> but onely that he does not think them <hi>necessary.</hi> And therefore though <hi>what we are apt to think useful, were thence to be concluded so;</hi> yet if what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>useful,</hi> be not likewise to be concluded <hi>necessary;</hi> there is no reason to <hi>fear</hi> that <hi>we should be obliged to believe the Miracles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by the Church of</hi> Rome. For if Miracles be not now <hi>necessary,</hi> there is no inconvenience in thinking the <hi>Miracles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by the Church of</hi> Rome, to be but <hi>pretended</hi> Miracles.</p>
            <p>But after all, how comes this Supposition in, <hi>That what we are apt to think useful, is thence to be concluded so?</hi> For, whatever you would insinuate, I speak not of <hi>what we are apt to think</hi> or phansy, with little or no reason, to be <hi>useful:</hi> but of what we judge so upon just and sufficient grounds: Upon a <hi>strong Probability of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> (which you your self seem to think sufficient,<note place="margin">

For how confidently soever you tell me here, that it is more than I can say for my <hi>Political Punishments,</hi> that they <hi>were ever useful for the promoting true Religion;</hi> I appeal to all observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons, Whether where-ever true Religion, or sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity has been nationally received, and establish'd by moderate Penal Laws, it has not always visibly lost ground by the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Laws: Whether Sects and Heresies (even the wildest and most absurd,) and even <hi>Epicurism</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thereupon spread themselves: and Whether the very Spirit and Life of Christianity has not sensibly decayed, as well as the number of sound Professors of it been dayly lessen'd upon it. (Not to speak of what at this time our eyes cannot but see, for fear of giving offense: Though I hope it will be none to any that have a just concern for Truth and Piety, to take notice of

the Books and Pamphlets which now fly so thick about this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, manifestly tending to the multiplying of Sects and Divisions, and even to the promoting of <hi>Scepticism</hi> in Religion among us. In which number I shall not much need your pardon, if I reckon the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Second Letter concerning Toleration)</hi> And if these have always been the Fruits of the relaxation of moderate Penal Laws, made for the preserving and advancing true Religion; I think this consideration alone is abundantly sufficient to shew the Usefulness and Benefit of such Laws.

               </gap>ar to the Gospel, has already been shewn. And, from the same ground, it seems not hard to conjecture, why God was pleas'd to call <hi>poor Fishermen,</hi> rather than <hi>Magistrates,</hi> to be <hi>Spreaders and Ministers of the Gospel.</hi> For as the great and wonderful things which were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43698:22"/>
to be done for the evidencing the truth of the Gospel, were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient to procure Attention to it, without any help from the Magistrate;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13.</note> so they were much more <hi>admirable</hi> and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as done by the hands of such mean persons, than they would have been, if they had been done by Princes or <hi>Magistrates.</hi> To which I may add, that the Conversion of the World to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, without the help, and notwithstanding the utmost resistance of the Civil Powers, was to be the great Evidence, to all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, of a divine Power accompanying the Gospel, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the progress of it: Which Evidence would have been wanting, if God had from the beginning used the service of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in propagating his Gospel.</p>
            <p>You demand further, <hi>What if God, foreseeing this Force would be in the hands of men as passionate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>as humoursome, as liable to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Error as the rest of their Brethren, did not think it a proper Means to bring men into the Right Way?</hi> But if there be any thing of an Argument in this, it proves that there ought to be no <hi>Civil Government</hi> in the World; and so proving too much, proves nothing at all.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.20.</note> The Scripture tells us, that <hi>the wrath of man work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the righteousness of God.</hi> And yet God has put the Sword into the Magistrate's hand, though he may be <hi>as passionate, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moursome, &amp;c. as the rest of his Brethren.</hi> So that, unless you would have no Government, or Discipline in the World, you must acknowledge, that how <hi>passionate</hi> or <hi>humoursome</hi> soever, or how <hi>liable</hi> soever <hi>to Prejudice and Error</hi> God foresaw Magistrates would be, there is not the least colour to inferr from thence, that he did not think moderate Penalties, used to <hi>bring men into the Right Way, a proper Means</hi> to bring them into it.</p>
            <p>Lastly you demand, <hi>What if there be other Means?</hi> And then you add, <hi>Then yours ceases to be necessary, upon the account that there is no means left. For you your self allow that the Grace of God is another Means. And I suppose you will not deny it to be both a proper and sufficient Means; and which is more, the onely Means; such Means as can work by itself, and without which all the Force in the World can do nothing.</hi> To which I answer: Though the <hi>Grace of God</hi> be <hi>another Means,</hi> and I thought fit to mention it, to prevent Cavils; yet it is none of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ns of which I was speaking in the place you referr to;<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> which any one who reads that Paragraph, will find to be onely <hi>Humane</hi> Means. And therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough the <hi>Grace of God</hi> be <hi>both a proper and sufficient Means,</hi> and <hi>such as can work by it self,</hi> and without which neither Penalties, nor any other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43698:23"/>
Means can do any thing; yet it may be true however, that when Admonitions and Intreaties fail, there is no <hi>Humane Means</hi> left, but Penalties, to bring prejudiced Persons to hear and consider what may convince them of their Errors, and discover the Truth to them. And then <hi>Penalties</hi> will be <hi>necessary</hi> in respect to that end, as an <hi>Humane Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What you intend by saying that the <hi>Grace of God</hi> is the <hi>onely Means,</hi> I do not well understand. If you mean onely that it is the <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>most necessary</hi> Means, and that without which all other Means are vain and ineffectual; I grant it is so. Or if you mean that it is the <hi>onely necessary</hi> Means, as being able to do its work without any help of other Means; This I have already granted. But if by calling it the <hi>onely Means,</hi> you intend to say that it does either always, or ordinarily exclude all other Means; I see no ground you have to say it.</p>
            <p>Yes, say you: <hi>God alone can open the Ear that it may hear, and open the Heart that it may understand.</hi> But, by your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>vour, this does not prove that he makes use of no <hi>Means</hi> in doing it. For whatever Means we may suppose him to make use of, it is <hi>he alone</hi> still that does it, though he does it by the Means he makes use of.</p>
            <p>You add, <hi>And this he does (i.e.</hi> he <hi>opens the Ear that it may hear, and the Heart that it may understand) in his own good time, and to whom he is gratiously pleas'd, but not according to the Will and Phansy of Man, when he thinks fit, by Punishments, to compell his Brethren.</hi> By which I su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pose you mean, that the Magistrate has no ground to hope that God will <hi>bless</hi> any Penalties that he may use, to bring men to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> the Doctrine of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or (which is the same thing) that God does not (at least not ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>arily) afford his Grace and Assistance to them who are brought by such Penalties to hear and consider that Doctrine, to enable them to hear and consider it as they ought, <hi>i. e.</hi> so as to be moved heartily to embrace it. If this be your meaning; then to let you see that it is not true, I shall onely desire you to tell me, whether they that are so brought to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider,</hi> are bound to <hi>believe</hi> the Gospel, or not? If you say they are; (and I suppose you dare not say otherwise;) then it evidently follows that God does afford them that Grace which is requisite to enable them to believe the Gospel: Because without that Grace, it is impossible for them to believe it; and they cannot be bound to believe what it is impossible for them to believe.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 21, 22.</note> And that you may do it the more successfully, you represent it (as you commonly do) in such a manner, as if I allow'd any Magistrate, of what Religion soever, to lay Penalties upon all that dissent from him:<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> Whereas in my own words it stands thus: <q>When men fly from the means of a right Information, and will not so much as consider how reasonable it is, throughly and impartially to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine a Religion which they embraced upon such Inducements as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and therefore with little or no examination of the proper Grounds of it: What humane Method can be used, to bring them to act like Men, in an affair of such consequence, and to make a wiser and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional choice, but that of laying such Penalties upon them, as may balance the weight of those Prejudices which enclined them to preferr a False Way before the True, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </q> Now this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you pretend to retort in this manner: <hi>And I say, I see no other means left (taking the World as we now find it, wherein the Magistrate never lays Penalties, for Matters of Religion, upon those of his own Church, nor is it to be expected they ever should) to make men of the National Church, any where, throughly and impartially examine a Religion which they embraced upon such Inducements as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and therefore with little or no examination of the proper Grounds of it. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the use of Force by Dissenters upon Conformists necessary.</hi> And then you add, <hi>I appeal to all the World, whether this be not as just and natural a Conclusion as yours.</hi> And I am well content the <hi>World</hi> should judge. And when it determines, that there is the same reason to say, That to bring those who conform to the National
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43698:24"/>
Church, to examine their Religion, it is necessary for <hi>Dissenters</hi> (who cannot possibly have the Coactive Power, because the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church has that on its side, and cannot be National with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) to <hi>use Force upon Conformists;</hi> As there is to say, That where the National Church is the true Church, there to bring <hi>Dissenters</hi> (as you call them) to examine their Religion, it is necessary for the Magistrate (who has the Coactive Power) to lay moderate Penalties upon them for <hi>dissenting:</hi> I say, when the <hi>World</hi> determines thus, I will never pretend any more to judge what is reasonable, in any case whatsoever. For I doubt not but I may safely presume that the <hi>World</hi> will easily admit these two things. 1. That though it be very fit and desireable, that all that are of the true Religion, should understand the true Groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of it; that so they may be the better able both to defend themselves against the assaults of Seducers, and to reduce such as are out of the Way: yet this is not strictly necessary to their Salvation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Experience shews (as far as men are capable to judge of such matters) that many do heartily believe and profess the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and conscientiously practice the Duties of it, who ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do not understand the true Grounds upon which it challenges their belief: And no man doubts but whoever does so believe, profess, and practice the true Religion, if he perseveres to the end, shall certainly attain Salvation by it. 2. That how much soever it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns those who reject the true Religion (whom you may call <hi>Dissenters,</hi> if you please) to examine and consider why they do so; and how needful soever Penalties may be to bring them to this: it is, however, utterly unreasonable that such as have not the Coactive Power, should take upon them to inflict Penalties for that purpose: Because, as that is not consistent with Order and Government; which cannot stand, where private persons are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to usurp the Coactive Power: So there is nothing more manifest, than that the prejudice which is done to Religion, and to the interest of men's Souls, by destroying Government, does infinitely outweigh any good that can possibly be done by that which destroys it. And whoever admits and considers these things, I am very secure he will be far enough from admitting, that there is any Parity of Reason in the Cases we here speak of, or that yours is as <hi>just and natural a Conclusion</hi> as mine.</p>
            <p>What follows here, has been sufficiently consider'd already. You say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>Faith is the Gift of God.</hi> And I say, This <hi>Gift comes,</hi> ordinarily at least, <hi>by hearing.</hi> And if the Magistrate be both war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43698:24"/>
and obliged to use convenient Penalties to bring his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to <hi>hear</hi> the Gospel; as I think I have shewn that he is; then, in doing so, he cannot be said to <hi>use any other means to procure this Gift to any one,</hi> than <hi>what God himself has prescribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If,</hi> say you, <hi>all the means God has appointed, to make men hear and consider, be Exhortation in season and out of season, &amp;c. together with Prayer for them, and the Example of Meekness and a good Life; this is all ought to be done, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</hi> But if these be not <hi>all the Means God has appointed;</hi> then these things are not <hi>all</hi> that <hi>ought to be done.</hi> As to the first <hi>Spreaders</hi> of the Gospel, it has already been shewn that God <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> other <hi>Means,</hi> besides these, for them to use, to induce men to hear and consider. And though when those extraordinary Means ceased, these Means which you mention, were the onely Means left to the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel; yet that is no proof that the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> when he became Christian, could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use such Means as his Station enabled him to use, when they became needful.</p>

Now if those Laws by which the <hi>French</hi> King requires his Subjects to come to Mass, be no <hi>Laws:</hi> and consequently their refusing to come, be not a <hi>disobeying his Laws:</hi>: 'tis evident there is nothing left for which the Refusers can be said to be punish'd, but onely their <hi>Religion,</hi> which requires them to refuse.</p>
            <p>But let us see the <hi>likeness</hi> of my <hi>new Method</hi> to this <hi>Plea. So,</hi> say you, <hi>by your Rule, the Dissenters</hi> (from the <hi>true Religion,</hi> for I speak of no other) <hi>must be punish'd</hi> (or, if you please, subjected to moderate Penalties, such as shall make them uneasy, but neither destroy, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> undo them.) <hi>For what? Not for their Religion, say you,</hi> (So you tell me, Sir. But where, I beseech you, do I <hi>say</hi> that Dissenters from the true Religion, are not to be punish'd for <hi>their</hi> Religion?) <hi>not for following the Light of their own Reason, not for obeying the Dictates of their own Consciences.</hi> No, Sir: but ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er for the contrary. For the <hi>Light of their own Reason,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Dictates of their own Consciences</hi> (if their <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> were not perverted and abused) would undoubtedly lead them to the same thing, to which the Method we speak of, is designe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to bring them. You proceed: <hi>For what then are they to be punish'd? To make them, say you, examine the Religion they have embraced, and the Religion they have rejected.</hi> Right, Sir: That is indeed the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43698:25"/>
next <hi>End</hi> for which they are to be punish'd. But what is that to your Question? which, if it be pertinent, demands for what <hi>Fault,</hi> not for what <hi>End,</hi> they are to be punish'd: As appears even by your next words; <hi>So that they are punish'd, not for having offended against a Law; (i. e.</hi> not for any <hi>Fault:) For there is no Law of the Land that requires them to examine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems then the <hi>Likeness</hi> of the two <hi>Pleas</hi> lies in this: The <hi>Pleaders for the</hi> French <hi>Discipline</hi> say that those who refuse to go to Mass, are not punish'd for their Religion, but for <hi>disobeying the King's Laws.</hi> And you make <hi>me</hi> say, that Dissenters are to be punish'd <hi>not for having offended against a Law.</hi> And were there ever any Twinns more like than these two Pleas are?</p>
            <p>But as if you had forgotten the <hi>Likeness</hi> you talk'd of, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with these words; <hi>And which now is the fairer Plea, pray judge.</hi> So that the thing I am to <hi>judge</hi> of at last, is not, how <hi>like</hi> these <hi>Pleas</hi> are to each other; but which is the <hi>fairer</hi> Plea of them.</p>
            <p>Now I confess, as you have made my Plea for me, I think there is no considerable difference as to the <hi>Fairness</hi> of them, excepting what arises from the different Degrees of Punishment in the <hi>French</hi> Discipline, and my Method. But if the <hi>French</hi> Plea be not true; and that which you make to be <hi>mine,</hi> be not mine: To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is it to enquire, which is the <hi>fairer</hi> of them? The truth of the matter is this: The <hi>French</hi> Discipline <hi>Dragoons</hi> men, and many (as you say) out of their <hi>lives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10.</note> for not <hi>coming to Mass</hi> (which is no Fault,) to make them <hi>come to Mass</hi> (which they cannot do wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hout sin.) And my Method punishes men with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which do not deserve to be call'd so, when compared with those of the <hi>French</hi> Discipline, for rejecting the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, proposed to them with sufficient Evidence (which certainly is a Fault,) to bring them to consider and examine the Evidence with which it is proposed, that so they may embrace it, (which is both lawful for them, and their duty to do.) And which of these <hi>Methods</hi> or <hi>Pleas</hi> is the <hi>fairer,</hi> let all the World judge.</p>
            <p>Whereas you say here, that <hi>there is no Law of the Land that requires men to examine,</hi> I think the contrary is plain enough. For where the Laws provide sufficient means of Instruction in the true Religion, and then require all men to embrace that Religion; I think the most natural Construction of those Laws is, that they require men to embrace it upon Instruction and Conviction; as it cannot be expected they should do, without <hi>examining</hi> the Grounds upon which it stands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43698:26"/>How pertinent the Declamation is, which makes up the rest of this Paragraph, appears sufficiently by what has been said, and will appear yet further, before I take leave of you.</p>

Which when I have done, and <hi>by settling these Points have framed the parts of my new Engine, set it together, and shew'd that it will work, without doing more harm than good in the World,</hi> you tell me you <hi>think then men may be content to submit to it.</hi> Onely before I do this, I crave leave to take some notice of one of the Conditions you are pleas'd to lay upon me. For you require me to do it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot onely <hi>plainly and intelligibly, without keeping in the uncertainty of general expressions</hi> (which is reasonable enough,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 46.</note>) but likewise <hi>without supposing all along</hi> my <hi>Church in the right,</hi> and my <hi>Religion the true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as to this latter Condition, I confess I do not see how you can oblige me to it. For if my <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>in the right;</hi> and my <hi>Religion</hi> be the <hi>true;</hi> why may I not <hi>all along suppose</hi> it to be so?</p>
            <p>You say <hi>this can no more be allow'd</hi> to me <hi>in this case, whatever</hi> my <hi>Church or Religion be, than it can be to a Papist or a Lutheran, a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43698:26"/>
Presbyterian or an Anabaptist; nay no more to</hi> me, <hi>than it can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to a Iew or a Mahometan.</hi> No, Sir? Not <hi>whatever</hi> my <hi>Church, or Religion be?</hi> That seems somewhat ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. And methinks you might have given us some Reason for what you say: For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not so self-evident as to need no proof. But I think it is no hard matter to guess at your Reason, though you did not think fit expressly to own it. For 'tis obvious enough that there can be no other Reason for this Assertion of yours, but either the equal <hi>Truth,</hi> or at least the equal <hi>Certainty</hi> (or <hi>Uncertainty</hi>) of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. For whoever considers your Assertion, must see, that to make it good, you will be obliged to maintain one of these two things: Either 1. That no Religion <hi>is the true Religion,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to other Religions: Which makes all Religions <hi>true,</hi> or all <hi>false,</hi> and so either way <hi>indifferent.</hi> Or, 2. That though some one Religion be <hi>the true Religion;</hi> yet no man can have any more reason, than another man of another Religion may have, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his to be <hi>the true Religion.</hi> Which makes all Religions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <hi>certain</hi> (or <hi>uncertain;</hi> whether you please) and so renders it vain and idle to enquire after <hi>the true Religion,</hi> and onely a piece of good luck if any man be of it, and such good luck as he can never know that he has, till he come into the other World. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two Principles you will own, I know not. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one or the other of them <hi>lies at the bottom</hi> with you, and is the <hi>lurking Supposition upon which you build all that you say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as unreasonable as this Condition is, I see no need I have to decline it, nor any occasion you had to impose it upon me. For certainly the making what you call my new Method, <hi>consistent</hi> and <hi>practicable,</hi> does no way oblige me to <hi>suppose all along</hi> my Religion is <hi>the true,</hi> as you imagine. No, Sir; 'tis enough for that purpose, to suppose that there is <hi>one true Religion,</hi> and but one; and that that Religion may be <hi>known</hi> by those who profess it, to be the onely true Religion; and may also be <hi>manifested</hi> to be such, by them to others, so far a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> least as to oblige them to receive it, and to leave them without excuse if they do not. Indeed if either of the two Principles but now mention'd, be true, <hi>i. e.</hi> if all Religions be equally <hi>true,</hi> and so <hi>indifferent;</hi> or all be equally <hi>certain</hi> (or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:</hi>) then without more adoe, the Cause is yours. For then, 'tis plain, there can be no reason why any man, in respect to his Salvation, should change his Religion: and so there can be no room for using any manner of Force, to bring men to consider what may reasonably move them to change. But if, on the contrary,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43698:27"/>
there be one true Religion, and no more; and that may be known to be the onely true Religion by those who are of it; and may by them be manifested to others, in such sort as has been said: then 'tis altogether as plain, that it may be very reasonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for some men to change their Religion; and that it may be made appear to them to be so. And then if such men will not consider what is offer'd, to convince them of the Reasonableness and Necessity of doing it; it may be very fit and reasonable, for any thing you have said to the contrary, in order to the br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nging them to Consideration, to require them under convenient Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to forsake their false Religions, and to embrace the true. Now as these things are all that I need to <hi>suppose;</hi> so I shall take leave to suppose them, till you shew good reason why I should not.</p>
            <p>And now I come to give an account of the Particulars men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. Which I think may be done in a very few words so <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>intelligibly,</hi> upon these Supposals as to enable any Reader to see, without any more help, to how little purpose you multiply words about these matters. Here therefore I am to <hi>tell the World,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who are to be punish'd.</hi> And those, according to the whole tenor of my <hi>Answer,</hi> are no other but such, as having sufficient Evidence tender'd them of the true Religion, do yet reject it; whether utterly refusing to consider that Evidence, or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering it as they ought, <hi>viz.</hi> with such care and diligence as the matter deserves and requires, and with honest and unbiass'd minds. And what difficulty there is in this, I cannot imagine. For there is nothing more evident, than that those who do so reject the true Religion, are <hi>culpable,</hi> and <hi>deserve</hi> to be punish'd. And it is easy enough to <hi>know</hi> when men do so reject the true Religion. For that requires no more than that we know that that Religion was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to them with sufficient Evidence of the truth of it. And that it <hi>may</hi> be tender'd to men with such Evidence; and that it may be <hi>known</hi> when it is so tender'd; these things, you know, I take leave here to suppose. Now if the persons I describe, do really <hi>deserve</hi> to be punish'd; and may be <hi>known</hi> to be such as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them; then as they <hi>deserve</hi> to be punish'd; so they <hi>may</hi> be punish'd. Which is all that needs be said upon this Head, to shew the <hi>Consistency</hi> and <hi>Practicableness</hi> of this <hi>Method.</hi> And what do you any where say against this?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For what.</hi> By which I perceive you mean two things. For sometimes you speak of the <hi>Fault,</hi> and sometimes of the <hi>End</hi> for which men are to be punish'd. (And sometimes you plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43698:27"/>
them.) Now if it be enquired, For what <hi>Fault</hi> men are to be punish'd: I answer, For rejecting the true Religion, after sufficient Evidence tender'd them of the truth of it: Which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is a <hi>Fault,</hi> and deserves Punishment. But if you enquire for what <hi>End</hi> such as do so reject the true Religion, are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd: I say, To bring them to embrace the true Religion; and in order to that, to bring them to consider, and that carefully and impartially, the Evidence which is offer'd, to convince them of the truth of it: Which are undeniably just and excellent Ends; and which, through God's blessing, have often been procured, and may yet be procured by convenient Penalties, inflicted for that purpose. Nor do I know of any thing you say against any part of this, which is not already answer'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3.<hi>With what Punishments.</hi> Now here having in my <hi>Answer</hi> declared,<note place="margin">A.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.14.</note> that I take the <hi>Severities</hi> so often mention'd, (which either destroy men, or make them miserable) to be <hi>utterly unapt and improper</hi> (for Reasons there given) <hi>to bring men to embrace the Truth which must save them;</hi> I do not presume to determine (nor have you shewn any cause why I should) just how far, within those bounds, that Force extends it self, which is really serviceable to that end; but content my self to say, <q>That so much Force, or such Penalties as are ordinarily sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o prevail with men of common Discretion, and not desperately perverse and obstinate to weigh matters of Religion carefully and impartially; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which ordinarily they will not do this; so much Force, or such Penalties may fitly and reasonably be used for the promoting true Religion in the World, and the Salvation of Souls.</q> And what just exception this is liable to, I do not understand.</p>
            <p>For when I speak of men of <hi>common Discretion, and not despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately perverse and obstinate,</hi> I think 'tis plain enough, that by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discretion</hi> I exclude not <hi>Idiotes</hi> onely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 41.</note> and such as we usually call <hi>Mad-men,</hi> but likewise the <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate,</hi> who perhaps may well enough deserve that name, though they be not wont to be sent to <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Penalties I speak of, be intended for the curing men's unreasonable <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Refractariness</hi> against the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; then the reason why the <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate</hi> are not to be regarded in measuring these Penalties,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 42.</note> is very apparent. For as Remedies are not provided for the <hi>incurable,</hi> so in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and tempering them, regard is to be had onely to those for whom they are designed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43698:28"/>Perhaps it may be needful here (to prevent a little Cavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) to note, that there are <hi>degrees</hi> of Perversness and Obstinacy and that men may be <hi>perverse and obstinate,</hi> without being <hi>desperately</hi> so: And that therefore some <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>obstinate</hi> persons may be thought curable, though such as are <hi>desperately</hi> so cannot. (As there are likewise <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Carelessness</hi> in men of their Salvation, as well as of <hi>Concern</hi> for it: So that such as have <hi>some</hi> Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cern for their Salvation, may yet be <hi>careless</hi> of it to a great degree. And therefore if those who have <hi>any</hi> Concern for their Salvation, deserve regard and pity; then so may <hi>some</hi> carless persons, though those <hi>who have no Concern for their Salvation, deserve not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</hi> Which spoils a little Harangue you give us,<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note>

               </gap>cines are thought safe and advisable, which do <hi>ordinarily</hi> cure, though not always (as none do:) So those Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, or Punishments, which are <hi>ordinarily</hi> found sufficient (as well as necessary) for the ends for which they are designed, may fitly and reasonably be used for the compassing those ends.</p>
            <p>Now I do not see what more can be required to justify the Rule here given.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 40.</note> For if you demand that it should express wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, particularly, are such as it says may <hi>fitly</hi> and <hi>reasonably be used:</hi> this, you must give me leave to tell you, is a very unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demand. For what Rule is there that expresses the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which agree with it? A Rule is intended for a <hi>common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> by which Particulars are to be examined; and therefore must necessarily be general. And those to whom it is given, are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be able to apply it, and to judge of Particulars by it. Nay it is often seen, that they are better able to do this, than those who give it. And so it is in the present case: The Rule here laid down, is that by which I suppose Governers and Lawgivers ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Penalties they use, for the promoting the true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls. But certainly no man doubts but their Prudence and Experience enables them to use and apply it be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter than other men; and to judge more exactly what Penalties do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with it, and what do not. And therefore I think you must excuse me, if I do not take upon me to teach them, what it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me rather to learn from them.</p>

               </gap> here that a man who has the true Religion proposed to him with sufficient Evidence of its Truth, may consider it as he ought, or <hi>do his utmost in considering,</hi> and yet not perceive the Truth of it; is neither more nor less, than to say, that sufficient Evidence is not sufficient Evidence. For what does any man mean by sufficient Evidence, but such as will certainly win assent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is duly consider'd?</p>
            <p>'Tis plain enough therefore, that as long as men reject the true Religion duly proposed to them, so long they offend, and deserve Punishment: And therefore it is but just, that <hi>so long</hi> they should be left liable to it.</p>
            <p>But because my Designe does rather oblige me to consider <hi>how long</hi> men may <hi>need</hi> Punishment, than <hi>how long</hi> it may be <hi>just</hi> to punish them; therefore I shall add, That as long as men refuse to embrace the true Religion, <hi>so long</hi> Penalties are necessary for them, to dispose them to consider and embrace it: And that therefore, as Justice allows, so Charity requires that they be kept subject to Penalties, <hi>till</hi> they embrace the true Religion.</p>

Now before we can suppose Magistrates every where <hi>so to punish,</hi> we must suppose the true Religion to be every where the National Religion. And if this were the case; I think it is evident enough, <hi>what Advantage to true Religion it would be, if Magistrates every where did so punish.</hi> For then we might reasonably hope that all false Religions would soon vanish, and the True become once more

            <p n="6">6. <hi>And lastly, Whence the Magistrate had Commission to do so.</hi> But of this I have spoken already, and need not here repeat what has been said, to shew, that the Magistrate receives his <hi>Commission so to punish</hi> as has been express'd, from <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>Minister</hi> he is.</p>

                  </gap>e Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, as I have endeavour'd to shew there is: this is as good an Argument to prove that there is somewhere a right to use such Force for that purpose, as the utter Uselessness of Force (if that could be made out) would be, to prove that no body has any such right.</q> Where every one sees that I do not inferr <hi>a right to use Force</hi> from the <hi>Usefulness of it barely</hi> (as you make me,) but from the <hi>Necessity,</hi> as well as <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of it. For though the utter <hi>Uselessness</hi> of Force (if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

could be made out) would, as I here acknowledge, be a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that no body has any right to use it; yet I never thought that the bare <hi>Usefulness</hi> of it was sufficient to prove that there is a right somewhere to use it. But if Force be both <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>necessary;</hi> that, I think, is a good proof of it: And that is the thing I insist upon.</p>
            <p>You might therefore have spared the pains you have taken to prove that <hi>Usefulness of Punishment cannot give a Commission to punish;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 47.</note> or that <hi>useful Punishment from every hand is not lawful:</hi> For I never asserted the contrary. But because some perhaps may think that there is more in the Instance you here make use of, than what you intend to prove by it; it may not be amiss briefly to shew there is not.</p>
            <p>That Instance is this: You say <hi>a man may have the Stone, and it may be useful (more than indirectly and at a distance useful) to him to be cut; but yet this usefulness will not justify the most skilful Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urgeon in the world, by Force to make him endure the pain and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Cutting; because he has no commission, no right, without the Patient's own consent to do so. Nor is it a good Argument, Cutting will be useful to him; therefore there is a right somewhere to cut him, whether he will or no.</hi> Now that this Instance does not come up to the Point in question between us, is very evident. For 1. It is to be consider'd, That the <hi>Stone</hi> does not always <hi>kill,</hi> though it be not cured; but men do often live to a great age with it, and die at last of other Distempers. But <hi>Aversion to the true Religion</hi> is certainly and inevitably mortal to the Soul, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not cured; and so of absolute necessity to be cured. And yet if we should suppose the <hi>Stone</hi> as certainly destructive of this temporal life, as that <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> is of men's eternal Salvation: even so, the necessity of curing it would be as much less, than the necessity of curing that Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as this <hi>temporal Life</hi> falls short in value of that which is <hi>eternal.</hi> And 2. It may be consider'd, That <hi>Cutting for the Stone</hi> is not always <hi>necessary,</hi> in order to the Cure: And that even where it is most so, it is withall <hi>hazardous</hi> by your own confession, and may kill, as well as cure, and that without any fault of the Patient. But the <hi>Penalties</hi> I speak of, as they are altogether <hi>necessary</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary Grace) to cure that pernicious, and otherwise untractable <hi>Aversion;</hi> so they can no way endanger or hurt the Soul, but by the fault of him that undergoes them. And if these things be true; if there be no such Necessity that persons trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Stone should be cured of it, as there is, that such
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43698:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as are possess'd with an Aversion to the true Religion should be cured of that Aversion; And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Cutting for the Stone, be neither so necessary, nor yet so safe a Means of curing, as moderate Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties are in the other case: Then how reasonable soever you may suppose it, that it should be left to the Patient's choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he shall be <hi>cut</hi> or not; and how true soever it may be, that the most <hi>skilful Chirurgeon in the world has no Commission, no right, without the Patient's own consent, by Force to make him endure the pain and hazard of Cutting;</hi> The Magistrate may nevertheless have a right to use Penalties to cure men of their Aversion to the true Religion: For 'tis plain enough, these things may very well s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and together.</p>
            <p>This may suffice to shew, how short this Instance falls of the Case before us. However I shall add, That though, as things now stand, no Chirurgeon has any right to <hi>cut</hi> his Calculous Patient, without his consent; yet if the Magistrate should by a Publick Law appoint and authorize a competent number of the most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that Art, to visit such as labour under that Disease, and to cut those (whether they consent or not) whose Lives they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously judge it impossible to save otherwise: I am apt to think you would find it hard to prove, that in so doing he exceeded the bounds of his Power: And I am sure it would be as hard to prove, that those Artists would have no right, in that case, to cut s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch Persons.</p>
            <p>Whereas you say in this Paragraph, that to justify Punishment, it is requisite that it be <hi>directly useful for the procuring some greater good,</hi> than that which it <hi>takes away;</hi> I wish you had told us why it must needs be <hi>directly</hi> useful for that pupose: or why Penalties are not as <hi>directly useful</hi> for the bringing men to the true Religion, as <hi>the rod of correction</hi> is to <hi>drive foolishness from a Child,</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43698:30"/>
               <hi>Sovereign?</hi> But, Sir, I answer roundly and plainly, In the hands of the Sovereign. What? (will you say) <hi>a right in</hi> Mahometan <hi>or Pagan Princes hands to use Force upon Christians, for fear</hi> (as you speak) <hi>lest mankind, in those Countries, should be unfurnish'd with means for the promoting God's honour and the good of Souls?</hi> No, Sir: but a right to use convenient Penalties for the promoting the true Religion; which I think is the <hi>promoting God's honour and the good of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this startle you; then I must tell you further, that I look upon the Supreme Power to be the same all the World over, in what hands soever it is placed: And I take this Right to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it. And if those that have it, do not use it as they ought, but instead of promoting true Religion by proper Penalties, set themselves to enforce <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> or <hi>Paganism,</hi> or any other false Religion: all that can, or that needs be said to that matter is, that God will one day call them to an account for their neglect of their Duty, for the Dishonour they do to him, and for the Souls that perish by their fault.</p>

               <hi>The Author having endeavour'd to shew that no body at all, of any rank or condition, had a power to punish, torment, or use any man ill, for matters of Religion; you tell us you do not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand why Clergy-men are not as capable of such Power as other men.</hi> Which is said with the same Ingenuity which you have used in other places.<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> For whoever will but consult the place, must see that the Power I speak of, is <hi>externally coactive Power,</hi> in general, and not a <hi>Power to punish, torment, or use men ill, for matters of Religion,</hi> as you make it to be. And whether the Author did, or did not give me <hi>any occasion,</hi> in a short <hi>Parenthesis</hi> to declare my dissent from those who think Clergy-men incapable of <hi>externally coactive Power,</hi> I think the fortune of <hi>Europe</hi> does not depend upon it.

For if what has hitherto been universally acknowledged, be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>no Power is given in vain,</hi> but to be <hi>used</hi> upon occasion; I think a very little <hi>Logick</hi> may serve a man to draw this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from it, That all Societies are instituted for the attaining <hi>all the good,</hi> or <hi>all the benefits</hi> they are <hi>enabled</hi> to attain: Because if you except any of those benefits, you will be obliged to admit, that the <hi>Power</hi> of attaining them was given in vain. Nor will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that <hi>all Societies are instituted for one and the same End</hi> (as you imagine it will,) unless you suppose all Societies ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by the Powers they are endued with, to attain the same End: which I believe no man hitherto did ever affirm. And therefore, notwithstanding this Position, there may be still as great a <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> as you please, <hi>between Church and State; a Commonwealth and an Army; or between a Family and the</hi> East-India <hi>Company.</hi> Which several Societies, as they are instituted for different <hi>Ends,</hi> so are they likewise furnish'd with different <hi>Powers,</hi> proportionate to their respective <hi>Ends.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43698:32"/>
these two accounts. 1. Because the true Religion, which this Method propagates, makes good Men; and good Men are always the best Subjects, or Members of a Commonweal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> to the Societies of which they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And 2. Because this Care in any Commonwealth, of God's Honour and Men's Salvation, entitles it to his special protection and blessing. So that where this Method is used, it proves both a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and a <hi>Civil Benefit</hi> to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You say I speak <hi>very improperly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 52, 53.</note> or rather very mistakenly,</hi> if I call <hi>such Benefits as may any way</hi> (i. e. <hi>indirectly, and at a distance, or by Accident) be attain'd by Civil, or any other Society, the Ends for which it is instituted:</hi> Whereas indeed the <hi>Mistake</hi> lies on your side, (which I must now again put you in mind of) in thinking that by <hi>indirectly and at a distance,</hi> I mean <hi>by Accident,</hi> in your sense; which I no where gave you any occasion to think. And therefore I can easily admit, that <hi>nothing can in reason be reckon'd among the Ends of any Society, but what may in reason be supposed to be designed by those who enter into it.</hi> (Though I see no reason, why the Author or Institutor of any Society, especially of Civil Society, may not be supposed to design more than those usually do, who enter in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o it.) But what follows from this? Why, you say, <hi>No body can in reason suppose that any one enter'd into Civil Society for the procuring, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or advancing the Salvation of his Soul; when he, for that end, needed not the Force of Civil Society.</hi> So that it seems, the reason why the procuring, securing, or advancing the Salvation of Souls, must not be reckon'd among the Ends of Civil Societies, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no <hi>need of the Force of Civil Society</hi> for that End: The contrary whereof has, I suppose, already be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Upon the same Grounds,</hi> say you, <hi>thus I reason. Doubtless Churches are instituted for the attaining of all the Benefits which Ecclesiastical Government can yield: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Temporal and Secular Interests of Men may any way be procured, or advanced by Ecclesiastical Politie; the procuring and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing those Interests must in all reason be reckon'd among the Ends of Religious Societies, and so consequently fall within the compass of Churchmen's Iurisdiction.</hi> Well, Sir; I admit the Consequence,

and do freely own <hi>the procuring and advancing the Temporal and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interests of Men,</hi> to be one of the <hi>Ends</hi> (an inferiour, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary End) <hi>of Religious Societies,</hi> &amp;c. And what do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence? Why, <hi>The Church of Rome,</hi> you say, <hi>has openly made its advantage of Secular Interests to be procured or advanced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, and at a distance, and</hi> in ordine ad spiritualia; <hi>all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is a time for all things.</hi> So that it seems, what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has openly made its advantage of, I am endeavouring to bring it in at a back-door, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches: For that I take to be the thing you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate by these words. But what is it, I beseech you, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has <hi>openly made its advantage of?</hi> For I confess I do not understand what you mean by <hi>Secular Interests to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured or advanced indirectly, and at a distance, and</hi> in ordine ad spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia. That some of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have made their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Power they claim'd, to dispose of all Secular matters as they thought fit, even to the deposing of Kings and Emperours, and the bestowing their Dominions on whomsoever they pleas'd; And that they claim'd this Power as belonging to them (at least as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> minces the matter) not <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately (i. e.</hi> not for the <hi>procuring or advancing men's Secular Interests</hi>) but onely <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>at a distance,</hi> viz. <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia;</hi> This is very notorious, and cannot be denied. But is there no difference between <hi>Temporal Power</hi> and <hi>Politie,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Politie</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> consisting in the exercise of <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> onely? between <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> paramount to all the Power of the Kings of the Earth, and <hi>Ecclesiastical Politie,</hi> subject to be many ways limited and regulated by the Civil Power? between procuring or advancing <hi>Spiritual Interests</hi> by such an infinite Temporal Power and Secular Politie, and procuring and advancing men's <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Secular Interests</hi> by Ecclesiastical Politie or Government, onely as the Civil Power shall require, or allow?

Argument, and so deserves not to be consider'd. And to the rest of that Paragraph, I think enough has been said already.</p>
            <p>You say:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 54.</note> 
               <hi>Commonwealths, or Civil Societies and Governments, if you will believe the judicious Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>are as St.</hi> Peter <hi>calls them</hi> (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>judicious Mr.</hi> Hooker (as you justly call him,) if you would have it thought, that he so referrs Civil Society and Publick Government to the <hi>Contrivance and Institution of Man,</hi> as either to exclude <hi>God Almighty</hi> from having any hand in it, or to leave men to their choice, whether they will live in such Society or not, or for what Ends they will enter into it: The least that can be said is, that you do very much mistake him. For though he asserts,<note place="margin">

               </note> that all Publick Regiment arose from <hi>deliberate Advice, Consultation,</hi>

               <hi>and Composition between men, judging it convenient and behoveful; there being no impossibility in Nature consider'd by it self, but that men might have lived without any Publick Regiment:</hi> And that, as to the <hi>kinds</hi> of Regiment, <hi>Nature ties not to any one, but leaves the choice as a thing arbitrary:</hi> Yet he asserts withall expresly, that we are <hi>naturally induced to seek Communion and Fellowship with others;</hi> and that <hi>this was the cause of men's uniting themselves at first in Politick Societies;</hi> and that, <hi>the corruption of our nature being presupposed, we may not deny, but that the Law of Nature does now

require of necessity some kind of Regiment.</hi> By which it appears, that how much soever he allows, in respect of the particular Forms of Commonwealths, or Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and even to the <hi>judicious Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>God</hi> is the Author and <hi>Institutor</hi> of Civil Society in general; then the <hi>Ends</hi> of it, as your self must grant, can be no other than what <hi>He</hi> has appointed: and all that is left to the Choice and Contrivance of Man, is onely the framing and modelling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and the Government of them, as Prudence shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, for the better attaining the Ends which He has fix'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
            <p>You say St. <hi>Peter</hi> shews, in the place you referr to, <hi>for what End Commonwealths are instituted,</hi> viz. <hi>for the punishment of evil-doers, and the praise of them that do well.</hi> But you say you do not find any where, <hi>that it is for the punishment of those who are not in Church-Communion with the Magistrate.</hi> Nor do I any where say it is. But if rejecting the true Religion, or declining the Communion of the Church of God, be <hi>doing evil;</hi> then they that do so, are <hi>Evil-doers:</hi> and then you see what you get by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words.</p>
            <p>But you say you are <hi>sure the Ends of Commonwealths, appointed by the Institutors of them, could not be their Spiritual and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My saying,<note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note> that to argue, as the Author does, that <hi>the Civil Power neither can nor ought in any manner to be extended to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls,<note place="margin">L.<hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> because the Care of Souls is not committed to the Civil Magistrate, more than to other men,</hi> is onely <hi>to prove the thing by its self,</hi> is undoubtedly true in the sense of the word <hi>extended</hi> which I there take it in.

            <p>To shew that <hi>the Care of Souls is not committed to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, any more than to other men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> the Author endeavours to prove that it is neither committed to him <hi>by God,</hi> nor <hi>by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Now in my <hi>Answer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22.</note> I think I shew that he fails as to both these Points; so that whether we say the Care of Souls is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Magistrate <hi>by God,</hi> or that it is vested in him by the <hi>consent of the People,</hi> either of these Assertions may be true, for any thing he has said to prove the contrary. Particularly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he says, that no such Power (as the Care of Souls committed to the Magistrate implies) can be vested in the Magistrate by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People, <hi>because no man can so far abandon the care of his own Salvation, as blindly to leave it to the choice of any other, whether Prince or Subject, to prescribe to him what Faith or Worship he shall embrace:</hi> To this I answer, <q>That as the Power of the Magistrate in reference to Religion (or the Salvation of Souls) is ordain'd for the bringing men to take such care as they ought of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that they may not blindly leave it to the choice, neither of any other Person, nor yet of their own Lusts and Passions, to prescribe to them what Faith or Worship they shall embrace: So if we suppose this Power to be vested in the Magistrate by the consent of the People; this will not import their abandoning the care of their Salvation, but rather the contrary.</q> And so I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to shew that it is every man's <hi>interest,</hi> in respect of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the Magistrate should have such a Power committed to him. Now what exception do you make to this? Why, you say <hi>this is a pleasant Answer</hi>; and you desire me to consider, 1. <hi>Whether it be not pleasant that I say the Power of the Magistrate is ordain'd to bring men to take such care;</hi>

               </note> and thence inferr, Then it is every man's Interest to vest such Power in the Magistrate? Well, Sir; I have consider'd this, but can by no means discern where the <hi>Pleasantness</hi> of it lies. For if the Power I speak of, be of such a nature as I have represented it; it will follow unavoidably, not onely that the People may vest it in the Magistrate without <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the care of their Salvation,</hi> or <hi>leaving it blindly to the choice of another to prescribe to them what Faith or Worship they shall embrace;</hi> but likewise, that it is every one's <hi>Interest</hi> (supposing it in his power) to vest it in him.</p>

               </gap>ing it his, before he receives it? Or cannot I say, that the Power of the Magistrate is such in the nature of it, that if we suppose it vested in him by the consent of the People, this will not import their <hi>abandoning the care of their Salvation,</hi> but rather the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the Interest of the People (supposing it in their power) to vest such a Power in him: Cannot I say this, without implying that the Magistrate has this Power <hi>already,</hi> before the People have vested it in him? What pretense can any man have to affirm this? especially considering, that my words do so plainly tend, as any man may see, to shew that the Power which I claim for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, does therefore belong to him, because it is vested in him either by God, or by the People: As it may be by either, for any thing the Author, or your self have said to the contrary.</p>

Another <hi>pleasant thing</hi> which you tell me I here say, is, That <hi>the Power of the Magistrate is to bring men to such a care of their Salvation that they may not blindly leave it to the choice of any person, or of their own lusts and passions, to prescribe to them what Faith or Worship they shall embrace; And yet that 'tis their best course t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For I speak not of the <hi>Magistrate's Religion,</hi> but of the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and that proposed with sufficient Evidence of the Truth of it. And if the People do onely vest a Power in the Magistrate, to punish them when they reject that Religion so proposed, to bring them to act <hi>according to Reason</hi> and <hi>sound Iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> I think that is far enough from leaving it to the choice of another man, to prescribe to them what Faith or Worship they shall embrace.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 60, 61:</note> when you say that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I give the Magistrate, of punishing men to make them consider Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Arguments proper and sufficient to convince them, is to convince them of the truth of his Religion (whatever that be) <hi>and to bring them to it.</hi> Which seems a little strange, and <hi>pleasant</hi> too. But thus you prove it: <hi>For men will never, in his opinion, act according to Reason and sound Iudgement, till they embrace his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if you have the brow of an honest man, you will not say the Magistrate will ever punish you to bring you to consider any other Reasons and Arguments but such as are proper to convince you of the truth of his Religion, and to bring you to that.</hi> Which (besides the pleasant talk of such <hi>Reasons and Arguments as are proper and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince men of the truth of the Magistrate's Religion,</hi> though it be a false one) is just as much as to say, It is so, because in the <hi>Magistrate's opinion</hi> it is so; and because it is not to be expected that he will act against his <hi>opinion.</hi> As if the Magistrate's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could change the nature of things, and turn a Power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the true Religion, into a Power to promote a false one. No, Sir: The Magistrate's Opinion has no such virtue. It may indeed keep him from exercising the Power he has to promote the true Religion; and it may lead him to abuse the pretense of it, to the promoting a False one: But it can neither destroy that Power, nor make it any thing but what it is. And therefore whatever the Magistrate's <hi>Opinion</hi> be, his <hi>Power</hi> was given him (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Power was to them) <hi>for edification</hi> onely, <hi>not for destruction</hi>: And it may always be said of him (what St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of himself) that he <hi>can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> And therefore if the Magistrate punishes me, to bring me to a False Religion; it is not his <hi>Opinion</hi> that will excuse him, when he comes to answer for it to his Judge. For certainly men are as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Opinions (those of them, I mean, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their Practice) as they are for their Actions.</p>
            <p>Here is therefore no <hi>shifting forwards and backwards,</hi> as you pretend; nor any <hi>Circle,</hi> but in your own Imagination. For though it be true that I say <hi>The Magistrate has no Power to punish men, to compell them to his Religion;</hi> yet I no where say, nor will it follow from any thing I do say, That he has Power <hi>to compell them to consider Reasons and Arguments proper to convince them of the truth of</hi> his <hi>Religion.</hi> But I do not much wonder that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put this upon me. For I think by this time it is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <hi>P.</hi> 61.</note>Your next Paragraph runs high, and charges me with nothing less than <hi>Prevarication.</hi> For whereas, as you tell me, I speak of it here as the most deplorable Condition imaginable, that men should be left to themselves, and not be forced to consider and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Grounds of their Religion, and search impartially and diligently after the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It seems all the <hi>Remedy</hi> I offer is no more than this, <hi>Dissenters must be punish'd.</hi> Upon which thus you insult: <hi>Can any body that hears you say so, believe you in earnest; and that want of Examination is the thing you would have amended, when want of Examination is not the thing you would have punish'd? —But if in all your Treatise you can shew me one place where you say that the Ignorant, the Careless, the Inconsiderate, the negligent in examining,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are to be punish'd, I will allow your Remedy for a good one. But you have not said any thing like this; and which is more, I tell you before hand you dare not say it. And whilst you do not, the World has reason to judge, that however want of Examination be a general Fault, which you with great vehemency have exaggerated; yet you use it only for a pretense to punish Dissenters; and either distrust your Remedy, or else care not to have it generally cured.</hi> Now here I acknowledge, that though want or neglect of Examination be a general Fault, yet the Method I propose for curing it, does not reach to all that are guilty of it, but is limited to those who reject the true Religion, proposed to them with sufficient Evidence. But then to let you see how little ground you have to say that I <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate</hi> in this matter, I shall onely desire you to consider, what it is that the Author and my self were enquiring after. For it is not, What course is to be taken to <hi>confirm</hi> and establish those in the Truth, who have already embraced it: Nor, How they may be enabled to <hi>propagate</hi> it to others: (For both which purposes I have already acknowledged it very useful, and a thing much to be desired, that all such persons should, as far as they are able, search into the Grounds upon which their Religion stands, and challenges their belief:) But the Subject of our enquiry is onely, What Method is to be used, to <hi>bring</hi> men to the true Religion. Now if this be the onely thing we were enquiring after, (as you cannot deny it to be;) then every one sees that in speaking to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43698:37"/>
this Point, I had nothing to do with any who have already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the true Religion; because they are not to be <hi>brought</hi> to that Religion, but onely to be <hi>confirm'd</hi> and <hi>edified</hi> in it; but was onely to consider how those who <hi>reject</hi> it, may be brought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. So that how much soever any of those who own the true Religion, may be guilty of neglect of Examination; 'tis evident, I was onely concern'd to shew how it may be <hi>cured</hi> in those, who, by reason of it, reject the true Religion, duly proposed or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to them. And certainly to confine my self to this, is not to <hi>prevaricate,</hi> unless to keep within the bounds which the Question under debate prescribes me, be to prevaricate.</p>
            <p>In telling me therefore that I <hi>dare not say that the Ignorant, the Careless, the Inconsiderate, the negligent in examining, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e. <hi>all</hi> that are such) <hi>are to be punish'd,</hi> you onely tell me that I <hi>dare</hi> not be impertinent. And therefore I hope you will excuse me, if I take no notice of the three <hi>Reasons</hi> you offer in your next Page, for your saying so. And yet if I had had a mind to talk imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently; I know not why I might not have <hi>dared</hi> to do so, as well as other men.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more in this Paragraph, which though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more pertinent than the rest, I shall not wholly pass over. It lies in these words: <hi>He that reads your Treatise with attention, will be more confirm'd in this Opinion</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> That I use want of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination onely for a pretense to punish Dissenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>when he shall find, that you (who are so earnest to have men punish'd, to bring them to consider and examine, that so they may discover the way of Salvation) have not said one word of considering, searching, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to the Scripture; which had been as good a Rule for a Christian to have sent them to, as to Reasons and Arguments proper to convince them of you know not what,</hi> &amp;c. How this <hi>confirms</hi> that <hi>Opinion,</hi> I do not see; nor have you thought fit to instruct me. But as to the thing it self, <hi>viz.</hi> my <hi>not saying one word of considering, searching, and hearkening to the Scripture,</hi> whatever advantage a captious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary may imagine he has in it, I hope it will not seem strange to any indifferent and judicious Person, who shall but consider that throughout my Treatise, I speak of the true Religion onely in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> i. e. not as limited to any particular Dispensation, or to the Times of the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; but as reaching from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of the World; and so comprehending the Times which preceeded the Scriptures; wherein yet God <hi>left not himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witness,</hi> but furnished Mankind with sufficient means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43698:38"/>
Him and his Will, in order to their eternal Salvation. For I appeal to all Men of Art, whether, speaking of the true Religion under this generality, I could be allowed to descend to any such <hi>Rules</hi> of it, as belong only to some particular Times, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations: Such as you cannot but acknowledge the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testaments</hi> to be.</p>

Whereas, on the contrary, in a Discourse of this nature, where the bounds of Right and Wrong are enquired into, and should be establish'd, the Magistrate was to be shew'd the bounds of his Authority, and warn'd of the injury he did when he misapplies his Power, and punish'd any man who deserv'd it not; and not be sooth'd into injustice, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of gain that might thence accrue to the Sufferer. Shall we do evil that good may come of it? There are a sort of People who are very wary of touching upon the Magistrate's duty, and tender of shewing the bounds of his Power, and the injustice and ill consequences of his misapplying it; at least, so long as it is misapplied in favour of them, and their Party.</hi> As to what you say here of the <hi>nature</hi> of my <hi>Discourse,</hi> I shall onely put you in mind, that the Question there debated is, Whether the Magistrate has any Right or Authority to use Force for the promoting the <hi>true</hi> Religion. Which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>supposes</hi> the Unlawfulness and Injustice of using Force to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a false Religion, as granted on both sides.

            <p>Nor am I any more concern'd in what you say of the Magistrate's misapplying his Power <hi>in favour of a Party.</hi> For as you have not yet proved that his applying his Power to the promoting the true Religion (which is all that I contend for) is <hi>misapplying</hi> it; so much less can you prove it to be <hi>misapplying it in favour of a Party.</hi>

And can he be <hi>encouraged</hi> to this, by hearing what others may <hi>gain</hi> by what (without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) must cost him so dear? 'Tis true indeed, the Apostate Emperour (who yet, by the way, was <hi>for</hi> Toleration, and talk'd much of his <gap reason="foreign">

But had he believed the Promises made to Christians, he would have believed the Threats likewise which the Gospel denounces against their Persecutors. And can any man think he would have been so mad, as to deprive them of their Goods and Possessions, that they might <hi>gain</hi> the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> when he knew that he should himself get nothing in the end but damnation by it?</p>

If Force,</hi> i. e. <hi>Punishment, may be any way useful for the promoting the Salvation of Souls, there is a Right somewhere to use it. And this Rights is in the Magistrate.

                  </gap>its his inclination, or serves his turn, to punish men directly to bring them to his Religion. For if he may use Force, because it may be, indirectly, and at a distance, any way, useful towards the Salvation of Souls, towards the procuring any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory; Why may he not, by the same Rule, use it where it may be useful, at least indirectly, and at a distance, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a greater degree of Glory? For St.</hi> Paul <hi>assures us, that the Afflictions of this life work for us a far more exceeding weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43698:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So that why should they not be punish'd, if in the wrong, to bring them into the right way; If in the right, to make them by their Sufferings gainers of a far more exceeding weight of Glory?</hi> But as prettily as this looks, I fear, if it be examined, it will not be found sufficient to prove even that little which you pretend to prove by it.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>first,</hi> you must give me leave to ask you once more, Where I say, <hi>If Force may be any way useful for the promoting the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls, there is a Right somewhere to use it?</hi> For in the Page you referr to, the words are <q>If there be so great Use and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of outward Force for the promoting true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, &amp;c.</q> Nor do I any where speak otherwise, that I know.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>secondly,</hi> let it be supposed if you please, that I say what you so often tell me I do, though I do not: Yet even so, unless it be as <hi>necessary</hi> for men to attain any <hi>greater degree</hi> of Glory, as it is to attain <hi>Glory,</hi> it will not follow, that if the Magistrate may use Force, because it may be indirectly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> useful towards the procuring <hi>any degree</hi> of Glory, he may by the same Rule, use it where it may be in that manner useful towards the procuring a <hi>greater degree</hi> of Glory. But that there is the same Necessity of men's attaining a <hi>greater degree</hi> of Glory, as there is of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Glory,</hi> no man will affirm. For without attaining <hi>Glory,</hi> they cannot escape the damnation of Hell: which yet they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, without attaining any <hi>greater degree</hi> of Glory. So that the attaining <hi>Glory,</hi> is absolutely necessary: but the attaining any <hi>greater degree</hi> of it, however desirable, it is not <hi>so</hi> necessary. Now if there be not the same Necessity of the one of these, as there is of the other; there can be <hi>no pretense</hi> to say, that whatever is lawful in respect to the one of them, is likewise so in respect to the other. And therefore thought St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us that <hi>the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this Life work for us a far more exceeding weight of Glory;</hi> it will not follow from thence, even <hi>by the Rule</hi> which you make for me, but is not mine, That <hi>if men be in the right way, they may be punish'd to make them by their Sufferings gainers of a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of Glory.</hi> So that your <hi>some pretense of Right,</hi> which was all that in modesty you could undertake to prove, comes at last to just none at all.</p>
            <p>But how unfortunate was I, to talk of the Magistrate's <hi>misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his Power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 66.</note> when he punishes those who have the Right on their side!</hi> For by granting that, it seems I <hi>grant all that the Author
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43698:40"/>
contends for,</hi> and so give up the Cause I undertook to defend. So you tell me, Sir: and thus you think you prove what you say. <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>if the Magistrate misapplies, or makes a wrong use of his Power, when he punishes in matters of Religion any one who is in the Right, though it be but to make him consider; he also misapplies his Power, when he punishes any one, whomsoever in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to make him consider</hi> . Which is certainly as wonderful a Collection as any you make in your whole Letter: As any man may see, that will but compare the Magistrate's <hi>punishing in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion any one who is in the Right to make him consider,</hi> with his <hi>punishing any one whomsoever</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> any one who is in the Wrong) <hi>in matters of Religion, to make him consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, first, to punish one who is <hi>in the Right,</hi> is to punish one who does not <hi>deserve</hi> to be punish'd; which is manifestly unjust, whatever the end be for which he is punish'd. But to punish one who is in the <hi>Wrong,</hi> and refuses to consider what may convince him of the Right, (and such onely are the persons whom I would have punish'd,) is onely to punish one who well <hi>deserves</hi> to be punish'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which no man can pretend to be unjust.</p>
            <p>Again; To punish one who is <hi>in the Right,</hi> to make him consider what may shew him the Right, and move him to embrace it (which is the thing we mean here by <hi>considering,</hi>) is vain and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; because he does already discern and embrace the Right, and therefore <hi>needs</hi> not be made consider, to bring him to embrace it. But to punish one who is in the Wrong, and can by no othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> means be prevail'd upon to consider what may manifest the Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to him; I say, to punish such a one to make him consider, is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reasonable and necessary; because it is <hi>necessary</hi> for him to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</hi> and Punishment is <hi>necessary</hi> to bring him to consider.</p>
            <p>Now if these Cases are so widely different: If in the first o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them, the Magistrate punishes where there is neither any <hi>desert,</hi> nor any <hi>need,</hi> or <hi>use</hi> of Punishment, but in the other, he punishes where Punishment is both <hi>deserv'd,</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to be inflicted: Is there any imaginable ground to say, That if the Magistrate mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applies, or makes a wrong use of his Power, in the first Case, he does so likewise in the other?</p>
            <p>Yes, you think there is. <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>every one is here Iudge for himself, what is Right; And in matters of Faith, and Religious Worship, another cannot judge for him. So that to punish any one in matters of Religion, though it be but to make him consider, is by your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Confession, beyond the Magistrate's Power. And that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43698:40"/>
in matters of Religion is beyond the Magistrate's Power, is (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) what the Author contends for.</hi> Which <hi>Demostration</hi> of yours; if I may have leave to put it into from, stands thus:</p>
            <q>Whoever takes upon him to judge for another, what is
Right in matters of Religion, takes upon him to do what
no man can do.</q>
            <q>But whoever punishes any man in matters of Religion, to
make him consider, takes upon him to judge for another,
what is Right in matters of Religion.</q>
            <q>Therefore whoever punishes any one in Matters of Religion,
to make him consider, takes upon him to do what no man
can do: and consequently misapplies his Power of punishing,
if he has that Power.</q>
            <p>Where if the Second Proposition were as evidently true, as the First is; I should readily admit the Conclusion, as sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. But if that Proposition be so far from being evidently true, that, on the contrary, it is certainly false, and plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a Contradiction in it; then you must give me some better proof of the Conclusion, before I shall be obliged to assent to it. Now (a little to examine that Proposition;) Why, I beseech you, does any one punish another to <hi>make him consider</hi>? Is it not, that that other may <hi>judge for himself,</hi> of what he is required to <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi> For as he that will <hi>judge</hi> of any matter, must first <hi>consider</hi> it; (according to that old Rule, <hi>Si judicas, cognosce</hi>:) So I know no use there is of <hi>considering,</hi> but in order to <hi>judging.</hi> And can he who punishes another <hi>to make him consider,</hi> that he may judge <hi>for himself</hi> of the matter to be consider'd, intend to <hi>judge for him,</hi> whom he punishes to make him <hi>judge for himself?</hi> If this be manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious and impossible, (as it must be acknowledged to be;) then every one sees that it is so far from being evidently true, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever punishes any one in Matters of Religion, to make him consider, takes upon him to judge for another what is Right in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that it is repugnant and absurd to say, that any man, who punishes another to make him <hi>consider,</hi> does at the same time take upon him to <hi>judge for that person,</hi> in any <hi>matter</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Thus you see with how little reason you say, that <hi>by granting that the Magistrate misapplies his Power, when he punishes those who have the Right on their side, I grant all that the Author contends for.</hi> Indeed if I had said that the Magistrate does <hi>therefore,</hi> in that Case, misapply his Power, because <hi>whoever punishes any one in matters of Religion to make him consider, takes upon him to judge for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43698:41"/>

               <hi>Why should not the care of every man's Soul be left to himself, rather than the Magistrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Is the Magistrate like to be more concern'd for it? Is the Magistrate like to take more care of it?</hi> &amp;c. As if not to leave the care of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's Soul to <hi>himself alone,</hi> were, as you express it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to <hi>take the care of men's Souls from themselves:</hi> Or as if to vest a Power in the Magistrate, to procure as much as in him lies (<hi>i.e.</hi> as far as it can be procured by convenient Penalties) that men take such care of their Souls as they ought to do, were to leave the care of their Souls <hi>to the Magistrate, rather than to themselves:</hi> Which no man but your self will imagine. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as freely as you can do, that as every man is more concern'd than any man else can be, so he is likewise more obliged, to take care of his Soul; and that no man can by any means be discharged of the care of his Soul; which, when all is done, will never be saved but by his own care of it. But do I contradict any thing of this, when I say, that the care of every man's Soul ought not to be left to <hi>himself alone?</hi> or, that it is the Interest of Mankind, that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> be entrusted and obliged to take care, as far as lies in him, that no man neglect his own Soul? I thought, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that every man was in some sort charged with the care of his <hi>Neigbour's</hi> Soul. But in your way of reasoning, he that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43698:41"/>
affirms this, takes away the care of every man's Soul from <hi>himself,</hi> and leaves it to his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> rather than to himself. But if this be plainly absurd; as every one sees it is; then so it must be likewise, to say, that he that vests such a Power as we here speak of in the Magistrate, <hi>takes away the care of mens Souls from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and places it in the <hi>Magistrate, rather than in themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What trifling then is it, to say here, <hi>If you cannot lay your hand upon your Heart, and say all this (viz.</hi> that the Magistrate is <hi>like to be more concern'd for other men's Souls, than themselves,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>What then will be got by the change?</hi> For 'tis plain, here is no such <hi>change</hi> as you would insinuate; but the care of Souls which I assert to the Magistrate, is so far from discharging any man of the care of his own Soul, or lessening his obligation to it, that it serves to no other purpose in the world, but to bring men, who otherwise would not, to consider and do what the Interest of their Souls obliges them to.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore manifest, that the thing here to be consider'd, is not, Whether the Magistrate be <hi>like to be more concern'd for other men's Souls,</hi> or <hi>to take more care of them, than themselves:</hi> nor, Whether he be <hi>commonly more careful of his own Soul, than other men are of theirs:</hi> nor, Whether he be <hi>less exposed,</hi> in matters of Religion, <hi>to Prejudices, Humours, and crafty Seducers, then other men:</hi> nor yet, Whether he be not <hi>more in danger to be in the wrong, than other men, in regard that he never meets with the great and onely Antidote of</hi> mine (as you call it) <hi>against Err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r which</hi> I <hi>here call Molestation.</hi> But the Point upon which this matter turns, is onely this, Whether the Salvation of Souls, be not better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, if the Magistrate be obliged to procure, as much as in him lies, that every man take such care as he ought of his Soul, than if he be not so obliged, but the care of every man's Soul be left to himself alone: Which certainly any man of common Sense may easily determine. For as you will not, I suppose, deny, but God has more amply provided for the Salvation of your own Soul, by obliging your Neighbour, as well as your self, to take care of it; though 'tis possible your Neighbour may not be <hi>more concern'd</hi> for it, than your self; or may not be <hi>more careful</hi> of his own Soul, than you are of yours; or may be no less <hi>exposed,</hi> in matters of Religion, <hi>to Prejudices, &amp;c.</hi> than you are; Because if you are your self wanting to your own Soul, it is more likely that you will be brought to take care of it, if your Neighbour be obliged to admonish and exhort you to it, than if he be not; though it may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43698:42"/>
fall out that he will not do what he is obliged to do in that case: So I think it cannot be denied, but the Salvation of all men's Souls is better provided for, if besides the obligation which every man has to take care of his own Soul (and that which every man's Neighbour has likewise to do it) the Magistrate also be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted and obliged to see that no man neglect his Soul, then it would be, if every man were left to himself in this matter: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though we should admit that the Magistrate is not <hi>like to be,</hi> or is not ordinarily, <hi>more concern'd for other men's Souls, than they themselves are, &amp;c.</hi> it is nevertheless undeniably true still, that whoever neglects his Soul, is more likely to be brought to take care of it, if the Magistrate be obliged to do what lies in him to bring him to do it, than if he be not. Which is enough to shew, that it is every man's <hi>true Interest,</hi> that the care of his Soul should not be left to himself alone, but that the Magistrate should be so far entrusted with it as I contend that he is.</p>
            <p>Having thus, Sir, as I think, consider'd all that is material in your Letter, and a great deal more; I now <hi>referr</hi> it (if I may use your words) <hi>to your self,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 67.</note> as well as to the judgement of the World, Whether the Author of the Letter,</hi> and your self, <hi>in saying no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has a Right;</hi> or I, <hi>in saying the Magistrate has a Right to use</hi> some degrees of <hi>Force in Matters of Religion, have most Reason.</hi> If you think the advantage lies on your side, and shall do me the favour to let me know why you think so; I shall consider what you say, with all the care I can use, and with a mind as well d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if upon such a consideration of what is offer'd, I find my self in an Error; I shall freely acknowledge my Conviction with all thankfulness; nor shall I be ashamed even publickly to retract my Error. But if instead of satisfactory Reason, I meet with nothing but Sophistry, and unfair dealing; I am apt to think I shall content my self with what I have already said: being now sufficiently sensible, that Cavils and Impertinencies are endless, when a Man of Parts shall not disdain to make use of them.</p>
