            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have been Perſwaded by ſome Private Friends, that
the Publication of the following Diſcourſe is not at
this time of day to be declin'd. Some People will,
doubtleſs, be angry, that their foul Play is brought upon
the Stage, and thus openly taxt. For this reaſon, I am bold
to engage Your Lordſhip in my Intereſts, and to ſhelter
my ſelf under Your Great and Honourable Name. Your
Honour will (I hope) the more eaſily pardon me herein,
ſince Your own Intereſt alſo is not a little concern'd. It is
not my Diſpoſition to expoſe any Mans Mistake, whilſt it
keeps in doors, and contains its ſelf within any bounds of
Modeſty and Privacy. In this caſe, certainly 'tis better to
mourn for it in ſecret, at moſt to rebuke it in a Corner. But
when 'tis made Notorious; when it boldly ſtares us in the
Face and is avow'd for Truth, when an Error, which one
would have hop'd was an unwilling One, is Supported by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
which muſt be Confeſt and Believ'd a wilful One:
That is, when the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government (or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational,
<pb facs="tcp:43545:3"/>
I can't tell which) is publickly maintain'd by a Text
of Scripture manifeſtly Corrupted, ſurely 'tis high time then
to make the World Senſible of the Artifice. I had ſome Years
before Diſcover'd the Falſe Reading here ſpoken of, but held
my peace. At length, wben I found that the Corruption, like
a Gangren, had ſpread its ſelf into ſeveral Editions of the
Bible here in <hi>England,</hi> and, God knows, how many in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and there vouch't for Good, I could not prevail with
my ſelf to be ſilent any longer, and I hope the ſame Good
Zeal will Inspire Your Honour with a Reſolution to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
ſuch Injuries Offer'd unto the <hi>Holy Word</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> Nor is this the only Inſtance of the kind. In the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
Petition for Peace above years ſince, <hi>Acts 15.
18. v.</hi> is thus cited—<hi>To lay upon you no greater
burden than neceſſary things,</hi> that ſmall word <hi>theſe</hi>
being cunningly left out meerly to ſupport their Propoſition,
Mr. <hi>B</hi>—who drew up the Petition,<note place="margin">Champ. Chal. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Dr. <hi>Hook</hi> late Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of <hi>Halifax.</hi>
               </note> and ſince has been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
charg'd for thus abuſing the Scripture, tho' he forgot
not to Acquaint us with the moſt trivial, yea ridiculous, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of his Life, yet had not the Ingenuity to confeſs his
Errror, nor yet the Courage to Paliate it with any Excuſe.
<hi>My Lord,</hi> I have now done, after I ſhall have made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Acknowledgment, as I now do, of the many great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

               <q>Add not thou unto his Word leſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thee, and thou be found a Liar.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Argument I am about to treat of
is weighty, and not eaſily compriz'd
in one ſingle Diſcourſe. It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concern me to huſband my time as thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
as may be, and chiefly to lay aſide all
thoughts of further Preface.</p>
            <p>The Text is a Negative Precept forbidding
all manner of Corrupting the Holy Scriptures,
and that under a double Caution:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Leſt God reprove thee</hi> for it, a terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation.</p>
            <p>2. Leſt <hi>thou be found a Liar,</hi> One of the moſt
deteſtable Sins in the ſight both of God and
Man. That by <hi>His Word</hi> is meant the Word
of God is manifeſt from the Verſe foregoing—<hi>Every Word of God is pure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 5.</note> Then it follows—
<hi>Add not thou unto his Word,</hi> i. e. to the Word of
God. That we at this day are to underſtand
hereby the written Word or Scriptures is not
to be queſtion'd, there being now no other
Word of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> but that which is <hi>written for our
Inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43545:4"/>
When the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> ſays, <hi>Add not;</hi> He muſt
be ſupply'd thus, neither diminiſh from the
Word. For ſo the Parallel places in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
do warrant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the Word,
neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it. Thou ſhalt
not add thereunto neither diminiſh from it,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
to the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> For the Holy Spirit does
not always expreſs things to the full, but leaves
'em oft times to be made up out of ſome other
places; hinting here but briefly what elſewhere
he more fully ſets forth. For which reaſon
therefore I would read the Text thus, <hi>Add not
thou unto his Word, neither diminiſh ought from it.</hi> And
then (as I ſaid) the Text is levell'd againſt all
manner of Corrupting the Word. One Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Inſtance of which I ſhall produce by and
by, the chief Reaſon of my undertaking this
Subject. I will confine my ſelf unto the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
in handling whereof my method ſhall be.</p>
            <p>1. To lay before you Negatively ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which though they may ſeem to be, yet are
not adding to, nor diminiſhing from, the Word.</p>
            <p>2. I will ſhew poſitively when we either
add or diminiſh, or both, contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
here given. 1. Negatively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that in
the following eaſes: It is not an adding unto the
Word, when we explain and fill up any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of Scripture out of ſome other places—
wherein we find the Truth more fully expreſt.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43545:4"/>
For in this conſiſts the very Office and Duty of
a Preacher, and Explainer of the Scripture.
And this I plead for my ſufficient Warrant in
taking the liberty of ſupplying the Text out of
other Parallel Places, as you ſee I have done. 2. It
is not diminiſhing from the Word, when we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Titles of the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> Nor is it
adding to the Word when we prefix the <hi>Latine</hi>
Titles to 'em.</p>
            <p>There was of late a Gentleman who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Nonconformiſts alledg'd againſt the
eſtabliſht Worſhip.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>De Laune</hi> in Lr. to Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi> page 43.</note> 
               <q>That in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> uſed
in the Liturgy are left out the Antient <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Titles, which are <hi>(ſays he)</hi> Original and Parts
of the H. Scripture, having a tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the unfolding the Myſteries therein
contain'd.</q> And he quarrels at the <hi>Latine</hi> Titles
prefixt thereunto. But it were well if the
Diſſenters, whoſe Cauſe he pleads, would firſt
prove that thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Titles are Original
and Eſſential Parts of the Holy Scripture, and
then if they are ſo, that they would give us a
Reaſon why in that very Tranſlation, which
they approve and make uſe of, thoſe Original
Titles are indeed retain'd, but in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Language ſtill in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the People; or why the Tranſlation of
'em into plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is not always placed at
the head of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but often caſt into the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43545:5"/>
Margent, as if they were ſomething elſe than
Scripture; neither of which ought to be, if theſe
Titles be part of, and ſo uſeful towards, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
the Senſe of the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And hereupon I
aſk whether this is not a ſufficient Intimation,
that they are not of a Certainty, what they are
confidently affirm'd to be, <hi>Viz.</hi> Original. I
would moreover be reſolv'd what thoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
are which thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Titles do unfold:
Whether the Diſſenters read 'em to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and if they do, whether the People
are one jot the wiſer or underſtand the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Pſalter, ever a whit the better for 'em.
Laſtly, I deſire to know, why they do not affix
'em, or rather the Tranſlation of 'em to the
front of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Metre and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſing 'em: All which ought to be done, if they are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Parts of the Pſalms</note> But if they deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
theſe ſmaller faults, be it ſo yet, <hi>Aequum eſt
peccatis veniam poſcentes reddere rurſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let then the World judge, whether this Author
ſought not an occaſion of quarrel againſt us
and yet found none, except what involves his
own Party in the ſame condemnation. As for
the <hi>Latine</hi> Titles they are (any one may know,)
but the firſt words of every <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſo by
conſequence undoubted Parts of Scripture, as
edifying too as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Titles are. In ſhort,
that they are borrow'd from the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Yea the whole <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> may
be granted and defended too. For ſo were
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Titles from the Modern <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43545:5"/>
'Tis not, I confeſs, worth while to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of ſuch Stuff as this, and I am really aſham'd
of the Digreſſion. But the Peeviſhneſs of an
Adverſary will ſometimes extort a Reply, tho'
it deſerves it not; and it may be fit now and then
to let the Contentious ſee their own Folly and
Frowardneſs.</p>
            <p>I conclude then that the leaving out the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Titles is no diminiſhing, nor the affixing the
<hi>Latine</hi> an adding to, the Word of God.</p>
            <p>3. It is not diminiſhing from the Word, when
we, intending to feed the flock of Chriſt with
the ſincere Milk of the Word, read ſome few Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of a Chap. omitting the reſt for that time.
The foremention'd Writer excepts againſt the
reading the Epiſtles and Goſpels,<note place="margin">De L. page 44.</note> telling us, thus.
<q>That 'tis a curtailing or mangling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that thereby they become quite another
thing than the Evangeliſts intended in the
Goſpels, or the Apoſtles in the Epiſtles, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ruining the Scope and Connexion in
divers places.</q> It is the manner of ſome Men
to accuſe ſtoutly, and in the general without
offering any one Inſtance to ſhew the Truth of
their objection. For tho' nothing be prov'd,
yet ſomething will ſtick, and at this rate who
can hope to be found innocent?</p>
            <p>But it might upon ſecond Thoughts have
been remembred, That the Diſſenters 'emſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43545:6"/>
oft-times ſing but two, ſometimes but one Staff
of a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and yet this is not a curtailing and
mangling the <hi>Pſalms:</hi> That the Scriptures were
not divided by the inſpired Pen-men into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well as not into theſe ſhorter Paragraphs
or Sections, which we call Epiſtles and Goſpels;
that there is a Connexion many times between
Chapter and Chapter, and yet the reading of a
ſingle Chapter is not accounted a making the
Scripture to become quite another thing than
was intended. <hi>Loripedem Rectus deridat, Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem
Albus.</hi> Surely it might have been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that there are two ſorts of Senſes in every
ſmall Section of Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. A Relative.</p>
            <p>2. A Separate or Independent Senſe. The
Relative Senſe (it's true) cannot be underſtood
without the Neighbouring Parts; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is not thereby quite ruin'd. In ſaying ſo
the Gentleman o'reſhort himſelf, and by obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
too much, prov'd nothing at all againſt
us. For to omit is not to deſtroy. And if it be
neceſſary to read as much Scripture at one time,
as there is a Connexion between the Parts, then
muſt the Diſſenters read many Chapters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
peradventure whole Books, and ſing
ſome of the longeſt <hi>Pſalms</hi> without Intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Finally then, if the Diſſenters can ſhew any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43545:6"/>
one Epiſtle or Goſpel, wherein the Relative Senſe
is altogether ruin'd, or the ſeparate Senſe in any
wiſe injur'd, I promiſe then to ſubſcribe to the
Objectors judgment in this and all others his raſh
accuſations of us. When O Lord, O when ſhall
we find Truth and Peace and Sincerity upon the
Earth? When ſhall all unneceſſary Squabbles
ceaſe from among us Men?</p>
            <p>4. It is not adding to the Word, when ſeveral
Paſſages tending to the ſame purpoſe, tho' found
in diſtant places or different Books of Scripture,
yet are caſt into one complex Sentence or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
<note place="margin">

not the inſpired Pen-men of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
quoted ſome Texts out of the Old from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Places and Authors, twiſting 'em together
as one entire and complex Paſſage? Doubtleſs
there are Examples of this kind to be met with;
I will content my ſelf with a ſingle one.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54, 55.</note> 
               <hi>Then

being borrow'd Part from the Prophet I ſay, and

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 25. 8.</note> is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> cited as one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and intire Teſtimony of Scripture.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14.</note> In like
manner, theſe three Verſes are to be found at leaſt
ſcatter'd up and down in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> part

and <hi>3d</hi> Verſes.<note place="margin">See Iſ. 59. 7, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If this anſwers not Expectation,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 33.</note> I add further,
That St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>3d</hi> Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> has
ſubjoyn'd the 3. Objected Verſes, immediately
to the <hi>3d v.</hi> of the <hi>14th Pſ.</hi> 
               <q>As it is written
(ſays he,) There is none that doth good, no not
one: Their throat is an open Sepulchre &amp; ſo on
to the end of the three objected Verſes.</q> Surely
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> may at leaſt excuſe,
if not juſtifie, this ſuppos'd Alteration of the
<hi>Pſalms.</hi> It is rather to be feared that the Objector
himſelf had a deſign upon the Scripture: Whilſt
he is accuſing us for adding thereto, himſelf is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
from it; and rather than ſpare us, is
calling into Queſtion the great Apoſtle of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> for adding to the Word.</p>
            <p>But above all, with what Effrontery could this
learned Man &amp; ſkill'd in the Original Languages
(as he pretends,) tell his Readers, that thoſe three
Verſes are not in any of the Original Copies? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his own Party has hitherto believ'd him,
but if they will give me leave, I'll open their eyes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43545:7"/>
in a very few words. For (not to take Notice of
that abſurd ſaying <hi>Original Copies,</hi> which he would
or ſhould have ſaid Copies of the Original,) what
are we to think of the <hi>Greek?</hi> That certainly is to be
accounted One of the Originals, if there be more
than One, as himſelf ſeems to intimate. And there
I read juſt as I read in the Liturgy Tranſlation,
and as I read in St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Again I might ſay with
the learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi> that the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy, for ought
I know, is of as good Authority as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> at
this day is, and for my Reaſons I ſend you to his
Hiſtory of the 70 Tranſlation: Only take this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you, that (as has been already noted)
St. <hi>Paul</hi> (which alſo the other holy Writers of the
New Teſtament generally do in other places)
follows the <hi>Greek,</hi> and not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy in
citing this <hi>14th Pſalm,</hi> which is no contemptible
Argument for the Authority of the 70. Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Briefly, we have this further Advantage on
our ſide, that 'tis more Probable the three contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Verſes might be left out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Copies, by the careleſneſs of the Tranſcribers,
than thruſt into the <hi>Greek</hi> by the Tranſlators.
'Tis eaſier (ſuppoſing 'em both honeſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere)
for Tranſcribers to omit, than Tranſlators
to add ſo much together of their own head.</p>
            <p>5. 'Tis not adding to, nor diminiſhing from,
nor corrupting the Word, when we Tranſlate it
into Vulgar Tongues. All Chriſtians have done
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43545:8"/>
ſo. Yea the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> 'emſelves in former Ages did
ſo, tho' of late, they have been contrary minded
for fear forſooth of miſtaking the Word, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
it.<note place="margin">Anastaſius Patr. of Ant. apud <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſerii Hiſt. Dogma. Multarum Gentium linguis Scriptura Tranſlata docet falſa eſſe quae addita ſunt.

Doubtleſs the Word of God may be
corrupted by Tranſcribing or Printing it, as well
as by Tranſlating it. Tranſcribing we know was,
&amp; Printing now a days is the Work often of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
&amp; mechanical Men, who are more liable to
miſtakes: but Tranſlating is the buſineſs of the
Learned. Ay, but St. <hi>Jerom</hi> confeſt himſelf ſubject
to miſtakes in Tranſlating the Scripture. Very
good! and yet he Tranſlated it for the uſe of the
<hi>Latine</hi> Chriſtians, and his Tranſlation is for the
moſt part read unto this day. Why then may not
a Learned Prieſt or Biſhop now a days render it

               </q> In ſhort even at this

and Practice of Antiquity, I mean the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglot
Bibles:</hi> So that the Catholick Church in the
Primitive Times, might have ſaid as the <hi>Jews</hi> did,
<hi>2d Acts, That they heard and read every one in his own
Tongue the wonderful Works and WORDS of God.</hi> But
ſetting aſide this, that it ſhould be lawful and ſafe
to have the Scripture Tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> only,
is to me a ſtrange <hi>Paradox.</hi> For what Priviledge
has God beſtow'd on the <hi>Latin</hi> more than on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tongues? All certainly one as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are capable of Miſtakes and Corruptions.
The <hi>Hebrew</hi> indeed had once the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Holy Language and (as I may ſay,) the
immediate Vehicle of the Divine Will. The <hi>Greek</hi>
ſucceeded next into it's Room. The reaſon of
both is obvious. The Word of God was
firſt directly intended for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only,
therefore firſt wrote in <hi>their</hi> Tongue: Afterwards
for the whole World, therefore wrote in the moſt
Vulgar and Common Language the <hi>Greek.</hi> Yet ſo
as that by degrees it was Tranſlated into every
Language,<note place="margin">Iſ. 11. 9.</note> to the end, that <hi>the Knowledge of the Lord
might cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inſcription on the Croſs was wrote in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi>
True! But 'twas by the command of <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
that accurſed Crucifier of our Lord, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his own Language, and for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Men.</note> Yet who can ſay that
the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in their <hi>Greek,</hi> and inſpired Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
continu'd it afterwards in the ſame <hi>Latine</hi>
Tongue? I never yet ſomuch as heard of any M.
S. or Printed <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament with the <hi>Latin</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
retain'd in it. Moreover we know that
as no <hi>Hebrew</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> ſo no <hi>Latin</hi> Bible is an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal;
nor indeed is there any ſuch thing as an
Original at this day. All our Bibles, in whatever
Language, are either Tranſlations or Tranſcripts,
which is the ſame thing to our preſent purpoſe,
both, as I ſaid, being liable to miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Finally, then the Word of God is his Word, be it
in what Language it will, and as much the Word
of God in one, as in another, there being (as I have
ſaid) no Original at this day. Briefly, one may
add or diminiſh in Tranſcribing and Printing, as
well as in Tranſlating: Therefore either both or
neither are to be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>6. It is not adding to the Word, when a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ariſing delivers ſome further Meſſages to
the Churches, which are affixt to the Canon of
Scripture. For the Rule in the Text runs thus, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not add,</hi> ſpeaking unto us Men. Nevertheleſs
God may add to it when ever he pleaſes, and
whatever he thinks fit. So that all the following
Books of Scripture were, notwithſtanding my
Text, added to the Canon unto the end of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
where (for ought we yet know) the Book
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43545:9"/>
is ſhut up in theſe Words. <q>For I certifie unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man,<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18, 19.</note> that heareth the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of this Book; if any Man ſhall add unto
theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues
that are written in this Book: And if any
Man ſhall take away from the Words of the
Book of this Propheſie, God ſhall take away
his Part out of the Book of Life, and out of the
Holy City, and from the things, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in this Book.</q> Which brings me to the 2. Head;
<hi>ſc.</hi> To ſhew poſitively when we add or diminiſh
ought from the Word of God. And firſt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing.</p>
            <p>1. Then we diminiſh from the Word, when
we caſt away any, never ſo little Part of it. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
was the Care of the <hi>Jews</hi> herein, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

at leaſt, have aſſum'd and exercis'd a like
expurgatory Power, upon the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Much more,</p>
            <p>2. Then we diminiſh from the Word, when
we reject whole Books, as the <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
of Old did all but the 5. Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and as many over Subtil and Wickedly Critical
Wits among the Chriſtians have done, calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Queſtion many intire Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and ſome there are who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to caſhiere 'em all. But,</p>
            <p>3. We diminiſh from the Word, when we lay
it aſide as not a Neceſſary, or not the Supreme
Rule of Faith. This is to diminiſh from it's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Some either Weak or Hypocritical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in Times of Old deliver'd up their Bibles to
their Perſecuters, and for ſo doing were Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that diſgraceful Name of Traditors,
Traitors. And yet queſtionleſs they had, or might
have had, the uſual Excuſes at hand, which are
currant now a days. <q>That they had the Light
within 'em, to guide 'em into all Truth, That
they had other Lights without 'em, The Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Holy and Learned Men, The aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Biſhops and Prieſts and the infallible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43545:10"/>
Popes, The daily Converſation of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and the Decrees of Councils to direct and
inſtruct 'em: Moreover, that the Truths and
Myſteries of the Goſpel (whatever became of
of the written Word) might be tranſmitted by
Oral Tradition unto Poſterity; and upon the
whole matter, that there was no neceſſity of
the written Word of God.</q> But theſe new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts,
notwithſtanding the Church, condemn'd
their Treachery: All which ſhews that in the
Judgment both of the Church, and of the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters
too, neither the Light within, nor the
Writings of Holy Men, nor the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
nor the Infallibility of the Popes, nor Oral
Tradition, nor all of 'em, were ſufficient to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Doctrine of Chriſtianity; and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
the neceſſity of the written Word of
God, &amp; that 'tis the only Neceſſary and Supreme
Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p>There is a pernicions Law among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi>
forbidding the People to Read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is a great Diminution of at leaſt the
Honour, the Sufficiency and Perſpicuity of the

            <p>'Tis pretended that it was found,<note place="margin">Council. Trid. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

meer ſhift to palliate the Injury done to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43545:11"/>
Word of God, contrary to the ſenſe and practice
of all Antiquity. For our Predeceſſors in the
Faith, I mean, the Ancient Fathers, this Obj.
notwithſtanding, were wont conſtantly to call
upon all the Faithful without diſtinction to
read the Word, telling 'em, <q>It was not like
<hi>Plato's</hi> Philoſophy, or <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Cryptical
Diſcipline, calculated for the Meridian of a
few of the Wiſer Sort; but fitted and deſign'd
for all to read and to underſtand, for the Wiſe
and for the Unwiſe, for Kings of the Earth &amp;
for all People, for Souldiers and for Lawyers,
for Monks and for Citizens of the World, for
Prieſts and Laymen, for Husbandmen and
Mariners, Artificers and Labourers, for Young
Men and Maidens, Old Men and Children,
and in a word for all Qualities, Ages, Sexes,
Fortunes and Degrees of Men whatever; to
be read in Publick and in Private, and at all
times, as well at Home as Abroad, in the
Church, and in the Fields, and in the Deſarts,
and in Journeys, &amp; in a word in every place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Shall I, by the way, crave leave to offer you a
Demonſtration (of my own for any thing that I
know) againſt our Adverſaries <hi>certiſſimum Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentum,</hi>
and that out of the Scripture it
ſelf too, becauſe I am now pleading in its behalf.
See then the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> 1 chap. 19.
<hi>v. We have alſo a more ſure word of Propheſy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43545:11"/>
ye do well to take heed as unto a Light that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in a dark place,</hi> compar'd with the 16. <hi>v.</hi> of
the <hi>3 d</hi> chap. of the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>As alſo in all his
Epiſtles, our beloved Brother</hi> Paul <hi>has written speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in 'em of theſe things, in which are ſome things hard
to be underſtood, which they that are unſtable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
wreſt, as they do all the other Scriptures unto their
own Deſtruction.</hi> Out of which Paſſages I argue
thus:<note place="margin">See <hi>4th</hi> Col. 16. &amp; 17. Acts 11. v.</note> 
               <q>That which <hi>Peter</hi> the firſt Pope or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> (and <hi>Paul</hi> too) commended and
encourag'd the People to, <hi>(ſc.</hi> to take heed or
to give attendance unto the reading of the
Word, although it was known by moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Experience, that ſome wreſted it to Errour
and Hereſy, and to their own Deſtruction) that
ought not now be deny'd the People, becauſe
forſooth there be at this day alſo ſome among
us that wreſt it to their own Deſtruction: That
which was not a competent Reaſon unto <hi>Peter,</hi>
cannot be a ſufficient Warrant unto his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
to deprive the People of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
What <hi>Peter</hi> could not, would not, do, the
Popes at this time of day cannot, ſhould not,
preſume to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, to advance a Supreme Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Independent Authority in the Church,
not Subordinate, yea Superiour, to the Scripture,
with liberty even to contradict it, is certainly a
diminiſhing of the Word, that is, its Soveraignty.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43545:12"/>
The Power of the Word is like God himſelf,
<hi>nec parem fert nec ſuperiorem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture is the intire body of the Divine
Law, who then ſhall dare to Diminiſh ought
from it, or thwart its Definitions? He that touches
the apple of Gods Eye: He claims (as I may ſay)
a ſhare in the Legiſlative, yea, and makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Superior even to God himſelf.</p>
            <p>It was then an impudent Preſumption, <hi>crimen
laeſae Majeſtatis</hi> in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> to take
upon 'em to decree with a <hi>non-obſtante,</hi> that tho'
the Scripture ſays, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> yet the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
(to whom alſo they confeſs it was ſpoken)
ſhall not drink thereof. Thus they made the
Word of God of none Effect by their Traditions,
teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of
Men, and declared 'emſelves above Jeſus Chriſt,
that Canon being ſet above his Word by their
own acknowledgment. And thus the Will and
the Wiſdom of Men took place of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Will of God.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we then think of thoſe, who equal,

the Light within 'emſelves, before the Word
of God? St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Believers he wrote to
certainly had the Light within, and the Spirit in
as great abundance as any at this time of day
can pretend:<note place="margin">

Tho' he had the Spirit and Light within, tho'
he had the Honour and Advantage of ſeeing
Chriſt Transfigur'd, and hearing the Voice from
Heaven,<note place="margin">v. 18.</note> ſaying—<hi>This is my beloved Son:</hi> Yet for
the proof of that very Propoſition himſelf relies
and exhorts the Faithful to rely rather on the
Word of Propheſy, the Scripture, as a more ſure
Teſtimony. Surer than what? Why ſurer than
any private Spirit or private Interpretation, tho'
of the Infallible <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf: Surer than ſeeing
Chriſt's Transfiguration: Surer than hearing the
Voice from Heaven: Surer than the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
So that the Light within and all other Lights
without were Darkneſs, unleſs they took heed
to that more ſure Word the Light of Gods Word.
And yet the private Spirit and Light within, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
or that Planetary and falſe Light of <hi>Peters</hi>
Succeſſors without, muſt in theſe unhappy days
of ours give check to the plain Teſtimony of
Scripture, and be preferr'd before it; As in the
uſe of the Lords Supper, one Part whereof thoſe
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion are depriv'd of. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> reject both Sacraments: And the Lords
Prayer many <hi>Diſſenters</hi> deſpiſe, and other things
might be inſtanced in. In ſhort, what amounts all
theſe ſpiritual Whymſeys to? But the ſetting up
either that more dimn Light at <hi>Rome,</hi> or the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Light of every Mans own Breaſt at home
above that more ſure Word of Scripture, <hi>whereunto
we ſhould do well to take heed.</hi> This is juſt ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43545:13"/>
piece of folly, as if a Man ſhould take
his Journey in the night time by the dimnLight
of the Moon, or by his own dark-Lanthorne
in his hand, refuſing the Light of the Sun by
Day, which notwithſtanding affords a much
clearer Light and ſafer Conduct to the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
Laſtly,</p>
            <p>4. We diminiſh from the Word even when
we preſume to add any thing to it. For this is
as it were to tax it with ſome ſuppos'd Defects
and Imperfections, which we, forſooth, would
ſupply.</p>
            <p>Now then as for adding to the Word in the
firſt place.</p>
            <p>1. We add to it when any thing is tackt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Word not belonging to it. Thus we reckon
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to have made bold with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
thruſting the Apochryphal Books into the
Canon of the Old Teſtament. But I haſten,</p>
            <p>2. We both add to the Word and diminiſh
from it, when we alter it, eſpecially ſo as that
it carries quite another Senſe than what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Spirit of God. And now I am at
length come to the Point I chiefly aim'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
on. It is to be bewail'd, that ſo many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Readings have already been thruſt into the
Sacred Text, no body knows certainly when,
nor where, nor by whom, nor on what Occaſion,
nor upon what Motive and Deſign. But I will
not trouble you nor my ſelf about this, which is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43545:13"/>
not now to be remedy'd. I will rather advertiſe you
of one of a freſher Date, which yet indeed has
not, ought not to have the honour of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a various Lection.</p>
            <p>The caſe in ſhort is this. The Apoſtles 'emſelves
had from the beginning exercis'd the Offices of
Preaching the Word, of Adminiſtring the Sacraments
and of Diſpenſing the Alms gather'd at the Lords
Supper. But the Church multiplying and buſineſs
increaſing upon their hands, there happen'd ſome
Occaſion of Complaint about the unequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of the ſaid Publick Alms. Whereupon the
Apoſtles order'd the multitude,<note place="margin">Acts. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>To ſeek out Seven
Men of Honeſt report, and full of the Holy Ghoſt and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whom</hi> We (as ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles have it
or) <hi>whom</hi> Ye (as others) <hi>may appoint over this buſineſs.</hi>
And hence a Queſtion may be ſtarted, whether the
People or the Apoſtles did appoint thoſe Seven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Offices aforeſaid, and by conſequence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the People or the Biſhops have Authority to
appoint the Parochial Miniſters. My buſineſs here
is not to Argue that Point, but to Examin into this
various Reading, which I ſhall do in reſolving
three Enquiries.</p>
            <p>1. Which of the two Readings is the true one?
The Reſolution whereof is very eaſy. The Place
ought to run thus—<hi>Whom</hi> We <hi>may appoint over the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">We the Apoſtles.</note> In proof of this (if any ſhould doubt it) I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to all the <hi>MSS</hi> and Printed Copies of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Teſtament, I appeal to all the Collections of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43545:14"/>
Readings, I appeal to the Bibles into whatever
Language Tranſlated, I appeal to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Impreſſions till of late, and I appeal to the
Hiſtory of the whole Fact here laid down, which
ſuppoſes it of neceſſity. The Apoſtles had had that
Buſineſs of Diſtributing the publick Alms in their
own hands from the beginning, therefore they (not
the People) delegated the Seven to it: Therefore
it's not to be read <hi>Ye</hi> but <hi>We.</hi> But then the next En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
is,</p>
            <p>2. When did this Corruption ſteal firſt into the
Text? Anſwer, I will not be peremptory in this:
But ſo far as my Diligence and Obſervation (which
has not been a little, and mannaged with all Care &amp;
Faithfulneſs) is able to carry me, I muſt ſay, that it
crept in firſt in the Year 1638. In that very Year,
there was a Fair Bible in Folio Printed at <hi>Cambridge</hi>
with this <hi>Erralum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">By <hi>Tho. Buck,</hi> and <hi>Rog. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The latter of which was indeed the mannager of the Preſs, and in the Intereſt of that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Party.</note> and this is the firſt time I have
yet been able to diſcover the Corruption.</p>
            <p>By the way, here I muſt beg your favourable
Conſtruction of this Remark. It is with the greateſt
Averſion and infinite Regret, that I am forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occaſion to bewray my own Neſt, and to
ſpeak out this great Truth to at leaſt the ſeeming
Diſhonour of my own Mother Univerſity, from
whoſe Breaſts I ſuckt in all that little Knowledge
I pretend unto. And this too in the Preſence and
the Hearing of ſome of the moſt Ingenious and
Learned Children of her Rival Siſter, who has (for
ought I can learn) been ſomewhat happier in this
kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43545:14"/>
But, however, as to the Fact ſo it came to paſs,
that while the chief Stewards of the Family were
otherwiſe imploy'd, and the inferiour Servants (I
think) ſleeping, the Enemy ſow'd theſe Tares, which
have been growing ever ſince until now. This may
ſuffice to point at the time when this Error firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr'd
into our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, <hi>ſc.</hi> in the Year 38. But,</p>
            <p>Who then brought in this falſe Reading, or what
Party among us at leaſt encourag'd and promoted
it ſince?</p>
            <p>It is an Enquiry worthy to be made, and a clear
and full diſcovery would deſerve an <hi>Hecatomb.</hi> And
tho' I will not promiſe ſo much, yet ſomething I
have to offer towards it, which tho' it amounts not
to a direct Proof againſt any Perſons, yet I think
may paſs for a good Circumſtantial One. To my
purpoſe then,</p>
            <p>I will not be ſo Poſitive as to Averr, that it was
at firſt induſtriouſly done, yet I muſt call into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the Diſſenters, as Perſons ſuſpected to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
contributed to the Corruption of this Place,
at leaſt, to the Continuance and Increaſe of it,
and that upon the following Accompts.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Alteration happen'd in the Year
38. Presbytery being then in the Aſcendant, I ſay
juſt in that nick of time, when all things were in
Preparation, and tended to the Subverſion of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
<hi>Scotland</hi> having already made a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and bound 'emſelves under a Curſe to Extripate
it, and <hi>England,</hi> even a great part of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43545:15"/>
'emſelves, running into the ſame exceſs of riot.
So that here is a Concurrence of the Circumſtance
of time, and a ſhrewd one too, ſufficient to ground
a ſuſpicion on.</p>
            <p>2. The Corruption in Appearance favours the
Diſſenters and their Deſign againſt Epiſcopacy. If
then any, they may be ſuſpected for being willing
to have it at leaſt continu'd and propagated.</p>
            <p>3. On the contrary, it cannot, with any Colour
of Reaſon, be imagin'd, that the Epiſcopal Party
deſign'd to Corrupt this Place, or to Connive at
it's Corruption, except they ſhall be thought <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lones
de ſe,</hi> and willingly and knaviſhly to deſtroy
what they endeavour zealouſly to eſtabliſh. Satan
(as our Lord argues) cannot be thought to caſt
out Satan, and to throw down his own Kingdom.
Nor will any one of Senſe believe, that the Epiſcopal
Party were willing to have that thruſt out of the
Scripture, upon which their Church Government
ſeems to be built; Or to ſubſtitute in its room, what
in Appearance overthrows their Politie.</p>
            <p>4. That Party ought in all Reaſon to be Suſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of foul Play herein, who, admitting they did
not at firſt on ſet, purpoſe, contrive the Corruption
of this place, yet now, belike, contribute to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
and Vindicating it, and under the Colour
of this new Text of Scripture, aſſert and ſupport
the new Popular Government of the Church, as
ſome of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do at this day.</p>
            <p>For the Proof of which Charge upon 'em, I need
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43545:15"/>
only to put you in mind of that memorable Story,
which doubtleſs ye have many of you heard of,
how that a <hi>Cameronian</hi> (one of the moſt rigid Sects
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians) Preaching ſome years
ſince concerning the Peoples Power of ſetting up
their own Teachers, &amp; having confirm'd his Point
with ſome Reaſons of his own (the Principal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, I gueſs, that it was moſt agreeable to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, which is juſt ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Reaſon as an Adulterer alſo might give for
his Wantonneſs.)</p>
            <p>But, I ſay, having prov'd his Point as he thought (no
matter to us how) at length bid his Audience not to
believe him, but to turn to their Bible, and ſo ſent
them incontinently to the 6. <hi>Act. 3. v.</hi> where they
might find their Character in theſe Words—<hi>Whom
YE</hi> (the Multitude of Believers) <hi>may appoint over this
Buſineſs.</hi> But whether this be a good Character, or
has on it the ſtamp of Divine Authority, let the
World judge by what has been already ſaid. For
a Concluſion then I would crave leave to addreſs,</p>
            <p>1. Unto all the Faithful in general; Men, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and Fathers ſuffer me to entreat you in a few
words, with all diligence, to preſerve the Word of
God pure and uncorrupt. If once the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
be poyſon'd, the Streams will be ſo too, and
from thenceforth we ſhall never be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between the Doctrines and Will of God, and
the Inventions and Inclinations of Men. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
of Chriſtianity, with deſign to overthrow
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43545:16"/>
the whole Frame of our Religion, have already
endeavour'd to take advantage of thoſe numerous
and various Lections, which in times of darkneſs
and ignorance heretofore ſtole into the <hi>Greek</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
(as I find it taken notice of in a Learned
Preface to a late Edition) what then will they ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Printed at</hi> Oxford <hi>Theater</hi> Anno 1675.</note>
when they obſerve the pureſt Kirk in the World
(as is pretended) tempering with, and refining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Word of God at this time of day? But let
not us, to ſerve a Cauſe, or to draw the ſimple Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into our Intereſts, let not us (I ſay) dare to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn
any falſe Witneſs whatever, much leſs out of
the Word of Truth. Let us leave that vile Artifice
to our Adverſaries on both hands. Truth needs not
ſuch feeble Supports, but is indeed very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parag'd
and weaken'd thereby. The brighteſt
Truth will receive prejudice when we go about
to eſtabliſh it by a Lie, much more Points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
when they are varniſh'd and waſht over
with falſe and fading Colours. <hi>'Tis our Intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
as well as our Duty—<hi>To lay aſide all Guile and
Hypocriſie,</hi> and to feed our Flocks with <hi>the ſincere
Milk of the Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>To put away Lying, and to ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man Truth with his Neighbour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 25.</note> Let us take to our
ſelves the Example of St. <hi>Paul—We are not</hi> (ſays
he reflecting upon the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſmaticks) <hi>as
many which corrupt the Word of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>But as of Sincerity,
but as of God in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi>
And once more he ſaith—<hi>We have renounced the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
things of Diſhoneſty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>not walking in Craftineſs, nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43545:16"/>
the Word of God deceitfully; but by manifeſtation of
the Truth.</hi> The Apoſtle not obſcurely hinting in
theſe Words, that the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> did ſo.</p>
            <p>2. But above all, and with all Submiſſion, I
would beg of thoſe, who are in Authority and do
humbly propoſe, that ſome effectual courſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to make amends for this at firſt (I am willing
to believe) unfortunate overſight committed
(I am aſham'd to repeat where) and to vindicate
this Place in the <hi>Acts</hi> from the Injury it has ſuffer'd
theſe Fifty Years paſt, and upward. How it may
in ſome meaſure be repair'd is not hard to tell. I
have heard of a whole Impreſſion of the Bible
condemn'd to be burnt, becauſe the Negative Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of a Commandment was caſually left out.
What then if one of every Edition thus deprav'd,
or at leaſt one for all, were ſerv'd after the ſame
manner <hi>in perpetuam rei Memoriam,</hi> and to expoſe
the craftineſs of thoſe <hi>Circumcellians</hi> among us, who
to advance their deſign, do not ſtick, it ſeems, to
promote it by Falſhood; and grounding 'emſelves
upon a meer Errour of the Preſs, as we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was at firſt, deceiving, and being deceived,
do lie againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and bring a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
upon the Word of God, and our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, I may happily ſeem too Warm
and Zealous in this matter. Doubtleſs, ſome will
think ſo. But upon Examination, having found
the firſt accidental ſlip repeated ſince in at leaſt
half a dozen Impreſſions of the Bible here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:43545:17"/>
and having now juſt Reaſon to ſuſpect the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Bibles generally faulty in this Paſſage; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Imagine, but it has been a good while under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
countenanc'd and abetted: For is it Poſſible to
believe, that One unhappy miſtake ſhould be ſo
ſucceſsful, as to have got into ſo many Editions
without the helping hand of ſome wily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
Schiſmatick.</p>
            <p>But principally, whereas now it begins to be
avow'd for good and vendible Ware, expos'd and
ſold publickly in the Market, can any One conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to believe it ſtill an Unwilling and Excuſable
Error? Or rather, is it not fit to be treated as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
and for bidden Commodities are? That is,
in plain terms (as I ſaid) caſt into the Fire.</p>
            <p>Moreover (for any thing I can foreſee) it may,
if not timely prevented, plead Preſcription, and
ſet up for Authentic, at leaſt, for a various Lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby the Popular Government of the
Church, may, in a few more Years, gain an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Divine Authority, and the <hi>Scot's</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be thought Apoſtolical Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>All which conſider'd the Warmth I have ſhew'd
upon this Occaſion (if any before accounted it ſuch)
will now, I hope, be allow'd Reaſonable and not
Unſerviceable to the Word and to the Church of
God, to this Part of it eſpecially among us, by Law
Divine &amp; Human Eſtabliſh'd. And long may it be
ſo to the Glory of God, &amp; to the Edification of the
Church in Peace &amp; Love in Truth &amp; Unity. <hi>Amen.</hi>
