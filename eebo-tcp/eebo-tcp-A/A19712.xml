         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conſidering and debating with
my felfe, the acwarde courſe of
this changeable world, among
other things I haue bene greatly deſyrous
to know, what the very &amp; chief cauſe ſhould
be, of the ſubuerſion and ruyne, from time to
time, of al mightie kyngdomes: And againe
of the ſetting vp and aduancement of manie
obſcure perſones of baſe degree and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to moſt high honors and dignities. For
when I throughly conſider and call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the alteration and decay of the
<hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and the manifolde cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that haue happened to noble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
puyſſaunt Kingdomes in times paſt, I well
ſee, that diſſolute life, ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and diſcord of
Rulers amonge themſelues hath from time
to time bene the chief &amp; originall cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Inſomuch that by reading out of olde
Monumentes and Hiſtories, thinges long
agone atchieued and done, I perceaue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Empires haue ben planted and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
many Nations ſubdued, many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
with long continuance firmlye eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and moſt aſſured peare and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie
among the Communaltie conſerued by
temperaunce and ſobrietie, but chiefly and
<pb facs="tcp:9649:5"/>
ſpecially by ciuill concord and mutuall amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Wherfore, both reaſon, &amp; dayly examples
enforce me to think, that Wealth, Ritches,
ſtrength and ſkilfull pollicie in warlyke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres
without concord and goodwyl of the
people hurteth many times, but profiteth
almoſt neuer. Whereas concord and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence
(euen without wealth and rycheſſe)
be of great force and of themſelues able to
doo very mutch. Therefore, they which
neglected the ſauegard, quietneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of their ſubiectes (whereby, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyll
is both purchaſed and alſo nouriſhed,)
and wholy yeelded themſelues to Ambition
and deſire of ſouereignty (beſtowing al their
ſtudies and cogitations onely to enrich and
bring themſelues to hye eſtate among their
owne People, deſiring rather to be feared of
them then of their enemies) were in the end
vnprofitable to themſelues and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to their countrey. Contrarywiſe, they
that ſo arme themſelues with the vnfayned
loue and goodwyll of their owne people and
ſubiectes, that they might both be tenderly
and intirelye beloued of them, and alſo bee
terrible and dreadfull to the enemy abroad:
thoſe (I ſay) were thei, which notably bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
both themſelues and their common
wealth. And if we would peruſe and rip

               </gap> auncient beginnings of al Kingdoms,
and throughly conſider their fyrſt originall,
<pb facs="tcp:9649:5"/>
wee ſhall finde that ſo many of them as long
floriſhed, were by moſt honeſt Artes and
wayes at the fyrſt gotten, and by the beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of gouerment conſtituted. For it is wel
inough knowne, that at the beginning, the
name of a king (which alwaies was a name
moſte holie and venerable) was geuen and
attributed to thoſe that had done beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and been moſt meritorious to their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
whom the people for their common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and vtilytie created Kinges and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes
ouer them. For when as the ſacred
worde of God was not yet amonge men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
no religyon reuerenced, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ciuill order regarded, when no man tooke

leſſe executed: when men after a brutiſhe
ſorte lyued abroad in the woods and open

ignorance, abuſing their ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
onely to the ſatiſfyinge of their owne ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall

By this way, <hi>Romulus</hi> the other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Rome, of a poore and beggarly ſheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
was aduanced to the degree of a king.
<pb facs="tcp:9649:6"/>
In lyke manner were <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Priſcus</hi> of ſtraungers and priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
made Kinges in the ſame place. By
ſuch good will and affection of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great conquered all the
Eaſt. By concorde, the <hi>Greeques</hi> victoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
augmented and enlarged their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
by concord, the common wealth of the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> grewe to bee moſte mightye:
the ſame concorde made the Romanes,
Lordes ouer al Lands, and conquerours of
al forraine nations. In this bond of concord
the <hi>Sarracens</hi> a weake and ſlender rable of
Peyzants at the fyrſt, being ioyned and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
together, ouercame and poſſeſſed verye
many prouinces belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
&amp; by this meanes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the Turks
at the fyrſt &amp; euer ſince hath increaſed. But
Inſolency, Ambition and Diſcord hath ben
the ſubuerſion of all Kingdomes, mightye
Empires and populous common wealthes.
For when princes (neglecting and forſaking
thoſe trades and waies by which their king
domes were at the fyrſt conſtituted) thinke
Money and wealth, to be the chief defence,
and as it were the Sinewes and ſtayes of
their kingdomes, when any ſecret hatred
and harte burninge enkindleth betweene
them and their people, then do they hazard
and endaunger both themſelues their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes
and ſubiectes to the ſpoyle of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
<pb facs="tcp:9649:7"/>
For nature hath thus ordayned, that as
we feele &amp; perceaue others to be affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs, we alſo ar affected towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp;
<hi>Plato</hi> his ſaying is well known concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
ſame matter who writeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the princes &amp;
rulers in a common welth are, ſuch common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
bee the people and Citizens of the ſame.
Therefore no man ought to marueile, why
thoſe Princes which ſet more by their own
priuate lucre and gayne then by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
commodytie of their Realme, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times but ſlenderlye beloued of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes:
and that all their Officers vnder
them by their euyll example, are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to enriche their owne Coffers then to
further the common wealth of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Thus mens harts being diuerſly bent
and their good wils alieuated one from an
other, the common wealth conſequently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to wracke &amp; confuſion. Theſe were the
cauſes, why the Empyre was firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from the <hi>Chaldayes</hi> to the <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> from
the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> to the <hi>Medians,</hi> from the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to the <hi>Perſians</hi> and laſt of all from the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Diſcord was the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
and diſparcling of that famous and
large Monarchy left by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
while his ſucceſſours (not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent euery man
with his owne Territory) quarelled among
themſelues for the whole Monarchy. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
abated and tamed the whole power
<pb facs="tcp:9649:7"/>
and common wealthe of the Greeques: by
diſcorde and ciuill warres, the Romane
ſtate was deſtroyed and brought almoſte
to nothing: and agayne the ciuill diuiſion
of the Greeques amonge themſelues was
the only cauſe that the flouriſhing empire of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was brought vnder the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
yoke and ſlauerye of a Nation moſte
barbarous. Diſcord was the vtter vndoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
and defacyng of the <hi>Sarracens</hi> Empire, as
in this Hiſtory it ſhall playnly appeare: and
the ſame plague doth at this day ſo infeſt
and trouble all Chriſtendome that I feare

why doo we thus runne headlong
vpon the Swordes poinct, and cut one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others

in ciuill warres and domeſticall murder?
why doo wee not (alas for pitie that our

lay aſyde all priuate grudges and
controuerſies which ought rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by equitie and the infallible lawe of

deuided into many partes and factions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, one conſpiringe an others bane
and thyrſting after his brothers bloud, wil
in the end bring all Chriſtendome to vtter
ruine and wofull deſolation. Which if they
would ioyne in one and liue together in
Chriſtian league, no doubte, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
might be agayn recouered and annexed to
the Romane Empire, <hi>Grecia</hi> and a great

bee deliuered out of the thraldome of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable

eftſones planted and truely acknowledged.
Paraduenture ſome wyll caſt doubtes and

In times paſt, one <hi>Peter</hi> an Heremite beyng

as into <hi>Afia,</hi> where they valiantly conquered

in thoſe daies were of themſelues ſo willing
to adueuture their liues in Chriſtes quarell
againſt the blaſphemers of his name, that
without any ſtipend or wages (godly zeale
ſo pricked them forwarde) they tooke in

of many Greeque, Conſtantinopolitan, and
Latine Authours, as out of the Chronicles
of the <hi>Arabians</hi> &amp; <hi>Moores,</hi> is deuided into three
Bookes. The firſte containeth the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,

dotynge <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the beginning of the
<hi>Saracens,</hi> with the ſucceſſe and increaſe of their

two hundreth yeeres ſpace. The ſeconde is
contynued from the fyrſt inclynation tyll the
beginning of the deſtruction and laſte ende
thereof, contayninge alſo the ſpace of two
hundreth yeeres. The third breefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
the finall end of it, and the original
beginning of the Turkiſhe Empire, (which
ſucceeded the Saracenical Domination) till
<hi>Othoman</hi> the firſt Emperour of Turks which
intreateth of their acts, for the ſpace of three
hundreth yeeres. So that this Hiſtorye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his beginning at the byrth of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
which was fiue hundred &amp; ſixty yeeres after
the incarnation of our Sauiour Chriſt, and
reacheth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeere one thouſand &amp; three

and other Emperours that ſucceeded hym,
we haue heere omitted, becauſe they be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally

becauſe they were greate and

broyle and confuſe diſorder, and alſo becauſe
this power of theirs encreaſed, through the diſcorde and

our throates willingly to be cut by them, which deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then our blood and deſtruction. For firſt of al,
this is well ynough knowen, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Empyre
(which throughe concorde temperance and valiauntnes
ſurmounted and grew to ſuch high Maieſtie and eſtate,
that all nacions almoſt in the world were obedienciaries
and ſubiect vnto it) when the Citizens being once lulled

               <hi>Saracens.</hi> For although the <hi>Gothes</hi> moſt vnmercifully
and beaſtly deſtroying and making hauocke of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Some obſerued the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Iewes:</hi>
ſome honoured the Sunne and Moone, ſome certain trées,
ſome Serpentes, ſome a Towre called <hi>Alcaba,</hi> which

whereof (his father beyng an Iſmaelite and his mother

taught both the rites of the Hebrewes and the manner of
worſhipping that the Gentiles vſed. His Parentes dyed
while he was but yet a tender and younge ladde, ſo that
then he was committed to the charge and cuſtodie of one
<hi>Salutelib,</hi> his vncle by the fathers ſyde. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came

which were (as before was ſhewed) the fierceſt and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickeſt

one <hi>Abdimoneples,</hi> an <hi>Iſmaelite.</hi> Who quickly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

his viſage and looke was graue and portly, pretending a

prepared a great armie at the inſtigation and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

then was and yet is, as well becauſe of an opinion of

the Citie and reſorte of people moſt noble and famous.
Then againe within the ſame yéere, diſcharging the ſaid
<hi>Azeib</hi> of his office, he appointed <hi>Moad</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
Lieutenant of the ſame Citie in his roume: with this

that he ſhould leaue neuer a mothers Sonne a liue in it,
nor ſuffer any forrayner to enter ſauing only ſuch as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

his meaning and entent was, (as afterwarde he brought

Admyralles, whyche had euerie one vnder them many
Peticapitaines and Centurions: and theſe foure hee
woulde commonly vſe to call the ſharpe Swordes of

But <hi>Ali</hi> rayſed warres againſte <hi>Muamad,</hi>

and made Byſſhoppe by all mens conſent: ſauynge
onelye <hi>Muauias.</hi> Who repoſinge greate truſte and
confidence in the <hi>Aegiptian</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Souldiours,
(whoſe proweſſe and magnanymytie he had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

that hée tooke the ſame in hande onely to reuenge the

            </p>
            <p>When both the Armyes were come to the Riuer
<hi>Euphrates, Muauias</hi> hauynge more ſkyll in warlyke
pollices, and alſo hauinge olde beaten Souldiours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hym, ſo fortyfied and entrenched hys Campe néere
to the Riuer ſide, and the Citie <hi>Babylon,</hi> that neyther
coulde he be inforced by hys aduerſarye to fight vnleſſe
he would hymſelfe, and alſo hys Armye ſhoulde not be
deſtitute of water, (whereof in that Region there is
great ſcarſitye) nor yet be vnprouided of victayles, and
moreouer néeded not to feare anye Alarmes behynde
at their backes. Whereas in the meane whyle <hi>Ali</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:9649:24"/>
his Armye, was extremely pinched for lacke of water.
And ſo for the ſpace of eleuen Monthes keeping his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
within the Trenches of hys Campe, he weryed
hys Enemye and lyngered the tyme onely now and
then with Skirmiſhes, tyll at length by the interceſſion
of certayne Prieſtes and others ſkilfull in the Lawe of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> order was taken betwéene them, that the

called <hi>Algendel,</hi> to ſit vpon this waightie matter of both
their tytles, the one thought it neceſſarye that <hi>Ali</hi> ſhould
be diſgraded and depoſed from his pontificall dignitie, and
the other ſtiflye helde opinion that he was a man moſte
worthy for the office. Thus pleading to and froe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abſolutely determyninge nor fully concludinge any
attonement, <hi>Ali</hi> and <hi>Muauias</hi> retourned agayne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them to his owne Campe. And neuer ceaſed with
often Skirmiſhing to moleſt and kill one an other, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
and waſtynge one an others Countries till at
length <hi>Ali</hi> in a certayne Temple néere <hi>Cufa</hi> a Citie of
<hi>Arabie</hi> was by the inſidious driftes and Ambuſhes of
<hi>Muauias</hi> ſlayne, and in the ſame buried, for which cauſe
the place at this daye is called <hi>Maſſadale</hi> which is as
much to ſaye, as the houſe of <hi>Ali.</hi> In his Ringe hee
had this inſcription: <hi>Corde ſyncero Deum Dominum
veneror.</hi> Hee was ſhorte and lowe of Stature, his
Bearde was ſide and longe, his Armes and Legges
full of haire, and in his goynge neuer lyfted vp hys
Eyes.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Ali</hi> was dead, the Citizens of <hi>Cufa</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratha</hi>
created <hi>Alhaccem</hi> (his eldeſt Sonne by his wife
<hi>Fatema,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mahomet</hi>) Byſſhope: a
man in all poynctes of bodelye feacture and comelye
<pb facs="tcp:9649:25"/>
ſhape, reſembling his Graundfather <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He with
an armie, marched againſt <hi>Muauias,</hi> but when both the
Hoſtes were ordered in battaile araie readie to geue the
onſet, and the voward of the one ſtanding full againſt the
fronte of the other, whether it were becauſe he feared the
doubtfull hazard of battaile or elſe (as ſome do write) that
he was ouercome with the goodnes and integrite of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
vnwilling that ſo great effuſion of bloud and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men ſhoulde be made for his ſake, he voluntarilie
went and ſubmitted himſelfe to <hi>Muauias,</hi> acknowledging
him to be his Superiour. Beyng thus reconciled one to
the other, they went both together to <hi>Cufa,</hi> and there fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great ſtore of money and treaſure, they departed
thence to <hi>Ietrib,</hi> where <hi>Muauias</hi> with his owne handes
crowned <hi>Alhaccem</hi> with the royall Diademe and called
him King, becauſe he well knew that he ſhoulde not liue
long. For within ſixe monethes after his Coronation he
dyed beyng poyſoned by the ſame <hi>Muauias.</hi> His Poeſie
engrauen in his Signet was: <hi>Solus Deus potens eſt.</hi>
Thus <hi>Muauias</hi> hauing now diſpatched and ridde out of
the way all his aduerſaries, raigned alone. Hauing thus
ſet his affaires in order, he inuaded the frontiers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

and a Slaue with a Horſe. At this time <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was
the chiefe Seate and Metropolitane Citie of the <hi>Saraceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
Empyre. But in this their ſo great ſucceſſe and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
there aroſe diſſenſions among themſelues for theyr

ſcrowles and Schedules. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> béeyng
(as we haue ſhewed) now made <hi>Saracens,</hi> helde opinions

            <p>And when he was retourned to <hi>Damaſcus, Sapor</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all ſuche places in <hi>Perſia</hi> as yet acknowledged the

<hi>Andrew</hi> taking hys leaue, in hys waye homewarde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
<hi>Sergius</hi> as he was retourning into <hi>Perſia</hi> and

might and would dodge &amp; finde cauillations with <hi>Sapor</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he was diſcharged of his promiſe. But there was more
conſtancie &amp; faithfulnes in the barbarous Infidel, then the
<hi>Greekes</hi> wit could conceiue or forſée. For <hi>Muauias,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>In this meane ſeaſon the Emperour althoughe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were now at hand and all places couered with Snow
ſent <hi>Andrew</hi> with a ſmall crew of Souldiours to expulſe

The <hi>Greeques</hi> therfore ſodainely ſkaled the walles and

            </p>
            <p>After this, an other populous armie of <hi>Saracens</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

he ſtudyed and bent his mind to appeaſe certayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies

all the learned men of his Empire, and ſuch as
had any wryting or Schedule either of <hi>Mahomet</hi> or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

&amp; taken this order in his matters at <hi>Damaſco</hi> which
was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head ſeat of his Empire, he died and was there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
He was the firſt of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Capitaines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with
<hi>Ozmen</hi> (during <hi>Homars</hi> raigne) entred into the Roman
prouinces w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an hoſt, and was the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> enlarged &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied

<hi>Aegipt</hi> and <hi>Aphrica</hi> weſtward, into <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and into <hi>Aſia</hi> northward, and was the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
a certen ſeate royall at <hi>Damaſco:</hi> which citie for the
fertilitie of the ſoyle and pleaſantnes of the ayre far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
any other. He vſed firſte of his race, to haue Slaues
and Eunuches after a princely ſtate &amp; guiſe to ſtand bare
headed before hym: for he was a man altogether marcial
and warlike, and in the atchiuing of his deuiſes prudent
and wiſe. His coulour was white, his face pleaſaunt and
graue, his eyes of diuers coulours, his ſtature meane,
his Bearde alwayes blacke, for euer as it beganne to
waxe graye, hee dyed it and conſerued it in his former
ſtate. He lyued lxxvij. yeares, and raigned twenty and
foure. His Signet which he caryed about with hym, had
in it this Poſie engrauen: <hi>O Deus ignoſce mihi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9649:28"/>
Of learnyng he was altogether ignoraunt, in ſo muche
that he could not write his own name: whereas otherwiſe
he had by nature a verie profound witte. Wherfore it is
reported that <hi>Mahomet</hi> on a time, making his prayers
at a banquet in preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many (as his cuſtome was) ſaid
theſe wordes: O God teach <hi>Muauias</hi> to write &amp; to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and defend him from all daungers. By which words,
that craftie Pſeudoprophete who knewe the nature of
<hi>Muauias</hi> to be fierce and prompt withall, ſhewed and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
two things. Firſt, that he, if he had the ayde of any
learning, might greatly helpe and furder his Secte. For
they which can write, can alſo reade and thereby become
wyſer. Then becauſe he ſaw him to be of ſuche a fierce
courage that he was lyke to aduenture and obiect himſelf
to many perilles and hazardes, he deſired of God to teach
him the Arte of numbring, wherby he might ſkanne and
obſerue due times and tempeſtiuities, and to haue the ſkil
to take the occaſions that ſhoulde be fitteſt for the exploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his affayres when they fell: and for the ſame cauſe
he deſired of God to protect &amp; deliuer him from all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
But he being a man craftie ynough of himſelfe and
naturally geuen to pollicie néeded not theſe helpes.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Muauias</hi> was dead, immediately his ſonne
<hi>Iezid</hi> was ſaluted Biſhop and King, who atchieued no
notable acte in his time worthie of remembraunce. For
he was a man altogether giuen to ſlouth, idlenes and riot,
and moreouer was ſickly and of a body nothing luſtie: ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that he put many of the nobilitie of <hi>Arabie</hi> to death.
He loued his owne Siſter lividinouſly, and was greatly
delited in learning and Poetrie, and made many verſes, a
moſt ſpightfull contemner of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
other Religion. During this mans raigne, <hi>Mutar</hi>

The rumour of this great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion being ſpred through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Spaine, the kinſfolkes of Earle <hi>Iulian</hi> gathering
together all the power that they were able, and feigning
that they went to repulſe this <hi>Saracenicall</hi> inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, went
ſtraight wayes thither and ioyned themſelues with him.
And ſo all their powers being linked in one, they waſted
and haryed al the coaſt about the Riuer <hi>Betis</hi> now named
<hi>Guadolouir,</hi> and commonly called <hi>Andaluſia</hi> or of the
<hi>Vandales, Vandaluſia. Roderike</hi> in the meane ſeaſon,
with as much ſpéede as he coulde, gathered a very great
Armie, and appointing his Coſen Germaine <hi>Ignicus</hi> to

Who making many conflictes and ſkirmiſhes with them

For immediatly after his creation, he ſent <hi>Malſana</hi> with

a good whyle in ſuch equall match, that hard it was
to diſcerne to whether partie the victorie would encline:
which was much to be merueiled at, conſidering how ſore
Spaine had for two yéeres laſt afore, béene afflicted with
dearth of victualles and the Peſtilential plague. Wherby
the ſouldiours had not the ſtrength and courage that they
had before, and the men, who in a hundreth &amp; fiftie yeeres
ſpace had not bene trained vp in any warres, cockered and
effeminated with eaſe, had loſt in a manner all warlike
diſcipline and right vſe of handling their weapons, &amp; were
moreouer withoute harnyſſe armour or habilimentes
méete for the warres: becauſe <hi>Vitiza, Roderike</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour,

the eyght daye which was the .xi. of September the two
Sonnes of King <hi>Vitiza</hi> hauing the night before inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by meanes whereof <hi>Mucas</hi> with litle a doe brought al his

the Souldiours well knowing their king could not eſcape

away by flight from them, ſhuld be aſſured that there was
none other way, but either to die togither in that place or
elſe to winne the victorie. For it had bene a thing moſt
ſhamefull and reprochfull to forſake their Prince and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
Soueraigne. Which cuſtome and maner, many
frée confederate cities of <hi>Italie</hi> folowing, trimmed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
for the warres, a certaine <hi>Chayre</hi> of eſtate, called
<hi>Carocio</hi>) wherin were ſet the Penons and Enſignes of

by many Oxen, wherby the whole hoaſt was giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they could not with any honeſtie flie, by reaſon
of the ſlow pace and vnweldineſſe of thoſe heauie Beaſts.
In this ſort was king <hi>Roderike</hi> pompouſly caried in hys
horſelitter during the battailes foughten in ſeuen dayes
ſpace. But on the eight day, ſéeing things brought to the
laſt puſhe and to ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſixe and ſeuen, of or on, he him

<hi>Orell,</hi> and animating his Souldiours with a moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
and pithie Oration boldly gaue the charge vppon
his enemies. But when he ſaw the fronte of his battaile
to ſhrinke, he departed aſide vnto a little hill harde by and
ſtripped himſelf out of all his royal Robes: and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence
beholding the mercileſſe ſlaughter of his men on euerye
ſide, moued with repentance, becauſe he knew himſelf to
be the cauſe &amp; occaſioner of all this miſhap, chaunged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into another wéede and fled into a deſerte of <hi>Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
where he found a certaine holy man, lyuing ſolitarie,
with whom he paſſed the reſt of his life.</p>
            <p>Nowe wheras it is reported and written that he folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
a Starre or a meſſanger of God which conducted and
guided him in his way: it may be ſo, and the ſame hath
alſo happened to others. But it may aſwell alſo be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
of a certaine ſecrete Starre mouing and directing
his will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9649:37"/>
And whereas they ſay he was put by that holy man into
a Caue or hoale and a Serpent with hym that had two
heads, which in two dayes ſpace gnawed al the fleſh of his
body from the bones this beyng ſimplie taken and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,
hath no likelihood of any truth. For what ſanctity,
what Religyon, or what pietie, commaundeth to kyll a
penitent perſon, and one that ſéeketh comfort of his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mynd by amendent of life, with ſuch horrible torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
and ſtraunge puniſhment? Wherefore I woulde rather
thinke it to be ſpoken myſticallye, and that the Serpent
with two heads ſignifieth his ſinful and gylty conſcience,
which tormenteth &amp; diſquieteth thoſe that haue perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any heynous offence, as though it were the Furies
of hell, as the Poetes haue feygned of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and others.

remained ſtill with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> had in euerie place, their

recouerie and helpe of Spaine, ſprang vp among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Aſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
Which Countrey not only remayned ſafe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified
of that Barbarous Nation, but alſo was the
firſt that ſtopped their lewde inuaſions, and there was the
auncient and natiue language of Spayne conſerued.
Which thing that it maye the better bée vnderſtoode by
what meanes it happened, we muſt briefely deſcribe the
whole tracte and ſituation of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> Wée ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Spayne was in forme of a <hi>Cherroneſe</hi> or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as a Iſlande. enuironed with Sea on euery ſide,
ſauyng onely in one place. The Northe parte whereof,
ioyneth to Fraunce by a narowe porcion of lande that
lyeth betwéene two Seas, and the <hi>Pyrenee</hi> Mountaines
lying a long from the Sunne riſing in Winter, to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the ſame in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, enuiron it about lyke a wall.
The bredth of the <hi>Iſthmos</hi> or narow trench of land lying
betwene the two Seas, being one diſtant but a litle from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9649:39"/>
the other is about CClxx. Myles. But the <hi>Pyrenee</hi> mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
ſtretch in length a great way further. For when
they come to the angle and as it were into a Baye of the
<hi>Cantabrique Ocean,</hi> which lyeth on the Northe ſyde of
Spayne, they ſtretch out in length a great waye into the
<hi>Equinoctiall</hi> Weſt: and kéeping of the Sea <hi>Cantabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
from the Northe part of Spayne, ſtretcheth euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the plaine <hi>Ocean,</hi> that hemmeth in all the Weſt parte
of Spaine. That part of theſe Mountaines that lyeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Fraunce, is altogether barraine and vnfruitful: but
that part which is next <hi>Spayne,</hi> is full of trees, and well
peopled wyth many townes and villages. We will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beginne our deſcription of them, at the <hi>Ocean,</hi> where
they ioyne in <hi>Spayne</hi> to the region called <hi>Guipuzque,</hi>
but in <hi>Fraunce</hi> they border vpon the confines of the <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conians.</hi>
On the ſide of <hi>Spayne</hi> there is <hi>Stephans vallay,</hi>

being both very huige and beautifull and aſwel by

is lyke a Horne (which a litle before we tearmed a Cape
or Elbow) it hath ſeauen Hylles annexed vnto it, of the
which foure, do hang out into the Cape, and that which is
waſhed with <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> is the greateſt and maketh the

you muſt néeds include y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine champaine of <hi>Pera</hi> (now

fenced and fortyfied with thrée ſtrong walles, two verye
broad and déepe ditches, and many Towers and Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes

                  <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> is in compaſſe xiii. miles.</note>

yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpoſition of the ayre and deſtenie would not ſuffer
this citie to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head ſeate &amp; keye of the <hi>Romane</hi> empire.
For as not only euery Country but alſo euery citie haue
their proper fates, maners, faſhions and rites: ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:9649:47"/>
may not ſafelye be tranſlated or remooued into an other

            <p>For the diſpoſition and temperature of the ayre altereth
mens manners, which being altered their deſtinies and
Fortunes are alſo chaunged. Which to be true, the ende
proued apparantlie. For the Empire being tranſlated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
into the borders of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Emperors themſelues
and the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions were afterwarde choſen out of
that Prouince, who being infected with their Gréekiſhe
lightneſſe and ambition, ſeditiouſly practized ſundry facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amonge themſelues, and effeminated with the nyce
wantonneſſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were not of power to repel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of foraine <hi>Barbaryans:</hi> when as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Maiſtreſſe and Caſtle of the
whole earth, lacking a head and hauyng loſt the right vſe
of warlyke diſcipline was made an open pray for all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to inuade. And thus that Empyre which (lyke a
good trée) in his owne ſoyle bare very good fruict, beynge
tranſplanted into a ſtrange aire and ground, within ſhort
time periſhed and came to ruyne.</p>
            <p>But to retourne agayne to our purpoſed narration.
<hi>Malſamas</hi> aduaunced his power to beſiege by lande, that
part which we ſayde ſtoode in the <hi>Iſthmos</hi> or ſtreict péece
of grounde, betwéene the <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Propontis,</hi> whiche
could be oppugned none other way but onely by land. He
becauſe his purpoſe was, vtterlye to diſapoynt the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
that no victuall ſhoulde be conueighed vnto them,
and for that his deſire was to encroche as néere to the
walles as could be, ſo politiquely lodged his Garriſons &amp;
Hoſt on euery ſide that the fronte of his Armye, was as
though it had bene a Horhe next to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, &amp; thence as
the Féelds farder of from the narrow land, ſtretch out in
breadth &amp; ſcope, raught out along about the Cape or Bay
vnto the mouthes of the riuers which we ſayd had their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9649:47"/>
yſſu es &amp; fallynge into the ſame. For this Hoſt was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
populous, and formydable, and therfore required
greatground &amp; elbow roome. From thence making many
roades into the country adioigning, he lamentably diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſame, and threatning vtter ſubuerſion to the Citie
laide battrye and ſiege to it with Mynes, Baſtiles and all
kinde of Engynes that might any way further his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
On thother ſide, <hi>Zulciminie</hi> with his Nauye on
the Sea enuironed the whole Citie, on that ſide towarde
<hi>Propontis</hi> and <hi>Boſphorus</hi> from the narowe lande to the
Promontorye <hi>Metopick,</hi> inſomuche that to them that
looked out of the Citie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Seas <hi>Propontis</hi> and <hi>Boſphorus</hi>
ſéemed all ouer to be couered with wodde lyke a Foreſt.
He ſlept no more in his buſineſſe then <hi>Malſamas</hi> dyd: but
with ſea ſkalyng ladders and ſuch Gunnes as then were
in vſe, aſſaulted the citie and moſt fiercely ſhooke it.</p>
            <p>But the beſieged Citizens were ſo vigilaunt and ſo
hardy withal, that all their attemptes and deuoyres were
wholy fruſtrate. Wherfore ſeing they could not this way
preuaile, they thought to win their purpoſe by long ſiege
and tract of time. But <hi>Zulciminie</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon died
in his owne Campe, whereby there aroſe a ſeditious tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
among the <hi>Saracenes</hi> for the choſinge of a new byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and for that cauſe the ſiege was for a time intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
At length <hi>Aumar</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Abdimazid</hi> was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Byſhoppe in the dead mans place, in the yéere 721.
The wynter was then ſo extréemly colde, that all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
were hard froſen ouer with yce. And alſo they had
victuall dayly brought into their Campe out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> yet
becauſe the number of the men and Beaſtes was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
great and the winter extreamely colde, a great ſorte
of them dyed, ſome with colde, ſome for famyne and ſome
of diſeaſes, &amp; a great rablement of them thinking to get
ſome booty abroad, yſſued out of their owne Campes and
made incurſions into the frontiers of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:9649:48"/>
they were of the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> incountred withall, and in
manner all ſlayne, as they were about their pyllage. At

and ſo ſpoyled them that few of them eſcaped vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt

no moe but .xv C. And if the night had not come vppon
them ere the battayle was fully ended, the whole route
of the <hi>Saracenes</hi> had bene at that time vtterly deſtroyed.
For <hi>Abderama</hi> in the night ſeaſon, perceiuinge how the
game went, and what a mortall ouerthrow he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
had no luſt to tarye and expect the hazard of the next

all his carriage and ſtuffe for a praye to his Enemies.
But the <hi>Nauarrians</hi> hauyng ſtopped the ſtreight paſſages

next day aſſoone as the Sonne was vp, <hi>Martellus</hi> in good
order marſhalled his army and tooke the Féeld, awaiting
the commyng of his enemies. But when he perfectlye
vnderſtoode that they were fled, his Souldiours fell to the
ſpoyle, which they found in the <hi>Saracenes</hi> Campe moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant

            <p>After the death of <hi>Eudo, Martellus</hi> added that parte of

               <hi>Saracenes</hi> more
aduiſedly and warely then <hi>Eudo</hi> before had done, that is
to wit, by geuing and receiuing hoſtages on both parties,
he eftſoones procured them to come agayne into <hi>Fraunce:</hi>
who now not with an Hoſt of bolde &amp; tymorous, warlike

And taking <hi>Auignion</hi> by treaſon of <hi>Maurice</hi> Capitayne

After this, more ruffling and commotion kindled in

With whoſe wealth, the Slaues being enriched

hundreth thouſand fighting Souldiours ready appointed

            <p>The Siege of this Citie continued many dayes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
aſſaultes fiercely geuen. The Aſſaylauntes were
not ſo buſie without, but the Defendaunts were as dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
within many times yſſuinge out of their Gates, not
after the <hi>Arabian</hi> guyſe, but accordinge to the <hi>Spanish</hi>
manner, armed with Sword and fire, quick, ſwift, nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſodaine, deluding their enemyes, with many ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes
and ſubtyll pollicies, facinge and ſhifting from
place to place, pretermittinge no occaſion that made for
their purpoſe, dealynge euery where and at all times ſo
deceiueablye, that when the other partye thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſureſt of their purpoſe, they were fardeſt of, and
when their deſires were likeſt (as thei thought) to ſorte to
effect, then were they ſooneſt beguiled and lykely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to fall into the lapps of their enemies: ſo ſecret and
ſpéedy, that they were many times in the middeſt of their
enemies flaſhing among them before any man ſuſpected
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, killing them and ſetting fire in their tentes
and gone againe out of ſight, ere any reſiſtaunce could be
made or any time to go againſt them. They ſkirmiſhed &amp;
ruffled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their enemies, in a maner within their owne
tents. And although there was a band apointed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates
of the Citie to kéepe them from comminge out, yet (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding)
they could not be ſo pent in, nor debarred
from their purpoſes, but with lyke bouldeneſſe as afore,
they would often ſet vpon them, and by no meanes wolde
be brought to kepe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wals of the citie, til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wer
throughly entrenched and rampired, and all their works
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9649:62"/>
within, finiſhed to their minde. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did they ſtand at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaunce
valiauntly, not as men defending their manhood
with walles, but kéepyng &amp; defending their walles with
manhood. This Siege contynuing ſomwhat longe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kings which were daily looked for to reyſe the ſiege,
came in deed, albeit furniſhed with any hoaſt, able to fight
a maine battaile, but euer as they eſpied any aduauntage
or occaſion, they would make out Dimilaunces and light
Horſemen by knowen pathes and waies, to annoy King
<hi>Charles.</hi> Which Horſemen oftener by night then by day
alitle diſquieted his Campe, and made ſome diſturbance
and Outcries therein. An other crewe of them killyng the
watchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; perforce making way through their enemies
Bulwarkes and Fortifications, entred the citie, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
relieued them within, whereby thei conceiued great
hope of future ſucceſſe. <hi>Charles</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a courage vnappauled
and inuincible exhorting his men, tolde them that the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
was to be obtained with paines taking &amp; vigilancie,
that martiall proweſſe appeareth not only in the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and conflict, but a great deale rather in good diſcipline
and obſeruance of martiall orders, not to be lulled in eaſe
and ſecurytie, beſtowing the greateſt part of the night in
ſléepe and bodely reſt, but in ſtudie and deuiſe for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiueaunce
of their waightye buſineſſe, &amp; in the day time
inceſſantly to be buſied, abſtaining from riot &amp; libidinous
luſtes &amp; euermore abandoning werines and lingering of
time. Geuing them further to vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cages and
walles wherin thoſe <hi>Sathaniſtes</hi> had encloſed themſelues
for their ſauegard, muſt ether perforce be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in péeces
&amp; beaten downe about their eares, or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be tamed and brought vnder awfull obedience.
Wherfore he had them to aduance their ſtandards &amp; with
banners diſplaid, to march againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not ſuffer them
to reſt. Then was ther made fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; habiliments,
to ſerue ech way and on euery ſide, wherby their Camp
was kept both before, behind and on either ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9649:63"/>
Then they that fiſked and raunged out as thei did before,
were faine to hyde their heades within their Fortreſſe, or
els were ſhamfully compelled to retire, and ſo the matter
was brought to a perfect Siege. Then beganne there a
ſharpe and terrible battrye whiche contynued day and
night without intermiſſion, freſh Souldiours euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weary, and fighting by courſe one
after an other rounde aboute, with all kinde of deuiſes
Engins, Ordinaunce, Ladders, Bridges, pollicie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyauntnes,
in ſomuch that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Saracenes</hi> courage being wel
cooled, were now diſmaid &amp; at their wits end, not hable to
hold out ani longer, but on euery ſide (do what they could)
were by the valyant <hi>French</hi> Aſſaylaunts throwen downe
from the walles or els ſlayne out of hand. Within the
Citie alſo there was a great ſlaughter of them, vntyll the
King had made proclamation that as many as were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
and without weapon ſhould be ſpared.</p>
            <p>Then lo, the <hi>Saracenes,</hi> euer before that time, chooſing

ſacked. From thence the Campe remooued and went to

which beinge terryfied and feared by the example afore,

Townes and places as <hi>Charles</hi> had taken in <hi>Spaine:</hi>
with whom there were many other Princes, Potentats

combates, darraigned and foughten with hym hand to

fought a bloudy battayle with hym at <hi>Baion,</hi> a Citie of
<hi>Vaſconia,</hi> wherein were ſlayne 400000. Chriſtians,
and among them <hi>Myles Anglere</hi> Father to <hi>Rouland,</hi> a

was Generall of the whole Army. Notwithſtanding, all
was regained by the puyſſance and proweſſe of <hi>Charles,</hi>
and other freſh ayd that then came euen in the nicke out

            <p>But not long after, hauinge repaired his army with

thence was in the borders of <hi>Xantongue</hi> in a cruell

<hi>Charles</hi> made any moe voyages againſt the <hi>Saracenes</hi>
into <hi>Spaine</hi> but one, nor that they euer entred into

renowne of his noble Actes and inuincible valiaunce,
and for the common weale of his Kingdome and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
becauſe he had no Children of his owne, and ſaw
that the power of that onely Region was farre vnhable

that he would ayde hym againſt the King of <hi>Corduba,</hi>
with whom he had then waged Warre. <hi>Charles</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting

Which compoſition when the Nobles and Péeres of the
Realme of <hi>Lyon</hi> vnderſtoode, they were ſoore diſpleaſed

and kepte, ſo encreaſed, that at this daye it is
thought to be one of the greateſt Cities in the whole

by <hi>Elagleb</hi> to be at <hi>Caioran,</hi> whiche Citie was builte
in <hi>Affrica</hi> when <hi>Ottmen</hi> had the regiment and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
of the Empyre, and is diſtaunte from the Citie

            <p>
               <hi>Spaigne</hi> although it obeyed &amp; had in it many kings, yet
they all acknowledged the Byſhop of <hi>Marrocco</hi> for their
Dioceſan: whiche is a Citie of <hi>Mauritanie Tingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana.</hi>
He that gouourned <hi>Aſsyria</hi> was called the <hi>Caliph,</hi>
whiche name ſignyfieth a ſucceſſoure: becauſe he boaſted
and bragged himſelf to be the Succeſſoure of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
The <hi>Aegiptian</hi> Byſhoppe was called the <hi>Sultane,</hi> and
hee of <hi>Caioran,</hi> (lyke as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> dyd) named him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

and as euerie one fauoured thys Byſhoppe or that, ſo
in hys quarrell dyd he make Warre with the Kings

and the ſtate of their Empyre was at this time through
the perturbation and burlyburly about the ſoueraigntie,
ſo obſcured and vnknowen, that no certaintie in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

Authors, concerning the actes and geſtes by them
atchieued.</p>
            <p>In the tyme that this <hi>Muamat</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Aaron</hi>
ruled <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> the Sonne in law of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
(expulſer of <hi>Leo</hi> out of <hi>Armenia</hi>) was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> one <hi>Thomas</hi> brued a great gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyle
and commotion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> a ranke ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy villain.</note> Of whom the report and fame is
tolde after two wayes. Some ſaye he came of a very
poore and baſe Parentage, and that he lyued long tyme
in much pouertie and indigence, faine to get his lyuing
with his handie labour, and ſometyme with ſeruile drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie.
Afterward, abandoning his natiue Countrey and
comming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was retained in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of an Alderman of the Citie where the graceleſſe
verlet ſo much abuſed himſelfe with carnall luſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
life, that he committed adultrie with his Miſtreſſe,
and dubbed the Alderman his maiſter, Knight of the
common Hall. Which lewde pranke being detected and
come to light, <hi>Thomas</hi> partly for ſtarke ſhame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie
and partly for feare of the paynes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appoynted by Law for ſuche as he was, fledde to
the <hi>Saracenes:</hi> for whoſe Diueliſhe deuiſes he was as
fit an Organe and Inſtrument as any in the worlde:
with whom, he was had in a great credite, ſpeciallye
after that his conuerſation and behauiour a long tyme
contynued and ſhewed among them (for he had nowe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9649:67"/>
dwelled among them .xxv. yéeres) had geuen ſufficient
teſtimonie &amp; put them in an aſſured opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fidelitie
towarde them. Inſomuch that renouncing and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Chriſtianitie and abiuring the holy Religion
of the Chriſtians, he embraced the horrible doctrine of
<hi>Mahometicall</hi> Religion. And beyng by them appoynted
Capitane of a competent Crew of warlike Souldiours
was ſent againſt the Chriſtians. For he had promiſed
vnto them, that if they would furniſhe him out with ſome
competent power, he woulde vndertake to ſubdue the
<hi>Romane</hi> Empyre into their handes. And leaſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould haue any miſtruſt &amp; diffidence in him thus
working and contriuing the Toyle of their confuſion, or
peraduenture taking him as a ſtraunger &amp; forayner giue
no credite to his wordes, he named himſelf <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Irene.</hi> Which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in very déede (for
his crabbed nature and peruerſe maners) his mother lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
before had bereft of both his eyes and of the Empire alſo,
and was then dead.</p>
            <p>Some others there be, which do affirme that this <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
was whilome in the houſe of one <hi>Bardanius</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Turcus,</hi> together with <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Leo.</hi> At what
time ſoiourning at a place called <hi>Philomelium,</hi> &amp; ſeeking
by all meanes how to make himſelfe Emperour, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
his counſaile and opened the very bottome of his
ſtomacke to a certaine Monke ſkilfull in the prediction of
fortunes and things to come, to which deuiſe and plat he
made <hi>Leo Armenus</hi> priuie. Vnto whome the Monke
tolde, that if he firſt aſpired to the Empyre, he ſhould looſe
both hys eyes and his worldly dignitie: but of them,
that brought hym his horſe, the firſt and ſecond ſhould
enioy the Diademe, and the thirde ſhould bee proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Emperour: but not hable to compaſſe and throughly
bring about, his deſired purpoſe, he ſhould ſhortly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe
and be brought to confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9649:68"/>
The firſt was <hi>Leo,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Michael,</hi> and the third this
<hi>Thomas</hi> whom <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour made Colonell ouer
the Band of his Confederates. Which <hi>Leo,</hi> when <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
vnderſtoode to bée ſlaine by <hi>Michael,</hi> he partly to
reuenge the death of him through whoſe beneuolence &amp;
goodwill he had bene promoted to diuerſe dignities, and
partlie to eaſe his owne Stomacke and bringe about the
effect of his malicious mynde (for <hi>Michael</hi> and he coulde
neuer agrée but maligned one an other euen from their
Adoleſcencie) rayſed warre agaynſt <hi>Michael,</hi> and firſt
found the meanes to inueigle and rayſe vp the <hi>Orientall</hi>
power (among whom he lyued) to take part wyth hym.
Thus he gathered together an armye not of weaklings
and vnexpert Souldiours, or of a fewe in number, but
huyge, Populous and hardie, of <hi>Saracenes, Moores,
Indians, Medes, Perſians, Aſſyrians, Armenians,
Chaldees, Iberians, Zigians, Cabirians</hi> and diuerſe
other Nations. Of whom, ſome by compulſion accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
hym in that Warre, ſome for good will, ſome
in hope of ſpoyle, and ſome for a rooted malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt <hi>Michael,</hi> who for his froward nature and
peruerſe manners was generally hated of all men. For
<hi>Thomas</hi> although he was lame on one of his féete, and a
<hi>Barbarian</hi> borne, yet for his gray heares and auncient
age he was reputed among them venerable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull,
in famylier talke and conference very curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and affable (whych are the thinges that moſt of
all wynneth the heartes of Souldiours) and for bodely
ſtrength not inferiour to any.</p>
            <p>He thus furniſhed with an armie of <hi>Saracenes,</hi> to
whom he had promyſed the <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre,
and alſo with a great power of Chriſtians which
ventured life limme and goods with him, violently inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and forcibly got the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Orient.</hi> And bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnder his obedience the exacters of publique tributes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9649:68"/>
with great ſtatelyneſſe of minde, folowed the chaſe of good
fortune now ſeruing his turne and ſmyling vppon hym,
Within a while, of a low Haſkerd became a great Ruler
and of a weake mungrell Pezaunt a mighty Potentate,
by whom all <hi>Aſia</hi> was with ſpoiling and pillage miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afflicted. Some Cities for feare ioygned ſyde with
him, and conformed themſelues to his humour. Some
becauſe they would not reuolte from theyr true Liege
the Emperour, were ſpoyled and the inhabitauntes
caryed awaye Captyue. So that there were none in
all <hi>Aſia</hi> but only the <hi>Opſicians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> which
continued in their true allegiance. For which gratuitie &amp;
conſtant obedience, the Emperour releaſed and frankly
remitted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their publique tribute called <hi>Fumariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
But <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſo puffed vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſucceſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly
tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Emperour: &amp; was
crowned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diademe at <hi>Antioche,</hi> by <hi>Iob</hi> Paſtour
or Biſhop at that time of the <hi>Antiochene</hi> Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
whom he (to requite one good turne for another) adopted
for his Sonne, and made as his fellowe and Coadiutour
in the adminiſtration of the Empyre, and then chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his owne name called himſelfe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
Sonne of <hi>Irene</hi> the Empreſſe.</p>
            <p>The Emperour knowing of this new ſtirre and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
made preparation for warre: and ſent one of his
Lordes with an Army nothing equall (God wot) nor of
power to match and encounter with his enemies: which
was by <hi>Thomas</hi> diſcomfited and cleane ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, méeting with the <hi>Romane</hi> Fléete, tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame,
and with .lxxx.M. men tooke his way to <hi>Abydus,</hi> which
is a Citie of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, ſtanding vpon the Sea ſyde,
ſpoyling and deſtroying all where he went, &amp; burning to
aſhes not only poore vpla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſh villages, but goodly towns
and ſtronge Cities. And from thence in a very darke
nyghte tranſfreted into <hi>Thracia,</hi> where many of the
<pb facs="tcp:9649:69"/>
Emperours Souldiours reuoulted and fled dayly vnto
hym. He put to flight and draue downe all the Emperors
power ſent againſt hym. Wherof were chief Capitaines
<hi>Olbian</hi> and <hi>Catacella,</hi> and (lyke a ragyng Streame, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
runnyng downe from a Hyll) profligated both by
Sea and Land and bore downe before him, an other wel
apoynted Nauy, manned out lykewiſe by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. He burſt aſunder the yron chayne that went
ouerthwart the Hauen &amp; ſo layd ſiege to the citie both by
Sea and land. But preuailyng nothing that way, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned
to winne his purpoſe by long ſiege, and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
his Campe in very good order, ſent parte of his army
to ſubdue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Townes lying by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coaſt of <hi>Euxine.</hi> This
doone, with the reſt of his power (which was very great)
he on euery ſide beclipped the citie with a mighty oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and gaue thereto a terrible battery. But by the
valyaunt courage of the Defendauntes, all his attemptes
were fruſtrate. And his Nauy on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea by force of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
was diſperſed and diſſeuered, ſo that he was fayne to
brynge his hoaſt back agayne into <hi>Aſia</hi> tyll the wynter
were paſſed.</p>
            <p>The Spring folowyng, he agayne retourned to the
ſame ſiege: but <hi>Michael</hi> being now better furniſhed and
prouided then hee was before both with a Nauy of tall
Shippes to ſcowre the Coaſtes and kéepe the Seas, and
alſo with an army of luſty ſouldiours by land, firſt aſſaied
by diuers ſlights to vndermine <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſouldiours &amp;
to ſollicite them to renownce and forſake their Capitaine
but al was in vayne. Wherfore ſetting all the Gates of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
citie open, he ſodenly with all his company iſſued out and
ſet vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> ſuſpectyng no ſuch pretence and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and him there diſcomfited, and his whole Fléete on
the Sea alſo.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Gregory,</hi> Coſen to <hi>Leo</hi> late Emperor,
who with a crew of good fighting Souldiours ayded <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:9649:69"/>
but now ſéeinge the worlde thus tourned, ſeparated
foorthwith his Souldiours aparte from the reſidue, in
hope thereby to wynne the Emperours fauour and ſet
vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> behinde. Whiche when <hi>Thomas</hi> eſpyed,
beyng nothing therewith diſcouraged, nor yet therefore
remoouing his ſtronglye lodged Campe from the Citie,
ſet vpon <hi>Gregorie</hi> with parte of hys Army and him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
who for his ſauegard flying away, he caught in
the chaſe and put to death. Then ſpéeding himſelfe into
his Camp agayne, he addreſſed his letters abroad into all
quarters, vntruly makyng report that he had gotten the
vpperhand againſt <hi>Michael</hi> in battayle: and ſent for the
Nauy that lay at <hi>Berytum,</hi> wherein were of Gallayes
and Hulkes to the number of CCC.L. Sayle, with all
expedition to come vnto him, as though the matter ſhould
foorthwith be tryed likewiſe by Sea. Which drifte and
commaundement when the Admyralles and Capitaines
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Nauy vnderſtoode and knew, they ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them at vnwares by night in the roade, when they
lay at Anker, and with their ſodayne comming, ſo ſcarred
and affrayed the Mariners that they were at their wittes
ende and knewe not how vpon ſuch a ſodayne to defend
themſelues: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there many of them were by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
taken, and many burnt, and very few eſcaped, which
beyng quicke of ſayle gott away and ioyned themſelues
to the other Army that was on the land.</p>
            <p>While this terreſtriall army lay before <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
without any notable battayle ſauing only manylight
ſkirmiſhes, and ſmall bickeringes, wherein ſomtimes
Fortune ſmyled and ſomtime frowned vpon either part,
the ſame and reporte thereof was ſpread and bruted
throughout the Worlde. In ſomuche that <hi>Mortago</hi>
King of <hi>Bulgarie,</hi> (notwithſtandinge the Emperoure
for gréedineſſe and miſerable ſparing of his money as he
<pb facs="tcp:9649:70"/>
was by nature moſt couetous and a néere Prince, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
hym for his good wyll, had before refuſed his ayde
offeryng to aſſiſt him, ſaying that he had no néede therof)
partlye becauſe hee was deſirous of Warre and ſpoyle
of his enemies, and partly to confirme the former thrée
yeeres League made with <hi>Leo Armenus,</hi> marched with
an Armye agaynſte <hi>Thomas,</hi> and him in a place called
<hi>Cedocto,</hi> not farre from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where the two
armyes met, in Battayle ouercame &amp; vanquiſhed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
many a man was ſlayne, and after the ende thereof
retourned home with many Priſoners and rich Booties.</p>
            <p>When the Nauye that <hi>Thomas</hi> had left at the Siege
heard of this notable diſcomfiture and ouerthrowe, they
all reuoulted from <hi>Thomas</hi> and ſubmitted themſelues to
the Emperour. <hi>Thomas</hi> gatheringe together the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt
of his Armye that eſcaped vnkylled at the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with <hi>Mortago,</hi> conducted them into a playne Féelde
called <hi>Diabaſis,</hi> diſtaunt certayne Furlonges from the
Citie, a place verye commodious and fit for excurſions,
and for plentie of water very profitable. Where hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
encamped. From thence makinge vagaries and
roades, he waſted and deſpoyled al the Emperours ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
buyldings and banqueting houſes of pleaſure ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Suburbes of the Citie. The Emperoure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
his Armye euery daye more and more encreaſed,
ſtrake vp Alarme and gaue the charge vpon him in thrée
ſeuerall parts, whereby he throughly put al <hi>Thomas</hi> his
Armye to flight. For <hi>Thomas</hi> before had geuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente
to his men, that at the firſte onſette, they
ſhould retyre and make a ſhewe as though they fled, and
afterward vpon the ſodayne tourne agayne and recharge
vpon their enemies. After this diſcomfiture many of his
men fledde to the Emperour. <hi>Thomas</hi> with a few of his
adherents came in ſafetie to <hi>Adrianople</hi> and his adoptiue
Son <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> eſcaping alſo by flight, tooke for his ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9649:70"/>
the Caſtel of <hi>Byzia.</hi> After whom the Emperour
without delay making purſuite, went firſte to <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
where <hi>Thomas</hi> was. And leaſt the <hi>Scythians</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng

ſurrender and yéelde, and ſo beclipped it rounde aboute
with a ſtrong Siege.</p>
            <p>The Citie was well walled and beſide that, ſurely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
and fortefied with Bulwarkes. But they were
ſo pinched with Famine, that all their victualles beinge
ſpent, they ſecretly had conference with <hi>Michael</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a poyncte and compoſition with him for pardon of
this their rebellyous conſpiracie, deliuered <hi>Thomas</hi> into

himſelfe vpon the Pauement and Stones, whiche done,
he ſet his féete vpon his necke, and trodde vpon hym.</p>
            <p>Then he cauſed his Féete and handes to be cutte of, and
ſo ſetting him vpon an Aſſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to be caryed
about the Campe, for euery man to wonder at. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

Haue mercie &amp; compaſſion vpon me y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> art y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true King.
And when he was about, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
&amp; motions to haue bewraied &amp; accuſed certen of his
famyliers, as pryuie and of counſel with him in this ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling

one of his Nobles, that no credite ought in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be geuen to a profeſſed enemie, accuſing the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

ſo geuing order for his execution, cauſed him, (longe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
in terrible forments) to be put to death.</p>
            <p>They that fled to <hi>Byzia,</hi> folowing the example of the

This end had <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe hiſtorie (although he were

            </p>

moſt fierce and at that time by reaſon of the huygenes of

burnt the Suburbes. Whiche Citie albeit the Citizenes

            <p>At whiche aunſwere <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſo ſtormed and fumed

he could nothing preuaile, he rayſed his Siege and went

do ſtraightwayes die. <q>The Emperour fought valiauntly
that day and oftentimes aſſayled the Turkes fiercely to
driue them out of the Staightes and to open the waye for

by the meanes &amp; helpe of the <hi>Europia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scythians,</hi> he made

            <p>Thus was the Turkiſhe Empire ſubuerted and
brought to finall ruyne, and from a State of well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
diſcipline and magnificence, fell to vtter decay and
extreeme confuſion: the cauſe whereof was, for that,
not onely the Nobilitie and higher Powers dyuided the
Kingdome into many ſections and partes, but many
alſo of baſer degrée and obſcurer Parentage, (aſſociatyng
vnto them the raſcall Peazauntes and vulgar ſort) practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
pylfering and robberie, carying nothing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but

that the garriſons defending the Caſtles &amp; fortreſſes

ſtipendes at the Emperours handes, woulde ſerue no
longer but departed thence, whych being at the firſt (as a
thing of ſmall waight and moment) neglected, was in the
ende the cauſe, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Empyre ſuſtained and
incurred moſt gréeuous daungers and calamities. For
<pb facs="tcp:9649:113"/>
when the Turkes were diſplaced and expulſed by the
<hi>Tartarians,</hi> they diſplaced and expulſed the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and
looke howe weake they were in compariſon of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi>
ſo ſtronge were they againſt the <hi>Greekes:</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that at length the matter was decided with open
warre and dent of Sworde. For the Emperour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that a great power of Turkes were vp in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlagonia,</hi>
leuyed a very competent Armye, to repreſſe
and (as much as might he) to inhibite their violent inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
leaſt if they ſhoulde bee ſtill ſuffered impunely to
raunge &amp; ſpoyle without reſiſtaunce, it might breede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
daunger and inconuenience. And therfore when bee
had aſſembled his power together, he ſent the ſame being
wel appointed againſt them, who encountring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turks,
had of them the victory. But whileſt they diſorderly and
ouerfarre in chaſe beyond the ryuer purſued them, they
fell into the bandes of an Ambuſhe which the Turkes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
night before had there layd for them. By meanes wherof
they being on th'one ſide beſet with an Haoſt of freſhe
Souldiours well appointed in battle aray, and on th'other

almoſt euery man. The Turkes triumphing for thys
ſucceſſe and victorie, enroaded afterward within the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Territories, and came as farre as the ryuer <hi>Sanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>

and ſubdued <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> and all the Countrey

            <p>Nowe, how this came to paſſe, we wyll declare. The

               <hi>Caliphes</hi> and all the <hi>Saracenes,</hi> lulled in caſe and noſeled
