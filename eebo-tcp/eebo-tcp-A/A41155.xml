            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

affirme and teach,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 26.</note> that his kingdome was not of this world, and
prohibited the ſubjects of his kingdome to take dominion and

            <p>But as a naturall body is one, and hath many members, and
all the members of the body which is one, though they bee many,
yet are but one body, even ſo is Chriſt, for I am his owne body by
his ſpirituall union; but marke well and underſtand, this body
is not one member, as a Pope, or Epiſcopus, to take preheminence,
which would make diviſion betwixt me and my head.</p>
            <p>But in the body there are many members, ſo in me the body or
Church of Chriſt there are many members, and hee is the onely
true and abſolute ſupreme head. And none but he can give many
and divers gifts and adminiſtrations as in this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 2. 4. 5, 6,
7. but the ſame Spirit, the ſame Lord, and though there bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
of operations, yet one God is the ſame, which worketh
all in all; Now if my head be God, and my endeavour the gifts
of the ſpirit, who can impoſe upon mee any other gifts adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or operation, but onely my Lord, ſurely no Prince, no Pope,
no Prelate.</p>
            <p>But conſider me, my ſonnes in this thing, that the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall,
no member, nor perſon is to receive this talent, and to hide it,
for God doth not light theſe lights to put them under a buſhell but
to enlighten the whole houſe the Church; As every member of
the body is profitable to other, ſo are my members; Therefore to
ſome hee gives the word of Wiſedome, to another the word of
Knowledge, to another the excellencie of Faith, to another the
operation of great workes, to another propheſie, to another diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of tongues, and to another interpretation of Tongues; All
theſe worketh one and the ſame ſpirit, diſtributing ſeverally as
<pb facs="tcp:64520:5"/>
he liſteth, for Chriſt my Lord and head is God; And the Father
is in him, and hee in the Father which is above all, and through
you all,<note place="margin">Epheſ 4. 7, 8.</note> and in us all; who gives unto every one grace according
to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt; for it was propheſied of him,
that when he aſcended (who had first deſcended into the loweſt
dejection of earthly paines and debaſement for the ſinnes of man)
hee ſhould alſo aſcend, and ſit on the right hand of God, and lead
captivitie captive, and receive of God the Father, gifts to give
unto man; Not humane gifts to governe the terreſtriall affaires
of this life, but divine gifts to guide and lead the ſoules of men
into the way of peace and eternall felicitie.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing my head is the great myſterie of God, and
ſpirituall word of Life, to whom I am united through the unitie
of the Spirit, I am his and he is mine, and both one Chriſt, one
Church and Myſticall body or ſpirituall Spouſe, My Lord give
me, all ſpirituall gifts to tranſlate me, from darkneſſe into his
glorious light; from carnall and earthly things, to bee made a
ſpirituall and heavenly Spouſe. For God which made light to
ſhine out of darkneſſe, is he which hath ſhined in our hearts to
give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face
of Jeſus Chriſt. But wee have this treaſure in earthen veſſels,
that the excellencie of that power, might be of God, and not of
man; For theſe cauſes he gave and ordained ſome members to
have diverſitie of gifts and adminiſtration; as firſt Apoſtles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
Prophets and Evangeliſts, thirdly Paſtors and Teachers;
Then ſuch as doe miracles (for miracles follow the Word,<note place="margin">Epheſ 4. 11.</note> where
there is need of confirmation) and gifts of healing, helpers, as
Deacons and Governours as Elders.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the instruments of miniſtration by divers gifts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
into divers administrations and offices which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by their ſpirituall operation and ministration of one
and the ſame word and miniſterie of God.</p>
            <p>This is that order, ordinance and government, or ſpirituall
juriſdiction, which my Lord God your Father hath instituted for
the repairing of the Saints, for the worke of the miniſtery, and for
the edification of the body of Chriſt his Church even mee your
Mother, and this is to continue, and not to be altered and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
untill we all meet together in the unity of faith, and that

acknowledging of the Sonne of God unto a perfect Man, and unto

            <p>Thus Right Honourable my Sonnes and Saints of God your

judgements and ſpirituall wiſedomes, that you may behold
mee all glorious within, and not judge by outward appearance,
nor by politique reaſons, leſt you be miſtaken in my nature and
condition, and ſuppoſe me to be a terreſtriall Hierarchie to bee
governed by poſitive lawes, traditions, Decrees and Canons of
men, which cannot ſearch the reines of the heart, nor cure the
ſoule, nor lead her into bliſſe. Therefore I requeſt you to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your conſideration the heavie burdens grievous to bee borne,
(which the Scribes and Phariſees of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretended to
ſit in <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſeat) have laid upon my ſhoulders: the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
waight whereof you my ſonnes have heretofore borne, with
much griefe, whilſt they advanced themſelves to the chiefe ſeates
and moſt eminent dignities, loving to be reputed great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Rabbies, even above you the naturall Peeres and Potentates
of State.</p>
            <p>And now I conclude, and doe offer unto your ſacred conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the holy Sinode of the Apostles, ſet forth for a perfect
patterne of all Counſells and Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. In the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the <hi>Acts</hi> where you may obſerve that Synode conſiſted
of the Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren. Their conſultation was
according to the rule of the written Word, there concluſion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was thus; It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us to
lay no more burden upon you then theſe things neceſſarie. That
is, that yee abſtaine from things offered to Idols and blood, which
includes all Ceremoniall inventions and bloudy ſacrifices, and
prohibits from that which is ſtrangled with all crueltie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and from fornication, which imports uncleane conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
and luſts, which if yee forbeare yee ſhall doe well.</p>
            <p>And though I here claime of you the honour of being your
Mother being the body of Chriſt and Church of God, in whom
you alſo have the honour and prerogative to be the ſonnes of God;
yet touching my earthly habitation and abode I am under your
Dominion and tuition, whom my Lord hath placed over me for
my peace and proſperity on earth. And that through Soveraigne
<pb facs="tcp:64520:6"/>
power and authority which he hath ordained over all men, to the
end you may give his Goſpell a free paſſage, and be nurſing and
protecting Fathers of mee in your Common-wealth, that your
Father may give you and your King a bleſſing of welfare and
happy being in my Lord Chriſt, in whom all Nations are bleſſed,
and bleſſed is that Nation whoſe God is the Lord.</p>

ſent them a deliverer, even his ſervant <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> added
nothing to the ſervice of the firſt age: but God added alſo
the Sacrament of the Paſſeover,<note place="margin">Paſſeover.</note> to declare unto them, that as
none was to be eſteemed the people of God, but thoſe that
were under the ſigne of the Covenant of God; ſo none ſhould
be delivered from the deſtroying wrath of God: but thoſe
that were redeemed, reconciled, and waſhed, or ſprinkled
with the blood of the unſpotted Lamb of God; the promiſed
ſeed of the woman, the word of life, made fleſh, in whoſe
death and ſhedding of his blood, they were ſaved and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from ſpirituall bondage and death; and this was to be
obſerved for a perpetuall ordinance among Gods people for

               <p>All the glory of the Tabernacle, and after that the Temple

pray for Emperours, for their Officers and Potentates; and

even the light of nature by multiplying their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions:
And this was a principall cauſe why they lived in

               <p>But in the ſecond age God did not onely for their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth
of ſinfulneſſe cut ſhort the dayes of man,<note place="margin">Why God ſhortned the dayes of mans life.</note> but hee alſo

               <p>But why was this ſecond age burthened with ordinances
and figures?<note place="margin">The reaſon why the ſecond age was clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> becauſe this age was drowned with the growth
of ſinne, and incapable of light, for ſinne by the law became
more raging and ſinfull; and the law was weak, and could
not prevaile with man becauſe of ſinne, for mans ſinfulneſſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64520:13"/>
was ſo great, that the ſpirit of the law which is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
could not dwell in fleſh and blood but it muſt be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
for this cauſe the law became death unto man, and man,
by the law became dead: for the law did not onely reprove,
but condemne. But in this third age the righteouſneſſe of the
law became incarnate, and was made man, that man might be
made the righteouſneſſe of the law: Thus that Chriſt, who
was promiſed to the firſt age, is become our righteouſneſſe:
ſo that now the ſpirit is communicated in a fuller meaſure,
and more evident and powerfull then it was unto the Jewes
in figurative types and ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon why all things are become more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and God will have his worſhip now to be known to be
onely ſpirit and truth; for through him we are become new
creatures unto God the Father, created in Chriſt, not to a new
worſhip, but to the ſame worſhip more pure and perfectly to
worſhip in ſpirit then heretofore.</p>

and therefore will be worſhip'd in ſpirit and truth. Alſo God
is one ſimple pure ſpirituall Eſſence, therefore he will have no
invention, nor no mixture of any Rites, Ceremonies, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
but plaineneſſe. And againe, God will with the
ſimple plaineneſſe of his worſhip and preaching confound
the wiſedome and ſuperſtitious curioſity of man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

he ſaith in his Goſpel; If you doe the things I command you

Father doth witneſſe, that Chriſt is onely to be heard, ſaying
from heaven this is my beloved Sonne, heare him; thereupon
we are not to regard what thoſe before us have judged meet;
becauſe we are not to apply our ſelves to follow the cuſtoms
of man, but the truth and verity of God. And the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

honour and dignity of his birth-right and dominion though
at the firſt, (by loſing that breath of life which was the
light and life of his ſoule, and that made him the perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God) they were weakened and blemiſhed in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie.
For if he had loſt his naturall faculties, hee had loſt
the forme of his being, and if his birth-right and dignity of

upon another, then ſhould nature have been deprived of the

               <head>Difference betwixt Regall ordination and

               <p>From hence we may extract an evident difference betwixt
the power of royall ordination in nature, and the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

That is a miniſteriall power to diſtribute Judgement, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,

to puniſh actuall offences, with corporall or pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

manner, and a greater meaſure of divine power and gifts,
for the miniſtration, writing, teaching, and preaching of the
Word and Sacraments of God, which is that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God to the antient Prophets, and that which was
taught by Chriſt, and after written by the Spirit of God,
from the pen and mouth of the Apoſtles; And this power is
a miniſteriall power, mighty in operation to bind and looſe
the conſcience, to open and ſhut heaven and hell, by declaring
the judgement of God againſt unpenitent ſinners, and his mercy
in Chriſt to the penitent man, as he hath taught and revealed;
for this power doth not follow the judgement and will of
man, nor ſucceſſion of profeſſion, but is tyed and limited to
the power of the Word and will of God; Therefore what
they hind on earth by this miniſteriall power, Chriſt bindes
in heaven by his abſolute power. By this there is no power
of coaction given to the Church over the body, nor purſe,
nor life, but onely over the ſoule and conſcience, and to rule

For this ſimilitudes ſake, Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates are

               <p>The Church is called a kingdome, becauſe as in earthly

Chriſt onely and abſolutely from the Father through

the Spirit hath power by the divine Word and law of God
over the ſoules of men for their eternall happineſſe and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Alſo, it is called the kingdome of God, becauſe God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that the word in eſſence, and property

eternitie it ſelfe, as it is deſcribed in
the firſt of <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell, and though it
cannot bee divided in it ſelfe yet it is
to bee diſtinguiſhed after the perſonall
order of the Trinitie.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may ſay the Word in the perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the unbegotten Word in the perſon of the Sonne, it is
the begotten Word, and in the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, it is
the procceding Word. So that by the proceeding Word all
things flow from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
            <p>By the order of this proceeding power the world was
made by the word of God. As the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<hi> Pſal. 33. 6.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the
hoast of them by the breath of his mouth. </hi>By this proceeding
power of the Word man was made a living ſoule, as<hi> Gen. 2.
7. </hi>And God breathed in his face the breath of life, and the
man was a living ſoule,<hi> and </hi>Ioh.<hi> 1. 4. in it was life, and that life
was the light of man, not naturall reaſon, but ſupernaturall
light which inlightened nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this proceeding word <hi>Adam</hi> was reſtored after his
fall, by promiſing to make the Word the ſeed of the Woman,
and to breake the Serpents head. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for God by the
proceeding of the Word, ſaying he will put enmity betwixt
Satan (whoſe nature is wicked and evill altogether) and
the humane generation or ſeed which Satan had made like

he would make his Word the ſeed of the Woman, whereby
it ſhould be of a contrary nature to wickedneſſe, of a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pure and holy nature and condition powerfull againſt
Satan.</p>
            <p>Thus by the proceeding Word, the word (God) is
made the word of promiſe, and the Promiſe is made life,
and thus it comes to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for by inſpiration of the proceeding Word, God the Word
dwelleth in them, for in the proceeding Word, is both the
begotten Word, and the unbegotten Word the Father, as
Chriſt ſaith, my Father and I are one, and the proceeding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is one with the Father and the Sonne, ſo theſe three are
one in themſelves, and beare record in heaven, and they alſo
agree in one by inſpiration in the ſoules of the faithfull, or the
Church which makes three to beare record on earth, as the
water of Sanctification, and the blood of juſtification, and
our ſpirit enlightned with the Spirit of God; it beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes and ſervants of
God. For this cauſe the faithfull are called the Temple of the
living God, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. as God hath ſaid, I will dwell among
them and walke there, and I will bee their God, and they ſhall
bee my people.</hi> Alſo, know yee not that your body is the
temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which yee have

price, therefore glorifie God in body and in Spirit for they are
Gods.</p>
            <p>As the proceeding Word hath proceeded by inſpiration to
dwell in man, which is his internall miniſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
by externall miniſtration to divulge and write the
ſame proceeding Word by the inſtrumentall pen and voyce
of man for mans inſtruction, at firſt written by his Prophet
<hi>Moyſes,</hi> and after by the reſt of Prophets and Apoſtles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts

<hi>Thou haſt knowne the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able to
make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith which is in
Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For the whole Scripture is given by inſpiration
of God and is profitable to teach, to convince, to correct,
to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the proceeding Word doth proportion it ſelfe to
mans capacity, firſt it becomes the word of promiſe in the
ſeed of the woman, then the inſpirated word to dwell in
the mind, and alſo it is the miniſteriall Word, declared, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
taught, and preached for mans inſtruction, and all is one
Word: for this cauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, we have a moſt
ſure word of the Prophets, to which yee doe well, that yee
take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, untill
the day dawne, and the day ſtarre ariſe in your hearts, and
from hence it is evident, that the Scripture is the very word
of God, which proceedeth out of God by inſpiration, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
publiſhing, and writing the ſame, and the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Word being the ſame proceeding word of God, (even
God declared in writing.) The Scriptures therefore are the
Fountaines of living water, and the ground of truth, for
preaching, teaching, and inſtruction, exhortation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Scriptures are to be had in Divine eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
for they containe the divine Word it ſelfe, and the
Paſtors and teachers thereof (being thereunto called of God

ſo that faſt ye know this, that no prophecie of the Scripture is

that is come in the fleſh is the very true God (as Chriſt ſaid)
to know thee and him whom thou haſt ſent, Chriſt, to be the
very true God (as <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed) thou art that Chriſt, that
Sonne of God, and Chriſt told him that fleſh and blood did
not teach him this, but his Father revealed it unto him.</p>
            <p>This word of God not having beene after this order
knowne and conſidered, hath beene the cauſe and occaſion of

order and manner of working, leadeth us by the hand from
one gradation to another, and ſtoppeth the mouth of all men
that ſpeake againſt the Scriptures and the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>For conſidering the word of God in theſe gradations we
ſhall evidently perceive and underſtand, that the power and
authoritie giuen and committed to the Church is no other
thing, but the proceeding word of God, miniſtring the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Word from the Father manifeſted in the fleſh, which
miniſtration is twofold, internall by inſpiration through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Word, becauſe man is an intellectuall Spirit, and

therefore a proper Tabernacle for the divine Word to dwell
in; Alſo externall miniſtration, becauſe man dwells in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
earthly, and, naturall tabernacle, therefore the holy

Word, and the power thereof is daily communicated
unto man both to ingraft him into the Word, and to nouriſh
him in the Word unto everlaſting life; For this manner of

dwelleth in this body or earthly houſe.</p>
            <p>The inſtruments which the holy Ghoſt doth uſe in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation

ſome members of the Church ſet apart for the worke of the

I may call thoſe the externall gifts which God gives to his
Church, for it is ſaid that unto every one of us is given
grace or the gifts of the Spirit, according to the meaſure of
the gift in Chriſt. For wee may diſcerne the Church is a
compact body knit to the head Chriſt, and conſiſteth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
members, yet in unity of the ſpirit they are one body, and
although there be but one Spirit, yet are there diverſities of
gifts, diverſities of adminiſtrations, diverſities of operations,
yet all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and the ſame ſpirit, and theſe diverſities or gifts,
make diverſities of functions; So there are many functions
in the Church, but God worketh all in all. But the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withall, but
peculiar gifts without the which the Church cannot at any
time be, and therefore moſt proper, of which it is ſaid that
Chriſt aſcended on high, and lead captivity captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
gift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.
Here is to bee obſerved, that the divine power by internall
diſpenſation is given in common to all, and every member of
the Church, ſo that all have common intereſt in the word of
God, and peculiar power thereby to admoniſh, comfort and
inſtructions another, and pray for one another, and beare one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64520:23"/>
anothers burdens, eſpecially they are all Kings. Prieſts, and
Prophets in their Families. For every Father ought to uſeth
office of an Elder in his houſe, <hi>Deut 6. 6, 7. Deut.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>But for the externall diſpenſation of the Word, the power
and efficacy thereof is committed unto peculiar men, wherof
Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, &amp; teachers, are in the
firſt ranke and functions, and the power and efficacy which is
given them, is onely the miniſtration of the Word, they have
not that abſolute power which Chriſt hath, to know who are
his from the beginning, and to have compaſſion, on whom he
would have compaſſion, and to ſhew mercy, on whom hee
would ſhow mercy. For Chriſt had not this abſolute power
as he was the Son of man, but as he was the perſon of God;
For as he was Man, he came not to do his owne will but the
will of his Father; So likewiſe when he ſent his Apoſtles and
Diſciples to teach all Nations, he ſent them, as he was ſent of
his Father. So ſend I you, ſaith he, which was not to doe
their owne will, nor to teach their owne doctrine, but to do
his will as he did his Fathers will, and to teach his doctrine
which he taught them, as his Father taught him: ſo by the
Word they are to do and teach, but nothing beſide the Word,
or without the Word. More at large of this in the Treatiſe of
Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the word of life is God in the perſon of the
Father, the unbegotten Word, in the Sonne the begotten
Word, and the incarnate Word, In the perſon of the Spirit
it is the proceeding Word, and the miniſteriall Word, and
this miniſteriall Word is the power, and the authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Church; So the Miniſters cannot doe any thing
but by the power of the Word, and this Word is Chriſt who
abideth with them, and with the whole Church alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the world; So Chriſt is the chiefe, and they are
his ſervants and embaſſadours.</p>

            <p>The firſt beames of the glorious goſpell of Chriſt (which
<hi>Paul</hi> calls the Image of the living God) that ſhines unto

3. 7 (which none was able to behold and live, which made

farre more exceeding glorious, which we all are able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

wherein as in a glaſſe or Cryſtall wee ſee the glory
of God in the love of the Father, and are changed into the

Lord.</p>
            <p>And the thing that is miniſtred, is the glorious goſpell of
Chriſt, which is the doctrine of Chriſt, or the myſtery of the

Thus the Word deſcends unto man by inſpiration, and
dwels in man through the Spirit, for the Lord is that Spirit,
and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is the Word, for
the Word and the ſpirit cannot be divided nor ſeparated, they
are one. For this cauſe God uſeth the externall miniſtration
of his Word and Spirit, that he may inſpire and regenerate
the mind of man. After this manner are the miniſters and
meſſengers that are ſent of God indued with the Word
and Spirit of God. Therefore let no man ſay that hee hath
the Spirit, if hee want the light of the Word, neither can
any man have the Word but by the Spirit, and the Word and
Spirit are both made manifeſt in this, that they reveale the
hid things of God, even the myſterie of God in Chriſt.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. which in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. is called a full aſſurance of

office, and have but one and the ſame Commiſſion, which
was given by the immediate ordination of Chriſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
For as God the Father ſent his beloved Sonne to bee a
light unto the Gentiles, and the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
in declaring unto them the glad tydings of ſalvation in his
death unto the remiſſion of ſinnes. So Chriſt ſayd to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> John 20. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Authority committed.</note>The power and authority committed unto them by this
commiſſion is the breath of life, out of the mouth of Chriſt
proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, as it is ſaid;
<hi>Man lives not by bread onely, but by every word that proceedteh
out of the mouth of God;</hi> Therefore he breathed on them and
ſaid, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For the word which Chriſt
ſpake or breathed out of his mouth, hee affirmed to be ſpirit
and life, ſaying, <hi>John 6. The fleſh profiteth nothing, but the
word that I ſpeake is ſpirit and life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſubſtance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</note>The ſubſtance of this Commiſſion is mandatory,<hi> Matt. 28.

                  <note place="margin">Bleſſing them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The doctrinall part of it.</note>The doctrinall part of their commiſſion, is teaching them
to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you,
and<hi> Marke 26. 15. </hi>hath it in theſe words,<hi> Preach the Goſpell
to every creature. </hi>Now the ſumme of the doctrine, which
Chriſt taught, is ſet downe more plainly by St.<hi> Luke 24. 44.
Theſe are the words that I ſpake unto you, whilſt I was yet with
you, that all things muſt be fulfilled, which were written in the
law, and the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes concerning mee. And
he (</hi>who was ſpirit, life and light<hi>) opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that they might underſtand the Scriptures; and ſaid, Thus
it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and riſe from
the dead the third day; And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins
ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at
Ieruſalem. </hi>And after this manner doe the Paſtors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64520:28"/>
Thus Chriſt by preaching and teaching unto them the
word of God, out of his mouth, he opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the Scriptures, and thereby they received the holy
Ghoſt, for this is Chriſts manner of breathing upon them,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. when hee ſaid, <hi>receive yee the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But in <hi>Luke</hi>
he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you;</hi>
Which is to ſay, I will ſend a viſible token of the Spirit upon
you, or the efficacie of the Spirit upon you. Therefore he ſayd,
<hi>Tarry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Citie of Ieruſalem, untill you bee endued with
power from on high.</hi> Not but that they had received the holy
Ghoſt before, but not the manifeſtation and evident power
thereof, as afterwards it did fall upon them in the ſimilitude
of fiery cloven tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The ſmites and operative effects of miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is ſet forth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23. Whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye remit, they
are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye retaine,
they are retained. For this is the power and efficacie of the
miniſteriall Word (as hath beene formerly ſhowne) which
ſloweth from the abſolute power of Chriſt, which was given
unto him of the Father, as he affirmed to his Diſciples, <hi>Matt.</hi>
28. 18. <hi>All power is given me in heauen and in Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this miniſtration of the Goſpell is that key of <hi>David</hi>
committed unto Chriſt, by which he ſhould open and no man
ſhut, and ſhould ſhut, and no man ſhould open. And in the
16. of <hi>Matthew</hi> 16 17. &amp; 18. ver. it is evident, that this
power of the keyes, is onely the power of the Goſpell of
Chriſt, or rather as <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed the Lord Jeſus to bee that
Chriſt, that Sonne of the living God, which he received not
by the intelligence of fleſh and blood, but by Revelation
from God the Father, this power changeth the whole cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature of man, and gives him another denomination or
qualitie, making him a ſtrong and immoveable rock, turning
<hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Petra.</hi> Thus after this manner is the revelation and
power of the Word, given in generall to every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the knowledge of Chriſt, to beleeve that he is that
Chriſt, that Sonne of the living God, (God himſelfe) againſt
this rocke the gates of hell, the powers and principalities of

darkneſſe, and worldly Governours cannot prevaile. But the
particular and publicke miniſtration thereof, is committed
to the Paſtors and teachers of the Church of God, by whoſe
miniſtration and publicke diſpenſation of the Word, the hearts
and conſciences of men are opened and ſhut, bound and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
every day, as <hi>Lydia</hi> and others in the <hi>Acts,</hi> in which the
Word becomes the favour of life unto ſome, and the ſavour
of death unto others; And this miniſteriall power is alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

<hi>Gather unto me ſeventy men of the Elders of Iſrael, whom thou
knoweſt that they are Elders of the people, and Governours over
them: and bring them unto the Tabernacle, and let them ſtand

Then the Elders that governed over the people, as in the 24,
25. and 26, verſes. <hi>So Moyſes went out, and told the people the
words of the Lord; and gathered ſeventy men of the Elders of
the people, and ſet them round about the Tabernacle. There the
Lord came downe in a cloud, and ſpake unto him, and tooke of the
ſpirit that was upon</hi> Moyſes, <hi>and put upon the ſeventy antient

               <p>Here their ordination is of God, their indowment is of

the burden of the people with <hi>Moyſes,</hi> for the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured,

And though they received daily inſtruction, and publicke

yet the ſeed of truth fell ſometimes among ſtony ground, and

Church of God planted the Word in publicke. So theſe

               <p>Now I come to the ſecond part of government, which
conſiſteth alſo in theſe three functions. The firſt ſort is called
promiſcuouſly, Paſtors, Teachers, Biſhops, for they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

the unitie of faith, and knowledge of the Sonne of God unto
a perfect Man, and unto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe
of Chriſt. The ſecond ſort is Deacons. The third is called by a
generall name in common to them and the Paſtors, Teachers
and Biſhops, which is the name of Elders, for that in their
publicke execution of Diſcipline, they are joyntly united, ſo

that though the Paſtor have the leading voyce and preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,<note place="margin">Biſhop our ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perintendent.</note>
yet he is not to execute, nor pronounce ſentence in the
Church without the Elders, nor yet to ordaine either Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
Elders, or Paſtors, without their counſell, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
conſent of the Church, ſo that the Paſtors, Teachers
and Biſhops, are not to beare the burthen alone, it would bee
too heavy for them, as it was for <hi>Moyſes,</hi> if they bore the
like conſcience to God as <hi>Moyſes</hi> did; and if it were too
heavy a burden for one man in thoſe dayes, when the Church
was but one Nation, and but one Congregation, and had but
one Tabernacle; How muſt it not now needs be a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
weight, when the Church is many Nations, farre and
wide diſperſed, and many diſtinct Congregations.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Elders be joyned in one power
with the Paſtors and Biſhops, ſo that nothing ought to bee
done without them, the Paſtors have this preheminence, that
the worke both of Diſcipline, cenſure, and ordination of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Paſtors and Deacons, is attributed unto them as moſt
proper to their function; For this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Titus,</hi> in
