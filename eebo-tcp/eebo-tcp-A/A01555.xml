            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xperience bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch a ſoueraigntie ouer all thinges humane and diuine, that without it the quality or power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of worde, deede, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, or matter, cannot make it ſelfe knowen to the vnderſtanding of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the heauenly trueth iuſtifieth it ſelfe by the effects of his nature and power, made apparant to the eyes &amp; capacities of earthly creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> not well ſtaid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trueth of Gods word, tranſgreſſed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; feeling the plagues of his offence, had thereby experience of the power &amp; trueth of his Almightie Creator.</p>
            <p>The firſt worlde ouerflowing in wickedneſſe, was drowned in the flood of Gods vengeance: to geeue experience to the world that enſued, what it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne his worde and Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3095:3"/>
               <hi>Noah</hi> beleeued the word of the Lord, and obeying his commandement, prepared the Arke &amp; was ſaued in the flood, he &amp; all his family: by experience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the world is made to vnderſtand the power and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods trueth and fauour towarde his elect people.</p>
            <p>The Lord willed <hi>Moſes</hi> to denounce his plagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Egypt, and in the effect of his power &amp; trueth he accompliſhed the ſame vpon man and beaſt, vpon fruit and tree, vpon earth and water: the experience whereof made <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Iſraelites ſo hardie in fayth, that they tooke their way through the red Sea, as through the fieldes on drie land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharao</hi> in the hardneſſe of his heart purſued the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and was drowned, he and all his armie in the pathes where <hi>Iacob</hi> went drye ſhod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby all the kings and princes of the earth had &amp; haue experience, what it is to contemne God, to perſecute his people, &amp; to deſpiſe his worde and miniſters.</p>
            <p>The like experience made <hi>Ioſuah</hi> bolde to lead Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael through the deepe waters of Iorden: where they paſſed on foot, and went dry ſhod to land.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites breaking the couenant of the Lorde their God, &amp; ſtanding in their rebellion were deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the land of Iudah, and Ieruſalem, and made ſlaues to the Chaldeans: whereby they were taught by experience (and ſo are wee by the ſame example) what it is to deſpiſe the Lord of hoſtes, and to ſtand in diſobedience againſt his maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The Lord reſtoring <hi>Iacob</hi> out of Chaldea to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance againe, according as he had promiſed by the mouthes of his Prophets: doth teach vs by experience
<pb facs="tcp:3095:3"/>
how faithfull he is in his promiſes, that we therefore ſhould reſt vpon him without doubting.</p>
            <p>Chriſt our Sauiour wrought wonders before all Iſrael, that their eyes might ſee his diuine power and beleeue him for his works ſake: but they beleeued not their owne eyes, and are therefore confounded by the experience that teſtifieth againſt their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>By examples of experience, the Lord Ieſus taught the Iewes, as by that of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> of the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſeed, of the euill Steward &amp;c. As by familiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</p>
            <p>Our forefathers the olde Chriſtians, ſo polluted their Tabernacles with the workes of impietie, that they extinguiſhed the holy Ghoſt in the Sanctuarie, whereby they fell to ignorance and corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were giuen ouer to ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience whereof ſhould teache vs of theſe dayes, and our children to walke wiſely in the preſence of our God.</p>
            <p>Experience diſcouereth the effects of wiſdome and folly: and maketh demonſtration of the fruits of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and of vice, and teacheth to diſtinguiſhe, betwixt the righteous and the wicked, betwixt the foole and the wiſe man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Experience is the mother and nurſe of the policies and gouernements, ciuill and martiall, priuate &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, guiding the counſailes and doinges of men with orderly diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Experience of the inordinate iniquities of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the lawes and the iudgement ſeat.</p>
            <p>The experience of the troubleſome furies of men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3095:4"/>
founded Armes, and aduaunced Militarie profeſſion, for the repreſſing and reſtraining of the tyrannies and noyfull malice of the wicked.</p>
            <p>The experience of the profit and value of lawe and armes, maketh al prudent ſtates and commonwelths, to embrace and to vphold them both with much care and endeuour.</p>
            <p>So to conclude, experience is the ordinarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and naturall ornament of reaſon, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe in knowledge, &amp; prudent in the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vſe of things. He therefore that iudgeth or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth againſt experience, is not in deede a man, but a foole more ignorant then a beaſt.</p>
            <p>The experience of other mens harmes, warneth the wiſe to be ware.</p>
            <p>The experience of forren euils, warneth England to waken it ſelfe out of ſecuritie, and to be watchfull, and wiſely to take it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Experience hath taught me to loue and to honour armes, and in the zeale of a good heart to couet the aduancement of martial occupation, which made me (an vnlettered man) to take vnto me a notarie to ſette downe in writing this drift in the defence and praiſe of warlike proweſſe, againſt al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temners of the ſame: for the benefite and encouragement of my countrie &amp; countrimen.</p>
            <p>And finally, the experience of the high noblenes &amp; honour of you, my ſinguler good Lord, doth enbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me (in the loue of a faithful hart, to your renoumed vertues) moſt humbly to commend this litle work to your honorable protection, that vnder the ſhielde of your noble fauour and iudgement, it may ſtande in

Where this benefit wanteth, there wanteth Science and gouernement, without which, the whole worlde woulde ſoone become a deſolate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, ewithout man to manure or to inhabite it.

Nowe being enformed that the Towne was vnfurniſhed of men of warre, and none woulde receiue, and vnſtored of victualles and none would prouide, but reiected the commandement of the Prince in both theſe pointes, they come agayne, and ſhut vp the vnarmed city with ſuch forces, that the prince and ſtates were not able to make any reſonable attempte to ſuccor the diſtreſſed Towne by land: which made them to fal in deuiſe to drowne the countrie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paringé an <hi>Armada,</hi> of ſmall boates wel appoynted for<note place="margin">The Lord prouideth for the ze<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>landers contrary to expecta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> the purpoſe: whiche after dificult paſſage on the moſte part of their way, were ſtalled at <hi>Sonterwold</hi> xi. dayes in wanne hope for want of water to carie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through their appointed voyage.

conſider the ſtate and nature of all partes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars pertaining to the commodity and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the health and wealth of his people, priuate, and publike: and accordingly to prouide to eſtabliſhe and to continue the ſame.</p>
            <p>For as hee is the heade of his people, ſo muſt he bee their wiſdom, their light, and their example: and looke<note place="margin">The prince ſhould be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Theſe Militarie men being the moſt renowmed, the moſt ſacred, beneficiall, and profitable perſonages of the world: to the worlde, and to all that dwell, and haue dwelled vpon earth, and that by warlike induſtrie: It muſt be granted, that al their aſſiſtants, and adherents: by whoſe labours, perils, blood, and valiancie, the great effects of Armes haue bene wrought: muſt bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the fame, and honour of their Princes, as a matter iuſtly to be imparted to euery one, according to

            <p>The nature and due honour, of Militarie profeſſion being ſuch: what meaneth the vulgare multitude of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo maliciouſly to contemne ſoldierſhip, and ſo brauely to deſpiſe the profeſſion of Armes, as a vile, and damnable occupation? Surely, bicauſe they are of ſeruile and vnnoble heartes: fooliſh in diſcretion, idle bellies, careleſſe of the common welth of their countrie, litle friendly to mankinde in generall, and leſſe zealous toward the glory and preſeruation of their Soueraigne Prince and gouernement. Nowe be it they may ſeeme to voide this rebuke with a ſleight, in denying to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Militarie profeſſion: for they honor the, profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and doe accordingly eſteeme of all them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily purſued the ſame: But to deſpiſe the common ſort<note place="margin">Diſſolute ſoldiers ar worthely deſpiſed.</note> of our Countrie men that go to warre, of purpoſe more to ſpoyle, then to ſerue: and as vnder colour of purſuite of Armes, they put themſelues to the libertie and vſe of ſwearing, dronkenes, ſhameles fornication, dicing, and Theeuery, in ſlowe warres, &amp; vnder loaſe gouernment in the tumultuous ſtate of a forein nation, where they thinke it a fooliſhe ſcrupuloſitie, to vſe either tendernes of conſcience, or yet any honeſt maners: So doe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into their Countrie, ſo much corrupted with all maner of euils, that they ſeeme rather to come from hel, then from the exerciſe of warlike armes, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of militarie diſcipline: &amp; therefore ſo venemous a broode to their natiue countrey (ſtanding in ciuill peace and gouernement) that they are rather to bee vometed out of the bulke of the common wealth, then to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the ſame. To contemne ſuch (ſay they) yea, to abhor them as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame of martial armes, &amp; to cut them of, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt infectiue neſt of domeſtical ſociety, is both honeſt &amp; neceſſary by al ciuil, &amp; diuine policy, &amp; diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3095:23"/>
And as for thoſe that are worthely called martialiſtes, bearing the true forme and ſubſtance of military men, they (ſay our people) are highely to bee eſtemed and maineteyned as the honorable and neceſſary membres of the ſtate publique.</p>
            <p>If the contemners of martiall Armes did kéepe themſelues within the compaſſe of theſe reaſones and diſcretion, they coulde not bee iuſtely reproued: for the wicked in his wickednes is not to bee defended, bicauſe he profeſſeth chiualry, or bicauſe he is a diuine. Let the euil therefore beare the blame and ſhame of his<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Armes is honorable though ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours ſtand right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnrepro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued.</note> owne treſpaſſe, and let the profeſſion that is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in it ſelf nature, goe vnuiolat, though al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the ſame ſhoulde ſtande rightly reproued. If all the Preachers of the word of trueth and ſaluation were corrupt bellies: yet ſtandeth the heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine true and perfit in his own qualitie. Militarie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation doth execute the high Juſtice of God vpon earth, though all the followers of the ſame were moſt horrible &amp; wicked (as the greater number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is) yet muſt the occupation by it ſelfe propertie ſtand honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world, as the two edged ſworde of the Lord God of hoſts, to whom al Scepters &amp; ſwordes doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, and by his power and direction are vſed to effect.</p>
            <p>Now let vs examine the matter to trie whether theſe contemners doe directly deſpiſe the verie ſelfe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Armes, or noe. If they doe not, then doe they fauor it: and grantinge it to bee commendable and neceſſarie, they deſire to practiſe the vſe thereof in their domeſticall paſtymes and exerciſes: they couet the company of ſuch as can inſtruct them in the ſame: they are prouided of habilements for the purpoſe, they loue honeſt Souldiers, &amp; are frendely to them: they put themſelues forth to the publike ſhew &amp; practiſe before the preſence of the royal maieſty and the nobilitie: they ſtriue in emulation to excel in the redines &amp; knowledg
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3095:23"/>
of Military order, and in the vſe of their weapons: they deſire to ſerue againſt the inteſtine diſturbers of the State publike, and couet to fight againſt the inuaders of their countrie: and are liberall in contributing to the charges of warres. But when the prince comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Muſters through the realme in citie, towne, and country, and to appointe ſelecte people to be numbred and deuided into bands, for to be practiſed and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the vſe and order of Armes, that thereby the realme may bee the better furniſhed of Militarie men for the fielde, and thereby ſtand in the more aſſurance if neede of warre ſhall happen: for the hoſte of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull multitude in Armes, is before an Armie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented warriours, as a flocke of ſheepe before a troupe of wolues: which conſideration ſhould moue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heartes feruently to deſire to be of profitable value for this occupation: wherein conſiſteth the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoueraigne maieſtie, and of the ſtate publike: and conſequently of euery particular ſtate and perſon comprehended in the ſame.</p>

            <p>Theſe were the good children of God: moſt valiant, and moſt famous in warlike proweſſe: For by vertue and armes, they became inuincible in the field, and moſt profitable in the citie.

Such ſlouth, and ſecuritie hath brought many a famous citie of the worlde to ruine, deſolation, and ſeruitude. <hi>London</hi>

might often times (in her life dayes) haue bene brought to the ſame predicament, had not their kings bene at hand, to ſtoppe and to vanquiſhe the inſolencie of ragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maiors of London are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> rebbels, by the force of Armes.

            <p>If they then, and their anceſters, citizens of <hi>London,</hi> are beholding to Military proweſſe, for the chiefe honour &amp; ancient (yea, and newe) preſeruation of their citie: why do they not honour the profeſſion, &amp; deſire libertie of their prince, to practiſe armes, and to nouriſhe Militarie prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe amongſt themſelues?

            </p>
            <p>It were a ſmall matter for the citie of <hi>London</hi> to haue fiue thouſand citizens of ſpecial manry, trained in arms, booked, and deuided into bands, and ready at a moment, if néed were: in which number, ſhould no ſeruant nor fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue perſon bee admitted, but the very houſholders, and their ſonnes: neither were it much for them to haue fiue hundreth furniſhed &amp; exerciſed horſes for the field. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fugger,</hi> the great money maſter of all Chriſtendome,<note place="margin">Anthony Fugger,</note> kept alwayes fiftie horſes of ſeruice in his owne ſtables in <hi>Auguſta,</hi> and ſo many warlike choſen Reiſters of his owne family.

            <p>And to ſpeak in general, pity it is to ſee ſo worthy a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ours is (ſo valiant &amp; actiue in arms, when they be entred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſe therof) to be ſo poorely inclined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low wars, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the purſuit of chiualry: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therfore of our idle people cannot be to extreeme: ſo that there were a ſufficient order ſet down for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them But to ſay truely, let the ſoueraigne maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty &amp; the court of parliament, prouide &amp; eſtabliſh neuer ſo eaſie, &amp; neuer ſo profitable &amp; ſéemly means for the ſuccour of the poore, &amp; for imploiment of the able people, this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wil not obſerue it: ſuch ſlouth &amp; corruption is in the Juſtices of the country, &amp; in the magiſtrates of townes &amp; cities, &amp; eke ſuch peruers obſtinacie in the merciles harts of rich folke, both of towne and country, that euery mans endeuor wholly tendeth to his owne priuate profit, that of al hands they neglect, yea, &amp; contemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publike welth &amp; honour of their country: much leſſe do they regard the preſeruation of the poore: ſo dul &amp; ſenſeles is the common ſort of this nation: neither will it bee remedied for any thing that can be deuiſed or commanded, til God himſelf do remedy it with a ſcourge of his owne making. Fiue perſons ſtanding at the barre condemned to dye vpon the ſtatute of Rogues, &amp; vpon no other matter, proclamation was made in the ful appearance of the country, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would come forth and take any one of the condemned, and reteine him in ſeruice, &amp; anſwere for his behauiour, he ſhould deliuer a man from death, in all the throngs of the people there was not one moued with compaſſion ſo to doe, then were all theſe miſerable wretches executed: ſurely a hard condition amongſt the people that profeſſe Chriſt: whoſe commandement it is, that as we are his, ſo muſt we loue one another as he loued vs.</p>
            <p>Chriſt committed his body to the ſhamefull Croſſe, &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3095:29"/>
his ſoule to the tormentes of hell, for the redemption of trayterous Rebbels againſt the high Maieſtie of God, and to reconcile the wicked to grace: and willeth vs to be mercifull, as our Heauenly Father is mercifull. But how farre we are from theſe qualities, the Lord he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it, and ſo doe the poore. God ſurely will iudge it with a heauie ſentence.</p>
            <p>But ſurely, this is a true concluſion, that the man, the people, or nation that fauour not the renowme and maintenance of Military proweſſe, nor imbraſe the high value of Armes, the ſame are enemies to all vertues, neyther haue they reſpect to godlineſſe: but all to their owne bellies, as the ſwine. If the nouriſhment and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Armes ſhould depende on the voluntarie charges and endeuours of the common multitude, Martiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhould lye in the ſtreete, vntill it were trodden to dunge.</p>
            <p>In deede it is not a matter that doth properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to baſe &amp; ſeruile mindes, but doth belong to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ambitious courages. Let them therfore that are truely noble, loue Armes, and let them that chalenge, or loue the name of honour, vertue, honeſtie, or worthines, put their hands to the vſe and aduancement of warlike knowledge and actiuitie: yea, the more noble, the more prudent, and honorable that men will bee eſteemed, ſo much the more friendly to Armes ought they to be, and the like delightfull in the practiſe and vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And as they eſteeme of it, ſo to eſteeme of them that do applye the occupation thereof in the feelde, where they ſuſtein no wanton labour, but are in continual trauail of the body, aud eke of the minde, dayly preſented to the daungers of death: whoſe hourely appearaunce to the Martialiſt in Armes, ſhoulde make him to conſider the frailtie of his ſtate, and the fewneſſe of his dayes, and therefore to apply his heart to wiſdome, and vertue, and to be alwayes, as a man prepared, and ready to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3095:29"/>
yet when the ſecure bellie doth reſt vpon an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope of long life: and hating the remembrance of death, hideth himſelfe from the ſight of wiſdome, and geueth ouer his heart to luſt and couetouſneſſe, the mother and nourſe of all euils.</p>
            <p>If any tongues more malicious, then diſcreet, will diſable our martialiſts, and defame our ſouldiours, and then make a falſe concluſion, againſt the profeſſion it ſelfe: let thoſe malignant ſpirites confeſſe the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by training vp, the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in martiall feates and knowledg</note> value of our nation in the olde time, and grant (in ſpight of their beards) that we are the ſonnes of thoſe our Fathers, whoſe ſtrength and courage in martiall actiuitie, neither <hi>Scots, French,</hi> nor <hi>Spanyards,</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt: nor yet ſafely to ſtand within the compaſſe and induſtrie of the Captaines: and that this preſent generation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> people, being trained and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed vnder the like conduct, nouriſhment, &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as our kindred were vnder the moſte famous kings, <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, <hi>Edward</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> the blacke Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> &amp;c. wold ſhew it ſelf to be the rightfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten children of the olde <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fathers, moſt valiant and famous in Militarie feates and knowledge: yea, looke how much more ſubtile and perilous the warres at theſe dayes are, then they were in the olde time: by ſo much the more ſhoulde we exceede our anceſters in the affaires of the ſame, if wee were accordingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and mainteined.</p>

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:3095:30"/>It is to be noted, that the campe of the States of the lowe Countrie, lay entrenched in a great heath or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ground, on the right hand of whoſe campe towards <hi>Loueine</hi> there was a ryuer ranne all along, and without the trenches on the ſame ſide, was the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe</hi> and <hi>Scottiſhe</hi> mens warde, wherein was a hill that the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> layd hard at to haue gotten, which if they coulde haue wonne, from the ſame they might haue diſcryed all their maner of dealing in the States Campe.

The footmen alſo of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> being entred into the plaine, the chiefe Coranels of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſhe</hi> regiments, taking to them thoſe looſe ſhotte which were before appointed, encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred the <hi>Spanyards</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plain, and delt ſo hotly and frankly with them at Pel Mel, that within thrée quarters of an houre they made them forſake the plaine, and retire ouer, into the fields, there nere adioyning: at the entrie whereof was many a man ſlaine, to the great diſcouragement of the whole Armie of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>Spanyardes.</hi> Thus through the goodneſſe of God (in whoſe quarrell they fought) for the aduancement of his name and true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by the proweſſe of thoſe valiant <hi>Engliſh</hi> men that there ſerued vnder the States (whoſe noble harts ſheweth forth a liuely patterne of the proweſſe of their progenitors) with the aide onely of a few <hi>Scottiſh</hi> men that ſerued there alſo: ſo terrified the harts of the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi> that amongſt all the encounters that I haue ſene in al the time that I haue ſerued, for theſe xxij. yeares, I neuer ſawe enemies ſo danted with any loſſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe as the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were that day, in flying the fury of the people, they being of ſo great ſtrength, and our folke but a fewe looſe ſhot. Then iſſued forth the <hi>Graue van Buſſu,</hi> generall of the States armie, and ſtood vpon a litle hill, facing the horſemen of of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and vew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the maner of the ſkirmiſh. After that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were thus driuen to forſake the plaine, and to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cloſes neere adioyning, ſeeing the inuincible courage of our men, durſt not any more come forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the plaine, but now and then ſalyed out, and ſtraight wayes retired in againe. About foure or fiue a clocke in the after noone, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ſouldiers were ſo ſtirred vp, that they determined no longer to ſtande dallying with the <hi>Spanyardes,</hi> but purpoſed to forſake the plaine champion, and to follow the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> into<note place="margin">The Span<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yards put to flight.</note> the fieldes, and there to haue them by the eares. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> ſeeing his footmen were put to the worſe, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a further miſchief, was driuen of neceſſity to make a profer with his horſemen, but did not breake, which cauſed our men to ſtay their going ouer into the fields, ſo that in this meane while, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> footmen (before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Scottiſh</hi> men were a ware) were a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile off, retiring in running maner ouer hedge and ditch with their enſigns, and ſo ended the ſkirmiſh. The Coranels and captaines both of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> did lead the ſeruice themſelues that day, with ſuch great boldneſſe, that it greatly imbaſed the glory and force of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and had vtterly ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, if the horſemen had done their endeuor halfe ſo well as did the footmen.</p>

themſelues and their ſeruice in the defence of the quiet ſtate and proſperitie of their prince and countrey: for theſe dayes are dangerous, and more dangerous will yet be.</p>

            <p>Let <hi>England</hi> therefore while it hath bleſſed reſt and leaſure, wiſe regiment, and God preſent in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, waken it ſelfe out of ſenſeleſſe ſecuritie, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently looke to her Tacles: for a ſtorme will come, and a tempeſt will fall: for at this preſent houre, the hand of the Lord God of hoſtes is in the ſeconde time for ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the remnant of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the yeere of his redeemed is come, and euery kingdome that wil not ſerue the Lord, ſhal vtterly periſh from the earth: ſtand faſt therefore, O ye people of <hi>England,</hi> for the ſworde of the Almightie is drawne, and will not be put vp till hee hath confounded, and vtterly conſumed all the enemies of <hi>Iacob</hi> from the face of the earth for euermore.

and be wiſe hearted, leſt through lewde ingratitude you moue the Lord God of hoſtes to wrath, &amp; through your rebellious inſolencie, you prouoke the moſt high to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Sanctuary in <hi>England:</hi> as they of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> through their wickednes draue him to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his holy mounte <hi>Sion</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> But if the Lord depart from you, woe ſhalbe vnto you, as it was to them of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>

            <p>Looke wiſely to your ſelues, and as ye loue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of Gods kingdome in <hi>England,</hi> ſo will you pray and labour for the preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſame amongſt the <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Dutch:</hi> as that the Lord may ſet his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie at reſt amongſt them as he hath done it amongſt vs, and that they may haue the grace ſo to receiue, and ſo to reteine the Lord their God, as he may haue delight to continue with them.</p>
