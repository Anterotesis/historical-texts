            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Theſe are therefore by the Advice of my Brethren the Aldermen and the Commons of this City in Common Council aſſembled; in His Majeſties Name ſtreightly to charge and command all Perſons within this City and the Liberties thereof, as they will anſwer the contrary at their utmoſt Perils, to behave themſelves at all times in a civil and orderly manner, with due Reſpect and Regard to all Perſons of Quality, Ladies and Gentlemen, that ſhall think fit to repair at any time to this City upon their Occaſions.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Miſdemeanors and Rudeneſs of Car-men, Dray-men and other Perſons hereafter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned committed in the Streets are too notorious: Theſe are therefore ſtreightly to command, That from henceforth no Car-man, Dray-man or other perſon with a Car or Cart or the like, do preſume to run againſt or obſtruct any Gentlemans Coach in their Paſſage in any the Streets of this City, but give them full ſpace and freedom of Paſſage without the leaſt Diſturbance, Affront or Injury to be offered to them, their Servants, Horſes or Coaches.</p>
            <p>And alſo that Tankard-Bearers, Porters, and other Perſons laden with Burdens or of inferior Quality do forbear to run againſt, juſtle or offer the leaſt uncivil Action to Perſons of better Quality, and that they do conſtantly give them place in their paſſage on foot through the Streets.</p>
            <p>And all Vagrants, Beggers and other idle and lewd Perſons are hereby enjoyned not to preſume to place themſelves in, or wander about any the Streets and publick Paſſages of this City. And all Conſtables and other Officers are hereby charged and required to intercept and apprehend all ſuch Perſons, and deal with them according to the Law in that behalf.</p>
            <p>And whereas throwing of Squibs, Fire-Works, Foot-ball Play and the like, are at certain Seaſons fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſed by Apprentices and others in the Streets, which is a great Grievance and Annoyance to the publick Paſſages of this City, Whereby much Miſchief is often done, and is an occaſion of great Fear to Paſſengers. Theſe are therefore further to command all Apprentices and other young Perſons to forbear from time to time all ſuch rude Practices.</p>
            <p>And that all Maſters of Families do look to and ſecure their Sons, Apprentices and Servants in the well ordering of themſelves and giving due Obedience hereunto.</p>
            <p>And all Perſons are to take notice, that the Obſervation hereof is ſtrictly required. And all Offenders in any the particulars before-mentioned ſhall ſuffer the utmoſt Penalties can be inflicted upon them.</p>
