         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But as I undertook it with much diffidence of my own ability to perform it well; so I thought fit before I published it, to pray Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to view, correct and order it according to his own minde and pleasure. Wherefore, though you find some places enlarged, others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and two Chapters (the 18th and 20th) almost wholly changed, you may nevertheless remain assured, that as now I present it to you,
<pb facs="tcp:59147:3"/>
it doth not at all vary from the Authours own sense and meaning. As for the six Lessons to the <hi>Savilian</hi> Professors at <hi>Oxford,</hi> they are not of my translation, but were written, as here you have them in English, by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> himself; and are joyned to this Book, because they are chiefly in defence of the same.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:59147:4"/>
and withall a most perfect pattern of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique by which they were enabled to finde out and demonstrate such excellent Theoremes as they have done. I know also that the Hypothesis of the Earths Diurnal Motion was the invention of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; but that both it, and Astronomy (that is, Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Physiques) springing up together with it, were by succeeding Philosophers strangled with the snares of Words. And therefore the beginning of Astronomy (except Observations) I think is not to be derived from farther time then from <hi>Nicolaus Copernicus;</hi> who in the Age next preceding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, revived the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras, Aristar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus &amp; Philolaus.</hi> After him, the Doctrine of the Motion of the Earth being now received, &amp; a difficult Question thereupon arising concerning the Descent of Heavy Bodies, <hi>Galilaeus</hi> in our time striving with that difficulty, was the first that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Natural Philosophy Universal, which is the knowledge of the Nature of <hi>Motion.</hi> So that neither can the Age of Natural Philosophy be reckoned higher then to him. Lastly, the Science of <hi>Mans Body,</hi> the most profitable part of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:59147:4"/>
Science, was first discovered with admirable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity by our Countryman Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> principal Physician to King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> in his Books of the <hi>Motion of the Blood</hi> and of the <hi>Generation of Living Creatures;</hi> who is the onely man I know, that conquering envy, hath established a new Doctrine in his life time. Before these, there was nothing certain in Natural Philosophy but every mans Experiments to himself, and the Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, if they may be called certain, that are no certainer then Civil Histories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But since these, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy &amp; Natural Philosophy in general have for so little time been extraordinarily advanced by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Keplerus, Petrus Gassendus, &amp; Marinus Mersennus;</hi> &amp; the Science of Humane Bodies in special by the wit &amp; industry of Physicians (the onely true Natural Philosophers) especially of our most Learned Men of the Colledge of Physicians in <hi>London.</hi> Natural Philosophy is therefore but young; but Civil Philosophy yet much younger, as being no older (I say it provoked, &amp; that my Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors may know how little they have wrought upon me) then my own Book <hi>de Cive.</hi> But what? Were there no Philosophers Natural nor Civil among the
<pb facs="tcp:59147:5"/>
ancient <hi>Greeks?</hi> There were men so called; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>Lucian,</hi> by whom they are derided; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness divers Cities, from which they have been often by publique Edicts banished. But it follows not that there was Philosophy. There walked in old <hi>Greece</hi> a certain Phantasme, for superficial gravity (though full within of fraud &amp; filth) a little like Philosophy; which unwary men thinking to be it, adhered to the Professors of it, some to one, some to another (though they disagreed among themselves) and with great Salary put their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to them to be taught, in stead of Wisdome, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to dispute; &amp; neglecting the Laws, to determine every Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to their own fancies. The first Doctors of the Church next the Apostles, born in those times, whilest they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to defend the Christian Faith against the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by Natural Reason, began also to make use of Philosophy, &amp; with the Decrees of Holy Scripture to mingle the Sentences of Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers; &amp; first some harmless ones of <hi>Plato;</hi> but afterwards also many foolish &amp; false ones out of the Physicks &amp; Metaphysicks of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Enemies betrayed unto them the Cittadel of Christianity From that time, in stead of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, there entred a thing called <hi>School-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59147:5"/>
walking on one foot firmly, which is the Holy Scripture, but halted on the other rotten foot, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Vain,</hi> &amp; might have called <hi>Pernicious Philosophy;</hi> for it hath raised an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Controversies in the Christian World concerning Religion, &amp; from those Controversies Wars. It is like that <hi>Empusa</hi> in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Poet, which was taken in <hi>Athens</hi> for a Ghost that changed shapes, having one brazenleg, but the other was the leg of an Ass, &amp; was sent (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) by <hi>Hecate,</hi> as a signe of some approaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil fortune. Against this <hi>Empusa</hi> I think there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be invented a better Exorcisme, then to disting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish between the Rules of Religion, that is, the Rules of Honoring God, which we have from the Laws, and the Rules of Philosophy, that is, the Opinions of private men; &amp; to yeild what is due to Religion to the Holy Scripture, and what is due to Philosophy to Natural Reason.

<pb facs="tcp:59147:6"/>
by putting into a clear Method the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Natural Philosophy, to fright and drive away this Metaphysical <hi>Empusa;</hi> not by skirmish, but by letting in the light upon her. For I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (if any confidence of a Writing can proceed from the Writers fear, circumspection &amp; diffidence) that in the three former parts of this Book, all that I have said is sufficiently demonstrated from Definitions; &amp; all in the fourth part, from Suppositions not absurd. But if there appear to your <hi>Lordship</hi> any thing less fully demonstrated then to satisfie every Reader, the cause was this, that I professed to write not all to all, but some things to Geometricians onely. But that your <hi>Lordship</hi> will be satisfied J cannot doubt.</p>
            <p>There remains the second Section, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Man.</hi> That part thereof where J handle the <hi>Optiques,</hi> contayning six Chapters, together with the Tables of the Figures belonging to them, I have already written &amp; engravenlying by me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove these six years. The rest shall, as soon as J can, be added to it; though by the contumelies &amp; petty injuries of some unskilful men, I know already by experience how much greater thanks will be due, then payed me, for telling Men the truth of what
<pb facs="tcp:59147:6"/>
Men are. But the burthen I have taken on me I mean to carry through; not striving to appease, but rather to revenge my self of Envy, by encreasing it. For it contents me that <hi>I</hi> have your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> favour; which, (being all you require) J acknowledge; and for which, with my prayers to Almighty God for your <hi>Lordships</hi> safety, J shall (to my power) be always thankefull.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hink not (courteous Reader) that the Philosophy the Elements whereof I am going to set in order, is that which makes Philosophers Stones, nor that which is found in the Metaphsique Codes. But that it is the Natural Reason of Man busily flying up and down among the Creatures, &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back a true report of their Order, Causes &amp; Effects. Philosophy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Childe of the World and your own Mind, is within your self; perhaps not fashioned yet, but like the World its Father, as it was in the beginning, a thing confused. Do therefore as the Statuaries do, who by hewing off that which is superfluous, do not make but find the Image. Or imitate the Creation. If you will be a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher in good earnest, let your Reason move upon the Deep of your own Cogitations and Experience. Those things that lie in Confusion must be set asunder, distinguished, and every one stampt with its own name set in order; that is to say, your Method must resemble that of the Creation. The order of the Creation was, <hi>Light, Distinction of Day and Night,</hi> the <hi>Firmament,</hi> the <hi>Luminaries, Sensible Creatures, Man;</hi> and after the Creation, the <hi>Commandement.</hi> Therefore the order of Contemplation will be, <hi>Reason, Definition, Space, the Starres, Sensible Quality, Man;</hi> and after Man is grown up, <hi>Subjection to Command.</hi> In the first part of this Section which is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Logique, I set up the light of Reason. In the Second (which hath for title the Grounds of Philosophy) I distinguish the most common Notions by accurate definition, for the avoiding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and obscurity. The third part concerns the Expansion of Space, that is, Geometry. The fourth contains the Motion of the Starres, together with the doctrine of Sensible Qualities.</p>

This is the Method I followed; and if it like you you may use the same; for I do but propound, not commend to you any thing of mine. But whatsoever shall be the Method you will like, I would very fain commend Philosophy to you, that is to say, the study of Wisdome, for want of which we have all suffered much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage lately. For even they that study Wealth, do it out of love to Wisdome; for their Treasures serve them but for a Looking-glass, wherin to behold and contemplate their owne Wisdome. Nor do they that love to be employed in publike business, aime at any thing but place wherein to shew their Wisdome. Neither do Voluptuous men neglect Philosophy, but onely because they know not how great a pleasure it is to the Mind of Man to be ravished in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and perpetual embraces of the most beauteous World. Lastly, though for nothing else, yet (because the Mind of Man is no less impatient of Empty Time, then Nature is of Empty Place) to the end you be not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forced for want of what to do, to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to men that have business, or take hurt by falling into idle Company, but have somewhat of your own wherewith to fill up your time, I recommend unto you the Study of Philosophy. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILOSOPHY seems to me to be amongst men now, in the same manner as Corn and Wine are said to have been in the world in ancient time. For from the beginning there were Vines and Ears of Corn growing here and there in the fields; but no care was taken for the planting and sowing of them. Men lived therefore upon Akorns; or if any were so bold as to venture upon the eating of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and doubtfull fruits, they did it with danger of their health. In like manner, every man brought Philosophy, that is, Naturall Reason, into the world with him; for all men can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to some degree, and concerning some things: but where there is need of a long series of Reasons, there most men wander out of the way, and fall into Error for want of Method, as it were for want of sowing and planting, that is, of improving their Reason. And from hence it comes to passe, that they who content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with daily experience, which may be likened to feeding upon Akorns, and either reject, or not much regard Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59147:9"/>
are commonly esteemed, and are indeed, men of sounder judgement, then those, who from opinions, though not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, yet full of uncertainty, and carelesly received, do nothing but dispute and wrangle, like men that are not well in their wits. I confesse indeed, that that part of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy by which Magnitudes and Figures are computed, is highly improved. But because I have not observed the like advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the other parts of it, my purpose is, as far forth as I am able, to lay open the few and first Elements of Philosophy in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as so many Seeds, from which pure and true Philosophy may hereafter spring up by little and little.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant how hard a thing it is to weed out of mens mindes such inveterate opinions as have taken root there, and been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in them by the authority of most eloquent Writers; especially, seeing true (that is accurate) Philosophy, professedly rejects not only the paint and false colours of Language, but even the very ornaments and graces of the same; and the first Grounds of all Science, are not only not beautifull, but poore, aride, and in appearance deformed. Neverthelesse, there being certainly some men, though but few, who are delighted with Truth and strength of Reason in all things, I thought I might do well to take this pains for the sake even of those few. I proceed therefore to the matter, and take my beginning from the very Definition of Philosophy, which is this.</p>
               <p n="2">2 PHILOSOPHY <hi>is such knowledge of Effects or Appearances, as we acquire by true Ratiocination from the knowledge we have first of their Causes or Generation: And again, of such Causes or Generations as may be from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first their Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better understanding of which Definition, we must consider; first, that although Sense and Memory of things, which are common to Man and all living Creatures, be Knowledge, yet because they are given us immediately by Nature, and not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Ratiocination, they are not Philosophy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Seeing Experience is nothing but Memory; and Prudence, or Prospect into the future time, nothing but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of such things as we have already had experience of, Prudence also is not to be esteemed Philosophy.</p>
               <p>By RATIOCINATION, I mean <hi>Computation.</hi> Now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59147:9"/>
is either to collect the sum of many things that are added together, or to know what remains when one thing is taken out of another. <hi>Ratiocination</hi> therefore is the same with <hi>Addition</hi> and <hi>Substraction;</hi> and if any man adde <hi>Multiplication</hi> and <hi>Division,</hi> I will not be against it, seeing Multiplication is nothing but Addition of equals one to another, and Division nothing but a Substraction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals one from another, as often as is possible. So that all Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination is comprehended in these two operations of the minde, Addition and Substraction.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But how by the <hi>Ratiocination</hi> of our Minde, we Adde and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract in our silent thoughts, without the use of words, it will be necessary for me to make intelligible by an example or two. If therefore a man see something a far off and obscurely, although no appellation had yet been given to any thing, he will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing have the same Idea of that thing, for which now by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a name on it, we call it <hi>Body.</hi> Again, when by comming neerer, he sees the same thing thus and thus, now in one place and now in another, he will have a new Idea thereof, namely that, for which we now call such a thing <hi>Animated.</hi> Thirdly, when standing neerer he perceives the figure, hears the voice, and sees other things, which are signes of a Rationall minde, he has a third Idea, though it have yet no appellation, namely, that for which we now call any thing <hi>Rationall.</hi> Lastly, when by looking fully and distinctly upon it he conceaves all that he has seen as one thing, the Idea he has now, is compounded of his former Ideas, which are put together in the Minde, in the same order, in which these three single names <hi>Body, Animated, Rationall,</hi> are in speech compounded into this one name <hi>Body-Animated-Rationall,</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> In like manner, of the severall conceptions of <hi>four sides, equality of sides, and right angles,</hi> is compounded the conception of a <hi>Square.</hi> For the mind may conceive a figure of foure sides without any conception of their equality; &amp; of that equality without conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right angle; and may joyne together all these single con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions into one conception or one Idea of a Square. And thus we see how the Conceptions of the mind are compounded. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whosoever sees a man standing neer him, conceives the whole Idea of that man; and if as he goes away he follow him with his eyes onely, he will lose the Idea of those things which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59147:10"/>
were signes of his being Rationall, whilest neverthelesse the Idea of a Body-Animated remaines still before his eies; so that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of Rationall is substracted from the whole Idea of Man, that is to say of Body-Animated-Rationall, and there remaines that of Body-Animated; &amp; a while after at a greater distance the Idea of Animated will be lost, &amp; that of Body only will remain; so that at last, when nothing at all can be seen, the whole Idea will vanish out of sight. By which examples, I thinke it is manifest enough, what is the internall Ratiocination of the Mind, without words.</p>
               <p>We must not therefore thinke that Computation, that is, Ratiocination, has place onely in numbers; as if man were distinguished from other living Creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) by nothing but the faculty of numbring; for <hi>Magnitude, Body, Motion, Time, Degrees of Quality, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conception, Proportion, Speech and Names</hi> (in which all the kinds of Philosophy consist) are capable of Addition and Substraction. Now such things as we adde or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to <hi>consider,</hi> in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; in which language also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies to <hi>Compute, Reason</hi> or <hi>Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 But <hi>Effects</hi> and the <hi>Appearances</hi> of things to sense, are faculties or Powers of Bodies, which make us distinguish them from one another; that is to say, conceive one Body to be equall or unequall, like or unlike to another Body; as in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple above, when by coming neer enough to any Body, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Motion and Going of the same, we distinguish it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from a Tree, a Column and other fixed Bodies; and so that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or going is the <hi>Property</hi> thereof, as being proper to living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a faculty by which they make us distinguish them from other Bodies.</p>
               <p n="5">5 How the knowledge of any Effect may be gotten from the knowledge of the Generation thereof, may easily be understood by the example of a Circle: For if there be set before us a plain fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure having as neer as may be the figure of a Circle, we cannot possibly perceive by sense whether it be a true Circle or no; then which neverthelesse nothing is more easie to be known, to him that knowes first the Generation of the propounded figure. For let it be known that the figure was made by the circumduction of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59147:10"/>
a Body whereof one end remained unmoved, and we may reason thus; a Body carried about, retaining alwayes the same length, applies it selfe first to one <hi>Radius,</hi> then to another, to a third, a fourth, and successively to all; and therefore the same length, from the same point, toucheth the circumference in every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which is as much to say as all the <hi>Radii</hi> are equal. We know therefore that from such generation proceeds a figure, from whose one middle point all the extreame points are reached unto by equal <hi>Radii.</hi> And in like manner, by knowing first what figure is set before us, we may come by Ratiocination to some Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same, though perhaps not that by which it was made, yet that by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it might have been made; for he that knows that a Circle has the property above declared, will easily know whether a Body carried about, as is said, will generate a Circle or no.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Scope</hi> of Philosophy, is, that we may make use to our benefit of effects formerly seen; or that by applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bodies to one another; we may produce the like effects of those we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our minde, as far forth as matter, strength &amp; industry will permit, for the commodity of humane life. For he inward glory and triumph of mind that a man may have, for the mastering of some difficult and doutfull matter, or for the discovery of some hidden truth, is not worth so much paines as the study of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy requires; nor need any man care much to teach another what he knowes himselfe, if he think that will be the onely benefit of his labour. The end of Knowledge is Power; and the use of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes (which among Geometricians serve for the finding out of Properties) is for the construction of Problemes; and lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing of some action, or thing to be done.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But what the <hi>Utility</hi> of Philosophy is, especially of Natural Philosophy and Geometry, will be best understood by reckoning up the chief commodities of which mankind is capable; and by comparing the manner of life of such as enjoy them, with that of others which want the same. Now the greatest commodities of mankind are the Arts, namely of measuring Matter and Motion; of moving ponderous Bodies; of Architecture; of Navigation; of making instruments for all uses; of calculating the Coelestiall Motions, the Aspects of the Stars, and the parts of Time; of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59147:11"/>
&amp;c. By which Sciences, how great benefits men receive, is more easily understood then expressed. These benefits are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by almost all the people of Europe, by most of those of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, and by some of Africa; but the Americans, and they that live neer the Poles do totally want them. But why? Have they sharper wits then these? Have not all men one kinde of soule, and the same faculties of mind? What then makes this difference, except Philosophy? Philosophy therefore is the cause of all these benefits. But the Utility of Morall and Civil Philosophy is to be estimated not so much by the commodities we have by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Sciences, as by the calamities we receive from not knowing them. Now all such calamities as may be avoided by humane industry arise from warre, but chiefly from Civil warre; for from this proceed Slaughter, Solitude, and the want of all things. But the cause of warre is not that men are willing to have it; for the Will has nothing for Object but Good, at least that which seemeth good. Nor is it from this, that men know not that the effects of war are evil; for who is there that thinks not poverty and losse of life to be great evils? The cause therefore of Civill warre, is that men know not the causes neither of Warre nor Peace, there being but few in the world that have learned those duties which unite and keep men in peace, that is to say, that have learned the rules of civill life sufficiently. Now the knowledge of these rules is Morall Philosophy. But why have they not learned them, unlesse for this reason that none hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have taught them in a clear and exact method? For what shall we say? Could the ancient Masters of Greece, Egypt, Rome, and others perswade the unskillfull multitude to their innumerable opinions concerning the nature of their Gods, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves knew not whether they were true or false, and which were indeed manifestly false &amp; absurd; &amp; could they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the same multitude to civill duty, if they themselves had understood it? Or shall those few writings of Geometricians which are extant, be thought sufficient for the taking away of all controversy in the matters they treat of, and shall those innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and huge Volumes of <hi>Ethicks</hi> be thought unsufficient, if what they teach had been certain and well demonstrated? What then can be imagined to be the cause that the writings of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59147:11"/>
those men have increased science, and the writings of these have increased nothing but words, saving that the former were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by men that knew, and the later by such as knew not the doctrine they taught onely for ostentation of their wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? Neverthelesse, I deny not but the reading of some such books is very delightfull; for they are most eloquently written, and containe many cleer, wholsome and choice sentences; which yet are not universally true, though by them universally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. From whence it comes to passe, that the circumstances of times, places and persons being changed, they are no lesse frequently made use of to confirme wicked men in their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then to make them understand the precepts of Civill duties. Now that which is chiefly wanting in them, is a true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule of our actions, by which we might know whether that we undertake be just or unjust. For it is to no purpose to be bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in every thing to do Right, before there be a certain Rule and measure of Right established; which no man hitherto hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Seeing therefore from the not knowing of Civill duties, that is, from the want of Morall science proceed Civill warres, and the greatest calamities of mankind, we may very well attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to such science the production of the contrary commodities. And thus much is sufficient, to say nothing of the prayses and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contentment proceeding from Philosophy, to let you see the Utility of the same in every kinde thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The <hi>Subject</hi> of Philosophy, or the matter it treats of, is every Body of which we can conceive any generation, and which we may by any consideration thereof compare with other Bodies; or which is capable of composition and resolution; that is to say, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body, of whose Generation or Properties we can have any knowledge.. And this may be deduced from the Definition of Philosophy, whose profession it is to search out the Properties of Bodies from their Generation, or their Generation from their Properties; and therefore where there is no Generation nor Property, there is no Philosophy. Therefore it excludes <hi>Theology,</hi> I meane the doctrine of God, Eternal, Ingenerable, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, and in whom there is nothing neither to divide nor compound, nor any Generation to be conceived.</p>
               <p>It excludes the doctrine of <hi>Angels;</hi> and all such things as are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59147:12"/>
thought to be neither Bodies, nor properties of Bodies; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them no place neither for composition, nor division, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny capacity of more and lesse; that is to say, no place for Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>It excludes <hi>History,</hi> as well <hi>Naturall</hi> as <hi>Politicall,</hi> though most usefull (nay necessary) to Philosophy; because such Knowledge is but Experience, or Authority, and not Ratiocination.</p>
               <p>It excludes all such Knowledge as is acquired by Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Revelation, as not derived to us by Reason, but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace in an instant, and as it were by some sense supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p>It excludes, not onely all Doctrines which are false, but such also as are not well grounded; for whatsoever we know by right Ratiocination, can neither be false nor doubtfull; and therefore <hi>Astrology,</hi> as it is now held forth, and all such Divinations rather then sciences, are excluded.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the doctrine of <hi>Gods Worship</hi> is excluded from Philosophy, as being not to be known by naturall reason, but by the authority of the Church; and as being the object of Faith, and not of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The principall parts of Philosophy are two. For two chief kinds of Bodies, and very different from one another, offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such as search after their Generation &amp; Properties; One whereof being the worke of Nature, is called a <hi>Naturall Body;</hi> the other is called a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and is made by the wills and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men. And from these spring the two parts of Philosophy called <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Civill.</hi> But seeing that for the knowledge of the Properties of a Common-wealth, it is necessary first to know the Dispositions, Affections and Manners of men, Civill Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is againe commonly divided into two parts; whereof one which treats of mens Dispositions and Manners is called <hi>Ethicks,</hi> and the other which takes cognisance of their Civil Duties is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Politicks</hi> or simply <hi>Civill Philosophy.</hi> In the first place therefore (after I have set downe such Premisses as appertaine to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Philosophy in general) I will discourse of <hi>Bodies Naturall;</hi> in the second, of the <hi>Dispositions and Manners of men;</hi> and in the third, of the <hi>Civill Duties of Subjects.</hi>

this my Definition of Philosophy, and will say that from the liberty which a man may take of so defining as seemes best to himselfe, he may conclude any thing from any thing (though I thinke it no hard matter to demonstrate, that this Definition of mine agrees with the sense of all men;) yet lest in this point there should be any cause of dispute betwixt me and them, I here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake no more then to deliver the Elements of that Science, by which the Effects of any thing may be found out from the known Generation of the same, or contrarily the Generation from the Effects; to the end that they who search after other Philosophy, may be admonished to seeke it from other Principles.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow unconstant and fading mens thoughts are, and how much the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them depends upon chance, there is none but knows by infallible experience in himself. For no man is able to remember Quantities without sensible and present Measures, nor Colours without sensible and present Patterns, nor Number without the Names of Numbers disposed in order and learned by heart. So that whatsoever a man has put together in his mind by ratiocination without such helps, will presently slip from him, and not be revocable but by beginning his ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation anew. From which it followes, that for the acquiring of Philosophy some sensible Moniments are necessary, by which our past thoughts may be not onely reduced, but also registred every one in its own order. These Moniments I call MARKS, namely, sensible things taken at pleasure, that by the sense of them such thoughts may be recalled to our mind, as are like those thoughts for which we [took them.]</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59147:13"/>2 Again, though some one man, of how excellent a wit soever, should spend all his time, partly in reasoning and partly in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Marks for the help of his memory, and advancing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in learning; who sees not, that the benefit he reapes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will not be much, and to others none at all? For unlesse he communicate his notes with others, his science will perish with him. But if the same notes be made common to many, and so one mans inventions be taught to others, sciences will thereby be encreased to the generall good of mankind. It is therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the acquiring of Philosophy that there be certain Signes, by which what one man finds out may be manifested and made known to others. Now those things we call SIGNES, are the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of their Consequents, and the Consequents of their Antecedents, as often as we observe them to go before or follow after in the same manner.</hi> For example, a thick Cloud is a Signe of Rain to follow; and Rain a Signe, that a Cloud has gone before, for this reason onely, that we seldom see Clouds without the Consequence of Rain, nor Rain at any time but when a Cloud has gone before. And of Signs some are <hi>Naturall,</hi> whereof I have already given an example; others are <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> namely, those we make choice of at our own pleasure; as a bush hung up, signifies that Wine is to be sold there; a stone set in the ground, signifies the bound of a field; and words so and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, signifie the Cogitations and Motions of our Minde. The difference therefore betwixt Markes and Signes is this, that we make those for our own use, but these for the use of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Words so connected, as that they become signes of our Thoughts, are called SPEECH, of which every part is a <hi>Name.</hi> But seeing (as is said) both Markes and Signes are necessary for the acquiring of Philosophy, (Marks by which we may remember our own thoughts, and Signes by which we may make our thoughts known to others,) Names do both these offices; but they serve for Marks before they be used as Signes. For though a man were alone in the world, they would be usefull to him in helping him to remember; but to teach others, (unlesse there were some others to be taught,) of no use at all. Again, Names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though standing singly by themselves, are Marks, because they serve to recall our own thoughts to mind; but they cannot be Signes, otherwise then by being disposed and ordered in Speech,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59147:14"/>
as parts of the same. For example, a man may begin with a word, whereby the hearer may frame an Idea of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his mind, which neverthelesse he cannot conceive to be the Idea which was in the mind of him that spake, but that he would say something which began with that word, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not as by it selfe, but as part of another word. So that the nature of a name consists principally in this, that it is a Mark ta ken for Memories sake; but it serves also by accident, to signifie and make known to others what we remember our selves; and therefore I will define it thus:</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>A</hi> NAME <hi>is a Word taken at pleasure to serve for a Mark, which may raise in our Mind a thought like to some thought we had before, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pronounced to others, may be to them a Sign of what thought the speaker had or had not before in his mind.</hi> And it is for brevities sake that I suppose the Originall of Names to be Arbitrary, judging it a thing that maybe assumed as unquestionable. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that new Names are daily made, and old ones laid aside; that diverse Nations use different Names, and how impossible it is either to observe simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, or make any comparison betwixt a Name and a Thing, how can any man imagine that the Names of Things were imposed from their natures? For though some Names of living creatures and other things, which our first Parents used, were taught by God himselfe; yet they were by him arbitrarily imposed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards both at the Tower of Babel, and since in processe of time, growing every where out of use, are quite forgotten, and in their roomes have succeeded others, invented and received by men at pleasure. Moreover, whatsoever the common use of words be, yet Philosophers, who were to teach their knowledge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had alwayes the liberty, and sometimes they both had and will have a necessity, of taking to themselves such Names as they please for the signifying of their meaning, if they would have it understood. Nor had Mathematicians need to aske leave of any but themselves to name the figures they invented <hi>Parabolas, Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles, Cissoeides, Quadratrices, &amp;c.</hi> or to call one Magnitude A, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther B.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But seeing Names ordered in speech (as is defined) are signes of our Conceptions, it is manifest they are not signes of the Things themselves; for that the sound of this word <hi>Stone</hi> should be the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59147:14"/>
signe of a Stone, cannot be understood in any sense but this, that he that heares it, collects that he that pronouunces it thinkes of a Stone. And therefore that disputation, whether Names signifie the Matter or Form, or something compounded of both, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like subtleties of the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> is kept up by erring men, and such as understand not the words they dispute about.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Nor indeed is it at all necessary that every Name should be the Name of some Thing. For as these, a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Tree,</hi> a <hi>Stone,</hi> are the Names of the Things themselves; so the Images of a Man, of a Tree and of a stone, which are represented to men sleeping, have their Names also, though they be not Things, but onely fictions and Phantasmes of things. For we can remember these; and therefore it is no lesse necessary that they have Names to mark and signifie them, then the Things themselves. Also this word <hi>Future</hi> is a Name, but no future thing has yet any being, nor do we know whether that which we call Future, shall ever have a being or no. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, seeing we use in our mind to knit together things Past with those that are Present, the Name <hi>Future</hi> serves to signifie such knitting together. Moreover, that which neither is, nor has been, nor ever shall or ever can be, has a name, namely, <hi>That which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor has been, &amp;c.</hi> Or more briefly this, <hi>Impossible.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this word <hi>Nothing,</hi> is a name, which yet cannot be the name of any thing. For when (for example) we substract 2 and 3 from 5, and so nothing remaining we would call that substraction to mind, this speech <hi>Nothing remains,</hi> and in it the word <hi>Nothing</hi> is not unusefull. And for the same reason we say truly <hi>Lesse then Nothing</hi> remaines, when we substract More from Lesse; for the minde feigns such remaines as these for Doctrines sake, and desires as often as is necessary, to call the same to memory. But seeing every name has some relation to that which is named, though that which we name be not alwaies a thing that has a being in Nature, yet it is lawfull for Doctrines sake to apply the word <hi>Thing,</hi> to whasoever we name; as if it were all one whether that thing be truly existent or be onely feigned.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The first distinction of Names, is that some are <hi>Positive,</hi> or <hi>Affirmative;</hi> others <hi>Negative,</hi> which are also called <hi>Privative</hi> and <hi>Indefinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Positive</hi> are such as we impose for the likenesse, Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59147:15"/>
or Identity of the things we consider; <hi>Negative</hi> for the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, Unliknesse, or Inequality of the same. Examples of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are <hi>a Man, a Philosopher;</hi> for <hi>a Man</hi> denotes any one of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, and <hi>a Philosopher</hi> any one of many Philosophers by reason of their similitude; Also <hi>Socrates</hi> is a Positive name, because it signifies alwayes one and the same man. Examples of <hi>Negatives</hi> are such Positives as have the Negative particle <hi>Not</hi> added to them, as <hi>Not-Man, Not-Philosopher.</hi> But Positives were before Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives; for otherwise there could have been no use at all of these. For when the name of <hi>White</hi> was imposed upon certain things, and afterwards upon other things the names of <hi>Black, Blew, Transparent, &amp;c.</hi> the infinite dissimilitudes of these with <hi>White</hi> could not be comprehended in any one Name, save that which had in it the Negation of White, that is to say, the Name <hi>Not-White,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equivalent to it, in which the word <hi>White</hi> is repeated, such as <hi>Unlike to white, &amp;c.</hi> And by these <hi>Negative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>names,</hi> we take notice our selves, and signifie to others what we have not thought of.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Positive and Negative names are <hi>Contradictory</hi> to one another, so that they cannot both be the name of the same thing. Besides, of Contradictory names, one is the name of any thing whatsoever; for whatsoever is, is either Man or Not-man, White or Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white, and so of the rest. And this is so manifest, that it needs no further proofe or explication; for they that say <hi>the same thing cannot both be, and not be,</hi> speak obscurely; but they that say, <hi>Whatsoever is, either is, or is not,</hi> speake also absurdly and ridiculously. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this Axiome, viz. <hi>Of two Contradictory Names, one is the Name of any thing whatsoever, the other not,</hi> is the originall and foundation of all Ratiocination, that is, of all Philosophy; and therefore it ought to be so exactly propounded, that it may be of it selfe cleare and perspicuous to all men; as indeed it is, saving to such, as reading the long discourses made upon this subject by the Writers of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks</hi> (which they beleeve to be some egregious learning) thinke they understand not, when they do.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Secondly, of Names, some are <hi>Common</hi> to many things, as a <hi>Man, a Tree;</hi> others <hi>Proper</hi> to one thing, as <hi>he that writ the Iliad, Homer, this man, that man.</hi> And a Common name, being the name of many things severally taken, but not collectively of all together (as Man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59147:15"/>
is not the name of all mankind, but of every one, as of Peter, Iohn, and the rest severally) is therefore called an <hi>Universall name;</hi> and therefore this word <hi>Universall</hi> is never the name of any thing exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent in nature, nor of any Idea or Phantasme formed in the mind, but alwayes the name of some word or name; so that when <hi>a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature, a Stone, a Spirit,</hi> or any other thing is said to be <hi>Universal,</hi> it is not to be understood, that any Man, Stone, &amp;c. ever was or can be Universall, but onely that these words, <hi>Living creature, Stone, &amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Universall names,</hi> that is, Names common to many things; and the Conceptions answering them in our minde, are the Images and Phantasmes of severall Living Creatures, or other things. And therfore for the understanding of the extent of an Universal name, we need no other faculty but that of our imagination, by which we remember that such names bring sometimes one thing, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another into our minde. Also of Common Names some are more, some lesse Common. <hi>More Common,</hi> is that which is the name of more things; <hi>Lesse Common,</hi> the name of fewer things. As <hi>Living-Creature</hi> is more Common then <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Horse</hi> or <hi>Lion,</hi> because it comprehends them all; and therefore a more Common name, in respect of a lesse Common, is called the <hi>Genus</hi> or a <hi>Generall name;</hi> and this in respect of that, the <hi>Species,</hi> or a <hi>Speciall Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 And from hence proceeds the third distinction of Names, which is, that some are called names of the <hi>First,</hi> others of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Intention.</hi> Of the <hi>first Intention</hi> are the names of Things, a <hi>Man, Stone, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>second</hi> are the names of names and speeches, as <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall, Particular, Genus, Species, Syllogisme,</hi> and the like. But it is hard to say why those are called names of the <hi>First,</hi> and these of the <hi>Second Intention,</hi> unlesse perhaps it was first intended by us to give names to those things which are of daily use in this life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to such things as appertaine to science, that is, that our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Intention was to give names to Names. But whatsoever the cause hereof may be, yet this is manifest, that <hi>Genus, Species, Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, &amp;c.</hi> are names of Words and Names onely; and therefore to put <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> for Things, and <hi>Definition</hi> for the nature of any thing, as the Writers of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> have done, is not right, seeing they be only significations of what we thinke of the nature of Things.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Fourthly, some Names are of <hi>certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>determined,</hi> others
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59147:16"/>
of <hi>uncertaine</hi> and <hi>undetermined</hi> signification. Of <hi>determined</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> signification is, first, that name which is giuen to any one thing by it self, and is called an <hi>Individuall Name;</hi> as <hi>Homer, this tree, that living Creature, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly that which has any of these words <hi>All, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Both, Either,</hi> or the like added to it; and it is therefore called an Universall Name, because it signifies every one of those things to which it is Common; and of <hi>certaine</hi> signification for this reason, that he which heares, conceives in his minde the same thing that he which speakes would have him conceive. Of <hi>Indefinite</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, first, that Name which has the word <hi>some,</hi> or the like added to it, and is called a <hi>Particular name;</hi> Secondly a Common Name set by it selfe without any note either of Universality or Particularity, as <hi>Man, Stone,</hi> and is called an <hi>Indefinite Name;</hi> but both <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Indefinite</hi> names are of uncertaine signification, because the Hearer knowes not what thing it is the Speaker would have him conceive; and therefore in Speech, Particular and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite names are to be esteemed equivalent to one another. But these words, <hi>All, Every, Some, &amp;c.</hi> which denote Universality and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity, are not Names, but parts onely of Names; So that <hi>Every Man,</hi> and <hi>That Man which the Hearer conceives in his mind,</hi> are all one; and <hi>Some Man,</hi> and <hi>That Man which the Speaker thought of</hi> signifie the same. From whence it is evident, that the use of signes of this kind, is not for a mans own sake, or for his getting of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by his own private meditation (for every man has his own, Thoughts sufficiently determined without such helpes as these) but for the sake of others; that is, for the teaching and signifying of our Conceptions to others; nor were they invented onely to make us remember, but to make us able to discourse with others.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Fifthly, Names are usually distinguished into <hi>Univocall,</hi> and <hi>Equivocall. Univocall</hi> are those which in the same train of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course signifie alwayes the same thing; but <hi>Equivocall</hi> those which meane sometimes one thing, and sometimes another. Thus, the Name <hi>Triangle</hi> is said to be <hi>Univocall,</hi> because it is alwayes taken in the same sense; and <hi>Parabola</hi> to be <hi>Equivocall,</hi> for the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it has sometimes of Allegory or Similitude, and sometimes of a certaine Geometricall figure. Also every <hi>Metaphor</hi> is by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>Equivocall.</hi> But this distinction belongs not so much to Names, as to those that use Names; for some use them properly and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59147:16"/>
for the finding out of truth; others draw them from their proper sense, for Ornament, or Deceipt.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Sixtly, of Names, some are <hi>Absolute,</hi> others <hi>Relative. Relative</hi> are such as are imposed for some Comparison, as <hi>Father, Sonne, Cause, Effect, Like, Unlike, Equal, Unequal, Master, Servant, &amp;c.</hi> And those that signifie no Comparison at all are <hi>Absolute Names.</hi> But as it was noted above, that Universality is to be attributed to Words &amp; Names onely, and not to Things; so the same is to be said of other distinctions of Names; for no Things are either <hi>Univocall</hi> or <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or <hi>Relative</hi> or <hi>Absolute.</hi> There is also another distinction of Names into <hi>Concrete</hi> and <hi>Abstract;</hi> but because Abstract Names proceed from Proposition, and can have no place where there is no Affirmation, I shall speake of them hereafter.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Lastly there are <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compounded Names.</hi> But here it is to be noted, that a name is not taken in Philosophy, as in Grammar, for one single word, but for any number of words put together to signifie one Thing; for among Philosophers <hi>Sentient Animated Body,</hi> passes but for one Name, being the Name of every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which yet, among Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians is accounted three Names. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a <hi>Simple Name</hi> is not here distinguished from a <hi>Compounded Name</hi> by a Preposition, as in Grammar. But I call a <hi>Simple Name,</hi> that which in every kind is the most Common or most Universall; and that a <hi>Compounded Name,</hi> which by the joyning of another Name to it is made lesse Universall, and signifies that more conceptions then one were in the mind, for which that later Name was added. For example, in the conception of Man (as is shewn in the former Chap.) First, he is conceived to be something that has Extension, which is marked by the word <hi>Body. Body</hi> therefore is a <hi>Simple Name,</hi> being put for that first single Conception; Afterwards, upon the sight of such and such motion, another Conception arises for which he is called an <hi>Animated Body;</hi> and this I here call a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Name,</hi> as I doe also the name <hi>Animal,</hi> which is equivalent to an <hi>Animated Body.</hi> And in the same manner an <hi>Animated Rational Body,</hi> as also a <hi>Man,</hi> which is equivalent to it, is a more Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Name. And by this we see how the Composition of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the mind is answerable to the Composition of Names; for as in the minde one Idea or Phantasme succeeds to another, and to this a third; so to one Name is added another and another succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59147:17"/>
and of them all is made one <hi>Compounded</hi> Name. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we must not thinke Bodies, which are without the Minde, are compounded in the same manner, namely that there is in Nature a Body, or any other imaginable Thing existent, which at the first has no Magnitude, and then by the addition of Magnitude, comes to have Quantity, and by more or lesse Quantity to have Density or Rarity, and again by the addition of Figure to be Figurate, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this by the injection of Light or Colour, to become Lucid or Coloured; though such has been the Philosophy of many.</p>
               <p n="15">15 The Writers of <hi>Logique</hi> have endeavoured to digest the Names of all the kinds of Things into certaine <hi>Scales</hi> or Degrees, by the continual subordination of Names lesse Common, to Names more Common. In the Scale of <hi>Bodies</hi> they put in the first and highest place <hi>Body</hi> simply, and in the next place under it lesse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Names, by which it may be more limited and determined, namely <hi>Animated</hi> and <hi>Inanimated,</hi> and so on till they come to <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidualls.</hi> In like manner in the Scale of <hi>Quantities</hi> they assign the first place to <hi>Quantity,</hi> and the next to <hi>Line, Superficies,</hi> and <hi>Solid,</hi> which are Names of lesse latitude; and these Orders or Scales of Names they usually call <hi>Praedicaments</hi> and <hi>Categories;</hi> And of this Ordination not onely Positive but Negative Names also are capable; which may be exemplified by such Formes of the <hi>Praedicaments</hi> as follow.</p>

               <p n="16">16 Concerning which Praedicaments it is to be noted in the first place, That as the division is made in the first Praedicament into Contradictory Names, so it might have been done in the rest. For as there, <hi>Body</hi> is divided into <hi>Animated</hi> and <hi>Not-Animated,</hi> so in the second Praedicament <hi>Continuall Quantity</hi> may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Line</hi> and <hi>Not-line,</hi> and again, <hi>Not-line</hi> into <hi>Superficies</hi> and <hi>Not-Superficies,</hi> and so in the rest; but it was not necessary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be observed, that of <hi>Positive</hi> Names the former comprehends the later; but of <hi>Negatives</hi> the former is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the later. For example <hi>Living-Creature</hi> is the Name of every Man, and therefore it comprehends the Name <hi>Man;</hi> but on the contrary <hi>Not-Man</hi> is the Name of every Thing which is Not-Living-Creature, and therefore the Name <hi>Not-Living-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which is put first, is comprehended by the later Name <hi>Not-Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must take heed we do not thinke, that as Names, so the diversities of Things themselves may be searched out and determined by such Distinctions as these; or that arguments may be taken from hence (as some have done ridiculously) to prove that the kinds of Things are not infinite.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I would not have any man thinke I deliver the Forms above for a true and exact Ordination of Names; for this cannot be performed as long as Philosophy remains imperfect; Nor that by placing (for example) <hi>Light</hi> in the Praedicament of <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> while another places the same in the Praedicament of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I pretend that either of us ought for this to be drawn
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59147:18"/>
from his opinion; for this is to be done onely by Arguments and Ratiocination, and not by disposing of words into <hi>Classes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, I confesse I have not yet seen any great use of the Praedicaments in Philosophy. I beleeve <hi>Aristotle</hi> when he saw he could not digest the Things themselves into such Orders, might neverthelesse desire out of his owne Authority to reduce Words to such Formes, as I have done; but I doe it onely for this end, that it may be understood what this Ordination of Words is, and not to have it received or true, till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by good reason to be so.</p>

               <p n="1">1<seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the Connection or Contexture of Names arise diverse kinds of Speech, whereof some signifie the Desires and Affections of Men; such are first <hi>Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which denote the desire of Knowing; as <hi>Who is a good Man?</hi> In which speech there is one Name expressed, &amp; another desired and expected from him of whom we aske the same. Then <hi>Prayers,</hi> which signifie the desire of having something; <hi>Promises, Threats, Wishes, Commands, Complaints,</hi> and other significations of other Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Speech may also be Absurd and Insignificant; as when there is a succession of Words, to which there can be no succession of Thoughts in the mind to answer them; and this happens often to such, as understanding nothing in some subtil matter, doe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, to make others beleeve they understand, speake of the same
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59147:19"/>
incoherently; For the connection of incoherent Words, though it want the end of Speech (which is Signification) yet it is Speech; and is used by the Writers of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> almost as frequently as Speech significative. In Philosophy there is but one kinde of Speech usefull, which some call in Latine <hi>Dictum,</hi> others <hi>Enuntiatum &amp; Pronunciatum;</hi> but most men call it <hi>Proposition,</hi> and is the speech of those that Affirm or Deny, and expresseth Truth or Falsity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>A</hi> PROPOSITION <hi>is a Speech consisting of two Names copulated by which he that speaketh signifies he conceives the later Name to be the Name of the same thing whereof the former is the Name; or</hi> (which is all one) <hi>that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Name is comprehended by the later.</hi> For example, this speech <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi> in which two Names are copulated by the verb <hi>Is,</hi> is a <hi>Proposition,</hi> for this reason, that he that speakes it conceives both <hi>Living Creature</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to be Names of the same thing, or that the former Name <hi>Man</hi> is comprehended by the later Name <hi>Living Creature.</hi> Now the former Name is commonly called the <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Antecedent,</hi> or the <hi>Contained Name,</hi> and the later the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, Consequent</hi> or <hi>Containing Name.</hi> The signe of Connection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst most Nations is either some word, as the word <hi>is</hi> in the Proposition <hi>Man is a living Creature,</hi> or some Case or Termination of a word, as in this Proposition, <hi>Man walketh</hi> (which is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to this, <hi>Man is walking</hi>) the Termination by which it is said he <hi>walketh,</hi> rather then he <hi>is walking,</hi> signifieth that those two are understood to be copulated, or to be Names of the same Thing.</p>
               <p>But there are, or certainly may be some Nations that have no word which answers to our Verbe <hi>Is,</hi> who neverthelesse forme Propositions by the position onely of one Name after another, as if instead of <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi> it should be said <hi>Man a Living Creature;</hi> for the very order of the Names may sufficiently shew their connection; and they are as apt and usefull in Philosophy, as if they were copulated by the Verbe <hi>Is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Wherefore in every Proposition three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Names, which are the <hi>Subject</hi> and the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,</hi> and their <hi>Copulation;</hi> both which Names raise in our Minde the Thought of one and the same Thing; but the Copulation makes us thinke of the Cause for which those Names were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on that Thing. As for example, when we say <hi>a Body is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable,</hi> though we conceive the same thing to be designed by both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59147:20"/>
those Names, yet our Minde rests not there, but searches fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what it is <hi>to be a Body,</hi> or <hi>to be Moveable,</hi> that is, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the difference betwixt these and other Things, for which these are so called, others are not so called. They therefore that seeke what it is <hi>to be</hi> any thing, as <hi>to be Moveable, to be Hot, &amp;c.</hi> seek in Things the causes of their Names.</p>
               <p>And from hence arises that distinction of Names (touched in the last Chap.) into <hi>Concrete</hi> and <hi>Abstract.</hi> For <hi>Concrete</hi> is the Name of any thing which we suppose to have a being, and is therefore called the <hi>Subject,</hi> in Latine <hi>Suppositum,</hi> and in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; as <hi>Body, Moveable, Moved, Figurate, a Cubit high, Hot, Cold, Like, Equal, Appius, Lentulus</hi> and the like; and <hi>Abstract</hi> is that which in any Subject denotes the Cause of the Concrete Name, as <hi>to be a Body, to be Moveable, to be Moved, to be Figurate, to be of such Quantity, to be Hot, to be Cold, to be Like, to be Equall, to be Appius, to be Lentulus, &amp;c.</hi> Or Names equivalent to these, which are most commonly called <hi>Abstract</hi> Names, as <hi>Corporeity, Mobility, Motion, Figure, Quantity, Heat, Cold, Likenesse, Equality,</hi> and (as Cicero has it) <hi>Appiety</hi> and <hi>Lentulity.</hi> Of the same kind also are Infinitives; for <hi>to Live</hi> and <hi>to Move</hi> are the same with <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>to be Living,</hi> and <hi>to be Moved.</hi> But <hi>Abstract Names</hi> denote onely the Causes of <hi>Concrete Names,</hi> and not the Things themselves. For example when we see any thing, or conceive in our Minde any Visible thing, that Thing appears to us, or is conceived by us, not in one Point, but as having Parts distant from one another, that is, as being extended and filling some space. Seeing therefore we call the Thing so conceived <hi>Body,</hi> the cause of that name is, that that Thing is <hi>extended,</hi> or the <hi>Extension</hi> or <hi>Corporeity</hi> of it. So when we see a Thing appeare sometimes here, sometimes there, and call it <hi>Moved</hi> or <hi>Removed,</hi> the Cause of that Name is that it <hi>is Moved</hi> or the <hi>Motion</hi> of the same.</p>
               <p>And these Causes of Names; are the same with the Causes of our Conceptions, namely some Power or Action, or Affection of the Thing conceived, which some call the Manner by which any thing workes upon our senses, but by most men they are called <hi>Accidents;</hi> I say Accidents, not in that sense in which <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> is opposed to <hi>Necessary;</hi> but so, as being neither the Things themselves, nor parts thereof, do neverthelesse accompany the

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 There is also this difference betwixt <hi>Concrete</hi> and <hi>Abstract Names,</hi> that those were invented before Propositions, but these after; for these could have no being till there were Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from whose <hi>Copula</hi> they proceed. Now in all matters that concerne this life, but chiefly in Philosophy, there is both great Use and great Abuse of <hi>Abstract Names;</hi> and the use consists in this, that without them we cannot for the most part either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or compute the Properties of Bodies; for when we would multiply, divide, adde or substract Heat, Light, or Motion, if we should double or adde them together by <hi>Concrete</hi> Names, saying (for example) Hot is double to Hot, Light double to Light, or Moved double to Moved, we should not double the Properties, but the Bodies themselves that are Hot, Light, Moved, &amp;c. which we would not doe. But the Abuse proceeds from this, that some men seeing they can consider, that is (as I said before) bring into account the Increasings and Decreasings of Quantity, Heat and other Accidents, without considering their Bodies or Subjects (which they call <hi>Abstracting,</hi> or making to exist apart by themselves,) they speake of Accidents, as if they might be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all Bodies. And from hence proceed the grosse errors of writers of <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> for, because they can consider Thought without the consideration of Body, they inferre there is no need of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inking-Body; and because Quantity may be considered without considering Body, they thinke also that Quantity may be without Body, and Body without Quantity; and that a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as Quantity by the addition of Quantity to it. From the same fountaine spring those insignificant words, <hi>Abstract Substance, Separated Essence</hi> and the like; as also that confusion of words deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Latine Verb <hi>Est,</hi> as <hi>Essence, Essentiality, Entity, Entitative;</hi> besides <hi>Reality, Aliquiddity, Quiddity,</hi> &amp;c. which could never have been heard of among such Nations as do not <hi>Copulate</hi> their Names by the Verbe <hi>Is,</hi> but by Adjective Verbs, as Runneth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, &amp;c. or by the mere placing of one Name after another; and yet seeing such Nations Compute and Reason, it is evident that Philosophy has no need of those words <hi>Essence, Entity</hi> and other the like barbarous Termes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59147:21"/>There are many Distinctions of Propositions, whereof the first is, that some are <hi>Universall,</hi> others <hi>Particular,</hi> others <hi>Indefinite,</hi> and others <hi>Singular;</hi> and this is commonly called the distinction of <hi>Quantity.</hi> An <hi>Universall Proposition</hi> is that whose subject is affected with the sign of an Universall Name, as <hi>Every man is a Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Particular,</hi> that whose subject is affected with the sign of a Particular Name, as <hi>Some Man is learned.</hi> An <hi>Indefinite Proposition</hi> has for its Subject a Common Name, and put without any sing; as <hi>Man is a Living Creature, Man is Learned.</hi> And a <hi>Singular Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is that whose Subject is a singular Name, as <hi>Socrates is a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, This man is black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 The Second Distinction is into <hi>Affirmative</hi> and <hi>Negative,</hi> and is called the Distinction of <hi>Quality.</hi> An <hi>Affirmative Proposition</hi> is that whose Praedicate is a Positive Name, as <hi>Man is a Living Creature. Negative,</hi> that whose Praedicate is a Negative Name, as <hi>Man is Not-a-stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 The third Distinction is, that one is <hi>True,</hi> another <hi>False.</hi> A <hi>True Proposition</hi> is that, whose Praedicate containes, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends its Subject, or whose Praedicate is the Name of every thing, of which the Subject is the Name; as <hi>Man is a Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is therefore a True Proposition, because whatsoever is called <hi>Man,</hi> the same is also called <hi>Living Creature;</hi> and <hi>Some Man is sick,</hi> is True, because <hi>sick</hi> is the Name of <hi>Some Man.</hi> That which is not True, or that whose Praedicate does not containe its Subject, is called a <hi>False Proposition,</hi> as <hi>Man is a Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these words <hi>True, Truth,</hi> and <hi>True Proposition</hi> are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to one another; For Truth consists in Speech, and not in the Things spoken of; and though <hi>True</hi> be sometimes opposed to to <hi>Apparent</hi> or <hi>Feigned,</hi> yet it is alwayes to be referred to the Truth of Proposition; for the Image of a Man in a Glasse, or a Ghost, is therefore denyed to be a very Man, because this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>A Ghost is a man,</hi> is not True; for it cannot be denied but that a Ghost is a very Ghost. And therefore Truth or Verity is not any Affection of the Thing, but of the Proposition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. As for that which the Writers of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> say, that <hi>A thing, One thing,</hi> and <hi>a Very thing,</hi> are equivalent to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it is but trifling and childish; for who does not know, that <hi>A Man, One Man,</hi> and a <hi>Very Man,</hi> signifie the same.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59147:21"/>8 And from hence it is evident, that Truth and Falsity have no place but amongst such Living Creatures as use Speech. For though some brute Creatures, looking upon the Image of a Man in a Glasse, may be affected with it as if it were the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and for this reason feare it or fawne upon it in vain; Yet they doe not apprehend it as True or False, but onely as Like; and in this they are not deceived. Wherefore, as men owe all their True Ratiocination to the right understanding of Speech; So also they owe their Errors to the misunderstanding of the same; and as all the Ornaments of Philosophy proceed onely from Man, so from Man also is derived the ugly absurdity of False opinions. For Speech has something in it like to a Spiders Web (as it was said of old of <hi>Solons</hi> laws;) for by contexture of words tender and delicate Wits are insnared and stopt; but strong Wits breake easily through them.</p>
               <p>From hence also this may be deduced, that the first Truths were arbitrarily made by those that first of all imposed Names upon Things, or received them from the imposition of others. For it is true (for example) that <hi>Man is a Living Creature;</hi> but it is for this reason, that it pleased men to impose both those Names on the same thing.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Fourthly, Propositions are distinguished into <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>not Primary. Primary</hi> is that wherein the Subject is explicated by a Praedicate of many Names, as <hi>Man, is a Body Animated Rationall;</hi> for that which is comprehended in the Name <hi>Man</hi> is more largely expressed in the Names <hi>Body, Animated,</hi> and <hi>Rationall</hi> joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it is called <hi>Primary,</hi> because it is first in Ratiocination; for nothing can be proved, without understanding first the name of the Thing in question. Now <hi>Primary Propositions</hi> are nothing but Definitions, or parts of Definitions, and these onely are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Demonstration, being Truths constituted arbitrarily by the Inventors of Speech, and therefore not to be demonstrated. To these Propositions, some have added others, which they call <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Principles;</hi> namely <hi>Axiomes</hi> and <hi>Common Notions;</hi> which (though they be so evident that they need no proofe, yet) because they may be proved, are not truly Principles; &amp; the lesse to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for such, in regard Propositions not intelligible, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifestly false, are thrust on us under the Name of <hi>Principles</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59147:22"/>
by the clamour of Men, who obtrude for evident to others all that they themselves thinke True. Also certaine <hi>Petitions</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received into the number of Principles; as for example, <hi>That a streight line may be drawne between two points,</hi> and other <hi>Petitions</hi> of the Writers of Geometry; and these are indeed the Principles of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Construction,</hi> but not of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Fiftly, Propositions are distinguished into <hi>Necessary,</hi> that is, necessarily True; and True, but not necessarily, which they call <hi>Contingent.</hi> A <hi>Necessary Proposition</hi> is when nothing can at any time be conceived or feigned, whereof the Subject is the Name, but the Praedicate also is the Name of the same thing; as <hi>Man is a Living-Creature</hi> is a necessary Proposition, because at what time soever we suppose the name <hi>Man</hi> agrees with any thing, at that time the name <hi>Living-Creature</hi> also agrees with the same. But a <hi>Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Proposition</hi> is that which at one time may be true, at another time false; as <hi>Every Crow is Black;</hi> which may perhaps be true now, but false hereafter. Again, in every <hi>Necessary Proposition,</hi> the Praedicate is either equivalent to the Subject, as in this, <hi>Man is a Rational Living-Creature;</hi> or part of an equivalent Name, as in this, <hi>Man is a Living-Creature,</hi> for the Name <hi>Rational Living-Creature,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> is compounded of these two, <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Living-Creature.</hi> But in a <hi>Contingent Proposition</hi> this cannot be; for though this were true, <hi>Every Man is a Lyar,</hi> yet because the word <hi>Lyar</hi> is no part of a Compounded name equivalent to the Name <hi>Man,</hi> that Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be called <hi>Necessary,</hi> but <hi>Contingent,</hi> though it should happen to be true alwayes. And therefore those Propositions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are <hi>Necessary,</hi> which are of Sempiternal Truth, that is, true at all times. From hence also it is manifest, that Truth adheres not to Things, but to Speech onely; for some Truths are eternal; for it will be eternally true, <hi>if Man, then Living-Creature;</hi> but that any <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Living-Creature</hi> should exist eternally, is not necessary.</p>
               <p n="11">11 A sixth Distinction of Propositions is into <hi>Categorical</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall.</hi> A <hi>Categoricall Proposition</hi> is that which is simply or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pronounced, as <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature, No Man is a Tree;</hi> and <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> is that which is pronounced conditionally, as, <hi>If any thing be a Man the same is also a Living Creature, If any thing be a Man the same is also Not-a-stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Categoricall Proposition,</hi> and an <hi>Hypothetical</hi> answering it, doe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59147:22"/>
both signifie the same, if the Propositions be Necessary; but not if they be Contingent. For example, if this, <hi>Every Man is a Living-Creature,</hi> be true, this also will be true, <hi>If any thing be a Man, the same is also a Living-Creature;</hi> but in Contingent Propositions, though this be true, <hi>Every Crow is Black;</hi> yet this, <hi>If any thing be a Crow the same is Black,</hi> is false. But an <hi>Hypotheticall Proposition</hi> is then rightly said to be true, when the Consequence is true; as <hi>Every Man is a Living-Creature</hi> is rightly said to be a true Proposition, because of whatsoever it is truly said <hi>That is a Man,</hi> it cannot but be truly said also <hi>The same is a Living-Creature.</hi> And therefore whensoever an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall Proposition</hi> is true, the <hi>Categoricall</hi> answering it is not only true, but also necessary; which I thought worth the noting, as an argument, that Philosophers may in most things reason more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly by <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> then <hi>Categoricall Propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 But seeing every Proposition may be &amp; uses to be pronounced and written in many formes, and we are obliged to speake in the same manner as most men speake; yet they that learne Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy from Masters, had need to take heed they be not deceived by the Variety of expressions. And therefore whensoever they meet with any obscure Proposition, they ought to reduce it to its most Simple and Categoricall forme; in which the Copulative word <hi>Is</hi> must be expressed by it selfe, and not mingled in any manner either with the Subject or Praedicate, both which must be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cleerly distinguished one from another. For example, if this Proposition <hi>Man can not sinne,</hi> be compared with this, <hi>Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sinne,</hi> their difference will easily appeare if they be reduced to these, <hi>Man is able not to sinne,</hi> and <hi>Man is not able to sinne,</hi> where the Praedicates are manifestly different. But they ought to doe this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by themselves, or betwixt them and their Masters onely; for it will be thought both ridiculous and absurd, for a man to use such language publiquely. Being therefore to speake of <hi>Equipollent Propositions,</hi> I put in the first place all those for <hi>Equipollent,</hi> that may be reduced p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rely to one and the same Categoricall Proposition.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Secondly, that which is Categoricall and Necessary, is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipollent</hi> to its Hypotheticall Proposition; as this Categorical, <hi>A Right-lined Triangle has its three Angles equal to two Right angles,</hi> to this Hypotheticall, <hi>If any Figure be a Right-lined Triangle, the three Angles of it are equal to two Right Angles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59147:23"/>14 Also, any two Universall Propositions, of which the Termes of the one (that is, the Subject and Praedicate) are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Termes of the other, and their Order inverted, as these, <hi>Every man is a Living Creature,</hi> and <hi>Every thing that is not a Living Creature, is not a Man,</hi> are <hi>Equipollent.</hi> For seeing <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature</hi> is a true Proposition, the Name <hi>Living Creature</hi> containes the Name <hi>Man;</hi> but they are both Positive Names; and therefore (by the last Article of the praecedent Chapter) the Negative Name <hi>Not Living Creature</hi> containes the Negative Name <hi>Not Man;</hi> Wherefore <hi>Everything that is not a Living Creature is not a Man</hi> is a true Proposition. Likewise these, <hi>No Man is a Tree, No Tree is a Man,</hi> are <hi>Equipollent.</hi> For if it be true that <hi>Tree</hi> is not the Name of any <hi>Man,</hi> then no one thing can be signified by the two Names <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Tree,</hi> wherefore <hi>No Tree is a Man</hi> is a true Proposition. Also to this, <hi>Whatsoever is not a Living Creature is not a Man,</hi> where both the Termes are Negative, this other Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>Equipollent, Onely a Living Creature is a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 Fourthly, Negative Propositions, whether the particle of Negation be set after the <hi>Copula</hi> as some Nations doe, or before it, as it is in Latine and Greeke, if the Termes be the same, are <hi>equipollent;</hi> as for example, <hi>Man is not-a-Tree</hi> and <hi>Man is not-a-Tree,</hi> are equipollent, though <hi>Aristotle</hi> deny it. Also these, <hi>Every Man is not a Tree,</hi> and <hi>No Man is a Tree</hi> are equipollent, and that so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, as it needs not be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Lastly, all Particular Propositions that have their Termes inverted, as these, <hi>Some Man is Blind, Some Blind thing is a Man,</hi> are <hi>equipollent;</hi> for either of the two Names, is the Name of some one and the same Man; and therefore in which soever of the two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they be connected, they signifie the same Truth.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Of Propositions that have the same Termes, and are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the same Order, but varied either by Quantity or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, some are called <hi>Subaltern,</hi> others <hi>Contrary,</hi> others <hi>Subcontrary,</hi> and others <hi>Contradictory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subaltern,</hi> are Universal and Particular Propositions of the same Quality; as, <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature, Some Man is a Living Creature;</hi> or, <hi>No Man is Wise, Some Man is not Wise.</hi> Of these i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Universal be true, the Particular will be true also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contrary,</hi> are Universal Propositions of different Quality; <hi>as</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59147:23"/>
                  <hi>Every Man is happy, No Man is happy.</hi> And of these if one be true the other is false; also they may both be false, as in the example given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subcontrary,</hi> are Particular Propositions of different Quality; <hi>as Some Man is learned, Some Man is not learned;</hi> which cannot be both false, but they may be both true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contradictory</hi> are those that differ both in Quantity and Quality; as <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature, Some Man is not a Living Creature;</hi> which can neither be both true, nor both false.</p>
               <p n="18">18 A Proposition is said to <hi>follow</hi> from two other Propositions, when these being granted to be true, it cannot be denyed but the other is true also. For example, let these two Propositions, <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi> and <hi>Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed true, that is, that <hi>Body</hi> is the Name of <hi>Every Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Living Creature,</hi> the Name of <hi>Every Man.</hi> Seeing therefore, if these be understood to be true, it cannot be understood that <hi>Body</hi> is not the name of <hi>Every man,</hi> that is, that <hi>Every Man is a Body,</hi> is false, this Proposition will be said to <hi>follow</hi> from those two, or to be necessarily <hi>inferred</hi> from them.</p>
               <p n="19">19 That a true Proposition may follow from false Propositions, may happen sometimes; but false from true, never. For if these, <hi>Every Man is a Stone,</hi> and <hi>Every Stone is a Living Creature,</hi> (which are both false) be granted to be true, it is granted also that <hi>Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is the name of <hi>Every Stone,</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Every Man,</hi> that is, that <hi>Living Creature</hi> is the Name of <hi>Every Man;</hi> that is to say, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi> is true, as it is indeed true. Wherefore a true Proposition may sometimes follow from false. But if any two Propositions be true, a false one can never follow from them. For if true follow from false, for this reason onely, that the false are granted to be true, then truth from two truths granted will follow in the same manner.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Now seeing none but a true Proposition will follow from true, and that the understanding of two Propositions to be true, is the cause of understanding that also to be true which is deduced from them; the two Antecedent Propositions are commonly called the Causes of the inferred Proposition, or Conclusion. And from hence it is that Logicians say, the <hi>Premisses</hi> are Causes of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;</hi> which may passe, though it be not properly spoken; for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59147:24"/>
though Understanding be the cause of Understanding, yet Speech is not the cause of Speech. But when they say, the Cause of the Properties of any thing, is the Thing it self, they speake absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Eor example, if a Figure be propounded which is Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; Seeing every Triangle has all its angles together equal to two right angles, from whence it follows that all the angles of that Figure are equal to two right angles, they say for this reason, that that Figure is the Cause of that Equality. But seeing the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure does not it self make its angles, and therefore cannot be said to be the <hi>Efficient-Cause,</hi> they call it the <hi>Formall-Cause;</hi> whereas in deed it is no Cause at all; nor does the Property of any Figure fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Figure, but has its Being at the same time with it; only the Knowledge of the Figure goes before the Knowledge of the Properties; and one Knowledge is truly the Cause of another Knowledge, namely the <hi>Efficient-Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much concerning <hi>Proposition;</hi> which in the Progress of Philosophy is the first Step, like the moving towards of one Foot. By the due addition of another Step I shall proceed to <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,</hi> and make a compleat Pace. Of which in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Speech consisting of three Propositions, from two of which the third followes, is called a SYLLOGISME; and that which followes is called the <hi>Conclusion;</hi> the other two <hi>Premisses.</hi> For example this Speech, <hi>Every man is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature, Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> therefore, <hi>Every Man is a Body,</hi> is a <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> because the third Proposition follows from the two first; that is, if those be granted to be true, this must also be granted to be true.</p>
               <p n="2">2 From two Propositions which have not one Terme common, no Conclusion can follow; and therefore no <hi>Syllogisme</hi> can be made of them. For let any two Premisses, <hi>A man is a Living Creature, A Tree is a Plant,</hi> be both of them true, yet because it cannot be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from them that <hi>Plant</hi> is the Name of a <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> the Name of a <hi>Plant,</hi> it is not necessary that this Conclusion, <hi>A Man is a Plant</hi> should be true. Corollary, Therefore in the <hi>Premisses</hi> of a <hi>Syllogisme</hi> there can be but three <hi>Termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides there can be no Terme in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> which was not in the <hi>Premisses.</hi> For let any two Premisses be, <hi>A Man is a Living Creature, A Living Creature is a Body,</hi> yet if any other Terme be put
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59147:25"/>
in the Conclusion, as <hi>Man is two footed;</hi> though it be true, it cannot follow from the Premisses, because from them it cannot be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that the Name <hi>Two footed</hi> belongs to a <hi>Man;</hi> and therefore againe, In every <hi>Syllogisme</hi> there can be but three <hi>Termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Of these Termes, that which is the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is commonly called the <hi>Major;</hi> that which is the <hi>Subject</hi> in the Conclusion, the <hi>Minor,</hi> and the other is the <hi>Middle Term;</hi> as in this Syllogisme, <hi>A Man is a Living Creature, A Living Creature is a Body,</hi> therefore, <hi>A Man is a Body, Body</hi> is the <hi>Major, Man</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> and <hi>Living Creature</hi> the <hi>Middle Term.</hi> Also of the Premisses, that in which the <hi>Major Terme</hi> is found, is called the <hi>Major Proposition,</hi> and that which has the <hi>Minor Term</hi> the <hi>Minor Proposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 If the Middle Terme be not in both the Premisses determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one and the same singular thing, no Conclusion will follow, nor Syllogisme be made. For let the <hi>Minor Terme</hi> be <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Terme Living Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Major Term Lyon;</hi> and let the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses be <hi>Man is a Living Creature, Some Living Creature is a Lyon,</hi> yet it will not follow that, <hi>Every</hi> or <hi>Any Man is a Lyon.</hi> By which it is manifest, that in every Syllogisme, that Proposition which has the <hi>Middle Terme</hi> for its <hi>Subject,</hi> ought to be either <hi>Universal</hi> or <hi>Singular,</hi> but not <hi>Particular</hi> nor <hi>Indefinite.</hi> For example, this Syllogism, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is a Living Creature, some Living Creature is four-footed,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>some Man is four-footed,</hi> is therefore faulty, because the <hi>Middle Term, Living Creature,</hi> is in the first of the Premisses determined onely to <hi>Man,</hi> for there the Name of <hi>Living Creature</hi> is given to <hi>Man onely,</hi> but in the later Premisse it may be understood of some other Living Creature besides Man. But if the later Premisse had been <hi>Universall,</hi> as here, <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature, Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> therefore <hi>Every Man is a Body,</hi> the Syllogisme had been true; for it would have followed that <hi>Body</hi> had been the Name of <hi>Every Living Creature,</hi> that is of <hi>Man,</hi> that is to say, the Conclusion <hi>Every Man is a Body</hi> had been true. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when the <hi>Middle Term</hi> is a <hi>Singular</hi> Name, a Syllogisme may be made, I say a true Syllogisme, though uselesse in Philosophy, as this, <hi>Some Man is Socrates, Socrates is a Philosopher,</hi> therefore <hi>Some Man is a Philosopher;</hi> for the Premisses being granted, the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion cannot be denyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And therefore of two Premisses, in both which the <hi>Middle</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59147:25"/>
                  <hi>Terme</hi> is <hi>Particular,</hi> a Syllogisme cannot be made; for whether the <hi>Middle Terme</hi> be the <hi>Subject</hi> in both the Premisses, or the <hi>Predicate</hi> in both, or the <hi>Subject</hi> in one and the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the other, it will not be necessarily determined to the same thing. For let the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses be,<list>
                     <item>Some Man is blind</item>
                     <item>Some Man is learned</item>
                  </list> In both which the <hi>Middle Term</hi> is the <hi>Subject,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not follow, that <hi>Blind</hi> is the Name of any <hi>learned Man,</hi> or <hi>Learned</hi> the Name of any <hi>Blind Man,</hi> seeing the Name <hi>Learned</hi> does not containe the Name <hi>Blind,</hi> nor this that; and therefore it is not necessary that both should be Names of the same Man. So from these Premisses. <list>
                     <item>Every Man is a Living Creature</item>
                     <item>Every Horse is a Living Creature</item>
                  </list> In both which the <hi>Middle Terme</hi> is the <hi>Predicate,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing will follow. For seeing <hi>Living Creature</hi> is in both of them <hi>Indefinite,</hi> which is equivalent to <hi>Particular,</hi> and that <hi>Man</hi> may be one kind of <hi>Living Creature,</hi> and <hi>Horse</hi> another kind, it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that <hi>Man</hi> should the be Name of <hi>Horse,</hi> or <hi>Horse</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> Or if the Premisses be, <list>
                     <item>Every Man is a Living Creature</item>
                     <item>Some Living Creature is four-footed</item>
                  </list> In one of which the <hi>Middle Terme</hi> is the <hi>Subject,</hi> and in the other the <hi>Predicate,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conclusion will follow, because the Name <hi>Living Creature</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not determined, it may in one of them be understood of <hi>Man</hi> in the other of <hi>Not-Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Now it is manifest from what has been said, that a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme is nothing but a Collection of the summe of two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, joyned together by a common Term, which is called the <hi>Middle Terme.</hi> And as Proposition is the Addition of two Names, so Syllogisme is the adding together of three.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Syllogismes are usually distinguished according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Figures,</hi> that is, by the diverse position of the Middle Term. And againe in Figure there is a distinction of certain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59147:26"/>
                  <hi>Moods,</hi> which consist of the differences of Propositions in <hi>Quantity &amp; Quality.</hi> The first Figure is that, in which the Terms are placed one after another according to their latitude of Signification; in which order the <hi>Minor Term</hi> is first, the <hi>Middle Term</hi> next, and the <hi>Major</hi> last; as if the <hi>Minor</hi> Term be Man, the <hi>Middle Term Living Creature</hi> and the <hi>Major Term Body,</hi> then, <hi>Man is a Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a Body,</hi> will be a Syllogisme in the first <hi>Figure;</hi> in which, <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi> is the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition; the <hi>Major, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature is a Body,</hi> and the <hi>Conclusion</hi> or sum of both <hi>Man is a Body.</hi> Now this <hi>Figure</hi> is called <hi>Direct,</hi> because the Termes stand in direct Order; and it is varied by <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> into four <hi>Moods;</hi> of which the first is that wherein all the Terms are <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and the Minor Term <hi>Universal,</hi> as <hi>Every Man is a Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Every Living Creature is a Body;</hi> in which all the Propositions are <hi>Affirmative</hi> and <hi>Universall.</hi> But if the Major Term be a Negative Name, and the Minor an Universall Name, the <hi>Figure</hi> will be in the second <hi>Mood,</hi> as, <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature, Every Living Creature is not a Tree,</hi> in which the Major Proposition and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are both <hi>Universall</hi> and <hi>Negative.</hi> To these two are commonly addded two more, by making the Minor Term <hi>Particular.</hi> Also it may happen that both the Major and Middle Termes are <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Terms, and then there arises another <hi>Mood,</hi> in which all the Propositions are Negative, and yet the Syllogisme will be good; as, if the Minor Term be <hi>Man,</hi> the Middle Term <hi>Not a Stone,</hi> and the Major Terme, <hi>Not a Flint,</hi> this Syllogisme, <hi>No Man is a Stone, Whatsoever is not a Stone is not a Flint,</hi> therefore <hi>No Man is a Flint,</hi> is true, though it consist of three Negatives. But in Philosophy, the Profession whereof is to establish Universall Rules concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Properties of Things, seeing the difference betwixt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> and <hi>Affirmatives</hi> is onely this, that in the former the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is affirmed by a Negative Name, and by a Positive in the later, it is superfluous to consider any other <hi>Mood</hi> in direct <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> besides that, in which all the Propositions are both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and Affirmative.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Thoughts in the mind answering to a Direct Syllogism, proceed in this manner; First, there is conceived a Phantasme of the thing named, with that Accident or Quality thereof for which it is in the Minor Proposition called by that name which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59147:26"/>
is the Subject; next, the Mind has a Phantasme of the same thing with that Accident or Quality for which it hath the name that in the same Proposition is the Predicate; Thirdly, the Thought returns of the same thing as having that Accident in it, for which it is called by the Name that is in the Predicate of the Major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and lastly, remembring that all those are the Accidents of one and the same thing, it concludes that those three Names are also Names of one and the same thing; that is to say, the Conclusion is true. For example, when this Syllogisme is made, <hi>Man is a Living Creature, A Living Creature is a Body,</hi> therefore <hi>Man is a Body,</hi> the Mind conceives first an image of a Man <hi>speaking</hi> or discoursing, and remembers that that which so appears, is called <hi>Man;</hi> then it has the image of the same Man <hi>moving,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that that which appeares so is called <hi>Living Creature;</hi> thirdly, it conceives an image of the same Man as <hi>filling some place</hi> or space, and remembers that what appeares so is called <hi>Body;</hi> and lastly, when it remembers, that that thing which was extended, and moved and spake, was one and the same thing, it concludes that the three Names <hi>Man, Living Creature,</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> are Names of the same thing, and that therefore <hi>Man is a Living Creature</hi> is a true Proposition. From whence it is manifest, that Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have not the use of Speech, have no Conception or Thought in the Mind, answering to a Syllogisme made of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Propositions; seeing it is necessary to Thinke not only of the Thing, but also by turnes to remember the diverse Names, which for diverse considerations thereof are applied to the same.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The rest of the Figures arise either from the Inflexion, or Inversion of the first or direct Figure; which is done by changing the Major, or Minor, or both the Propositions into converted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions aequipollent to them.</p>
               <p>From whence follow three other Figures; of which, two are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected,</hi> and the third <hi>Inverted.</hi> The first of these three is made by the Conversion of the Major Proposition. For let the Minor, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and Major Terms stand in direct order, thus, <hi>Man is a Living Creature, Is not a Stone,</hi> which is the first or direct Figure; the Infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion will be by converting the Major Proposition in this manner,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59147:27"/>
                  <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A stone is not a Living Creature;</hi> And this is the second</p>
               <p>Figure, or the first of the Indirect Figures; in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion will be, <hi>Man is not a stone.</hi> For (having shewn in the last Chap. 14 Article, that Universall Propositions converted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the Termes are aequipollent,) both those Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes conclude alike; so that if the Major be read (like Hebrew) backwards, thus, <hi>A Living Creature is not a Stone,</hi> it will be direct again, as it was before. In like manner this Direct Syllogisme, <hi>Man is not a Tree, is not a Pear-tree,</hi> will be made Indirect by convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Major Proposition (by contradiction of the Termes) into another aequipollent to it, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man is not a Tree,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Pear-tree is a Tree;</hi> for the same Conclusion will follow, <hi>Man is not a Pear-tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the Conversion of the Direct Figure into the first Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Figure, the Major Terme in the Direct Figure ought to be <hi>Negative.</hi> For though this Direct, <hi>Man is a Living Creature, is a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> be made Indirect, by converting the Major Proposition, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man is a Living Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not a Body is not a Living Creature,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Body;</hi> yet this Conversion appeares so obscure, that this Mood is of no use at all. By the Conversion of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Proposition, it is manifest, that in this Figure, the Mi dle Terme is alwayes the Predicate in both the Premisses.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The second Indirect Figure is made by converting the Minor Proposition, so as that the Middle Term is the Subject in both. But this never concludes Uniuersally, and therefore is of no use in Philosophy. Neverthelesse I will set down an example of it; by which this Direct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> by Conversion of the Minor Proposition will stand thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some Living Creature is a Man,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some Man is a Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi> cannot be converted into this, <hi>Every Living Creature is a Man;</hi> and therefore if this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59147:27"/>
be restored to its Direct forme, the Minor Proposition will be <hi>Some Man is a Living Creature,</hi> and consequently the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be <hi>Some Man is a Body,</hi> seeing the Minor Terme <hi>Man,</hi> which is the Subject in the Conclusion, is a Particular Name.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The third Indirect or Inverted Figure, is made by the Conversion of both rhe Premisses. For Example, this Direct Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Living Creature is not a Stone,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is not a Stone;</hi> being Inverted will stand thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Stone is not a Living Creature</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoever is not a Living Creature, is not a Man,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Stone is not a Man.</hi> Which Conclusion is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of the Direct Conclusion, and aequipollent to the same. The Figures therefore of Syllogisms, if they be numbred by the diverse scituation of the Middle Terme onely, are but three; in the first whereof the Middle Term has the Middle place; in the second, the last; and in the third, the first place. But if they be numbred according to the scituation of the Termes simply, they are four; for the first may be distinguished againe into two, namely into Direct and Inverted. From whence it is evident, that the controversie among Logicians concerning the fourth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is a meer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or contention about the Name thereof; for as for the thing it selfe, it is plain, that the scituation of the Termes (not considering the Quantity or Quality by which the Moods are distinguished) makes four differences of Syllogismes, which may be called Figures, or have any other Name at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p n="12">12 In every one of these Figures there are many Moods, which are made by varying the Premisses according to all the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are capable of, by Quantity and Quality; as namely, in the Direct Figure there are six Moods; in the first Indirect Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, four; in the second, fourteen; and in the third, eighteen. But because from the Direct Figure I rejected as superfluous all Moods besides that which consists of Universal Propositions, and whose Minor Proposition is Affirmative, I doe together with it reject the Moods of the rest of the Figures which are made by Conversion of the Premisses in the Direct Figure.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59147:28"/>13 As it was shewed before, that in Necessary Propositions a Categoricall and Hypotheticall Proposition are aequipollent; so likewise it is manifest that a Categoricall and Hypotheticall Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme are aequivalent. For every Categoricall Syllogisme, as this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi>

                  <hi>Every Living Creature is a Body,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Body,</hi> is of equall force with this Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Syllogisme.</p>

                  <hi>If any thing be a Man, the same is also a Living Creature,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If any thing be a Living Creature, the same is a Body,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any thing be a Man, the same is a Body.</hi> In like manner, this Categorical Syllogisme in an Indirect Figure</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Stone is a Living Creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Man is a Living Creature,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Man is a Stone,</hi> or</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Stone is a Man,</hi> is aequivalent to this Hypotheticall Syllogisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any thing be a Man, the same is a Living Creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>If any thing be a Stone, the same is not a Man,</hi> or</p>

                  <hi>If any thing be a Man, the same is not a Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much seemes sufficient for the nature of Syllogismes; (for the doctrine of Moods and Figures is cleerely delivered by others that have written largely and profitably of the same.) Nor are Precepts so necessary as Practice for the attaining of true Ratiocination; and they that study the Demonstrations of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, will sooner learn true Logick, then they that spend time in reading the Rules of Syllogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>En are subject to <hi>Erre</hi> not onely in Affim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Denying; but also in Perception, and in silent Cogitation. In Affirming and Denying, when they call any thing by a Name, which is not the Name thereof; as if from seeing the Sun first by reflection in Water, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again directly in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we should to both those appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances give the Name of Sunne, and say there are two Sunnes; which none but men can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; for no other Living Creatures have the use of Names. This kind of Error onely deserves the name of <hi>Falsity,</hi> as arising, not from sense, nor from the Things themselves but from pronouncing rashly; for Names have their constitution, not from the Species of Things, but from the Will and Consent of Men. And hence it comes to passe, that men pronounce <hi>Falsely</hi> by their own negligence, in departing from such appellations of things as are agreed upon, and are not deceived neither by the Things, nor by the Sense; for they do not perceive that the thing they see is called Sunne, but they give it that Name from their owne will and agreement. Tacite Errors, or the Errors of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59147:29"/>
Sense and Cogitation, are made, by passing from one Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Imagination of another different thing; or by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be Past, or Future, which never was, nor ever shall be; as when by seeing the Image of the Sunne in Water, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Sunne it selfe to be there; or by seeing swords, that there has been or shall be fighting, because it uses to be so for the most part; or when from Promises we feigne the mind of the Promiser to be such and such; or lastly, when from any Signe we vainly imagine something to be signified, which is not. And Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of this sort are common to all things that have sense; and yet the Deception proceeds neither from our senses, nor from the Things we perceive; but from our selves, while we feigne such things as are but meer Images, to be something more then Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But neither Things, nor Imaginations of Things can be said to be False, seeing they are truly what they are; nor doe they as Signes promise any thing which they do not performe; for they indeed do not promise at all, but we from them; nor doe the Clouds, but we from seeing the Clouds, say it shall rain. The best way therefore to free our selves from such Errors as arise from naturall Signes, is first of all, before we begin to reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such conjecturall things, to suppose our selves ignorant, and then to make use of our Ratiocination; for these Errors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the want of Ratiocination; whereas Errors which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Affirmation and Negation, (that is, the Falsity of Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) proceed only from Reasoning amisse. Of these therefore, as repugnant to Philosophy, I will speake principally.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Errors which happen in Reasoning, that is, in Syllogizing, consist either in the Falsity of the Premisses, or of the Inference. In the first of these cases, a Syllogisme is said to be faulty in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it; and in the second case, in the <hi>Forme.</hi> I will first consider the Matter, namely how many wayes a Proposition may be false; and next the Forme, and how it comes to pass, that when the Premises are True, the Inference is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing False.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that Proposition onely is True, (Chap. 3. Art. 7.) in which are copulated two Names of one and the same thing; and that alwayes False, in which Names of different things are copulated; look how many wayes Names of different things
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59147:29"/>
may be copulated, and so many wayes a False Proposition may be made.</p>
               <p>Now all things to which we give Names, may be reduced to these four kinds, namely, <hi>Bodies, Accidents, Phantasmes,</hi> and <hi>Names</hi> themselves; and therefore in every true Proposition it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Names copulated, be both of them Names of <hi>Bodies,</hi> or both Names of <hi>Accidents,</hi> or both Names of <hi>Phantasmes,</hi> or both Names of <hi>Names.</hi> For Names otherwise copulated are incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and constitute a False Proposition. It may happen also that the Name of a <hi>Body,</hi> of an <hi>Accident,</hi> or of a <hi>Phantasme</hi> may be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Speech.</hi> So that copulated Names may be Incoherent seven manner of wayes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 If the Name of a <hi>Body</hi> be copulated with the Name of an <hi>Accident.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 If the Name of a <hi>Body</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Phantasme.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 If the Name of a <hi>Body</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Name.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4 If the Name of an <hi>Accident</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Phantasme.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5 If the Name of an <hi>Accident</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Name.</hi>

                  <item>6 If the Name of a <hi>Phantasme</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Name.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7 If the Name of a <hi>Body,</hi> of an <hi>Accident</hi> or of a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme</hi> be copulated with the Name of a <hi>Speech.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Of all which I will give some examples.</p>
               <p n="3">3 After the first of these wayes Propositions are false, when Abstract Names are copulated with Concrete Names; as (in Latine and Greek) <hi>Esse est Ens, Essenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> (<hi>i.</hi>) <hi>Quidditas est Ens,</hi> and many the like which are found in Aristotles <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> Also, the <hi>Understanding worketh,</hi> the <hi>Understanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth,</hi> the <hi>Sight seeth,</hi> A <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Magnitude,</hi> A <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Quantity,</hi> A <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Extension,</hi> To <hi>Be a Man</hi> is <hi>a Man, Whitenesse</hi> is a <hi>White thing, &amp;c.</hi> which is as if one should say The <hi>Runner</hi> is the <hi>Running,</hi> or the <hi>Walke Walketh.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Essence</hi> is <hi>separated, Substance</hi> is <hi>Abstracted;</hi> and others like these, or derived from these (with which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Philosophy abounds). For seeing no <hi>Subject</hi> of an <hi>Accident,</hi> (that is, No <hi>Body</hi>) is an <hi>Accident;</hi> no Name of an <hi>Accident</hi> ought to be given to a <hi>Body,</hi> nor of a <hi>Body</hi> to an <hi>Accident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 False in the second Manner are such Propositions as these,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59147:30"/>
A <hi>Ghost is a Body,</hi> or a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, a thinne Body; <hi>Sensible Species fly up and down in the Air,</hi> or <hi>are moved hither and thither,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Bodies; also, A <hi>Shadow is Moved,</hi> or <hi>is a Body; Light is Moved,</hi> or <hi>is a Body; Colour is the Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect of Sight, Sound</hi> of <hi>Hearing; Space</hi> or <hi>Place is Extended;</hi> and innumerable others of this kind. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ghosts, sensible Species,</hi> a <hi>Shadow, Light, Colour, Sound, Space, &amp;c.</hi> appeare to us no lesse sleeping then waking, they cannot be things without us, but onely <hi>Phantasmes</hi> of the mind that imagins them; and therefore the Names of these, copulated with the Names of <hi>Bodies,</hi> cannot constitute a true Proposition.</p>
               <p n="5">5 False Propositions of the third kind, are such as these; <hi>Genus est Ens, Universale est Ens, Ens de Ente Praedicatur.</hi> For <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Universale,</hi> and <hi>Praedicare</hi> are Names of <hi>Names,</hi> and not of <hi>Things.</hi> Also <hi>Number is Infinite,</hi> is a false Proposition; for no number can be Infinite, but onely the word <hi>Number</hi> is then called an Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Name when there is no determined Number answering to it in the Mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6 To the fourth kind belong such false Propositions as these, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>An Object is of such Magnitude or Figure as appeares to the Beholders; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Light, Sound, are in the Object;</hi> and the like. For the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appeares sometimes <hi>greater,</hi> sometimes <hi>lesser,</hi> sometimes <hi>square,</hi> sometimes <hi>round</hi> according to the diversity of the Distance and Medium; but the true Magnitude and Figure of the thing seen is allwayes one and the same; so that the magnitude and figure which appeares, is not the true magnitude and figure of the Object, nor any thing but Phantasme; and therefore in such Propositions as these, the Names of <hi>Accidents</hi> are copulated with the Names of <hi>Phantasmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Propositions are false in the fifth manner, when it is said that <hi>The Definition is the Essence of a thing; Whitenesse,</hi> or some other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>is the Genus, or Universal.</hi> For <hi>Definition</hi> is not the <hi>Essence</hi> of any thing, but a speech signifying what we conceive of the Essence thereof; and so also not Whitenesse it selfe, but the word <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> is a <hi>Genus,</hi> or an <hi>Universall Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 In the sixth manner they Erre, that say the <hi>Idea of any thing is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal;</hi> as if there could be in the Mind an Image of <hi>a Man</hi> which were not the Image of <hi>some one Man,</hi> but of <hi>Man simply,</hi> which is impossible; for every <hi>Idea</hi> is one, and of onething; but they are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59147:30"/>
deceived in this, that they put the <hi>Name</hi> of the thing for the <hi>Idea</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="9">9 They erre in the seventh manner, that make this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between things that have being, that some of them <hi>exist by themselves,</hi> others <hi>by Accident;</hi> Namely, because <hi>Socrates is a Man</hi> is a Necessary Proposition, and <hi>Socrates is a Musician</hi> a Contingent Proposition, therefore they say some things <hi>exist necessarily</hi> or <hi>by themselves,</hi> others <hi>contingently</hi> or <hi>by Accident;</hi> whereby, seeing <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Contingent, By it selfe, By Accident,</hi> are not Names of <hi>Things,</hi> but of <hi>Propositions,</hi> they that say <hi>any thing that has being, exists by Accident,</hi> copulate the Name of a <hi>Proposition</hi> with the Name of a <hi>Thing.</hi> In the same manner also they Erre, which place some Ideas in the Understanding, others in the Fancy; as if from the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Proposition <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi> we had one Idea or Image of a Man derived from sense to the Memory, and another to the Understanding; wherein that which deceives them is this, that they think one <hi>Idea</hi> should be answerable to a <hi>Name,</hi> another to a <hi>Proposition;</hi> which is false; for <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>position</hi> signifies onely the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of those things one after another, which we observe in the same <hi>Idea</hi> of Man; so that this Proposition <hi>Man is a Living Creature,</hi> raises but one <hi>Idea</hi> in us, though in that <hi>Idea</hi> we consider that first, for which he is called <hi>Man,</hi> and next that for which he is called <hi>Living Creature.</hi> The Falsities of Propositions in all these several manners, is to be discovered by the Definitions of the Copulated Names.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But when Names of <hi>Bodies</hi> are copulated with Names of <hi>Bodies,</hi> Names of <hi>Accidents</hi> with Names of <hi>Accidents,</hi> Names of <hi>Names</hi> with Names of <hi>Names,</hi> and Names of <hi>Phantasmes</hi> with Names of <hi>Phantasmes,</hi> if we neverthelesse remaine still doubtfull whether such Propositions are true; we ought then in the first place to find out the Definition of both those Names, and againe the Definitions of such Names as are in the former Definition, and so proceed by a continuall Resolution till we come to a simple Name, that is, to the most Generall or most Universall Name of that kind; and if after all this the Truth or Falsity thereof be not evident, we must search it out by Philosophy, and Ratiocination, beginning from Definitions. For every Proposition Universally true, is either a Definition, or part of a Definition, or the evidence of it depends upon Definitions.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59147:31"/>11 That fault of a Syllogisme which lyes bid in the Forme thereof, will allwayes be found either in the implication of the Copula with one of the Termes, or in the Aequivocation of some word; and in either of these wayes there will be <hi>four Terms,</hi> which (as I have shewne) cannot stand in a true Syllogisme. Now the implication of the Copula with either Terme, is easily detected by reducing the Propositions to plain and cleere Praedication; as (for example) if any man should argue thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hand toucheth the Pen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pen toucheth the Paper,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hand toucheth the Paper;</hi> the Fallacy will easily appear by reducing it, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hand, is, touching the Pen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pen, is, touching the Paper,</hi> Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Hand, is, touching the Paper;</hi> where there are manifestly these four Termes, <hi>The Hand, Touching the Pen, The Pen,</hi> and <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paper.</hi> But the danger of being deceived by Sophismes of this kind, does not seem to be so great, as that I need insist long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon them.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And though there may be Fallacy in Aequivocal Terms, yet in those that be manifestly such there is none at all; nor in <hi>Metaphors;</hi> for they professe the transferring of Names from one thing to another. Neverthelesse sometimes Aequivocalls (and those not very obscure) may deceive; as in this argumentation, <hi>It belongs to Metaphysicks, to treat of Principles; But the first Principles of all, is, that the same thing cannot both exist and not exist at the same time; and therefore it belongs to Metaphysicks to treat whether the same thing may both exist and not exist at the same time;</hi> where the Fallacy lies in the Aequivocation of the word <hi>Principle;</hi> for whereas Aristotle in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Metaphysicks sayes, that <hi>the treating of Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to primary science,</hi> he understands by <hi>Principles, Causes</hi> of things, and certaine <hi>Existences</hi> which he calls <hi>Primary;</hi> but where he sayes <hi>a Primary Proposition is a Principle,</hi> by <hi>Principle</hi> there he means the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and cause of Knowledge,</hi> that is the understanding of words, which if any man want, he is incapable of learning.</p>
               <p n="13">13 But the <hi>Captions</hi> of Sophists and Scepticks, by which they were wont of old to deride and oppose Truth, were faulty for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59147:31"/>
the most part, not in the Forme, but in the Matter of Syllogisme; and they deceived not others oftner then they were themselves deceived. For the force of that famous argument of Zeno against Motion, consisted in this Proposition, <hi>Whatsoever may be divided into parts infinite in number, the same is infinite;</hi> which he without doubt thought to be true, yet neverthelesse is false. For to be divided into <hi>infinite parts,</hi> is nothing else but to be divided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>o <hi>as many parts as any man will.</hi> But it is not necessary that a Line should have parts infinite in number, or be infinite, because I can divide and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it as often as I please; for how many parts soever I make, yet their number is finite; but because he that sayes <hi>Parts,</hi> simply, without adding <hi>how many,</hi> does not limit any number, but leaves it to the determination of the Hearer, therefore we say commonly a line may be divided infinitely; which cannot be true in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense.</p>
               <p>And thus much may suffice concerning <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> which is as it were the first Pace towards Philosophy; in which I have said as much as is necessary, to teach any man from whence all true ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation has its force. And to enlarge this Treatise with all that may be heaped together, would be as superfluous, as if one should (as I said before) give a young child Precepts for the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of him to goe; for the Art of Reasoning is not so well learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Precepts as by Practice, and by the reading of those books in which the Conclusions are all made by severe Demonstration. And so I pass on to the way of Philosophy, that is, to the Method of Study.</p>

               <p>The first Beginnings therefore of Knowledge, are the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes of Sense and Imagination; and that there be such Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes we know well enough by Nature; but to know why they be, or from what Causes they proceed, is the work of Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which consists (as is said above, in the 1. Chap. 2. Art.) in <hi>Composition,</hi> and Division or <hi>Resolution.</hi> There is therefore no Method, by which we find out the Causes of things, but is either <hi>Compositive,</hi> or <hi>Resolutive,</hi> or <hi>partly Compositive,</hi> and <hi>partly Resolutive.</hi> And the Resolutive is commonly called <hi>Analyticall</hi> Method, as the Compositive is called <hi>Syntheticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 It is common to all sorts of Method, to proceed from known things to unknown; and this is manifest from the cited Definition of Philosophy. But in Knowledge by Sense, the whole object is more known, then any part thereof; as when we see a Man, the Conception or <hi>whole Idea</hi> of that <hi>Man</hi> is first or more known, then the <hi>particular Ideas</hi> of his being <hi>figurate, animate, and rationall;</hi> that is, we first see the whole Man, and take notice of his <hi>Being,</hi> before we observe in him those other Particulars. And therefore in any knowledge of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or that any thing <hi>is,</hi> the beginning of our search is from the <hi>whole Idea;</hi> and contrarily, in our knowledge of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or of the Causes of any thing, that is, in the <hi>Sciences,</hi> we have more knowledge of the Causes of the Parts, then of the Whole. For the Cause of the Whole is compounded of the Causes of the Parts; but it is necessary that we know the things that are to be compounded, before we can know the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. Now by Parts, I do not here mean Parts of the thing it self, but Parts of its Nature; as, by the Parts of Man I do not understand his Head, his Shoulders, his Arms, &amp;c. but his Figure, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Motion, Sense, Reason, and the like; which Accidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compounded or put together, constitute the whole Nature of Man, but not the man himselfe. And this is the meaning of that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59147:33"/>
common saying, namely, that some things are more knowne to <hi>us,</hi> others more known to <hi>Nature;</hi> for I do not thinke that they which so distinguish, mean, that something is known to Nature, which is known to no man; and therefore, by those things that are more known to Us, we are to understand, things we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by our Senses, and by more known to Nature, those we acquire the knowledge of by Reason; for in this sense it is, that the <hi>Whole,</hi> that is, those things that have Universal Names, (which for brevities sake I call <hi>Universall</hi>) are more knowne to us then the <hi>Parts,</hi> that is, such things as have Names lesse Universal, (which I therefore call <hi>Singular;</hi>) and the Causes of the Parts, are more known to Nature then the Cause of the Whole; that is, Universalls then Singulars.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the Study of Philosophy men search after Science either Simply, or Indefinitely; that is, to know as much as they can, without propounding to themselves any limited question; or they enquire into the Cause of some determined Appearance, or endeavour to find out the certainty of something in question; as what is the cause of <hi>Light,</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> of <hi>Gravity,</hi> of a <hi>Figure</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the like; or in what <hi>Subiect</hi> any propounded <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> is inhaerent; or what may conduce most to the <hi>generation</hi> of some propounded <hi>Effect</hi> from many <hi>Accidents;</hi> or in what manner particular Causes ought to be compounded for the production of some certaine Effect. Now according to this variety of things in question, sometimes the <hi>Analyticall Method</hi> is to be used, and sometimes the <hi>Syntheticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 But to those that search after Science indefinitely, which consists in the knowledge of the Causes of all things, as far forth as it may be attained, and the Causes of Singular things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Causes of Universall or Simple things, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that they know the Causes of Universall things, or of such Accidents as are common to all Bodies, that is, to all Matter, before they can know the Causes of Singular things, that is, of those Accidents by which one thing is distinguished from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And againe they must know what those Universall things are, before they can know their Causes. Moreover, seeing Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall things are contained in the Nature of Singular things, the knowledge of them is to be acquired by Reason, that is, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59147:33"/>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>For example, if there be propounded a Conception or <hi>Idea</hi> of some Singular thing, as of a <hi>Square,</hi> this Square is to be resolved into a <hi>Plain, terminated with a certaine number of equall and straight lines and right angles.</hi> For by this Resolution we have these things Universall or agreeable to all Matter, namely, <hi>Line, Plain,</hi> (which containes <hi>Superficies,) Terminated, Angle, Straightness, Rectitude and Equality;</hi> and if we can find out the Causes of these, we may compound them all together into the Cause of a Square. Againe, if any man propound to himselfe the Conception of <hi>Gold,</hi> he may by Resolving come to the Ideas of <hi>Solid, Visible, Heavy,</hi> (that is, tending to the Center of the Earth, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,) and many other more Universall then Gold it selfe; and these he may Resolve againe, till he come to such things as are most Universall. And in this manner by Resolving continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we may come to know what those things are, whose Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being first known severally, and afterwards compounded, bring us to the Knowledge of Singular things. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Method of attaining to the Universall Knowledge of Things, is purely <hi>Analyticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 But the Causes of Universall things (of those at least that have any Cause) are manifest of themselues, or (as they say com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) known to Nature; so that they need no Method at all; for they have all but one Universall Cause, which is Motion. For the variety of all Figures arises out of the variety of those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which they are made; and Motion cannot be understood to have any other Cause besides Motion; nor has the Variety of those things we perceive by Sense, as of <hi>Colours, Sounds, Savours, &amp;c.</hi> any other Cause then Motion, residing partly in the Objects that work upon our Senses, and partly in our selves, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it is manifestly some kind of Motion, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without Ratiocination come to know what kind. For though many cannot understand till it be in some sort demonstrated to them, that all Mutation consists in Motion; yet this happens not from any obscurity in the thing it selfe, (for it is not intelligible that any thing can depart either from Rest, or from the Motion it has, except by Motion;) but either by having their Naturall Discourse corrupted with former Opinions received from their Masters, or else for this, that they do not at all bend their mind to the enquiring out of Truth,</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59147:34"/>6 By the Knowledge therefore of Universalls, and of their Causes (which are the first Principles by which we know the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of things,) we have in the first place their Definitions, (which are nothing but the explication of our Simple Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.) For example, he that has a true Conception of <hi>Place,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of this Definition, <hi>Place is that space which is posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or filled adaequately by some Body;</hi> and so, he that conceives <hi>Motion</hi> aright, cannot but know, that <hi>Motion is the privation of one Place, and the acquisition of another.</hi> In the next place, we have their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations or Descriptions; as, (for example,) that <hi>a Line is made by the Motion of a Point, Superficies by the Motion of a Line,</hi> and <hi>one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by another Motion, &amp;c.</hi> It remains, that we enquire, what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begets such and such Effects; as, what Motion makes a Straight line, and what a Circular; what Motion thrusts, what drawes, and by what way; what makes a thing which is seen or heard, to be seen or heard sometimes in one manner, sometimes in another. Now the Method of this kind of Enquiry, is <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> For first we are to observe what Effect a Body moved pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, when we consider nothing in it besides its Motion; and we see presently that this makes a Line, or length; next, what the Motion of a long Body produces, which we find to be Superficies; and so forwards, till we see what the Effects of Simple Motion are; and then in like manner, we are to observe what proceeds from the Addition, Multiplication, Substraction and Division of these Motions, and what Effects, what Figures, and what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties they produce; from which kind of Contemplation sprung that part of Philosophy which is called <hi>Geometry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this consideration of what is produced by Simple Motion, we are to passe to the consideration of what Effects one Body mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved worketh upon another; and because there may be Motion in all the severall parts of a Body, yet so as that the whole Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still in the same place, we must enquire, first, what Motion causeth such and such Motion in the whole, that is, when one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy invades another Body which is either at Rest, or in Motion, what way, and with what swiftnesse the invaded Body shall move; and again, what Motion this second Body will generate in a third, and so forwards. From which Contemplation shall be drawn that part of Philosophy which treats of Motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59147:34"/>In the Third place we must proceed to the Enquiry of such Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as are made by the Motion of the Parts of any Body, as, how it comes to passe, that things when they are the same, yet seeme not to be the same, but changed. And here the things we search after are sensible Qualities, such as <hi>Light, Colour, Transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, Opacity, Sound, Odour, Savour, Heat, Cold</hi> and the like; which because they cannot be known till we know the Causes of Sense it selfe, therefore the consideration of the Causes of <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting</hi> and <hi>Touching</hi> belongs to this third place; and all those qualities and Changes above mentioned are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the fourth place; which two considerations compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that part of Philosophy which is called <hi>Physiques.</hi> And in these four parts is contained whatsoever in Naturall Philosophy may be explicated by Demonstration properly so called. For if a Cause were to be rendred of Natural Appearances in special, as, what are the Motions and Influences of the heavenly Bodies, and of their parts, the reason hereof must either be drawn from the parts of the Sciences above mentioned, or no reason at all will be given, but all left to uncertaine conjecture.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Physiques</hi> we must come to <hi>Morall Philosophy;</hi> in which we are to consider the Motions of the Mind, namely <hi>Appetite, Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Love, Benevolence, Hope, Fear, Anger, Emulation, Envy, &amp;c.</hi> what Causes they have, and of what they be Causes. And the reason why these are to be considered after <hi>Physiques,</hi> is, that they have their Causes in Sense and Imagination, which are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Physicall</hi> Contemplation. Also the reason why all these Things are to be searched after in the order abovesaid, is, that Physiques cannot be understood, except we know first what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in the smallest parts of Bodies; nor such Motion of Parts, till we know what it is that makes another Body move; nor this, till we know what Simple Motion will effect. And because all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of things to sense is determined, and made to be of such and such Quality and Quantity by Compounded Motions, every one of which has a certaine degree of Velocity, and a certaine and determined way; therefore in the first place we are to search out the wayes of Motion simply, (in which Geometry consists;) next the wayes of such generated Motions as are manifest; and lastly the wayes of internal and invisible Motions, (which is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59147:35"/>
Enquiry of Naturall Philosophers.) And therefore they that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Naturall Philosophy, study in vaine, except they begin at Geometry; and such Writers or Disputers thereof, as are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Geometry, do but make their Readers and Hearers lose their time.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Morall Philosophy</hi> doe not so adhere to one another, but that they may be severed. For the Causes of the Motions of the Mind are known not onely by Ratiocination, but also by the Experience of every man that takes the paines to observe those Motions within himselfe. And therefore not only they that have attained the knowledge of the Passions and Perturbations of the Mind, by the <hi>Syntheticall Method</hi> and from the very first Principles of Philosophy, may by proceeding in the same way come to the Causes and Necessity of constituting Common-wealths, and to get the Knowledge of what is Naturall Right, and what are Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Duties; and in every kind of Government, what are the Rights of the Commonwealth, and all other Knowledge apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Civill Philosophy, for this reason, that the Principles of the Politiques consist in the Knowledge of the Motions of the Mind, and the Knowledge of these Motions from the knowledge of Sense and Imagination; but even they also that have not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the first part of Philosophy, namely <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Physiques,</hi> may notwithstanding attain the Principles of Civill Philosophy, by the <hi>Analyticall Method.</hi> For if a Question be propounded, as <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such an Action be Just or Uniust;</hi> if that <hi>Uniust</hi> be resolved into <hi>Fact against Law,</hi> and that notion of <hi>Law</hi> into the <hi>Command</hi> of him or them that have <hi>Coercive Power;</hi> and that <hi>Power</hi> be derived from the <hi>Wills</hi> of Men that constitute such Power to the end they may live in Peace, they may at last come to this, that the Appetites of Men and the Passions of their Minds are such, that unlesse they be restrained by some Power, they will alwayes be making warre upon one another; which may be known to be so by any mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that will but examine his owne Mind. And therefore from hence he may proceed by Compounding, to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Justice or Injustice of any propounded Action. So that it is manifest by what has been said, that the Method of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy to such as seek Science simply, without propounding to themselves the Solution of any Particular question, is partly <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticall,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59147:35"/>
and partly <hi>Syntheticall;</hi> namely, that which proceeds from Sense to the invention of Principles, <hi>Analyticall;</hi> and the rest <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall.</hi>

               <p n="8">8 To those that seek the Cause of some certaine and pro pounded Appearance or Effect, it happens sometimes, that they know not whether the thing whose Cause is sought after, be Matter or Body, or some Accident of a Body. For though in <hi>Geometry,</hi> when the Cause is sought of Magnitude, or Proportion, or Figure, it be certainly known that these things, namely Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, Proportion and Figure are Accidents; yet in Naturall Philosophy, where all questions are concerning the Causes of the Phantasmes of sensible things, it is not so easie to discern between the things themselves from which those Phantasmes proceed, and the Appearances of those things to the sense; which have deceived many, especially when the Phantasmes have been made by Light.

The Properties of Matter and Accidents already found out by Us by the <hi>Syntheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Method</hi> from their Definitions, are to be compared with the <hi>Idea</hi> we have before us; and if it agree with the Properties of Matter or Body, then it is a Body; otherwise it is an Accident. Seeing therefore Matter cannot by any endeavour of ours be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Made or Destroyed, or Encreased, or Diminished, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of its place, whereas that <hi>Idea</hi> Appeares, Vanishes, is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and Diminished, and Moved hither and thither at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; we may certainly conclude that it is not a Body, but an Accident onely.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59147:36"/>
must proceed in this manner. First, Matter in Generall must be divided into parts, as into Object, Medium, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient it selfe, or such other parts as seem most conformable to the thing propounded. Next, these parts are severally to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how they agree with the Definition of the Subject; and such of them as are not capable of that Accident are to be rejected. For example, If by any true Ratiocination the Sunne be found to be greater then its apparent Magnitude, then that Magnitude is not in the Sunne; If the Sunne be in one determined straight line, and one determined distance, and the Magnitude and Splendor be seen in more lines and distances then one, as it is in Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Refraction, then neither that Splendor nor apparent Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude are in the Sun it self, and therefore the Body of the Sun cannot be the Subject of that Splendor and Magnitude. And for the same reasons the Aire and other parts will be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, till at last nothing remain which can be the Subject of that Splendor and Magnitude but the Sentient it selfe. And this Method, in regard the Subject is divided into parts is <hi>Analitycall;</hi> and in regard the Properties both of the Subject and Accident are compared with the Accident concerning whose Subject the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is made, it is <hi>Syntheticall.</hi>

               <p n="10">10 But when we seek after the Cause of any propounded Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; we must in the first place get into our Mind an exact Notion or <hi>Idea</hi> of that which we call Cause, namely, that <hi>A Cause is the Summe or Aggregate of all such Accidents both in the Agents and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as concurre to the producing of the Effect propounded; all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting together, it cannot be understood but that the Effect existeth with them; or that it cannot possibly exist if any one of them be absent.</hi> This being known, in the next place we must examine singly every Accident that accompanies or praecedes the Effect, as farre forth as it seemes to conduce in any manner to the production of the same, and see whether the propounded Effect may be conceived to exist, without the existence of any of those Accidents; and by this meanes separate such Accidents as do not concurre, from such as concurre to produce the said Effect; which being done, we are to put together the concurring Accidents, and consider whether we can possibly conceive that when these are all present, the Effect propounded will not follow; and if it be evident that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59147:36"/>
the Effect will follow, then that Aggregate of Accidents is the entire Cause, otherwise not; but we must still search out and put together other Accidents. For example, if the Cause of Light be propounded to be sought out; first, we examine things without us, and find that whensoever Light appeares, there is some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Object, as it were the fountaine of Light, without which we cannot have any perception of Light; and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of that Object is necessary to the generation of Light. Next we consider the Medium, and find that unlesse it be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a certaine manner, namely, that it be <hi>transparent,</hi> though the Object remain the same, yet the Effect will not follow; and therefore the concurrence of Transparency is also necessary to the generation of Light. Thirdly, we observe our own Body, and find that by the indisposition of the Eyes, the Brain, the Nerves, and the Heart, that is, by Obstructions, Stupidity and Debility we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Light, so that a fitting disposition of the Organs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive impressions from without is likewise a necessary part of the Cause of Light. Again, of all the Accidents inhaerent in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, there is none that can conduce to the effecting of Light, but onely Action, (or a certain Motion,) which cannot be conceived to be wanting, whensoever the Effect is present; for, that any thing may shine, it is not requisite that it be of such or such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or Figure, or that the whole Body of it be moved out of the place it is in, (unlesse it may perhaps be said, that in the Sun or other Body, that which causeth Light is the light it hath in it selfe; which yet is but a trifling exception, seeing nothing is meant thereby but the Cause of Light; as if any man should say that the Cause of Light is that in the Sunne which produceth it;) it remaines therefore that the Action by which Light is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is Motion only in the parts of the Object. Which being understood, we may easily conceive what it is the Medium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, namely, the continuation of that Motion to the Eye; and lastly what the Eye and the rest of the Organs of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent contribute, namely, the continuation of the same Motion to the last Organ of Sense, the Heart. And in this manner the Cause of Light may be made up of Motion continued from the Original of the same Motion, to the Original of Vitall Motion, Light being nothing but the alteration of Vitall Motion, made by the impression upon it of Motion continued from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59147:37"/>
But I give this onely for an example, for I shall speak more at large of Light, and the generation of it in its proper place. In the mean time it is manifest, that in the searching out of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, there is need partly of the <hi>Analyticall,</hi> and partly of the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall Method;</hi> of the <hi>Analyticall,</hi> to conceive how circumstances conduce severally to the production of Effects; and of the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall,</hi> for the adding together and compounding of what they can effect singly by themselves. And thus much may serve for the Method of Invention. It remaines that I speake of the Method of Teaching, that is, of Demonstration, and of the Meanes by which we demonstrate.</p>
               <p n="11">11 In the Method of Invention the use of words consists in this, that they may serve for <hi>Marks,</hi> by which, whatsoever we have found out may be recalled to memory; for without this all our Inventions perish, nor will it be possible for us to go on from Principles beyond a Syllogisme or two, by reason of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Memory. For example, if any man by considering a Triangle set before him, should find that all its angles together taken are equall to two right angles, and that by thinking of the same tacitely, without any use of words either understood or expressed; and it should happen afterwards that another Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle unlike the former, or the same in different scituation should be offered to his consideration, he would not know readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether the same property were in this last or no; but would be forced as often as a different Triangle were brought before him (and the difference of Triangles is infinite) to begin his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation anew; which he would have no need to do if he had the use of Names; for every Universal Name denotes the conceptions we have of infinite Singular things.. Neverthelesse as I said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, they serve as <hi>Markes</hi> for the helpe of our Memory, whereby we register to our selves our own Inventions; but not as <hi>Signes</hi> by which we declare the same to others; so that a man may be a Philosopher alone by himselfe without any Master; Adam had this capacity; But to Teach, that is to Demonstrate, supposes two at the least, and Syllogisticall Speech.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And seeing Teaching is nothing but leading the Mind of him we teach, to the knowledge of our Inventions, in that Track by which we attained the same with our own Mind; therefore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59147:37"/>
the same Method that served for our Invention, will serve also for Demonstration to others, saving that we omit the first part of Method which proceeded from the Sense of Things to Universal Principles; which because they are Principles, cannot be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated; and seeing they are known by Nature (as was said above in the 5th. Article) they need no Demonstration, though they need Explication. The whole Method therefore of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>Syntheticall,</hi> consisting of that order of Speech, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins from Primary or most Universall Propositions, which are manifest of themselves, and proceeds by a perpetuall composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Propositions into Syllogismes, till at last the Learner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the truth of the Conclusion sought after.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Now such Principles are nothing but Definitions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are two sorts; one, of Names that signifie such things as have some conceiveable Cause, and another of such Names as signifie things of which we can conceive no Cause at all. Names of the former kind are, <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter, Quantity</hi> or <hi>Extension, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and whatsoever is common to all Matter. Of the second kind are, <hi>such a Body, such and so great Motion, so great Magnitude, such Figure,</hi> and whatsoever we can distinguish one Body from another by. And Names of the former kind are well enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, when by Speech as short as may be, we raise in the Mind of the Hearer perfect and cleer Ideas or Conceptions of the Things named, as when we Define Motion to be <hi>the leaving of one place, and the acquiring of another continually;</hi> for though no Thing Moved, nor any Cause of Motion be in that Definition, yet at the hearing of that Speech, there will come into the Mind of the Hearer an <hi>Idea</hi> of Motion cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er enough. But Definitions of things which may be understood to have some Cause, must consist of such Names as expresse the Cause or Manner of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as when we Define a Circle to be a Figure made by the circumduction of a straight line in a plaine, &amp;c. Besides Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there is no other Proposition that ought to be called Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, or (according to severe truth) be received into the number of Principles. For those <hi>Axiomes</hi> of <hi>Euclide,</hi> seeing they may be demonstrated are no Principles of Demonstration, though they have by the consent of all Men gotten the authority of Principles, because they need not be Demonstrated. Also those <hi>Petitious</hi> or <hi>Postulata</hi> (as they call them) though they be Principles
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59147:38"/>
yet they are not Principles of Demonstration, but of Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction onely; that is, not of Science, but of Power; or (which is all one) not of <hi>Theoremes,</hi> which are Speculations, but of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes,</hi> which belong to Practice, or the doing of something. But as for those common received Opinions, <hi>Nature abhorres Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Nature doth nothing in Vaine,</hi> and the like, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident in themselves, nor at all to be demonstrated, and which are oftner false then true, they are much lesse to be ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Principles.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to Definitions, The reason why I say that the Cause and Generation of such things as have any Cause or Generation, ought to enter into their Definitions, is this. The End of Science, is the Demonstration of the Causes and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Things; which if they be not in the Definitions, they cannot be found in the Conclusion of the first Syllogisme that is made from those Definitions; and if they be not in the first Conclusion, they will not be found in any further Conclusion deduced from that; and therefore by proceeding in this manner we shall never come to Science; which is against the scope and intention of Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Now seeing Definitions (as I have said) are Principles or Primary Propositions, they are therefore Speeches; and seeing they are used for the raising of an <hi>Idea</hi> of some Thing in the mind of the Learner, whensoever that Thing has a Name, the Definition of it can be nothing but the Explication of that Name by Speech; and if that Name be given it for some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Conception, the Definition is nothing but a Resolution of that Name into its most Universall parts. As when we define Man, saying, <hi>Man is a Body Animated, Sentient, Rationall,</hi> those Names <hi>Body Animated, &amp;c.</hi> are parts of that whole Name <hi>Man;</hi> so that Definitions of this kind alwayes consist of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> the former Names being all till the last, <hi>Generall;</hi> and the last of all, <hi>Difference.</hi> But if any Name be the most Universall in its kind, then the Definition of it cannot consist of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> but is to be made by such circumlocution as best expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the force of that Name. Again, it is possible, and happens often that the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference</hi> are put together, and yet make no Definition; as these Words <hi>a Straight Line</hi> containe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59147:38"/>
both the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference;</hi> but are not a Definition, unlesse we should thinke a Straight Line may be thus defined, <hi>A Straight Line is a Straight Line;</hi> and yet if there were added another Name consisting of different Words, but signifying the same thing which these signifie, then these might be the Definition of that Name. From what has been said it may be understood how a Definition ought to be defined, namely, <hi>That it is a Proposition, whose Praedicate Resolves the Subiect, when it may, and when it may not, it exemplifies the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 The Properties of a Definition are,</p>
               <p>First, that it takes away Aequivocation, as also all that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Distinctions, which are used by such as think they may learn Philosophy by Disputation. For the Nature of a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to define, that is, to determine the signification of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Name, and to pare from it all other Signification besides what is contained in the Definition it selfe; and therefore one Definition does as much, as all the Distinctions (how many soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) that can be used about the Name defined.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it gives an Universall Notion of the thing defined, representing a certaine Universall Picture thereof, not to the Eye, but to the Mind. For as when one paints a Man, he paints the image of some Man; so he that defines the Name <hi>Man,</hi> makes a Representation of some Man to the mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is not necessary to dispute whether Definitions are to be admitted or no. For when a Master is instructing his Scholar, if the Scholar understand all the parts of the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, which are Resolved in the Definition, and yet will not admit of the Definition, there needs no further Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, it being all one as if he refused to be taught. But if he understand nothing, then certainely the Definition is faulty; for the nature of a Definition consists in this, that it exhibit a cleare Idea of the thing defined; and Principles are either known by themselves, or else they are not Principles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That in Philosophy, Definitions are before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Names. For in teaching Philosophy, the first beginning is from Definitions, and all progression in the same till we come to the Knowledge of the thing compounded, is Compositive. Seeing therefore Definition is the explication of a Compounded Name
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59147:39"/>
by Resolution, and the progression is from the parts to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, Definitions must be understood before Compounded Names; nay when the Names of the parts of any Speech be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, is it not necessary that the Definition should be a Name Compounded of them. For example, when these Names, <hi>Aequilaterall, Quadrilaterall, Right-angled,</hi> are sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it is not necessary in Geometry that there should be at all such a Name as <hi>Square;</hi> for defined Names are received in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy for brevities sake onely.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, That Compounded Names which are defined one way in some one part of Philosophy, may in another part of the same be otherwise defined; as a <hi>Parabola</hi> and an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> have one Definition in Geometry, and another in Rhetorique; for Definitions are instituted and serve for the understanding of the Doctrine which is treated of. And therefore as in one part of Philosophy, a Definition may have in it some one fit Name for the more briefe explanation of some proposition in Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; so it may have the same liberty in other parts of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; for the use of Names is particular (even where many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the setling of them) and arbitrary.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, That no Name can be defined by any one Word; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no one Word is sufficient for the Resolving of one or more words.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That a defined Name ought not to be repeated in the Definition. For a defined Name, is the whole Compound, and a Definition is the Resolution of that Compound into parts; but no Totall can be part of it selfe.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Any two Definitions that may be compounded into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, produce a Conclusion; which because it is derived from Principles, that is, from Definitions, is said to be <hi>Demonstrated;</hi> and the Derivation or Composition it selfe is called a <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In like manner, if a Syllogisme be made of two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof one is a Definition, the other a Demonstrated Conclusion, or neither of them is a Definition, but both former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated, that Syllogisme is also called a Demonstration, and so successively. The Definition therefore of a Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, <hi>A</hi> DEMONSTRATION <hi>is a Syllogism or Series of Syllogisms derived and continued from the Definitions of Names, to the last Conclusion.</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59147:39"/>
And from hence it may be understood, that all true Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which taketh its beginning from true Principles, produceth Science, and is true Demonstration. For as for the Originall of the Name, although that which the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latines <hi>Demonstratio</hi> was understood by them for that sort onely of Ratiocination, in which by the describing of certaine Lines and Figures, they placed the thing they were to prove, as it were before mens Eyes, which is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or to <hi>shew</hi> by the Figure; yet they seem to have done it for this reason, that unlesse it were in Geometry (in which only there is place for such Figures) there was no Ratiocination certaine, and ending in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their Doctrines concerning all other things being nothing but Controversie and Clamour; which neverthelesse hapned not because the Truth to which they pretended could not be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident without Figures, but because they wanted true Principles, from which they might derive their Ratiocination; and therefore there is no reason but that if true Definitions were praemised in all sorts of Doctrines, the Demonstrations also would be true.</p>
               <p n="17">17 It is proper to Methodical Demonstration,</p>
               <p>First, That there be a true Succession of one Reason to another, according to the Rules of Syllogizing delivered above.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Praemisses of all Syllogismes be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the first Definitions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That after Definitions, he that Teaches or Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates any thing, proceed in the same Method by which he found it out; namely, that in the first place those things be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated which immediately succeed to Universal Definitions (in which is contained that part of Philosophy which is called <hi>Philosophia Prima.)</hi> Next, those things which may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Simple Motion (in which Geometry consists.) After Geome try, such things as may be taught or shewed by manifest Action, that is, by Thrusting from, or Pulling towards. And after these, the Motion or Mutation of the invisible parts of Things, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Sense &amp; Imagination &amp; of the internal Passions, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those of Men, in which are comprehended the Grounds of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Duties, or Civil Philosophy; which takes up the last place. And that this Method ought to be kept in all sorts of Philosophy, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from hence, that such things as I have said are to be taught
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59147:40"/>
last cannot be demonstrated, till such as are propounded to be first treated of, be fully understood. Of which Method no other Example can be given, but that Treatise of the Elements of Philosophy, which I shall begin in the next Chapter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the worke.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Besides those <hi>Paralogismes,</hi> whose fault lies either in the Falsity of the Praemisses, or the want of true Composition, of which I have spoken in the praecedent Chapter, there are two more which are frequent in Demonstration; one whereof is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Petitio Principii;</hi> the other is the supposing of a <hi>False Cause;</hi> and these do not onely deceive Unskilfull Learners but sometimes Masters themselves, by making them take that for well demonstrated which is not demonstrated at all. <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> is when the Conclusion to be proved, is disguised in other Words, and put for the Definition or Principle from whence it is to be demonstrated; and thus by putting for the Cause of the Thing sought, either the Thing it selfe or some Effect of it, they make a Circle in their Demonstration. As for example, He that would Demonstrate that the Earth stands still in the Center of the World, and should suppose the Earths Gravity to be the Cause thereof, and define Gravity to be a quality by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavy Body tends towards the Center of the World, would lose his labour; for the question is, What is the Cause of that quality in the Earth; and therefore he that supposes Gravity to be the Cause, puts the Thing it selfe for its own Cause.</p>
               <p>Of a <hi>False Cause</hi> I find this example in a certaine Treatise where the thing to be demonstrated is the Motion of the Earth. He begins therefore with this, that seeing the Earth and the Sun are not alwayes in the same scituation, it must needs be that one of them be locally moved; which is true; next he affirms that the Vapours which the Sun raises from the Earth and Sea are by reason of this Motion necessarily moved; which also is true; from whence he infers the Winds are made, and this may passe for granted; and by these Winds he sayes the Waters of the Sea are moved, and by their Motion the bottome of the Sea, as if it were beaten forwards, moves round; and let this also be granted; wherefore he concludes, the Earth is moved; which is neverthelesse is a Paralogisme. For if that wind were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59147:40"/>
the Cause why the Earth was from the beginning moved round, and the Motion either of the Sunne or the Earth were the Cause of that Wind, then the Motion of the Sunne or the Earth was before the Wind it self; and if the Earth were Moved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind was made, then the Wind could not be the cause of the Earths revolution; but if the Sunne were Moved, and the Earth stand still, then it is manifest the Earth might remain Unmoved notwithstanding that Wind; and therefore that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not made by the Cause which he alledgeth. But Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes of this kind are very frequent among the Writers of <hi>Physiques,</hi> though none can be more elaborate then this in the Example given.</p>
               <p n="19">19 It may to some men seem pertinent to treat in this place of that Art of the Geometricians, which they call <hi>Logistica,</hi> that is, the Art, by which, from supposing the thing in question to be true, they proceed by Ratiocination, till either they come to something knowne, by which they may demonstrate the truth of the thing sought for; or to something which is impossible, from whence they collect that to be false which they supposed true. But this Art cannot be explicated here, for this reason, that the Method of it can neither be practised, nor understood unlesse by such as are well versed in Geometry; and among Geometricians themselves, they that have most Theoremes in readiness, are the most ready in the use of this <hi>Logistica;</hi> so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not a distinct thing from Geometry it selfe; for there are in the Method of it three parts; the first whereof consists in the finding out of Equality betwixt known and unknown things, which they call Equation; and this Equation cannot be found out but by such as know perfectly the Nature, Properties and Transpositions of Proportion, as also the Addition, Substracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Multiplication, and Division of Lines and Superficies, and the Extraction of Roots; which are the parts of no meane Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician. The Second is, when an Equation is found, to be able to judge whether the Truth or Falsity of the Question may be deduced from it or no; which yet requires greater Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And the third is, when such an Equation is found, as is fit for the solution of the Question, to know how to Resolve the same in such manner, that the Truth or Falsity may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59147:41"/>
manifestly appeare, which in hard questions cannot be done without the Knowledge of the Nature of Crooked-lined Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; but he that understands readily the Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of these, is a Compleat Geometrician. It happens besides, that for the finding out of Equations there is no certaine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but he is best able to do it, that has the best Naturall Wit.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Teaching of Naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, I cannot begin better (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn) then from <hi>Privation;</hi> that is, from feigning the World to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated. But if such annihilation of all things be supposed, it may perhaps be asked, what would remain for any Man (whom onely I except from this Universal annihilation of things) to consider as the Subject of Philosophy, or at all to reason upon; or what to give Names unto for Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sake.</p>
               <p>I say therefore there would remain to that Man Ideas of the World, and of all such Bodies as he had, before their annihilation, seen with his eies, or perceived by any other Sense; that is to say, the Memory and Imagination of Magnitudes, Motions, Sounds, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, &amp;c. as also of their order &amp; parts. All w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> things though they be nothing but Ideas &amp; Phantasms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hapning internally to him that imagineth; yet they will appear as if they were externall, and not at all depending upon any power of the Mind. And these are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59147:42"/>
the things to which he would give Names, and substract them from, and compound them with one another. For seeing that after the destruction of all other things, I suppose Man still remaining, and namely that he thinkes, imagines, and remembers, there can be nothing for him to thinke of but what is Past; Nay, if we do but observe diligently what it is we doe when we consider and reason, we shall find, that though all things be still remaining in the world, yet we compute nothing but our own Phantasmes. For when we calculate the magnitude and motions of Heaven or Earth, we doe not ascend into Heaven that we may divide it into parts, or measure the motions thereof, but we doe it sitting still in our Closets or in the Darke. Now things may be considered, that is, be brought into Account, either as internal Accidents of our Mind, in which manner we consider them when the question is about some Faculty of the Mind; or as Species of external things, not as really existing, but appearing onely to exist, or to have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Us. And in this manner we are now to consider them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If therefore we remember, or have a Phantasme of any thing that was in the world before the supposed annihilation of the same; and consider, not that the thing was such or such, but onely that it had a Being without the Mind, we have presently a Conception of that we call <hi>Space:</hi> an Imaginary Space indeed, because a meere Phantasme, yet that very thing which all men call so. For no man calls it Space for being already filled, but because it may be filled; nor does any man think Bodies carry their Places away with them, but that the same Space contains sometimes one, sometimes another Body; which could not be if Space should alwayes accompany the Body which is once in it. And this is of it selfe so manifest, that I should not thinke it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any explaining at all, but that I finde Space to be falsely defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by certaine Philosophers, who inferre from thence, One, that the world is Infinite; for taking <hi>Space</hi> to be the Extension of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and thinking Extension may encrease continually, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres that Bodies may be infinitely Extended; and Another from the same Definition concludes rashly, that it is impossible even to God himselfe to create more Worlds then one; for if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World were to be created, he sayes, that seeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without this world, and therefore (according to his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59147:42"/>
Definition) no Space, that new world must be placed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but in nothing nothing can be placed; which he affirms onely, without shewing any reason for the same; whereas the contrary is the truth: for more cannot be put into a Place allready filled, so much is Empty Space fitter then that which is Full for the receiving of new Bodies. Having therefore spoken thus much for these mens sakes, and for theirs that assent to them, I return to my purpose, and define <hi>Space</hi> thus, SPACE <hi>is the Phantasme of a Thing existing without the Mind simply;</hi> that is to say, that Phantasme, in which we consider no other Accident, but onely that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears without us.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As a Body leaves a Phantasme of its Magnitude in the mind, so also a Moved Body leaves a Phantasme of its Motion, namely an Idea of that Body passing out of one Space into another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall succession. And this Idea or Phantasme, is that which (without receding much from the common opinion, or from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> Definition) I call <hi>Time.</hi> For seeing all men confesse a Yeare to be Time, and yet do not think a Year to be the Accident or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of any Body, they must needs confesse it to be, not in the things without Us, but only in the Thought of the Mind. So when they speake of the Times of their Predecessors, they do not think after their Predecessors are gone, that their Times can be any where else then in the Memory of those that remember them. And as for those that say, Dayes, Years and Moneths are the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sunne and Moon, seeing it is all one to say, Motion <hi>Past</hi> and Motion <hi>Destroyed,</hi> and that <hi>Future</hi> Motion is the same with Motion which <hi>Is not yet begun,</hi> they say, that which they do not meane, that there neither is, nor has been, nor shall be any Time: for of whatsoever it may be said, <hi>It has been</hi> or <hi>It shall be,</hi> of the same also it might have been said heretofore, or may be said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>It is.</hi> What then can Dayes, Moneths and Yeares be, but the Names of such Computations made in our Mind? <hi>Time</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Phantasme, but a Phantasme of Motion, for if we would know by what Moments Time passes away, we make use of some Motion or other, as of the Sun, of a Clock, of the sand in an Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse, or we mark some Line upon which we imagine something to be Moved, there being no other means by which we can take notice of any Time at all. And yet when I say <hi>Time</hi> is a Phantasme
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59147:43"/>
of Motion, I doe not say this is sufficient to define it by; for this word <hi>Time</hi> comprehends the notion of <hi>Former</hi> and <hi>Later,</hi> or of <hi>Succession</hi> in the motion of a Body, in as much as it is first <hi>Here</hi> then <hi>There.</hi> Wherefore a compleat Definition of <hi>Time</hi> is such as this, TIME <hi>is the Phantasme of Before and After in Motion;</hi> which agrees with this Definition of <hi>Aristotle, Time is the Number of Motion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Former and Later;</hi> for that Numbring is an act of the Mind; and therefore it is all one to say, <hi>Time is the Number of Motion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Former and Later;</hi> and <hi>Time is a Phantasme of Motion Numbred.</hi> But that other Definition, <hi>Time is the Measure of Motion,</hi> is not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; for we measure Time by Motion and not Motion by Time.</p>
               <p n="4">4 One Space is called <hi>Part</hi> of another Space, and one Time <hi>Part</hi> of another Time, when this containes that and something besides. From whence it may be collected, that nothing can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called a PART, but that which is compared with something that contains it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And therefore to <hi>make parts,</hi> or to <hi>Part</hi> or DIVIDE Space or <hi>Time,</hi> is nothing else but to consider One and Another within the same; so that if any Man <hi>Divide</hi> Space or Time, the diverse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions he has are more by one, then the Parts he makes; for his first Conception is of that which is to be divided, then of some Part of it, and again of some other Part of it, and so forwards as long as he goes on in Dividing.</p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, that here by <hi>Division,</hi> I doe not mean the severing or pulling asunder of one Space or Time from another (for does any man think that one Hemisphere may be separated from the other Hemisphere, or the first Hour from the second?) but Diversity of Consideration; so that Division is not made by the operation of the Hands but of the Mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6 When Space or Time is considered among other Spaces or Times, it is said to be ONE, namely <hi>One of them;</hi> for except One Space might be added to another, and substracted from another Space, and so of Time, it would be sufficient to say Space or Time simply, and superfluous to say One Space or One Time, if it could not be conceived that there were another. The common Definition of <hi>One,</hi> namely, that <hi>One is that which is Undivided,</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to an absurd Consequence; for it may thence be inferred, that whatsoever is Divided, is many things, that is, that every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59147:43"/>
thing, is Divided Things, which is Insignificant.</p>
               <p n="7">7 NUMBER is. One and One, or One One and One, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; namely One and One make the Number <hi>Two,</hi> and One One and One, the Number <hi>Three;</hi> and so are all other Numbers made; which is all one as if we should say, <hi>Number is Unities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 To COMPOUND Space of Spaces, or Time of Times, is first to Consider them one after another, and then altogether as One; as if one should reckon first the Head, the Feet, the Armes and the Body severally, and then for the account of them all together put <hi>Man.</hi> And that which is so put for all the severalls of which it consists, is called the WHOLE; and those severalls, when by the Division of the Whole, they come again to be considered singly, are parts thereof; and therefore the <hi>Whole,</hi> and <hi>all the Parts taken together,</hi> are the same thing. And as I noted above, that in <hi>Division</hi> it is not necessary to pull the Parts asunder; so in <hi>Composition</hi> it is to be understood, that for the making up of a whole there is no need of putting the Parts together, so as to make them touch one another, but onely of collecting them into one summe in the Mind. For thus all Men being considered together, make up the Whole of Mankind, though never so much disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Time and Place; and twelve Hours, though the hours of severall dayes, may be Compounded into one Number of Twelve.</p>
               <p n="9">9 This being well understood, it is manifest, that nothing can rightly be called a Whole, that is not conceived to be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Parts, and that it may be divided into parts; so that if we deny that a thing has parts, we deny the same to be a Whole. For example, if we say the soul can have no Parts, we affirme that no soul can be a Whole soul. Also it is manifest, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has Parts till it be Divided; and when a Thing is Divided, the Parts are onely so many as the Division makes them. Againe, that a Part of a Part is a Part of the Whole; &amp; thus any Part of the Number <hi>Four,</hi> as <hi>Two,</hi> is a Part of the Number <hi>Eight;</hi> for <hi>Four</hi> is made of <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Two;</hi> but <hi>Eight</hi> is compounded of <hi>Two, Two</hi> and <hi>Four;</hi> and therefore <hi>Two</hi> which is a Part of the Part <hi>Four,</hi> is also a Part of the whole <hi>Eight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Two Spaces are said to be CONTIGUOUS, when there is no other Space betwixt them. But two Times, betwixt which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59147:44"/>
there is no other Time, are called IMMEDIATE, A—B—C as AB, BC. And any two Spaces as well as Times are said to be CONTINUALL, when they have one common part, A—B—C—D as AC, BD, where the part BC is common; and more Spaces and Times are Continual, when every two which are next one another are Continual.</p>
               <p n="11">11 That Part which is between two other Parts, is called a MEAN; &amp; that which is not between two other parts, an EXTREME. And of Extremes, that which is first reckoned is the BEGINNING, and that which last, the END; and all the Means together taken, are the WAY. Also <hi>Extreme Parts</hi> and <hi>Limits</hi> are the same thing. And from hence it is manifest, that <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> depend upon the order in which we number them; and that to <hi>Terminate</hi> or <hi>Limit</hi> Space and Time, is the same thing with <hi>imagining their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and End;</hi> as also that every thing is FINITE or INFINITE, acording as we imagine or not imagine it <hi>Limited</hi> or <hi>Terminated</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way; and that the <hi>Limits</hi> of any Number are <hi>Unities,</hi> and of these, that which is the first in our Numbering is the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and that which we number last, is the <hi>End.</hi> When we say Number is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> we mean only that no Number is expressed; for when we speak of the Numbers <hi>Two, Three, a Thousand, &amp;c.</hi> they are always <hi>Finite.</hi> But when no more is said but this, <hi>Number is Infinite,</hi> it is to be understood as if it were said, this Name <hi>Number</hi> is an <hi>Indefinite</hi> Name.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Space or Time is said to be <hi>Finite in Power,</hi> or <hi>Terminable,</hi> when there may be assigned a Number of finite Spaces or Times, as of Paces or Hours, than which there can be no greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the same measure, in that Space or Time; and <hi>Infinite in Power</hi> is that Space or Time, in which a greater Number of the said Paces or Hours may be assigned, than any Number that can be given. But we must note, that although in that Space or Time which is Infinite in Power, there may be numbered more Paces or Hours then any number that can be assigned, yet their number will alwayes be Finite; for every Number is Finite. And therefore his Ratiocination was not good, that undertaking to prove the World to be Finite, reasoned thus; <hi>If the world be Infinite, then there may be taken in it some Part which is distant from us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Paces: But no such Part can be taken; wherefore the</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59147:44"/>
                  <hi>world is not infinite;</hi> because that Consequence of the Major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is false; for in an Infinite space, whatsoever we take, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in our Mind, the distance of the same from us is a Finite space; for in the very designing of the place thereof, we put an End to that space, of whch we our selves are the Beginning, and whatsoever any man with his Mind cuts off both wayes from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, he determines the same, that is, he makes it Finite.</p>
               <p>Of Infinite Space or Time, it cannot be said that it is a <hi>Whole,</hi> or <hi>One;</hi> not a <hi>Whole,</hi> because not compounded of Parts; for seeing Parts, how many soever they be, are severally Finite, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so when they are all put together make a whole Finite; Nor <hi>One,</hi> because nothing can be said to be One, except there be Another to compare it with; but it cannot be conceived that there are two Spaces, or two Times Infinite. Lastly, when we make question whether the World be Finite or Infinite, we have nothing in our Minde answering to the Name <hi>World;</hi> for whatsoever we Imagine, is therefore Finite, though our Computation reach the fixed Stars, or the ninth or tenth, nay, the thousanth Sphere. The meaning of the Question is this onely, whether God has actually made so great an Addition of Body to Body, as we are able to make of Space to Space.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And therefore that which is commonly said, that Space and Time may be divided Infinitely, is not to be so understood, as if there might be any Infinite or Eternal Division; but rather to be taken in this sense, <hi>Whatsover is Divided, is divided into such Parts as may again be Divided;</hi> or thus, <hi>The Least Divisible thing is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> or as Geometricians have it, <hi>No Quantity is so small, but a Less may be taken;</hi> which may easily be demonstrated in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Let any Space or Time (that which was thought to be the Least Divisible) be divided into two equal Parts A and B. I say ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, as A, may be divided again. For suppose the Part A to be contiguous to the Part B of one side, and of the other side to some other Space equal to B. This whole Space therefore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater then the Space given) is divisible. Wherefore if it be divided into two equal Parts, the Part in the middle, which is A, will be also divided into two equal Parts; and therefore A was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving understood what Imaginary Space is, in which we supposed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining without us, but all those things to be destroyed that by existing heretofore left Images of themselves in our Minds; let us now suppose some one of those things to be placed again in the World, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated anew. It is necessary therefore that this new created or replaced thing do not onely fill some part of the Space above-mentioned, or be coincident and coextended with it, but also, that it have no dependance upon our thought. And this is that which for the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59147:45"/>
Extension of it we commonly call <hi>Body;</hi> and because it depends not upon our Thought, we say is <hi>a thing subsisting of itself;</hi> as also <hi>existing,</hi> because without Us; and lastly, it is called the <hi>Subject,</hi> because it is so placed in and <hi>subjected</hi> to Imaginary Space, that it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Reason, as well as perceived by Sense. The Definition therefore of <hi>Body</hi> may be this, A BODY <hi>is that which having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon our Thought is coincident or coextended with some part of Space.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But what an <hi>Accident</hi> is, cannot so easily be explained by any Definition, as by Examples. Let us imagine therefore that a Body fills any Space, or is coextended with it, that Coextention is not the coextended Body; And in like manner, let us imagine that the same Body is removed out of its place, that Removing is not the removed Body; Or let us think the same not removed, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removing or Rest, is not the resting Body. What then are these things? They are <hi>Accidents</hi> of that Body. But the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>What is an Accident;</hi> which is an Enquiry after that which we know already, and not that which we should enquire after. For who does not alwayes and in the same manner understand him that sayes any thing is Extended, or Moved, or not Moved? But most men will have it be said that <hi>an Accident is something,</hi> namely some part of a natural thing, when indeed it is no part of the same. To satisfie these men, as well as may be, they answer best that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine an <hi>Accident</hi> to be <hi>the Manner by which any Body is conceived;</hi> which is all one as if they should say, <hi>An Accident is that faculty of any Body by which it works in us a Conception of itself.</hi> Which Definition though it be not an Answer to the Question propounded, yet it is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that Question which should have been propounded, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>whence does it happen that one part of any Body appears here, another part there?</hi> For this is well answered thus, <hi>It happens from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of that Body.</hi> Or, <hi>How comes it to pass that the whole Body by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is seen now here now there?</hi> and the answer will be, <hi>By reason of its Motion.</hi> Or lastly, <hi>Whence is it that any Body possesseth the same space for sometime?</hi> And the answer will be, <hi>because it is not moved.</hi> For if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Name of a Body, that is, concerning a Concrete Name, it be asked, <hi>what is it?</hi> the answer must be made by Definition; for the Question is concerning the signification of the Name. But if it be asked concerning an Abstract Name, <hi>what is it?</hi> the Cause
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59147:46"/>
is demanded why a thing appears so or so. As if it be asked, <hi>what is Hard?</hi> The Answer will be, Hard is that, whereof no Part gives place, but when the Whole gives place. But if it be demanded, <hi>what is Hardness?</hi> A Cause must be shewn why a Part does not give place except the Whole give place. Wherefore I define an ACCIDENT to be <hi>the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ner of our conception of Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 When an <hi>Accident</hi> is said <hi>to be in a Body,</hi> it is not so to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as if any thing were conteined in that Body; as if, for example, Redness were in Blood, in the same manner, as Blood is in a bloody cloth, that is, as a Part in the Whole; for so an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would be a Body also. But as Magnitude, or Rest, or Motion, is in that which is Great, or which Resteth, or which is Moved (which how it is to be understood, every man understands) so also it is to be understood that every other Accident <hi>is in</hi> its Subject. And this also is explicated by <hi>Aristotle</hi> no otherwise then negatively, namely, that <hi>An Accident is in its Subject, not as any part thereof, but so as that it may be away, the Subject still remaining;</hi> which is right, saving that there are certain Accidents which can never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish except the Body perish also; for no Body can be conceived to be without Extension, or without Figure. All other Accidents, which are not common to all Bodies, but peculiar to some onely, as <hi>To be at Rest, to be Moved, Colour, Hardness,</hi> and the like, do perish continually, and are succeeded by others; yet so, as that the Body never perisheth. And as for the opinion that some may have, that all other Accidents are not in their Bodies in the same manner that Extension, Motion, Rest, or Figure are in the same; for example, that Colour, Heat, Odour, Vertue, Vice and the like, are otherwise in them, and (as they say) <hi>inherent;</hi> I desire they would suspend their judgement for the present, and expect a little, till it be found out by Ratiocination, whether these very Accidents are not also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Motions, either of the Mind of the perceiver; or of the Bodies themselves which are perceived; for in the search of this, a great part of Naturall Philosophy consists.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Extension of a Body, is the same thing with the MAGNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUDE of it, or that which some call <hi>Real Space.</hi> But this <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> does not depend upon our Cogitation, as Imaginary Space doth; for this is an Effect of our Imagination, but <hi>Magnitude</hi> is the Cause of it; this is an Accident of the Mind, that of a Body exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Mind.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59147:46"/>5 That Space (by which word I here understand Imaginary Space) which is coincident with the Magnitude of any Body, is called the PLACE of that Body; and the Body it self is that which we call the <hi>Thing Placed.</hi> Now <hi>Place,</hi> and the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude</hi> of the Thing Placed differ: First in this, that a Body keeps alwayes the same <hi>Magnitude</hi> both when it is at Rest, and when it is Moved; but when it is Moved, it does not keep the same <hi>Place.</hi> Secondly, in this, that <hi>Place</hi> is a Phantasme of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of such and such Quantity and Figure; but <hi>Magnitude</hi> is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Accident of every Body; for one Body may at several times have several Places, but has always one and the same Magnitude. Thirdly, in this, that <hi>Place</hi> is nothing out of the Mind, nor <hi>Magnitude</hi> any thing within it. And lastly, <hi>Place</hi> is feigned Extension but <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude</hi> true Extension, and a Placed Body is not Extension, but a Thing Extended. Besides, <hi>Place is Immoveable;</hi> for seeing that which is Moved, is understood to be carried from Place to Place, if Place were Moved, it would also be carried from Place to Place, so that one Place must have another Place, and that Place another Place, and so on infinitely, which is ridiculous. And as for those, that by making <hi>Place</hi> to be of the same Nature with <hi>Real Space,</hi> would from thence maintain it to be Immoveable, they also make Place (though they do not perceive they make it so) to be a meer Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme. For whilest One affirms that Place is therefore said to be Immoveable, because Space in general is considered there; if he had remembred that nothing is General or Universal besides Names or Signes, he would easily have seen that that Space which he sayes is considered in general, is nothing but a Phantasme in the Mind or the Memory, of a Body of such Magnitude and such Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. And whilest another sayes, Real Space is made Immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Understanding; as when under the Superficies of running water, we imagine other and other water to come by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual succession, that Superficies fixed there by the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the <hi>Immoveable Place</hi> of the River, what else does he make it to be but a Phantasm, though he doe it obscurely, and in perplexed words? Lastly, the nature of <hi>Place</hi> does not consist in the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Ambient,</hi> but in <hi>Solid Space;</hi> for the whole Placed Body is coextended with its whole Place, and every part of it with every answering part of the same Place; but seeing every
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59147:47"/>
Placed Body is a Solid thing, it cannot be understood to be coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Superficies. Besides, how can any whole Body be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unless all its parts be moved together with it? Or how can the internall Parts of it be Moved, but by leaving their Place? But the internal Parts of a body cannot leave the Superficies of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part contiguous to it; and therefore it followes, that if Place be the Superficies of the Ambient, then the parts of a Body Moved, that is Bodies moved, are not Moved.</p>

               <p n="7">7 <hi>Here, There, In the Country, In the City,</hi> and other the like Names by which answer is made to the question <hi>Where is it,</hi> are not properly Names of Place, nor doe they of themselves bring into the mind the Place that is sought; for <hi>Here</hi> and <hi>There</hi> signifie nothing, unlesse the thing be shewn at the same time with the finger or something else, but when the Eye of him that seeks, is by pointing, or some other signe directed to the thing sought, the Place of it is not hereby defined by him that answers, but found out by him that askes the question. Now such Shewings as are made by words onely, as when we say, <hi>In the Countrey,</hi> or <hi>In the City,</hi> are some of greater latitude then others, as when we say <hi>In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, In the City, In such a Street, In a House, In the Chamber, In Bed,</hi> &amp;c. For these do by little and little direct the Seeker neerer to the proper Place; &amp; yet they do not determine the same, but onely restrain it to a lesser Space, &amp; signifie no more then that the Place of the Thing is within a certain Space designed by those Words, as a Part is in the Whole. And all such Names (by which answer is made to the question <hi>Where</hi>) have for their highest <hi>Genus</hi> the Name <hi>Somewhere.</hi> From whence it may be understood, that whatsoever is Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, is in some Place properly so called, which Place is part of that greater Space that is signified by some of these Names, <hi>In the Countrey, In the City,</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p n="8">8 A Body, and the Magnitude, and the Place thereof, are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one and the same act of the Mind; for, to divide an Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body, and the Extension thereof, and the Idea of that Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is Place, is the same with dividing any one of them; because they are coincident, and it cannot be done but by the Mind, that is by the Division of Space. From whence it is manifest, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59147:47"/>
neither Two Bodies can be together in the same Place, nor One Body be in Two Places at the same Time. Not Two Bodies in the same Place; because when a Body that fills its whole Place is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Two, the Place it self is divided into Two also, so that there will be Two Places, Nor One Body in Two Places; for, the Place that a Body fills being divided into Two, the Placed Body will be also divided into Two, (for, as I said, a Place and the Body that fills that Place are divided both together) and so there will be two Bodies.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Two Bodies are said to be <hi>Contiguous</hi> to one another, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual,</hi> in the same manner as Spaces are; namely, <hi>those are Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, between which there is no Space.</hi> Now by Space I understand here as formerly an Idea or Phantasme of a Body. Wherefore, though between two Bodies there be put no other Body, and consequently no Magnitude, or (as they call it) Real Space, yet if another Body may be put between them, that is, if there intercede any imagined Space which may receive another Body, then those Bodies are not Contiguous. And this is so easie to be understood, that I should wonder at some men, who being otherwise skilful enough in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, are of a different opinion, but that I finde that most of those that affect Metaphysical subtilties, wander from Truth, as if they were led out of their way by an <hi>Ignis Fatuus.</hi> For can any man that has his natural Senses, think that two Bodies must therefore necessarily Touch one another, because no other Body is between them? Or that there can be no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> because <hi>Vacuum</hi> is nothing, or as they call it, <hi>Non Ens?</hi> Which is as childish, as if one should reason thus; No Man can Fast, because to Fast is to eat Nothing; but Nothing cannot be eaten. <hi>Continual, are any two Bodies that have a common part; and more then two are Continual, when every two that are next to one another, are continual.</hi>

For example, let any Body be in the Place

ACBD; the same Body ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not come into the Place BDEF, but it must first be in GHIK, whose part GHBD is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both the Places ACBD, and GHIK; and whose part BDIK is common to both the Places GHIK, and BDEF. Now it cannot be conceived that any thing can be Moved without Time; for Time, is by the Definition of it, a Phantasme, that is a Conception of Motion; and therefore to conceive that any thing may be Moved without Time, were to conceive Motion without Motion, which is impossible.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>That is said to be at Rest, which during anytime is in one place; and that. to be Moved, or to have been Moved, which whether it be now at Rest, or Moved, was formerly in another Place then that which it is now in.</hi> From which Definitions it may be inferred, First, that <hi>Whatsoever is Moved, has been Moved;</hi> for if it be still in the same Place in which it was formerly, it is at Rest, that is, it is not Moved, by the Definition of <hi>Rest;</hi> but if it be in another Place, it has been Moved, by the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Moved.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>what is Moved, will yet be Moved;</hi> for that which is Moved, leaveth the Place where it is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be in another Place, and consequently will be moved still. Thirdly, that <hi>whatsoever is Moved, is not in One place during any time, how little soever that time be;</hi> for by the Definition of Rest, that which is in one Place during any time, is at Rest.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Sophisme against Motion, which seems to spring from the not understanding of this last Proposition. For they say, that, <hi>If any Body be Moved, it is Moved either in the Place where it is, or in the Place where it is not; both which are false; and therefore nothing is Moved.</hi> But the falsity lies in the Major Proposition; for that which is Moved, is neither Moved in the Place where it is, nor in the Place where it is not; but from the Place where it is, to the Place where it is not. Indeed it cannot be denied but that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Moved, is Moved somewhere, that is, within some Space; but then the Place of that Body is not that whole Space, but a part of it, as is said above in the seventh Article. From what is above demonstrated, namely, that whatsoever is Moved, has also
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59147:48"/>
been Moved, and will be Moved, this also may be collected, that there can be no conception of Motion, without conceiving Past and Future time.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Though there be no Body which has not some Magnitude, yet if when any Body is moved, the Magnitude of it be not at all considered, the way it makes it called a LINE, or one single Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension; &amp; the Space through which it passeth, is called LENGTH; and the Body it self, a POINT; in which sense the Earth is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Point,</hi> and the Way of its yearly Revolution, the <hi>Ecliptick Line.</hi> But if a Body which is Moved, be considered as <hi>long,</hi> and be supposed to be so Moved, as that all the several parts of it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to make several Lines, then the Way of every part of that Body is called BREADTH, and the Space which is made is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led SUPERFICIES, consisting of two Dimensions, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to every several part of the other is applyed whole. Again, if a Body be considered as having <hi>Superficies,</hi> and be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be so Moved, that all the several parts of it describe several Lines, then the Way of every part of that Body is called THICKNESS, or DEPTH, and the Space which is Made is called SOLID, consisting of three Dimensions, any two whereof are applyed whole to every several part of the third.</p>
               <p>But if a Body be considered as <hi>Solid,</hi> then it is not possible that all the several parts of it should describe several lines; for what way soever it be Moved, the way of the following part will fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of the part before it, so that the same Solid will still be made which the formost Superficies would have made by it self. And therefore there can be no other Dimension in any Body, as it is a Body, then the three which I have now described; though as it shall be shewed hereafter, <hi>Velocity,</hi> which is Motion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Length,</hi> may be being applyed to all the parts of a <hi>Solid,</hi> make a Magnitude of Motion consisting of four Dimensions; as the goodness of Gold computed in all the parts of it makes the Price and Value thereof.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Bodies</hi> (how many soever they be) that can fill every one the place of every one, are said to be EQUAL every one to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59147:49"/>
Figure, either by Flexion or Transposition of the parts. And <hi>One Body is</hi> GREATER <hi>then another Body, when a part of that is equal to all this; and</hi> LESSE, <hi>when all that is equal to a part of this.</hi> Also <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes</hi> are <hi>Equal,</hi> or <hi>Greater,</hi> or <hi>Lesser</hi> then one another for the same consideration, namely, when the Bodies of which they are the Magnitudes, are either <hi>Equal</hi> or <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Lesse,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">14 One and the same Body, is alwayes of one and the same Magnitude.

But there would be no need at all of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating a thing that is in it self so manifest, if there were not some, whose opinion concerning Bodies and their Magnitudes is, that a Body may exist separated from its Magnitude, and have greater or lesse Magnitude bestowed upon it, making use of this Principle for the explication of the nature of <hi>Rarum</hi> and <hi>Densum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 Motion, in as much as a certain Length may in a certain Time be transmitted by it, is called VELOCITY or <hi>Swiftness:</hi> &amp;c. For though <hi>Swift</hi> be very often understood with relation to <hi>Slower</hi> or <hi>less Swift,</hi> as Great is in respect of Less, yet nevertheless, as Magnitude is by Philosophers taken absolutely for Extension, so also <hi>Velocity</hi> or <hi>Swiftness</hi> may be put absolutely for Motion accord ing to Length.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Many Motions are said to be made in Equal Times, when every one of them begins and ends together with some other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or if it had begun together, would also have ended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the same. For Time which is a Phantasme of Mo tion, cannot be reckoned but by some exposed Motion; as in Dials by the Motion of the Sun or of the Hand; and if two or more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions begin and end with this Motion, they are said to be made in equal times; from whence also it is easie to understand what it is to be moved in Greater or Longer time, &amp; in lesse time or not so long; namely, that that is longer Moved, which beginning with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59147:49"/>
ends later; or ending together, began sooner.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Motions are said to be Equally Swift, when Equal lengths are transmitted in Equal times; and Greater Swiftness is that, wherein Greater length is passed in Equal time, or Equal length in less time. Also that Swiftness by which Equal lengths are passed in Equal parts of time, is called <hi>Uniform</hi> Swiftness or Motion; and of Motions <hi>not Uniform,</hi> such as become Swifter or Slower by equal Increasings or Decreasings in equal parts of time, are said to be <hi>Accelerated</hi> or <hi>Retarded Uniformly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 But Motion is said to be Greater, Lesse, and Equal, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the Length which is transmitted in a certain time, that is, in regard of Swiftness onely, but of Swiftness applyed to every smallest particle of Magnitude; For when any Body is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, every part of it is also Moved; and supposing the parts to be halves, the Motions of those halves have their Swiftness equal to one another, and severally equal to that of the Whole; but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Whole is equal to those two Motions, either of which is of equal Swiftness with it; and therefore it is one thing for two Motions to be Equal to one another, &amp; another thing for them to be Equally Swift. And this is manifest in two Horses that draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breast, where the Motion of both the Horses together is of Equal Swiftness with the Motion of either of them singly; but the Motion of both is Greater then the Motion of one of them, namely Double. Wherefore <hi>Motions are said to be simply Equal to one another when the Swiftness of one computed in every part of its Magnitude, is Equal to the Swiftness of the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>puted also in every part of its Magnitude: &amp; Greater then one another, when the Swiftness of one computed as above, is Greater then the Swiftness of the other so computed; and Lesse, when Lesse.</hi> Besides, the Magnitude of Motion computed in this manner is that which is commonly called FORCE.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Whatsoever is at Rest, will alwayes be at Rest, unless there be some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body besides it, which by endeavouring to get into its Place by motion, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it no longer to remain at Rest.</hi> For suppose that some Finite Body exist, and be at Rest, and that all Space besides be Empty; if now this Body begin to be Moved, it will certainly be Moved some way; Seeing therefore there was nothing in that Body which did not dispose it to Rest, the reason why it is Moved this way is in something out of it; and in like manner, if it had been Moved any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59147:50"/>
other way, the reason of Motion that way had also been in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of it; but seeing it was supposed that Nothing is out of it, the reason of its Motion one way would be the same with the reason of its Motion every other way; wherefore it would be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alike all wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es at once; which is impossible.</p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>Whatsoever is Moved, will alwayes be Moved, except there be some other Body besides it, which causeth it to Rest.</hi> For if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Nothing to be without it, there will be no reason why it should Rest now, rather then at another time; wherefore its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would cease in every particle of time alike; which is not intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</p>
               <p>When we say a Living Creature, a Tree, or any other specified Body is <hi>Generated,</hi> or <hi>Destroyed,</hi> it is not to be so understood as if there were made a Body of that which is not-Body, or not a Body of a Body, but of a Living Creature not a Living Creature, of a Tree not a Tree, &amp;c. that is, that those Accidents for which we call one thing a Living Creature, another thing a Tree, and another by some other Name, are Generated and Destroyed; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same Names are not to be given to them now, which were given them before. But that Magnitude for which we give to any thing the Name of Body is neither Generated nor Destroyed. For though we may feign in our Mind that a Point may swell to a huge bulk, and that this may again contract it selfe to a Point; that is, though we may imagine something to arise where before was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and Nothing to be there where before was something, yet we cannot comprehend in our Minde how this may possibly be done in Nature. And therefore Philosophers, who tye themselves to Naturall Reason, Suppose that a Body can neither be Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor Destroyed, but onely that it may appear otherwise then it did to Us, that is under different <hi>Species,</hi> and consequently be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by other and other Names; so that that which is now called Man, may at another time have the Name of Not-Man; but that which is once called Body, can never be called Not-Body. But it is manifest, that all other Accidents besides Magnitude or Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may be Generated and Destroyed; as when a White thing is made Black, the Whiteness that was in it Perisheth, and the Blackness that was not in it is now Generated; and therefore Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Accidents under which they appear diversly, have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59147:50"/>
this difference, that Bodies are Things, and not Generated; Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are Generated, and not Things.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And therefore when any thing appears otherwise then it did, by reason of other and other Accidents, it is not to be thought that an Accident goes out of one Subject into another (for they are not, as I said above, in their Subjects as a Part in the Whole, or as a Conteined thing in that which Conteins it, or as a Master of a Family in his House,) but that one Accident Perisheth, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Generated. For example, when the Hand being Moved, Moves the Pen, Motion does not go out of the Hand into the Pen, for so the Writing might be continued though the Hand stood still, but a new Motion is Generated in the Pen, and is the Pens Motion.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And therefore also it is improper to say an Accident is Moved; as when in stead of saying, <hi>Figure is an Accident of a Body car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away,</hi> we say, <hi>A Body carries away its Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Now that Accident for which we give a certain Name to any Body, or the Accident which denominates its Subject, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the ESSENCE thereof; as Rationality is the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Man, Whiteness; of any White Thing and Extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Essence of a Body. And the same Essence in as much as it is Generated, is called the FORM. Again, a Body, in respect of any accident is called the SUBJECT, and in respect of the Form it is called the MATTER.</p>
               <p>Also, the Production or Perishing of any Accident, makes its Subject be said <hi>to be Changed;</hi> onely the Production or Perishing of Form, make it be said it is <hi>Generated</hi> or <hi>Destroyed;</hi> but in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Mutation, the name of <hi>Matter</hi> still remains. For a Table made of Wood, is not onely Wooden, but Wood; and a Statue of Brass is Brass as well as Brazen; though <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siques</hi> say, that whatsoever is made of any thing ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, not Wood, but Wooden.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And as for that Matter which is common to all things, and which Philosophers following <hi>Aristotle,</hi> usually call <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> that is, <hi>First Matter,</hi> it is not any Body distinct from all other Bodies, nor is it one of them. What then is it? A mere Name; yet a Name which is not of vain Use; for it signifies a conception of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59147:51"/>
Body without the consideration of any Form or other Accident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely Magnitude or Extension, &amp; aptness to receive Form &amp; other Accidents; so that whensoever we have use of the Name <hi>Body in general,</hi> if we use that of <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> we do well. For as, when a Man not knowing which was first, Water or Ice, would finde out which of the two were the Matter of both, he would be fain to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some third Matter which were neither of these two; so he that would finde out what is the Matter of all things, ought to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such as is not the Matter of any thing that exists. Wherefore <hi>Materia Prima</hi> is no Thing; and therefore they do not attribute to it either Form or any other Accident besides Quantity; whereas all singular things have their Forms and Accidents certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Materia Prima</hi> therefore is Body in general, that is Body consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Universally, not as having neither Form nor any Accident, but in which no Form nor any other Accident but Quantity are at all considered, that is, they are not drawn into Argumentation.</p>
               <p n="25">25 From what has been said, those Axiomes may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated which are assumed by <hi>Euclide</hi> in the beginning of his first Element about the Equality and Inequality of Magnitudes; of (which omitting the rest) I will here demonstrate onely this one, <hi>The Whole is greater then any Part thereof;</hi> to the end that the Reader may know that those Axioms are not indemonstrable, &amp; therefore not Principles of Demonstration; and from hence learn to be wary how he admits any thing for a Principle, which is not at least as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident as these are. <hi>Greater</hi> is defined to be that, whose Part is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Whole of another. Now if we suppose any Whole to be A, and a Part of it to be B; seeing the Whole B is Equal to it self, and the same B is a Part of A; therefore a Part of A will be Equal to the Whole B. Wherefore by the Definition above, A is Greater then B, which was to be proved.</p>

Also if many Bodies be so orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that every two which are next to one another be contiguous, then all those that are betwixt the first and the last are both A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Patients, and the first is an Agent onely, and the last a Patient onely.</p>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59147:52"/>3 An Agent is understood to <hi>produce</hi> its determined or certain Effect in the Patient, according to some certain Accident, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, with which both it and the Patient are affected; that is to say, the Agent hath its Effect precisely such, not because it is a Body, but because such a Body, or so Moved; For otherwise all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, seeing they are all Bodies alike, would produce like Effects in all Patients; and therefore the Fire (for example) does not warm, because it is a Body, but because it is Hot; nor does one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy put forward another Body because it is a Body, but because it is moved into the place of that other Body. The Cause therefore of all Effects consists in certain Accidents both in the Agents and in the Patient; which when they are all present, the Effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; but if any one of them be wanting it is not produced; and that Accident either of the Agent or Patient, without which the Effect cannot be produced, is called <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> or <hi>Cause Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary by Supposition,</hi> as also the <hi>Cause Requisite for the Production of the Effect.</hi> But a CAUSE. simply, or <hi>An Entire Cause, is the Aggregate of all the Accidents both of the Agents how many soever they be, and of the Patient, put together; which when they are all supposed to be present, it cannot be understood but that the Effect is produced at the same instant; and if any one of them be wanting, it cannot be understood but that the Effect is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 The Aggregate of Accidents in the Agent or Agents, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the production of the Effect, the Effect being produced, is called the <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> thereof; and the Aggregate of Accidents in the Patient, the Effect being produced, is usually called the <hi>Material Cause;</hi> I say the Effect being produced; for where there is no Effect, there can be no Cause; for nothing can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Cause where there is nothing that can be called an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But the Efficient and Material Causes, are both but Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Causes, or Parts of that Cause which in the next precedent article I called an Entire Cause. And from hence it is manifest, that the Effect we expect, though the Agents be not defective on their part, may nevertheless be frustrated by a defect in the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and when the Patient is sufficient, by a defect in the Agents.</p>
               <p n="5">5 An Entire Cause is alwayes sufficient for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its Effect, if the Effect be at all possible. For let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Effect whatsoever be propounded to be produced; if the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59147:52"/>
same be produced, it is manifest that the Cause which produced it was a sufficient Cause; but if it be not produced, and yet be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it is evident that something was wanting either in some Agent, or in the Patient, without which it could not be produced; that is, that some Accident was wanting which was requisite for its Production; and therefore that Cause was not <hi>Entire,</hi> which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>
               <p>It follows also from hence, that in whatsoever instant the Cause is Entire, in the same instant the Effect is produced. For if it be not produced, something is still wanting, which is requisite for the production of it; and therefore the Cause was not Entire, as was supposed.</p>
               <p>And seeing a Necessary Cause is defined to be that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed, the Effect cannot but follow; this also may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that whatsoever Effect is produced at any time, the same is produced by a Necessary Cause. For whatsoever is produced, in as much as it is produced, had an Entire Cause, that is, had all those things, which being supposed, it cannot be understood but that the Effect follows; that is, it had a Necessary Cause. And in the same manner it may be shewn, that whatsoever Effects are hereafter to be produced, shall have a Necessary Cause; so that all the Effects, that have been or shall be produced, have their Ne cessity in things antecedent.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And from this, that whensoever the Cause is Entire, the Effect is produced in the same instant, it is manifest, that Causation and the Production of Effects consist in a certain continual Progress; so that as there is a continual Mutation in the Agent or Agents by the working of other Agents upon them, so also the Patient upon which they work is continually altered and changed. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Heat of the Fire encreases more and more, so also the Effects thereof, namely the Heat of such Bodies as are next to it, &amp; again of such other Bodies as are next to them, encreases more &amp; more accordingly; which is already no litle argument that all Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation consists in Motion onely; the truth whereof shall be further demonstrated in the ninth Article. But in this Progress of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that is, of Action and Passion, if any man comprehend in his imagination a part thereof, and divide the same into parts, the first part or Beginning of it cannot be considered otherwise then
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59147:53"/>
as Action or Cause; for if it should be considered as Effect or Passion, then it would be necessary to consider something before it for its Cause or Action; which cannot be; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be before the Beginning. And in like manner, the last part is considered onely as Effect; for it cannot be called Cause if nothing follow it; but after the last nothing follows. And from hence it is, that in all Action the Beginning and Cause are taken for the same thing. But every one of the intermediate parts are both Action and Passion, and Cause and Effect, according as they are compared with the antecedent or subsequent part.</p>
               <p n="7">7 There can be no Cause of Motion, except in a Body Contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Moved. For let there be any two Bodies which are not contiguous, and betwixt which the intermediate Space is empty, or if filled, filled with another Body which is at Rest; and let one of the propounded Bodies be supposed to be at Rest, I say it shall always be at Rest. For if it shall be Moved, the Cause of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (by the 8th. Chapter 19th. Article) will be in some external Body; and therefore if between it and that external Body there be nothing but empty Space, then whatsoever the disposition be of that external Body, or of the Patient it self, yet if it be supposed to be now at Rest, we may conceive it wil continue so til it be touched by some other Body; but seeing Cause (by the Definition) is the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of all such Accidents, which being supposed to be present it cannot be conceived but that the Effect will follow, those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which are either in external Bodies, or in the Patient it self, cannot be the Cause of future Motion; and in like manner, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we may conceive, that whatsoever is at Rest, will still be at Rest, though it be touched by some other Body, except that other Body be moved, therefore in a contiguous Body which is at Rest, there can be no Cause of Motion. Wherefore there is no Cause of Motion in any Body, except it be Contiguous and Moved.</p>
               <p>The same reason may serve to prove, that whatsoever is Moved, will alwayes be Moved on in the same way and with the same Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, except it be hindered by some other Contiguous and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Body; and consequently that no Bodies either when they are at Rest, or when there is an interposition of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> can generate or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tinguish or lesson Motion in other Bodies. There is one that has
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59147:53"/>
written, that things Moved are more resisted by things at Rest, then by things contrarily Moved, for this reason, that he conceived Motion not to be so contrary to Motion as Rest. That which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him was, that the words <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Names; whereas Motion indeed is not resisted by Rest, but by contrary Motion.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But if a Body work upon another Body at one time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same Body work upon the same Body at another time so, that both the Agent and Patient, and all their parts, be in all things as they were; and there be no difference except onely in time, that is, that one Action be former the other later in time; it is manifest of it self, that the Effects will be Equal and Like; as not differing in any thing besides time. And as Effects themselves proceed from their Causes; so the diversity of them depends upon the diversity of their Causes also.</p>
               <p n="9">9 This being true, it is necessary that <hi>Mutation</hi> can be nothing else, but Motion of the Parts of that Body which is Changed. For First, we do not say any thing is Changed, but that which appears to our Senses otherwise then it appeared formerly. Secondly, both those Appearances are Effects produced in the Sentient; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is necessary (by the preceding article) that either some part of the Agent which was formerly at Rest, is now Moved, and so the Mutation consists in this Motion; or some part which was formerly Moved, is now otherwise Moved, and so also the Mutation consists in this new Motion; or which being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Moved, is now at Rest, which (as I have shewn above) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to pass without Motion, and so again Mutation is Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or, lastly, it happens in some of these manners to the Patient or some of its parts; so that Mutation, howsoever it be made, will consist in the Motion of the parts either of the Body which is perceived, or of the Sentient Body, or of both. Mutation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Motion, (namely of the parts either of the Agent or of the Patient;) which was to be demonstrated. And to this it is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that Rest cannot be the Cause of any thing; nor can any Action proceed from it, seeing neither Motion nor Mutation can be caused by it.</p>

               <p n="1">1<seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Orrespondent to <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> are POWER and ACT; Nay, those and these are the same things, though for divers considerations they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers names. Forwhensoever any Agent has all those Accidents which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily requisite for the production of some Effect in the Patient, then we say that Agent has <hi>Power</hi> to produce that Effect, if it be applyed to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. But (as I have shewn in the precedent Chapter,) those Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents constitute the Efficient Cause; and therefore the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which constitute the Efficient Cause, constitute also the <hi>Power</hi> of the Agent. Wherefore the <hi>Power of the Agent,</hi> and the <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> are the same thing. But they are considered with this difference, that <hi>Cause</hi> is so called in respect of the Effect already produced, and <hi>Power</hi> in respect of the same Effect to be produced hereafter, so that <hi>Cause</hi> respects the Past, <hi>Power</hi> the Future time. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Power of the Agent,</hi> is that which is commonly called <hi>Active Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, whensoever any Patient has all those Accidents which it is requisite it should have for the production of some Effect in it, we say it is in the <hi>Power</hi> of that Patient to produce that Effect, if it be applyed to a fitting Agent. But those Accidents (as is defined in the precedent Chapter) constitute the Material
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59147:55"/>
Cause; and therefore the <hi>Power of the Patient,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Passive Power</hi>) and <hi>Material Cause</hi> are the same thing; but with this different consideration, that in Cause the Past time, and in Power the Future is respected. Wherefore the Power of the Agent and Patient together, which may be called Entire or <hi>Plenary Power,</hi> is the same thing with <hi>Entire Cause;</hi> for they both consist in the Sum or Aggregate of all the Accidents as well in the Agent as in the Patient, which are requisite for the production of the Effect. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Accident produced is in respect of the Cause called an <hi>Effect;</hi> so in respect of the Power it is called an <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 As therefore the Effect is produced in the same instant in which the Cause is Entire; so also every Act that may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is produced in the same instant, in which the Power is Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And as there can be no Effect, but from a Sufficient and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Cause; so also no Act can be produced, but by Sufficient Power, or that Power by which it could not but be produced.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And as it is manifest, (as I have shewn) that the Efficient and Material Causes are severally and by themselves parts onely of an Entire Cause, and cannot produce any Effect but by being joyned together; so also Power Active and Passive, are parts onely of Plenary and Entire Power; nor, except they be joyned, can any Act proceed from them; and therefore these Powers (as I said in the first Article) are but conditionall, namely, <hi>the Agent has Power, if it be applyed to a Patient; and the Patient has Power, if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to an Agent;</hi> otherwise neither of them have Power, nor can the Accidents which are in them severally be properly called Powers; nor any Action be said to be Possible, for the Power of the Agent alone, or of the Patient alone.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For that is an Impossible Act, for the production of which there is no Power Plenary. For seeing Plenary Power is that in which all things concurre which are requisite for the production of an Act, if the Power shall never be Plenary, there will always be wanting some of those things, without which the Act cannot be produced; wherefore that Act shall never be produced, that is, that Act is IMPOSSIBLE: And every Act which is not Impossible, is POSSIBLE. Every Act therefore which is Possible shall at some time be produced; for if it shall never be produced, then those things shall never concurre which are requisite for the production
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59147:55"/>
of it; wherefore that Act is <hi>Impossible</hi> by the Definition; which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 A <hi>Necessary Act</hi> is that, the production whereof it is Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to hinder; and therefore every Act that shall be produced; shall necessarily be produced; for that it shall not be produced is Impossible, because (as is already demonstrated) every Possible Act shall at some time be produced; Nay, this Proposition, <hi>What shall be, shall be,</hi> is as necessary a Proposition, as this, <hi>A Man is a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here perhaps some man may ask, whether those Future things, which are commonly called <hi>Contingents,</hi> are Necessary. I say therefore that generally all Contingents, have their Necessary Causes, (as is shewn in the preceding Chapter,) but are called Contingents in respect of other Events upon which they do not depend; as the Rain which shall be to morrow, shall be Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, (that is from necessary Causes;) but we think and say it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by chance, because we doe not yet perceive the Causes thereof, though they exist now; for men commonly call that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall</hi> or <hi>Contingent,</hi> whereof they do not perceive the necessary Cause; and in the same manner they use to speake of things past, when not knowing whether a thing be done or no, they say it is possible it never was done.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all Propositions concerning Future things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or not contingent, as this, <hi>It will rayne to morrow,</hi> or this, <hi>To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Sun will rise,</hi> are either necessarily true, or necessarily false; but we call them Contingent because we doe not yet know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be true or false; whereas their Verity depends not upon our Knowledge, but upon the foregoing of their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But there are some who though they confess this whole Proposition, <hi>To morrow it will either rain or not rain,</hi> to be true, yet they will not acknowledge the parts of it, as <hi>To morrow it will rain,</hi> or <hi>To morrow it will not rain,</hi> to be either of them true by it self, because they say neither this nor that is true <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.</hi> But what is this <hi>determinately true,</hi> but true upon our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or evidently true? and therefore they say no more but that it is not yet known whether it be true or no; but they say it more obscurely, and darken the Evidence of the truth with the same words with which they endevour to hide their own ignorance.</p>
               <p n="6">6 In the 9th. Article of the precedent Chapter I have shewn,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59147:56"/>
that the Efficient Cause of all Motion and Mutation consists in the Motion of the Agent or Agents; And in the first Article of this Chapter, that the Power of the Agent is the same thing with the Efficient Cause. From whence it may be understood, that all Active Power consists in Motion also; and that Power is not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Accident which differs from all Acts, but is indeed an Act, namely Motion, which is therefore called Power, because another Act shall be produced by it afterwards. For example, if of three Bodies the first put forwards the second, and this the third, the Motion of the second in respect of the first which produceth it, is the Act of the second Body, but in respect of the third it is the Active Power of the same second Body.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The Writers of <hi>Metaphysiques</hi> reckon up two other Causes besides the <hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Material,</hi> namely the ESSENCE, which some call the <hi>Formal Cause;</hi> and the <hi>End,</hi> or <hi>Final Cause;</hi> both which are nevertheless Efficient Causes. For when it is said, the Essence of a thing is the Cause thereof, <hi>as to be Rational, is the Cause of Man,</hi> it is not intelligible; for it is all one as if it were said, <hi>To be a Man is the Cause of Man,</hi> which is not well said. And yet the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Essence</hi> of any thing, is the Cause of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the thing it selfe; for if I first know that a thing is <hi>Rational,</hi> I know from thence that the same is <hi>Man;</hi> but this is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then an Efficient Cause. A <hi>Final Cause</hi> has no place but in such things as have Sense and Will; and this also I shall prove hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be an Efficient Cause.</p>

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59147:57"/>Bodies which differ more then in Magnitude are called <hi>Unlike,</hi> and those which differ onely in Magnitude, <hi>Like.</hi> Also of Unlike Bodies some are said to differ in the <hi>Species,</hi> other in the <hi>Genus;</hi> in the <hi>Species</hi> when their difference is perceived by one and the same Sense, as <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black;</hi> and in the <hi>Genus,</hi> when their difference is not perceived but by divers Senses, as <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Hot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 And the <hi>Likeness,</hi> or <hi>Unlikeness, Equality</hi> or <hi>Inequality</hi> of one Body to another, is called their RELATION; and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themselves <hi>Relatives</hi> or <hi>Correlatives; Aristotle</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the first whereof is usually named the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and the second the <hi>Consequent;</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> of the Antecedent to the Consequent according to Magnitude, namely, the Equality, the Excess or Defect thereof, is called the PROPORTION of the Antecedent to the Consequent, so that <hi>Proportion</hi> is nothing but the Equality or Inequality of the Magnitude of the Antecedent compared to the Magnitude of the Consequent by their difference only, or compared also with their difference. For Example, the <hi>Proportion</hi> of Three to Two consists only in this, that Three <hi>exceeds</hi> Two by Unity; and the Proportion of Two to Five in this, that Two compared with Five is <hi>deficient</hi> of it by Three, either simply, or compared with the numbers different; and therefore in the Proportion of Unequals, the Proportion of the Lesse to the Greater is called DEFECT, and that of the Greater to the Lesse EXCESS.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Besides, of Unequals, some are more, some lesse, and some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unequall; so that there is <hi>Proportion of Proportions,</hi> as well as of <hi>Magnitudes,</hi> namely, where two Unequals have relation to two other Unequals; as when the Inequality which is between 2 and 3 is compared with the Inequality which is between 4 and 5. In which Comparison there are alwayes four Magnitudes, or (which is all one) if there be but three, the midlemost is twice numbred; and if the Proportion of the first to the second be equal to the Proportion of the third to the fourth, then the four are said to be <hi>Proportionals;</hi> otherwise they are not Proportionals.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Proportion of the Antecedent to the Consequent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in their Difference, not onely simply taken, but also as compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one of the Relatives; that is, either in that part of the greater by which it exceeds the lesse, or in the Remainder after
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59147:57"/>
the lesse is taken out of the greater; as the Proportion of Two to Five, consists in the Three by which Five exceeds Two, not in Three, simply onely, but also as compared with Five or Two. For though there be the same difference between Two &amp; Five, which is between Nine and Twelve, namely Three, yet there is not the same Inequality; and therefore the Proportion of Two to Five, is not in all Relation the same with that of Nine to Twelve, but onely in that which is called Arithmetical.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But we must not so think of Relation, as if it were an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent differing from all the other Accidents of the Relative; but one of them; namely that, by which the Comparison is made. For example, the likeness of one <hi>White</hi> to another <hi>White,</hi> or its Unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>Black,</hi> is the same Accident with its <hi>Whiteness;</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Inequality,</hi> the same Accident with the <hi>Magnitude</hi> of the thing compared, though under another Name; for that which is called <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Great,</hi> when it is not compared with something else, the same when it is compared is called <hi>Like</hi> or <hi>Unlike, Equal</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.</hi> And from this it follows, that the Causes of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which are in Relatives, are the Causes also of <hi>Likeness, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeness, Equality</hi> and <hi>Inequality;</hi> namely, that he that makes two Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Bodies, makes also their Inequality; and he that makes a Rule and an Action, makes also, if the Action be congruous to the Rule, their Congruity; if Incongruous, their Incongruity. And thus much concerning <hi>Comparison</hi> of one Body with another.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But the same Body may at different times be Compared with it self. And from hence springs a great controversie among Philosophers about the <hi>Beginning of Individuation;</hi> namely, in what sense it may be conceived that a Body is at one time the same, at another time not the same it was formerly. For example, whether a Man grown old be the same Man he was whilest he was young, or another Man; or whether a City be in different Ages the same, or another City. Some place <hi>Individuity</hi> in the Unity of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> others in the Unity of <hi>Form;</hi> and one sayes it consists in the Unity of the <hi>Aggregate of all the Accidents together.</hi> For <hi>Matter,</hi> it is pleaded, that a lump of Wax, whether it be Spherical or Cubical, is the same Wax, because the same Matter. For <hi>Form,</hi> that when a Man is grown from an Infant to be an Old Man, though his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be changed, yet he is still the same Numerical Man; for that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59147:58"/>
                  <hi>Identity</hi> which cannot be attributed to the Matter, ought probably to be ascribed to the Form. For the <hi>Aggregate of Accidents</hi> no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance can be made; but because when any new Accident is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, a new Name is commonly imposed on the Thing, therefore he that assigned this cause of <hi>Individuity,</hi> thought the thing it self also was become another thing. According to the first Opinion, He that sins, and he that is punished should not be the same Man, by reason of the perpetual flux and change of Mans Body; nor should the City which makes Lawes in one Age, and abrogates them in another, be the same City; which were to confound all Civil Rights. According to the second Opinion, two Bodies exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both at once, would be one and the same Numerical Body; for if (for example) that Ship of <hi>Theseus</hi> (concerning the Difference whereof, made by continual reparation, in taking out the old Planks, and putting in new, the Sophisters of <hi>Athens</hi> were wont to dispute) were, after all the Planks were changed, the same Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Ship it was at the beginning; and if some Man had kept the Old Planks as they were taken out, and by putting them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards together in the same order, had again made a Ship of them, this without doubt had also been the same Numerical Ship with that which was at the beginning; and so there would have been two Ships Numerically the same, which is absurd. But according to the third Opinion, Nothing would be the same it was; so that a Man standing, would not be the same he was sitting; nor the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is in the Vessel, the same with that which is poured out of it. Wherefore the beginning of <hi>Individuation</hi> is not alwayes to be taken either from Matter alone, or from Form alone.</p>
               <p>But we must consider by what name any thing is called, when we enquire concerning the <hi>Identity</hi> of it; for it is one thing to ask concerning <hi>Socrates</hi> whether he be the same Man, and another to ask whether he be the same Body; for his Body when he is Old, cannot be the same it was when he was an Infant, by reason of the difference of Magnitude; for One Body has alwayes One and the same Magnitude; yet nevertheless he may be the same Man. And therefore whensoever the Name by which it is asked whether a thing be the same it was, is given it for the Matter onely, then if the Matter be the same, the thing also is <hi>Individually</hi> the same; as the Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r which was in the Sea, is the same which is afterwards
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59147:58"/>
in the Cloud; and any Body is the same, whether the parts of it be put together, or dispersed, or whether it be congealed or dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Also if the Name be given for such Form as is the beginning of Motion, then as long as that Motion remains it will be the same <hi>Individual</hi> thing; as that Man will be alwayes the same, whose A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Thoughts proceed all from the same beginning of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, that which was in his generation; and that will be the same River, which flows from one and the same Fountain, whether the same Water, or other Water, or something else then Water flow from thence; and that the same City, whose Acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed continually from the same Institution, whether the Men be the same or no. Lastly, if the Name be given for some Accident, then the <hi>Identity</hi> of the thing will depend upon the Matter; for by the taking away and supplying of Matter, the Accidents that were are destroyed, and other new ones are generated, which cannot be the same Numerically; so that a Ship, which signifies Matter so fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, will be the same, as long as the Matter remains the same; but if no part of the Matter be the same, then it is Numerically another Ship; and if part of the Matter remain, and part be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then the Ship will be partly the same, and partly not the same.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat, and how manifold <hi>Dimension</hi> is, has been said in the 8th. Chapter, namely, that there are three Dimensions, Line (or Length) Superficies and Solid; Every one of which, if it be determined, that is, if the limits of it be made known is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quantity;</hi> For by <hi>Quantity</hi> all men understand that which is signified by that word, by which answer is made to the question <hi>How much is it.</hi> Whensoever therefore it is asked (for example) <hi>How long is the Journey,</hi> it is not answered indefinitely <hi>Length;</hi> nor when it is asked, <hi>How big is the Field</hi> is it answered indefinitely <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies;</hi> nor if a man ask <hi>How great is the bulk,</hi> indefinitely <hi>Solid;</hi> but it is answered determinately, The Journey is a hundred Miles; the Field is a hundred Acres; the Bulk is a hundred Cubical Feet; or at least in some such manner, that the Magnitude of the thing enquired after may by certain Limits be comprehended in the Mind. QUANTITY therefore cannot otherwise be defined, then to be <hi>a Dimension determined</hi> or <hi>a Dimension, whose Limits are set out, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Place, or by some Comparison.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And <hi>Quantity</hi> is determined two wayes; One, by the Sense, when some sensible Object is set before it; as when a Line, a Superficies or Solid, of a Foot or Cubit, marked out in some Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is objected to the Eyes; which way of Determining is called <hi>Exposition,</hi> and the Quantity so known is called <hi>Exposed Quantity;</hi> The Other, by Memory, that is, by Comparison with some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Quantity. In the first manner, when it is asked of what Quantity a thing is, it is answered, of such Quantity as you see
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59147:59"/>
Exposed. In the second manner, answer cannot be made but by Comparison with some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xposed Quantity; for if it be asked, How long is the Way, the answer is, so many thousand Paces; that is, by Comparing the Way with a Pace, or some other Measure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and known by Exposition; or the Quantity of it is to some other Quantity known by Exposition, as the Diameter of a Square is to the Side of the same, or by some other the like means. But it is to be understood that the Quantity Exposed must be some standing or permanent thing, such as is marked out in consistent or durable matter; or at least something which is revocable to sense; for otherwise no Comparison can be made by it. Seeing therefore (by what has been said in the next preceding Chapter) Comparison of one Magnitude with another, is the same thing with Proportion; it is manifest, that Quantity determined in the second manner, is nothing else but the Proportion of a Dimension not Exposed to another which is Exposed; that is, the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Equality or Inequality thereof with an Exposed Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Lines, Superficies</hi> and <hi>Solids</hi> are Exposed, First, by <hi>Motion,</hi> in such manner, as (in the 8th Chapter) I have said they are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but so, as that the Marks of such Motion be permanent; as when they are designed upon some Matter, as a Line upon Paper; or graven in some durable Matter. Secondly, by <hi>Apposition;</hi> as when one Line or Length is applyed to another Line or Length, one Breadth to another Breadth, and one Thickness to another Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; which is as much as to describe a Line by Points, a Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by Lines, and a Solid by Superficies, saving that by Points in this place are to be understood very short Lines, and by Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies very Thin Solids. Thirdly, Lines and Superficies may be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Section;</hi> namely a Line may be made by Cutting an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Superficies, and a Superficies by the Cutting of an Exposed Solid.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Time</hi> is Exposed not onely by the Exposition of a Line, but also of some Moveable thing, which is moved Uniformly upon that Line, or at least is supposed so to be Moved. For seeing Time is an Idea of Motion in which we consider Former and Later, that is, Succession, it is not sufficient for the Exposition of Time that a Line be described, but we must also have in our Minde an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59147:60"/>
of some Moveable thing passing over that Line, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it must be Uniform, that Time may be divided and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as often as there shall be need. And therefore when Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers in their Demonstrations draw a Line, and say, <hi>Let that Line be Time,</hi> it is to be understood as if they said, <hi>Let the Conception of Uniform Motion upon that Line, be Time.</hi> For though the Circles in Dials be Lines, yet they are not of themselves sufficient to note Time by, except also there be, or be supposed to be a Motion of the Shadow or the Hand.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Number</hi> is Exposed either by the Exposition of Points, or of the Names of Number <hi>One, Two, Three, &amp;c.</hi> and those Points must not be contiguous, so as that they cannot be distinguished by Notes, but they must be so placed that they may be <hi>discerned</hi> one from another; for from this it is that Number is called <hi>Discrete Quantity,</hi> whereas all Quantity which is designed by Motion, is called <hi>Continual Quantity.</hi> But that Number may be Exposed by the Names of Number, it is necessary that they be recited by heart and in order, as One, Two, Three, &amp;c. for by saying One, One, One and so forward, we know not what Number we are at beyond Two or Three, which also appear to Us in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not as Number, but as Figure.</p>
               <p n="6">6 For the Exposition of <hi>Velocity</hi> (which by the Definition therof is a Motion which in a certain Time passeth over a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Space) it is requisite not onely that Time be Exposed, but that there be also Exposed that Space which is transmitted by the Body whose Velocity we would determine, and that a Body be understood to be Moved in that Space also; so that there must be Exposed two Lines, upon One of which Uniform Motion must be understood to be made, that the Time may be determined, and upon the other the Velocity is to be computed. As if we would Expose the Velocity of the Body A, we draw two lines AB and CD, and place a Body in C also, which done, we say, the Velocity of the Body A is so great, that it passeth over the Line AB in the same Time, in which the Body C passeth over the Line CD with Uniform Motion.

               <p n="7">7 <hi>Weight</hi> is Exposed by any Heavy Body, of what Matter soever, so it be alwayes alike Heavy.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59147:60"/>8 The <hi>Proportion</hi> of two Magnitudes is then Exposed when the Magnitudes themselves are Exposed; namely, the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Equality, when the Magnitudes are Equal; and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, when they are Unequal. For seeing (by the 5th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the precedent Chapter) the Proportion of two Unequal Magnitudes consists in their Difference compared with either of them; and when two Unequal Magnitudes are Exposed, their Difference is also Exposed; it follows, that when Magnitudes which have Proportion to one another are Exposed, their Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also is Exposed with them; and in like manner, the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Equals (which consists in this, that there is no Difference of Magnitude betwixt them) is Exposed at the same time when the Equal Magnitudes themselves are Exposed. For Example, if the Exposed Lines AB and CD be Equal, the Proportion of Equality is Exposed in them; and if the Exposed Lines EF &amp; EG be Unequal, the Proportion which EF has to EG, and that which EG has to EF are also Exposed in them; for not onely the Lines themselves, but also their Difference GF is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. The Proportion of Unequals is Quantity; for the Difference GF, in which it consists, is Quantity. But the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Equality is not Quantity, because between Equals there is no Difference; nor is one Equality greater then another, as one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality is greater then another Inequality.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9 The Proportion of two <hi>Times,</hi> or of two <hi>Uniform Velocities,</hi> is then Exposed, when two lines are exposed, by which two Bodies are understood to be Moved Uniformly; and therefore the same two Lines serve to exhibit both their own Proportion, and that of the Times and Velocities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are considered to be Exposed for the Magnitudes themselves, or for the Times or Velocities. For let the two Lines A and B be Exposed; their Proportion therefore (by the last foregoing Article) is Exposed; and if they be considered as drawn with equal and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform Velocity, then seeing their Times are greater, or equal, or lesse, according as the same Spaces are transmitted in greater, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, or lesse Time, the Lines A and B will exhibit the Equality or Inequality, that is, the Proportion of the Times. To conclude, If the
<figure/>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59147:61"/>
same Lines A and B be considered as drawn in the same Time, then seeing their Velocities are greater, or equal, or lesse, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they pass over in the same time longer, or equal, or shorter Lines, the same Lines A and B will exhibit the Equality or Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that is, the Proportion of their Velocities.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat</hi> &amp; <hi>Little</hi> are not intelligible but by Comparison. Now that to which they are compared is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Exposed, that is, some Magnitude either perceived by Sense, or so defined by Words, that it may be comprehended by the Mind. Also that to which any Magnitude is compared, is either Greater, or Less, or Equal to it. And therefore Proportion (which as I have shewn, is the Estimation, or Comprehension of Magnitudes by Comparison) is threefold; namely Proportion of <hi>Equality,</hi> that is, of Equal to Equal; or of <hi>Excesse,</hi> which is of the Greater to the Lesse; or of <hi>Defect,</hi> which is the Proportion of the Lesse to the Greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59147:62"/>Again, every one of these Proportions is twofold; For if it be asked concerning any Magnitude given, how Great it is, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer may be made by Comparing it two wayes; First, by saying it is greater or lesse then another Magnitude by so much; as Seven is lesse then Ten by three Unities; and this is called <hi>Arithmetical Proportion.</hi> Secondly, by saying it is greater or lesse then another Magnitude by such a part or parts thereof; as Seven is less then Ten by three tenth parts of the same Ten. And though this Proportion be not alwayes explicable by Number, yet it is a determinate Proportion, and of a different kind from the former, and called <hi>Geometrical Proportion,</hi> and most commonly <hi>Proportion simply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Proportion, whether it be Arithmetical or Geometrical, cannot be Exposed but in two Magnitudes (of which the former is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> &amp; the later the <hi>Consequent</hi> of the Proportion) as I have shewn in the 8th. Article of the precedent Chapter. And therefore if two Proportions be to be compared, there must be four Magnitudes Exposed, namely two Antecedents and two Consequents; for though it happen sometimes, that the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the former Proportion be the same with the Antecedent of the later, yet in that double Comparison it must of necessity be twice numbred; so that there will be alwayes four Terms.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Of two Proportions, whether they be Arithmetical or Geometrical, when the Magnitudes compared in both (which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi> in the fifth Definition of his sixth Book calls the <hi>Quantities of Proportions</hi>) are equal, then one of the Proportions cannot be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater or lesse then the other; For one Equality is neither greater nor lesse then another Equality. But of two Proportions of Inequality, whether they be Proportions of Excesse or of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, one of them may be either greater or lesse then the other, or they may both be equal; for though there be propounded two Magnitudes that are unequal to one another, yet there may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two more unequal, and other two equally unequall, and other two less unequal then the two which were propounded. And from hence it may be understood that the Proportions of Excess and Defect are Quantity, being capable of More &amp; Less; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Equality is not Quantity, because not capable, neither of <hi>More</hi> nor of <hi>Less.</hi> And therefore Proportions of Inequality may
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59147:62"/>
be added together or substracted from one another, or be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed or divided by one another, or by Number; but Proportions of Equality not so.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Two Equal Proportions are commonly called <hi>The Same Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and it is said, that the Proportion of the first Antecedent to the first Consequent is the <hi>same</hi> with that of the second Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the second Consequent. And when four Magnitudes are thus to one another in Geometrical Proportion, they are called <hi>Proportionals,</hi> and by some more briefly <hi>Analogisme.</hi> And <hi>Greater Proportion,</hi> is the Proportion of a Greater Antecedent to the same Consequent, or of the same Antec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Less Proportion</hi> is the Proportion of a Less Antecedent to the same Consequent, or of the same Antecedent to a Greater Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and when the Proportion of the first Antecedent to the first Consequent, is less then that of the second to the second, the four Magnitudes may be called <hi>Hypologisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 One Arithmetical Proportion is the <hi>Same</hi> with another A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical Proportion, when one of the Antecedents exceeds its Consequent, or is exceeded by it, as much as the other Antecedent exceeds its Consequent, or is exceeded by it. And therefore in four Magnitudes Arithmetically Proportional, the sum of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes is equal to the sum of the Means. For if A. B :: C. D be Arithmetically Proportional, and the Difference on both sides be the same Excess or the same Defect E; then B+C (if A be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then B) will be equal to A−E+C; and A+D will be equal to A+C−E; But A−E+C and A+C−E are equal. Or if A be less then B, then B+C will be equal to A+E+C; and A+D will be equal to A+C+E; But A+E+C, and A+C+E are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
               <p>Also if there be never so many Magnitudes Arithmetically Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional, the Sum of them all will be equal to the Product of half the number of the Terms multiplyed by the Sum of the Extremes. For if A. B :: C. D :: E. F be Arithmetically Proportional, the Couples A+F, B+E, C+D will be equal to one another; and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59147:63"/>
their Sum will be equal to A+F multiplyed by the number of their Combinations, that is, by half the number of the Terms.</p>
               <p>If of four Unequal Magnitudes, any two together taken be equal to the other two together taken, then the greatest and the least of them will be in the same Combination. Let the Unequal Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes be A, B, C, D; and let A+B be equal to C+D; &amp; let A be the greatest of them all; I say B will be the least. For if it may be, let any of the rest, as D, be the least. Seeing therefore A is greater then C, and B then D, A+B will be greater then C+D; which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>
               <p>If there be any four Magnitudes, the Sum of the greatest and least, the Sum of the Means, the difference of the two greatest, and the difference of the two least will be Arithmetically Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. For let there be four Magnitudes, whereof A is the greatest, D the least, and B and C the Means; I say A+D. B+C :: A−B. C−D are Arithmetically Proportional. For the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first Antecedent and its Consequent is this, A+D−B−C; and the difference between the second Antecedent and its Consequent this, A−B−C+D; but these two Differences are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and therefore (by this 5th. Article) A+D. B+C :: A−B. C−D are Arithmetically Proportional.</p>
               <p>If of four Magnitudes, two be equal to the other two, they will be in reciprocal Arithmetical Proportion. For let A+B be equal to C+D; I say A. C :: D. B are Arithmetically Proportional. For if they be not, let A. C :: D. E (supposing E to be greater or less then B) be Arithmetically Proportional, and then A+E will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to C+D; wherefore A+B and C+D are not equal; which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>
               <p n="6">6 One Geometrical Proportion is the same with another Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Proportion, when the same Cause producing equal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in equal Times, determines both the Proportions.</p>
               <p>If a Point Uniformly moved, describe two Lines either with the same, or different Velocity, all the parts of them which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, that is, which are described in the same time, will be Two to Two in Geometrical Proportion, whether the Antecedents be taken in the same Line, or not. For, from the point A (in the 10 Figure at the end of the 14 Chapter) let the two Lines A D, A G, be described with Uniform Motion; and let there be taken
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59147:63"/>
in them two parts AB, AE, and again two other parts AC, AF; in such manner, that AB, AE, be contemporary, and likewise AC, AF contemporary. I say first (taking the Antecedents AB, AC in the Line AD, and the Consequents AE, AF in the Line AG) that AB. AC :: AE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> AF are Proportionals. For seeing (by the 8th. Chapter and the 15 Article) Velocity is Motion considered as determined by a certain Length or Line, in a certain Time trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by it, the quantity of the Line AB will be determined by the Velocity and Time by which the same AB is described; and for the same reason, the quantity of the Line AC will be determined by the Velocity and Time, by which the same AC is described; and therefore the proportion of AB to AC, whether it be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Equality, or of Excess or Defect, is determined by the Velocities and Times by which AB, AC are described; But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motion of the Point A upon AB and AC is Uniform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are both desribed with equal Velocity; and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of them have to the other the Proportion of Majority or of Minority, the sole cause of that Proportion is the difference of their Times; and by the same reason it is evident, that the proportion of AE to AF is determined by the difference of their Times onely. Seeing therefore AB, AE, as also AC, AF are contemporary, the difference of the Times in which AB and AC are described, is the same with that in which AE and AF are described. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the proportion of AB to AC, and the proportion of AE to AF are both determined by the same Cause. But the Cause which so determines the proportion of both, works equally in equal Times, for it is Uniform Motion; and therefore (by the last prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Definition) the proportion of AB to AC is the same with that of AE to AF; and consequently AB. AC :: AF. AF are Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals; which is the first.</p>
               <p>Secondly (taking the Antecedents in different Lines,) I say, AB. AE :: AC. AF are Proportionals; For seeing AB, AE are described in the same Time, the difference of the Velocities in which they are described are the sole Cause of the proportion they have to one another. And the same may be said of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of AC to AF. But seeing both the Lines AD and AG are passed over by Uniform Motion, the difference of the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which AB, AE are described, will be the same with the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59147:64"/>
difference of the Velocities, in which AC, AF are described. Wherefore the Cause which determines the proportion of AB to AE, is the same with that which determines the proportion of AC to AF; and therefore AB. AE :: AC. AF, are Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; which remained to be proved.</p>

               <p n="8">8 In an Hyperlogisme, that is, where the Proportion of the first Antecedent to its Consequent, is greater then the proportion of the second Antecedent to its Consequent, the Permutation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals, and the Addition of Proportionals to Proportionals, &amp; Substraction of them from one another; as also their Composition &amp; Division, &amp; their Multiplication &amp; Division by the same Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, produce always an Hyperlogisme.

Suppose the Point A to be moved over the whole Line AD with Uniform Motion; then the proportions as well of AB to AC, as of AC to AD are determined by the difference of the Times in which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; that is, AB has to AC such proportion as is determined by the different Times of their description; and AC to AD such proportion as is determined by their Times.

For the difference of the Times in which AD and AB are described is Excess of Time; for there goes more time to the description of AD then of AB; and the difference of the Times in which AB and AC are described is Defect of Time, for less Time goes to the description of AB then of AC; but this Excess, and Defect being ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or let it be as D to C, so A to something else, as to E, and let them be ordered thus E, A, B; for the proportion of E to B will be compounded of the proportions of E to A (that is, of C to D), and of A to B.

the Efficient quantities on both sides be equal in number, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Products will be compounded of the several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions which the Efficient quantities have to one another.</p>
               <p>First, let the two Products be A B, and C D, whereof one is made of the Multiplication of A into B, and the other of the Multiplication of C into D. I say the proportion of A B to C D is compounded of the proportions of the Efficient A to the Efficient C, and of the Efficient B to the Efficient D. For let A B, C B and C D be set in Order; and as B is to D, so let C be to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quantity as E; and let A, C, E, be set also in Order. Then by (the 4 <hi>Coroll.</hi> of the 6 Art.) it will be as A B the first quantity, to C B the second quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the first Order, so A to C in the second Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and again, as C B to C D in the first Order, so B to D, that is, (by Construction) so C to E in the second Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and therefore (by the last <hi>Corollary</hi>) A B. C D :: A. E will be Proportionals. But the proportion of A to E is compounded of the Proportions of A to C, and of B to D; Wherefore also the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of A B to C D is compounded of the same.

               <p>Secondly, let the two Products be A B F, and C D G, each of them made of three Efficients, the first of A, B and F, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of C, D and G; I say, the proportion of A B F to C D G is compounded of the proportions of A to C, of B to D and of F to G. For let them be set in Order as before; and as B is to D, so let C be to another quantity E; and again, as F is to G, so let E be to another, H; and let the first Order stand thus, A B F, C B F, C D F and C D G; and the second Order thus, A, C, E, H, Then the proportion of A B F to C B F in the first Order, will be as A to C in the second; and the Proportion of C B F to C D F in the first Order, as B to D, that is, as C to E (by Construction) in the second Order; and the Proportion of C D F to C D G in the first, as F to G, that is, as E to H (by Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) in the second Order; and therefore A B F. C D G :: A. H will be Proportionals. But the Proportion of A to H is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Proportions of A to C, B to D, and F to G. Wherefore the Proportion of the Product A B F to C D G is also

compounded of the same. And this operation serves, how many soever the Efficients be that make the Quantities given.</p>
               <p>From hence ariseth another way of Compounding many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions into One, namely, that which is supposed in the 5 Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 6 Book of <hi>Euclide;</hi> which is, by multiplying all the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of the Proportions into one another, and in like manner all the Consequents into one another. And from hence also it is evident, in the first place, That the Cause why Parallelograms, which are made by the Duction of two straight Lines into one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all Solids which are equal to Figures so made, have their proportions compounded of the proportions of the Efficients; And in the second place, why the Multiplication of two or more Fractions into one another, is the same thing with the Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the proportions of their several Numerators to their several Denominators. For examp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, if these Fractions ½, ⅔, ¾ be to be multiplyed into one another, the Numerators 1, 2, 3 are first to be multiplyed into one another, which make 6; and next the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minators 2, 3, 4, which make 24; and these two Products make the Fraction 6/24. In like manner, if the proportions of 1 to 2, of 2 to 3, and of 3 to 4 be to be compounded, by working as I have shewn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, the same proportion, of 6 to 24 will be produced.</p>
               <p n="15">15 If any Proportion be compounded with it self inverted, the Compound will be the Proportion of Equality. For let any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be given, as of A to B, and let the Inverse of it be that of C to D; and as C to D, so let B be to another quantity; for thus they will be compounded (by the 2 <hi>Coroll.</hi> of the 12 Art.) Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportion of C to D is the Inverse of the proportion of A to B, it will be as C to D, so B to A; and therefore if they be placed in Order A, B, A, the proportion compounded of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of A to B, and of C to D will be the proportion of A to A, that is, the proportion of Equality. And from hence the cause is evident, why two equal products have their Efficients reciprocally proportional. For, for the making of two products equal, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of their Efficients must be such, as being compounded may make the proportion of Equality, which cannot be, except one be the Inverse of the other; for if betwixt A and A any other quantity as C be interposed, their order will be A, C, A, and the later proportion of C to A will be the Inverse of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proportion of A to C.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59147:68"/>16 A Proportion is said to be multiplied by a Number when it is so often taken as there be Unities in that Number; and if the Proportion be of the Greater to the Less, then shall also the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Proportion be increased by the Multiplication; but when the Proportion is of the Less to the Greater, then as the Number increaseth, the quantity of the Proportion diminisheth; as in these three Numbers 4, 2, 1, the Proportion of 4 to 1, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Duplicate of 4 to 2, but also twice as great; but inverting the order of those Numbers thus 1, 2, 4, the Proportion of 1 to 2 is greater then that of 1 to 4; and therefore though the proportion of 1 to 4 be the Duplicate of 1 to 2, yet it is not twice so great as that of 1 to 2, but contrarily the half of it. In like manner, a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is said to be Divided, when between two quantities are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed one or more Means in continual Proportion, and then the Proportion of the first to the second is said to be Subduplicate of that of the first to the third, and Subtriplicate of that of the first to the fourth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This mixture of Proportions, where some are Proportions of Excess, others of Defect (as in a Merchants accompt of <hi>Debitor</hi> and <hi>Creditor</hi>) is not so easily reckoned as some think; but maketh the Composition of Proportions sometimes to be Addition, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Substraction; which soundeth absurdly to such as have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by Composition understood Addition, and by Diminution Substraction. Therefore to make this account a little clearer, we are to consider (that which is commonly assumed, and truly) that if there be never so many Quantities, the Proportion of the first to the last is compounded of the Proportions of the first to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and of the second to the third, and so on to the last, without regarding their Equality, Excess or Defect; So that if two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, one of Inequality, the other of Equality be added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Proportion is not thereby made Greater nor Less; as for example, if the Proportions of A to B and of B to B be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Proportion of the first to the second is as much as the Sum of both, because Proportion of Equality (being not quantity) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augmenteth quantity nor lesseneth it. But if there be three quantities A, B, C, unequal, and the first be greatest, the last least, then the Proportion of B to C is an addition to that of A to B, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59147:69"/>
makes it greater; and on the contrary, if A be the least, and C the greatest quantity, then doth the addition of the Proportion of B to C make the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded Proportion of A to C less then the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of A to B, that is, the Whole less then the Part. The Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiont herefore of Proportions is not in this case the Augmentation of them, but the Diminution; for the same quantity (<hi>Euclide</hi> the 5, 8.) compared with two other quantities hath a greater Proportion to the lesser of them then to the greater. Likewise, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions compounded are one of Excess, the other of Defect, if the first be of Excess, as in these numbers 8, 6, 9, the Proportion compounded, namely, of 8 to 9, is less then the Proportion of one of the parts of it, namely of 8 to 6; but if the Proportion of the first to the second be of Defect, and that of the second to the third be of Excess, as in these Numbers 6, 8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, then shall the Proportion of the first to the third be greater then that of the first to the second, as 6 hath a greater Proportion to 4 then to 8; the reason whereof is manifestly this, that the less any quantity is deficient of another, or the more one exceedeth another, the proportion of it to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the greater.</p>
               <p>Suppose now three quantities in continual Proportion A B 4, A C 6, A D 9. Because therefore A D is greater then A C, but not greater then A D, the proportion of A D to A C will be (by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi> 5, 8.) greater then that of A D to A D; and likewise, because the Proportions of A D to A C, and of A C to A B are the same, the proportions of A D to A C and of A C to A B (being both Proportions of Excess) make the whole Proportion of A D to A B (or of 9 to 4) not onely the Duplicate of A D to A C (that is, of 9 to 6) but also the Double, or twice so great. On the other side, because the proportion of A D to A D (or 9 to 9) being Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Equality, is no quantity, &amp; yet greater then that of A C to A D (or 6 to 9) it will be as 0-9 to 0-6, so A C to A D, and again, as 0-9 to 0-6, so 0-6 to 0-4; but 0-4, 0-6, 0-9 are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual proportion; and because 0-4 is greater then 0-6, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 0-4 to 0-6 will be Double to the proportion of 0-4 to 0-9, Double I say, and yet not Duplicate, but Subduplicate.</p>
               <p>If any be unsatisfied with this ratiocination, let him first consider that (by <hi>Euclide</hi> 5, 8) the proportion of A B to A C is greater then
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59147:69"/>
that of A B to A D wheresoever D be placed in the line A C prolonged; and the further off the point D is from C, so much the greater is the proportion of A B to A C then that of A B to A D.
<figure/>
There is therefore some point (which suppose be E) in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from C, as that the proportion of A B to A C will be twice as great as that of A B to A E. That considered, let him determine the length of the line A E, and demonstrate (if he can) that A E is greater or less then A D.</p>
               <p>By the same method, if there be more quantities then three, as A, B, C, D in continual Proportion, and A be the least, it may be made appear, that the Proportion of A to B is Triple Magnitude (though Subtriple in Multitude) to the Proportion of A to D.</p>

For let the Magnitudes be C, B, A, D, E, and let A, B, C, as also A, D, E be in Continual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; I say the proportion of D to B is Subduplicate of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of E to C. For the proportion of D to B is compounded of the proportions of D to A, and of A to B once taken; But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of E to C is compounded of the same twice taken; and therefore the proportion of D to B is Subduplicate of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of E to C- And in the same manner, if there were three Terms on either side, it might be demonstrated that the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of D to B would be Subtriplicate of that of the Extremes, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Now seeing the proportion of AB to AE is greater then that of AB to AF, the proportion of AB to AG, which is half the greater proportion, is greater then the proportion of AB to AI the half of the less Proportion; and therefore AI is greater then AG.

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Etween two points given, the shortest Line is that, whose extreme points cannot be drawn further asunder, withour altering the quantity, that is, without altering the proportion of that line to any other line given. For the Magnitude of a Line is computed by the greatest distance which may be between its extreme points; So that any one Line, whether it be extended, or bowed, has alwayes one and the same Length, because it can have but one greatest distance between its extreme points.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59147:73"/>And seeing the action by which a Straight Line is made Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or contrarily a Crooked Line is made Straight, is nothing but the bringing of its extreme points neerer to one another, or the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them further asunder, a CROOKED <hi>Line</hi> may rightly be defined to be <hi>That, whose extreme points may be understood to be drawn further asunder;</hi> and a STRAIGHT <hi>Line</hi> to be <hi>That, whose extreme points cannot be drawn further asunder; and comparatively, A more Crooked, to be That line whose extreme points are neerer to one another then those of the other, (supposing both the Lines to be of equal Length.)</hi> Now howsoever a Line be bowed, it makes alwayes a <hi>Sinus</hi> or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, sometimes on one side, sometimes on another; So that the same Crooked Line may either have its whole Cavity on one Side onely, or it may have it part on one side and part on other sides. Which being well understood, it will be easie to understand the following Comparisons of Straight and Crooked <hi>Lines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, If a Straight &amp; a Crooked Line have their Extreme points common, the Crooked Line is longer then the Straight Line. For if the extreme points of the Crooked Line be drawn out to their greatest distance, it wil be made a straight line, of which that which was a Straight Line from the beginning will be but a part; and therefore the Straight Line was shorter then the Crooked Line which had the same extreme points. And for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if two Crooked Lines have their extreme points common, and both of them have all their cavity on one and the same side, the outermost of the two will be the longest Line.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Straight Line and a perpetually Crooked Line ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be coincident, no not in the least part. For if they should, then not onely some Straight Line would have its extreme points com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with some Crooked Line, but also they would by reason of their coincidence, be equal to one another; which, as I have new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewn, cannot be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Between two points given there can be understood but one straight Line; because there cannot be more then one least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval or Length between the same points. For if there may be two, they will either be coincident, and so both of them will be one Straight Line; or if they be not coincident, then the application of one to the other by extension, will make the extended Line
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59147:73"/>
have its extreme points at greater distance then the other; and consequently it was Crooked from the beginning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From this last it follows, that two Straight Lines cannot include a Superficies. For if they have both their extreme points common, they are coincident; and if they have but one, or neither of them common, then at one, or both ends, the extreme points will be disjoyned, and include no Superficies, but leave all open and undetermined.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Every part of a Straight Line is a Straight Line. For seeing every part of a Straight Line is the least that can be drawn between its own extreme points, if all the parts should not consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Straight Line, they would all together be longer then the whole Line.</p>
               <p n="2">2 APLAIN, or a <hi>Plain Superficies, is that which is described by a Straight Line so moved that all the several points thereof describe several Straight Lines.</hi> A straight line therefore is necessarily all of it in the same Plain which it describes. Also the Straight Lines which are made by the points that describe a Plain, are all of them in the Same Plain. Moreover, if any Line whatsoever be moved in a Plain, the Lines which are described by it are all of them in the same Plain.</p>
               <p>All other <hi>Superficies</hi> which are not Plain, are Crooked, that is, are either <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>Convex.</hi> And the same Comparisons which were made of Straight and Crooked Lines: may also be made of Plain and Crooked Superficies. For</p>
               <p>First, If a Plain and a Crooked Superficies be terminated with the same Lines, the Crooked Superficies is greater then the Plain Superficies. For if the Lines of which the Crooked Superficies consists be extended, they will be found to be longer then those of which the Plain Superficies consists, which cannot be extended because they are Straight.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Two Superficies, wherof the one is Plain, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continually Crooked, cannot be coincident, no not in the least part. For if they were coincident they would be equal; nay, the same Superficies would be both Plain and Crooked, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Within the same terminating Lines, there can be no more then one Plain Superficies; because there can be but one least Superficies within the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59147:74"/>Fourthly, No number of Plain Superficies can include a Solid, unless more then two of them end in a Common <hi>Vertex.</hi> For if two Plains have both the same terminating Lines, they are coincident, that is, they are but one Superficies; and if their terminating Lines be not the same, they leave one or more sides open.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Every part of a Plain Superficies is a Plain Superficies. For seeing the whole Plain Superficies is the least of all those that have the same terminating Lines; and also every part of the same Superficies is the least of all those that are terminated with the same Lines; if every part should not constitute a Plain Superficies, all the parts put together would not be equal to the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Of <hi>Straightness,</hi> whether it be in Lines, or in Superficies there is but one kinde; but of <hi>Crookedness</hi> there are many kindes; for of Crooked Magnitudes, some are <hi>Congruous,</hi> that is, are coincident when they are applyed to one another; others are <hi>Incongruous.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, some are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Uniform,</hi> that is, have their parts howsoever taken, congruous to one another; others are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or of <hi>several Forms.</hi> Moreover, of such as are Crooked, some are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Crooked,</hi> others <hi>have parts which are not Crooked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 If a Straight Line be moved in a Plain, in such manner, that while one end of it stands still, the whole Line be carried round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, til it come again into the same place from whence it was first moved, it will describe a plain Superficies, which will be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every way by that Crooked Line which is made by that end of the Straight Line which was carried round. Now this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies is called a CIRCLE; and of this Circle, the Unmoved Point, is the the <hi>Center;</hi> the Crooked Line which terminates it, the <hi>Perimeter;</hi> and every part of that Crooked Line, a <hi>Circumference</hi> or <hi>Arch;</hi> the straight Line which generated the <hi>Circle,</hi> is the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter</hi> or <hi>Radius;</hi> and any straight Line which passeth through the Center, and is terminated on both sides in the Circumference is called the <hi>Diameter.</hi> Moreover, every point of the <hi>Radius</hi> which describes the Circle, describes in the same time its own Perimeter, terminating its own Circle, which is said to be <hi>Concentrick</hi> to all the other Circles, because this and all those have one common Center.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in every Circle, all Straight Lines from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59147:74"/>
to the Circumference are equal. For they are all coincident with the Radius which generates the Circle.</p>
               <p>Also the Diameter divides both the Perimeter and the Circle it self into two equal parts. For if those two parts be applyed to one another, and the Semiperimeters be coincident, then seeing they have one common Diameter, they will be equal; and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircles will be equal also; for these also will be coincident. But if the Semiperimeters be not coincident, then some one straight Line which passes through the Center (which Center is in the Diameter) will be cut by them in two points. Wherefore, seeing all the straight Lines from the Center to the Circumference are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, a part of the same straight Line will be equal to the whole; which is impossible.</p>
               <p>For the same reason the Perimeter of a Circle will be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, that is, any one part of it will be coincident with any other equal part of the same.</p>
               <p n="5">5 From hence may be collected this property of a Straight Line, namely, that it is all conteined in that Plain which conteins both its extreme points. For seeing both its extreme points are in the Plain, that Straight Line which describes the Plain will pass through them both; and if one of them be made a Center, and at the distance between both, a Circumference be described, whose Radius is the Straight Line which describes the Plain, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference will pass through the other point. Wherefore between the two propounded points, there is one straight line (by the Definition of a Circle) conteined wholly in the propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plain; and therefore if another straight Line might be drawn between the same points, and yet not be conteined in the same Plain, it would follow, that between two points two straight lines may be drawn; which has been demonstrated to be impossible.</p>
               <p>It may also be collected, That if two Plains cut one another, their common section will be a straight Line. For the two extreme points of the intersection are in both the intersecting Plains; and between those points a straight Line may be drawn; but a straight Line between any two points is in the same Plain in which the Points are; and seeing these are in both the Plains, the straight line which connects them will also be in both the same Plains, and therefore it is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon section of both. And every other Line that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59147:75"/>
can be drawn between those points will be either coincident with that Line, that is, it will be the Same Line; or it will not be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident; and then it wil be in neither, or but in one of those Plains.</p>
               <p>As a straight Line may be understood to be moved round about whilest one end thereof remains fixed, as the Center; so in like manner it is easie to understand, that a Plain may be circumdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about a straight line, whilest the straight line remaines still in one and the same place, as the <hi>Axis</hi> of that motion. Now from hence it is manifest, that any three Points are in some one Plain. For as any two Points, if they be connected by a straight Line, are understood to be in the same Plaine in which the straight Line is; so, if that Plaine be circumduced about the same straight Line, it will in its revolution take in any third Point, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be situate; and then the three Points will be all in that Plaine; and consequently the three straight Lines which connect those Points, will also be in the same Plain.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Two Lines are said to <hi>Touch</hi> one another, which being both drawne to one and the same point, will not cut one another, though they be produced, produced I say in the same manner in which they were generated. And therefore if two straight Lines touch one another in any one point, they wil be contiguous through their whole length. Also two Lines continually crooked wil do the same, if they be congruous, and be applyed to one another accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their congruity; otherwise, if they be incongruously applyed, they will, as all other crooked Lines, touch one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (where they touch) but in one point onely. Which is manifest from this, that there can be no congruity between a straight line and a line that is continually crooked; for otherwise the same line might be both straight and crooked. Besides when a straight line touches a crooked line, if the straight line be never so little moved about upon the point of contact, it will cut the crooked line; for seeing it touches it but in one point, if it incline any way, it will do more then touch it; that is, it will either be congruous to it, or it will cut it; but it cannot be congruous to it; and therefore it will cut it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 An Angle, according to the most general acception of the word, may be thus defined; <hi>When two Lines, or many Superficies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in one sole point, and diverge every where else, the quantity of</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59147:75"/>
                  <hi>that divergence is an</hi> ANGLE. And an Angle is of two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orts; for first it may be made by the concurrence of Lines, and then it is a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall Angle;</hi> or by the concurrence of Superficies, and then it is called a <hi>Solid Angle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, from the two wayes by which two lines may diverge from one another, Superficial Angles are divided into two kindes. For two straight lines which are applyed to one another, and are contiguous in their whole length, may be separated or pulied open in such manner, that their concurrence in one point will still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; And this Separation or Opening may be either by Circular Motion, the Center whereof is their point of concurrence, and the Lines will still ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in their straightness, the quantity of which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or Divergence is an <hi>Angle</hi> simply so called; Or they may be separated by continual Flexion or Curvation in every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point; and the quantity of this Separation is that which is called an <hi>Angle of Contingence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides of Superficial Angles simply so called, those which are in a plain Superficies are Plain; and those which are not plain, are denominated from the Superficies in which they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, those are <hi>Straight-lined Angles</hi> which are made by straight lines; as those which are made by crooked lines are <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-lined;</hi> and those which are made both of straight and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lines, are <hi>Mixed Angles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Two Arches inter cepted between two <hi>Radii</hi> of Concentrick Circles, have the same proportion to one another, which their whole Perimeters have to one another. For let the point A (in the first Figure) be the Center of the two Circles B C D and E F G; in which the <hi>Radii</hi> A E B and A F C inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Arches B C and E F; I say the proportion of the Arch B C to the Arch E F, is the same with that of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimet B C D to the Perimerer er E F G. For if the Radius A F C be understood to be moved about the Center A with Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar &amp; Uniform Motion, that is, with equal Swiftness every where, the point C will in a certain time describe the Perimeter B C D, and in a part of that time the Arch B C; and because the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are equal by which both the Arch and the whole Perimeter are described, the proportion of the magnitude of the Perimeter B C D to the magnitude of the Arch B C, is determined by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59147:76"/>
but the difference of the times in which the Perimeter and the Arch are described. But both the Perimeters are described in one and the same time, and both the Arches in one and the same time; and therefore the proportions of the Perimeter B C D to the Arch B C, and of the Perimeter E F G to the Arch E F, are both determined by the same cause. Wherefore B C D, B C :: E F G. E F are Proportionals (by the 6 <hi>Art.</hi> of the last Chapter), and by Permutation B C D. E F G :: B C. E F will also be Proportionals, which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Nothing is contributed towards the Quantity of an Angle, neither by the Length, nor by the Equality, nor by the Inequality of the lines which comprehend it. For the lines A B and A C com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the same Angle which is comprehended by the lines A E and A F, or A B and A F. Nor is an Angle either increased or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished by the absolute quantity of the Arch which subtends the same; for both the greater Arch B C, and the lesser Arch E F are subtended to the same Angle. But the quantity of an Angle is estimated by the quantity of the subtending Arch compared with the quantity of the whole Perimeter. And therefore the Quantity of an Angle simply so called may be thus defined.</p>

                  <hi>The Quantity of an Angle, is an Arch or Circumference of a Circle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by its proportion to the whole Perimeter.</hi> So that when an Arch is intercepted between two straight lines drawn from the Center, look how great a portion that Arch is of the whole Perimeter, so great is the Angle. From whence it may be understood, that when the lines which contein an Angle are straight lines, the quantity of that Angle may be taken at any distance from the Center. But if one, or both of the conteining lines be crooked, then the quantity of the Angle is to be taken in the least distance from the Center, or from their concurrence; for the least distance is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a straight line, seeing no crooked line can be imagined so little, but that there may he a less straight line. And although the least straight line cannot be given, because the least given line may still be divided, yet we may come to a part so small, as is not at all considerable; which we call a Point. And this point may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be in a straight line which touches a crooked line; for an Angle is generated by separating by circular motion one straight line from another which touches it, (as has been said above in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59147:76"/>
7th <hi>Article</hi>). Wherefore an Angle which two crooked lines make is the same with that which is made by two straight lines which touch them.</p>
               <p n="10">10 From hence it follows, that <hi>Vertical Angles,</hi> such as are ABC, D B F (in the second Figure) are equal to one another. For if from the two Semiperimeters D A C, F D A which are equal to one another, the common Arch D A be taken away, the remayning Arches A C, D F will be equal to one another.</p>
               <p>Another distinction of Angles is, into <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Oblique. A Right Angle is that, whose quantity is the fourth part of the Perimeter.</hi> And the lines which make a Right Angle are said to be <hi>Perpendicular</hi> to one another. Also of Oblique Angles, that which is greater then a Right, is called an <hi>Obtuse Angle;</hi> and that which is less, an <hi>Acute Angle.</hi> From whence it follows, that all the Angles that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be made at one and the same Point, together taken, are equal to four Right Angles; because the quantities of them all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the whole Perimeter. Also, that all the Angles which are made on one side of a straight line from any one point taken in the same, are equal to two Right Angles; for if that point be made the Center, that straight line will be the Diameter of a Circle, by whose Circumference the quantity of an Angle is determined; and that Diameter will divide the Perimeter into two equal parts.</p>
               <p n="11">11 If a Tangent be made the Diameter of a Circle whose Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the point of Contact, a straight line drawn from the Center of the former Circle to the Center of the later Circle, will make two Angles with the Tangent (that is, with the Diameter of the later Circle) equal to two Right Angles (by the last <hi>Article</hi>). And because (by the 6th <hi>Article)</hi> the Tangent has on both sides e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual inclination to the Circle, each of them will be a Right Angle; as also the Semidiameter will be perpendicular to the same Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Moreover, the Semidiameter, in as much as it is the Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, is the least straight line which can be drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Center to the Tangent; and every other straight line that reaches the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent will pass out of the Circle, and will therefore be greater then the Semidiameter. In like manner, of all the straight lines which may be drawn from the Center to the Tangent, that is the greatest which makes the greatest Angle with the Perpenpicular; which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59147:77"/>
will be manifest, if about the same Center another Circle be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, whose Semidiameter is a straight line taken neerer to the Perpendicular, and there be drawn a Perpendicular (that is, a Tangent) to the same.</p>
               <p>From whence it is also manifest, that if two straight lines which make equal Angles on either side of the Perpendicular, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Tangent, they will be equal.</p>
               <p n="12">12 There is in <hi>Euclide</hi> a Definition of Straight-lined Parallels; but I do not find that Parallels in general, are any where defined; and therefore for an Universal definition of them, I say, that <hi>Any two lines whatsoever (Straight or Crooked) as also any two Superficies, are</hi> PARALLEL, <hi>when two equal straight lines wheresoever they fall upon them, make always equal Angles with each of them.</hi> From which Definition it follows.</p>
               <p>First, that any two straight lines not enclined opposite wayes, falling upon two other straight lines which are Parallel, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting equal parts in both of them, are themselves also equal and Parallel. As if AB and CD (in the third Figure) enclined both the same way (fall upon the Parallels AC and BD, and AC and BD be equal, AB and CD will also be equal and Parallel. For the Perpendiculars BE and DF being drawn, the Right Angles EBD and FDH will be equal. Wherefore seeing EF and BD are parallel, the angles EBA and FDC will be equal. Now if DC be not equal to BA, let any other straight line equal to BA be drawn from the point D; which seeing it cannot fall upon the point C, let it fall upon G. Whereore AG will be either greater or less then BD; and therefore the angles EBA and FDG are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, as was supposed. Wherefore AB and CD are equal; which is the first.</p>
               <p>Again, because they make equal Angles with the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars BE and DF; therefore the Angle CDH will be equal to the Angle ABD, and (by the Definition of Parallels) AB and CD will be parallel; which is the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Plain which is included both wayes within parallel lines is called a</hi> PARALLELOGRAM.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Corollary.</hi> From this last it follows, That the Angles ABD and CDH are equal; that is, that a straight line (as BH) falling upon two Parallels (as AB and CD) makes the internal Angle ABD equal to the external and opposite Angle CDH.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59147:77"/>2 <hi>Coroll.</hi> And from hence again it follows, that a straight line falling upon two Parallels, makes the alternate Angles equal; that is, the Angle AGF (in the fourth figure) equal to the Angle GFD. For seeing GFD is equal to the external opposite Angle EGB, it will be also equal to its vertical Angle AGF, which is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to GFD.</item>
                  <item>3 <hi>Coroll.</hi> That the internal Angles on the same side of the line FG are equal to two Right Angles. For the Angles at F, namely GFC and GFD are equal to two Right Angles. But GFD is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to its alternate Angle AGF. Wherefore both the Angles GFC and AGF which are internal on the same side of the line FG, are equal to two Right Angles.</item>
                  <item>4 <hi>Coroll.</hi> That the three Angles of a straight-lined plain Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle are equal to two Right Angles; and any side being produced, the external Angle will be equal to the two opposite internal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. For if there be drawn by the Vertex of the plain Triangle ABC (figure 5.) a Parallel to any of the sides, as to AB, the Angles A and B will be equal to their alternate Angles E &amp; F, &amp; the Angle C is common. But (by the 10th <hi>Article</hi>) the three Angles E, C and F are equal to two Right Angles; and therefore the three Angles of the Triangle are equal to the same; which is the first. Again, the two Angles B and D are equal to two Right Angles (by the 10th <hi>Article</hi>). Wherefore taking away B, there will remain the Angles A and C equal to the Angle D; which is the second.</item>
                  <item>5 <hi>Coroll.</hi> If the Angles A and B be equal, the sides AC and CB will also be equal, because AB and EF are parallel; And on the contrary, if the sides AC and CB be equal, the Angles A and B will also be equal. For if they be not equal, let the Angles B and G be equal. Wherefore seeing GB and EF are parallels, and the Angles G and B equal, the sides GC and CB will also be equal; and because CB and AC are equal by supposition, CG and CA will also be equal; which cannot be (by the 11th <hi>Article.</hi>)</item>
                  <item>6 <hi>Coroll.</hi> From hence it is manifest, that if two <hi>Radii</hi> of a Circle be connected by a straight Line, the Angles they make with that connecting Line will be equal to one another; and if there be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that segment of the Circle which is subtended by the same line which connects the <hi>Radii,</hi> then the Angles which those <hi>Radii</hi> make with the circumference wil also be equal to one another. For
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59147:78"/>
a straight line which subtends any Arch, makes equal Angles with the same, because if the Arch and the Subtense be divided in the middle, the two halves of the segment wil be congruous to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reason of the Uniformity both of the Circumference of the Circle and of the straight Line.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="13">13 Perimeters of Circles are to one another as their Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters are. For let there be any two Circles, as (in the first figure) BCD the greater, and EFG the lesser, having their common Center at A; and let their Semidiameters be AC and AE. I say AC has the same proportion to AE which the Perimeter BCD has to the Perimeter EFG. For the magnitude of the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters AC and AE is determined by the distances of the points C and E from the Center A; and the same distances are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the uniform motion of a point from A to C in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that in equal times the distances acquired be equal. But the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimeters BCD and EFG are also determined by the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the points C and E from the Center A; and therefore the Perimeters BCD and EFG, as well as the Semidiameters AC and AE have their magnitudes determined by the same cause, which cause makes in equal times equal spaces. Wherefore (by the 13 Chapter and 6th <hi>Article</hi>) the Perimeters of Circles and their Semidiameters are Proportionals; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="14">14 If two straight Lines w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitute an Angle, be cut by straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined Parallels, the intercepted Parallels will be to one another, as the parts w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Vertex. Let the straight lines AB and AC (in the 6 figure) make an Angle at A, &amp; be cut by the two straight-lined Parallels BC and DE, so that the parts cut off from the Vertex in either of those Lines (as in AB) may be AB and AD. I say the Parallels BC and DE are to one another as the parts AB and AD. For let AB be divided into any number of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, as into AF, FD, DB; and by the points F and D, let FG and DE be drawn Parallel to the base BC, and cut AC in G and E; and again by the points G and E let other straight lines be drawn Parallel to AB, and cut BC in H and I. If now the point A be understood to be moved uniformly over AB, and in the same time B be moved to C, and all the points F, D and B be moved u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly and with equal Swiftness over FG, DE, and BC; then shall B pass over BH (equal to FG) in the same time that A pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses over AF; and AF and FG will be to one another as their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities

Wherefore, AF. GF:: AD. DE:: AB. BC are Proportionals.</p>
               <p>The Subtenses of equal Angles in different Circles (as the straight lines BC and FE (in the 1 figure) are to one another as the Arches which they subtend. For (by the 8th <hi>Article</hi>) the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of equal Angles are to one another as their Perimeters are; and (by the 13th <hi>Art.</hi>) the Perimeters as their Semidiameters; But the the Subtenses BC and FE are parallel to one another by reason of the equality of the Angles which they make with the Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters; and therefore the same Subtenses (by the last precedent <hi>Article</hi>) will be proportional to the Semidiameters, that is, to the Perimeters, that is, to the Arches which they subtend.</p>
               <p n="15">15 If in a Circle any number of equal Subtenses be placed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after one another, and straight lines be drawn from the extreme point of the first Subtense to the extreme points of all the rest, The first Subtense being produced will make with the second Subtense an external Angle double to that which is made by the same first Subtense and a Tangent to the Circle touching it in the extreme point thereof; and if a straight line which subtends two of those Arches be produced, it will make an external Angle with the third Subtense, triple to the Angle which is made by the Tangent with the first Subtense; and so continually. For with the Radius AB (in the 7th figure) let a circle be described, &amp; in it let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number of equal Subtenses BC, CD &amp; DE be placed; also let BD &amp; BE be drawn; &amp; by producing BC, BD &amp; BE to any distance in G, H and I, let them make Angles with the Subtenses which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another, namely the external Angles GCD, and HDE. Lastly, let the Tangent KB be drawn, making with the first Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense the Angle KBC. I say the Angle GCD is double to the Angle KBC, and the Angle HDE triple to the same Angle KBC. For if AC be drawn cutting BD in M, and from the point C

               <p>It may also be demonstrated that the external Angle made by a Subtense produced and the next equal Subtense, is equal to an Angle from the Center insisting upon the same Arch; As in the last Diagram, the Angle GCD is equal to the Angle CAD; For the external Angle GCD is double to the Angle CBD; and the Angle CAD insisting upon the same Arch CD, is also double to the same Angle CBD or KBC.</p>

For first, an Angle of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingence is made by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual flexion, so that in the generation of it there is no circular motion at all, in which consists the nature of an Angle simply so called; and therefore it cannot be compared with it according to Quantity. Secondly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external Angle made by a Subtense produced and the next Subtense, is equal to an Angle from the Center insisting upon the same Arch (as in the last figure the Angle GCD is equal to the Angle CAD) the Angle of Contingence wil be equal to that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle from the Center which is made by AB and the same AB; for no part of a Tangent can subtend any Arch; but as the point of Contact is to be taken for the Subtense, so the Angle of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to be accounted for the external Angle, and equal to that Angle whose Arch is the same point B.</p>
               <p>Now seeing an Angle in general is defined to be the Opening o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59147:80"/>
but this quantity consists in greater and less Flexion; for how much the greater a Circle is, so much the neerer comes the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of it to the nature of a straight Line; for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of a Circle being made by the curvation of a straight line, the less that straight line is, the greater is the curvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; therfore when one straight line is a Tangent to many Circles, the Angle of Contingence which it makes with a less Circle is greater then that which it makes with a greater Circle.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore is added to, or taken from an Angle simply so called, by the addition to it or taking from it of never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angles of Contingence. And as an Angle of one sort can never be equal to an Angle of the other sort, so they cannot be either greater or less then one another.</p>
               <p>From whence it follows, that an Angle of a Segment, that is, the Angle which any straight line makes with any Arch, is equal to the Angle which is made by the same straight line, &amp; another which touches the Circle in the point of their Concurrence; as in the last figure, the Angle which is made between GB and BK is equal to that which is made between GB and the Arch BC.</p>

It remains that I speak briefly of the nature of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symptotes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asymptosy</hi> depends upon this, that Quantity is infinitly divisible. And from hence it follows, that any line being given, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy supposed to be moved from one extreme thereof towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is possible (by taking degrees of Velocity alwayes lesse and lesse in such proportion as the parts of the Line are made lesse by continual division) that the same Body may be alwayes moved forwards in that Line, and yet never reach the end of it. For it is manifest that if any straight Line, as AF (in the 8th figure) be cut any where in B, and again BF be cut in C, and CF in D, and DF in E, and so eternally, and there be drawn from the point F the straight Line FF at any Angle AFF; and lastly, if the straight Lines AF, BF, CF, DF, EF, &amp;c. having the same proportion to one another with the Segments of the Line AF, be set in order and parallel to the same AF, the crooked Line ABCDE and the straight Line FF will be <hi>Asymptotes,</hi> that is, they will alwayes come neerer and neerer together, but never touch one another. Now because any Line may be cut eternally according to the proportions which the Segments have to one another, therefore the divers kindes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symptotes</hi> are infinite in number, and not necessary to be further spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this place. In the nature of Asymptotes in general there is no more, then that they come still neerer and neerer but never touch. But in special in the Asymptosie of Hyperbolique Lines, it is understood they should approach to a distance lesse then any given quantity.</p>
               <p n="20">20 SITUATION <hi>is the relation of one place to another;</hi> &amp; where there are many places, their <hi>Situation</hi> is determined by four things; By
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59147:81"/>
                  <hi>their Distances from one another;</hi> By <hi>several Distances from a place assigned;</hi> By <hi>the order of straight lines drawn from a place assigned to the places of them all;</hi> and by <hi>the Angles which are made by the lines so drawn.</hi> For if their Distances, Order, and Angles be given, that is, be certainly known, their several places will also be so certainly known, as that they can be no other.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Points, how many soever they be, have <hi>Like Situation</hi> with an equal number of other Points, when all the straight lines that are drawn from some one point to all these, have severally the same proportion to those that are drawn in the same order and at equal Angles from some one point to all those. For let there be any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Points as A, B and C, (in the 9 figure), to which from some one point D let the straight Lines DA, DB and DC be drawn; and let there be an equal number of other Points as E, F and G, and from some point H let the straight Lines HE, HF and HG be drawn, so that the Angles ADB and BDC be severally and in the same order equal to the Angles EHF and FHG, and the straight Lines DA, DB and DC proportional to the straight Lines HE, HF and HG; I say the three points A, B and C, have Like Situation with the three points E, F &amp; G, or are placed Alike. For if HE be understood to be layed upon DA, so that the point H be in D, the point F will be in the straight Line DB by reason of the equality of the Angles ADB and EHF; and the point G will be in the straight Line DC by reason of the equality of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles BDC and FHG; and the strright Lines AB and EF, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so BC and FG will be parallel, because AD. ED :: BH. FH :: CD. GH are Proportionals by construction; and therefore the distances between the points A and B, and the points B and C, will be proportional to the distances between the points E and F, and the points F and G. Wherefore in the situation of the points A, B and C, and the situation of the points E, F and G the Angles in the same order are equal, so that their situations differ in nothing but the inequality of their distances from one another, and of their distances from the points D and H. Now in both the orders of Points those inequalities are equal; for AB. BC :: EF. FG, which are their distances from one another, as also DA. DB. DC :: HE. HF. HG which are their distances from the assumed points D and H, are Proportionals. Their difference therefore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59147:81"/>
consists solely in the magnitude of their distances. But by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>Like</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Art,</hi> 2) those things which differ onely in Magnitude are Like. Wherefore the points A, B and C have to one another Like Situation with the points E, F and G, or are placed Alike; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>FIGURE, <hi>is quantity determined by the Situation, or placing of all its extreme Points.</hi> Now I call those points Extreme which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the place which is without the figure. In Lines therefore and Superficies all Points may be called Extreme, but in Solids onely those which are in the Superficies that includes them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like Figures,</hi> are those, whose extreme points in one of them, are all placed like all the extreme points in the other; for such Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures differ in nothing but Magnitude.</p>
               <p>And like Figures are <hi>alike placed,</hi> when in both of them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologal straight lines, that is, the straight lines which connect the points which answer one another are parallel, and have their proportional sides enclined the same way.</p>
               <p>And seeing every Straight Line is like every other Straight Line, and every Plain like every other Plain when nothing but Plainness is considered; if the Lines which include Plains, or the Superficies which include Solids have their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions known, it will not be hard to know whether any Figure be like or unlike to another propounded Figure.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the <hi>First Grounds of Philosophy.</hi> The next place belongs to <hi>Geometry;</hi> in which the Quantities of Figures are sought out from the Proportions of Lines and Angles. Wherefore it is necessary for him that would study Geometry to know first what is the nature of Quantity, Proportion, Angle and Figure.

But because this part of Philosophy having been improved by the best Wits of all Ages has afforded greater plenty of matter then can well be thrust together within the narrow limits of this discourse; I thought fit to admonish the Reader, that before he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59147:83"/>
proceed further, he take into his hands the Works of <hi>Euclide, Archimedes, Apollonius</hi> and other as well Ancient as Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For to what end is it to do over again that which is already done? The little therefore that I shall say concerning Geometry in some of the following Chapters, shall be such onely as is new, and conducing to Natural Philosophy.</p>
               <p>I have already delivered some of the Principles of this doctrine in the 8 &amp; 9 Chapters, which I shall briefly put together here, that the Reader in going on may have their light neerer at hand.</p>
               <p>First therefore in the 8th Chap. and 10 <hi>Article, Motion</hi> is defined to be <hi>the continual privation of one place, and acquisition of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is there shewn, that <hi>Whatsoever is Moved is Moved in Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the same Chap. 11. <hi>Article,</hi> I have defined <hi>Rest to be when a Body remains for some time in one place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is there shewn, that <hi>Whatsoever is Moved is not in any determined place;</hi> as also that the same <hi>has been Moved, is still Moved, and will yet be Moved;</hi> So that in every part of that Space in which Motion is made, we may consider three Times, namely the <hi>Past,</hi> the <hi>Present,</hi> and the <hi>Future Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, in the 15 <hi>Article</hi> of the same Chapter, I have defined <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity</hi> or <hi>Swiftness to be Motion considered as Power, namely, that Power by which a Body Moved may in a certain Time transmit a certain Length;</hi> which also may more briefly be enunciated thus, <hi>Velocity is the quantity of Motion determined by Time and Line.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, in the same Chap. 16. <hi>Article,</hi> I have shewn that <hi>Motion is the Measure of Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, in the same Chap. 17th <hi>Art.</hi> I have defined Motions to be Equally Swift, when in Equal Times Equal Lengths are transmitted by them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, in the 18 <hi>Article</hi> of the same Chapter, <hi>Motions</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be <hi>Equal, when the Swiftness of one Moved Body computed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of its magnitude, is equal to the Swiftness of another computed also in every part of its magnitude.</hi> From whence it is to be noted, that <hi>Motions Equal to one another, and Motions Equally Swift,</hi> do not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same thing; for when two horses draw abrest, the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both is greater then the Motion of either of them singly; but the Swiftness of both together is but Equal to that of either.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, in the 19 <hi>Article</hi> of the same Chapter, I have shewn,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59147:83"/>
that <hi>Whatsoever is at Rest will alwayes be at Rest, unless there be some other Body besides it, which by getting into its place, suffers it no longer to remain at Rest.</hi> And that <hi>Whatsoever is Moved, will alwayes be Moved, unless there be some other Body besides it, which hinders its Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, In the 9 Chapter and 7 <hi>Article,</hi> I have demonstrated, that <hi>When any Body is moved which was formerly at Rest, the immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of that Motion is in some other Moved and Contiguou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventhly, I have shewn in the same place, that <hi>Whatsoever is Moved, will always be Moved in the same way, and with the same Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if it be not hindered by some other Moved and Contiguou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To which Principles I shall here add these that follow. First, I define ENDEAVOUR <hi>to be Motion made in less Space and Time then can be given;</hi> that is, <hi>less then can be determined or assigned by Exposition or Number;</hi> that is, <hi>Motion made through the length of a Point, and in an Instant or Point of Time.</hi> For the explayning of which Definition it must be remembred, that by a Point is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that which has no quantity, or which cannot by any means be divided (for there is no such thing in Nature); but that whose quantity is not at all considered, that is, whereof neither quantity nor any part is computed in demonstration; so that a Point is not to be taken for an Indivisible, but for an Undivided thing; as also an Instant is to be taken for an Undivided, and not for an Indivisible Time.</p>
               <p>In like manner Endeavour is to be conceived as Motion; but so, as that neither the quantity of the Time in which, nor of the Line in which it is made may in demonstration be at all brought into comparison with the quantity of that Time, or of that Line of which it is a part. And yet, as a Point may be compared with a Point, so one Endeavour may be compared with another Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and one may be found to be greater or lesse then another. For if the Vertical points of two Angles be compared, they will be equal or unequal in the same proportion which the Angles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have to one another. Or if a straight Line cut many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences of Concentrick Circles, the inequality of the points of intersection will be in the same proportion which the Perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have to one another. And in the same manner, if two Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begin and end both together, their Endeavours will be Equal or Unequal according to the proportion of their Velocities; as we
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59147:84"/>
see a bullet of Lead descend with greater Endeavour then a ball of Wooll,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I define IMPETUS <hi>or Quickness of Motion, to be the Swiftness or Velocity of the Body moved, but considered in the several points of that time in which it is moved; In which sense</hi> Impetus <hi>is nothing else but the quantity or velocity of Endeavour. But considered with the whole time, it is the whole velocity of the Body moved, taken together throughout all the time, and equal to the Product of a Line representing the time multiplyed into a Line representing the arithmetically mean</hi> Impetus <hi>or Quickness.</hi> Which Arithmetical Mean what it is, is defined in the 29th <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of the 13th Chapter.</p>
               <p>And because in equal times the wayes that are passed are as the Velocities, and the <hi>Impetus</hi> is the Velocity they go withal reckoned in all the several points of the times, it followeth that during any time whatsoever, howsoever the <hi>Impetus</hi> be encreased or decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the length of the way passed over shall be encreased or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in the same proportion; and the same Line shall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent both the way of the Body moved, and the several <hi>Impetus</hi> or degrees of Swiftness wherewith the way is passed over.</p>
               <p>And if the Body moved be not a point, but a straight line mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so as that every point thereof make a several straight line, the Plain described by its motion, whether Uniform, Accelerated or Retarded, shall be greater or less (the time being the same) in the same proportion with that of the <hi>Impetus</hi> reckoned in one motion to the <hi>Impetus</hi> reckoned in the other. For the reason is the same in Parallelograms and their Sides,</p>
               <p>For the same cause also if the Body moved be a Plain, the Solid described shall be still greater or less in the proportions of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Impetus</hi> or Quicknesses reckoned through one Line, to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Impetus</hi> reckoned through another.</p>
               <p>This understood, let ABCD (in the first figure of the 17th Chapter) be a Parallelogram; in which suppose the side AB to be moved parallelly to the opposite side CD, decreasing al the way till it vanish in the point C, and so describing the figure ABEFC; the point B as AB decreaseth, will therefore describe the Line BEFC; and suppose the time of this motion designed by the line CD; and in the same time CD suppose the side AC to be moved parallelly and uniformly to BD. From the point O taken at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59147:84"/>
in the Line CD, draw OR parallel to BD, cutting the Line BEFC in E, and the side AB in R. And again from the point Q taken also at adventure in the Line CD, draw QS parallel to BD, cutting the Line BEFC in F, and the side AB in S; and draw EG and FH parallel to CD, cutting AC in G and H. Lastly, suppose the same construction done in all the points possible of the Line BEFC. I sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that as the proportions of the Swiftnesses wherewith QF, OE, DB, and all the rest supopsed to be drawn parallel to DB, and terminated in the Line BEFC, are to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of their several Times designed by the several parallels HF, GE, AB and all the rest supposed to be drawn parallel to the Line of time CD, and terminated in the Line BEFC (the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate to the aggregate) so is the Area or Plain DBEFC to the Area or Plain ACFEB. For as AB decreasing continually by the line BEFC vanisheth in the time CD into the point C, so in the same time the line DC continually decreasing vanisheth by the same line CFEB into the point B; and the point D de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth in that decreasing motion the line DB equall to the line AC described by the point A in the decreasing motion of A &amp; B; &amp; their swiftnesses are therefore equal. Again, because in the time GE the point O describeth the line OE, and in the same time the point R describeth the line RE, the line OE shall be to the line RE, as the swiftness wherewith OE is described to the swiftness wherwith RE is described. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, because in the same time HF the point Q describeth the Line QF, and the point S the Line SF, it shall be as the swiftness by which QF is described to the swiftness by which SF is described, so the Line it self QF to the Line it self SF; and so in all the Lines that can possibly be drawn parallel to BD in the points where they cut the Line BEFC. But all the parallels to BD, as RE, SF, AC and the rest that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be drawn from the Line AB to the Line BEFC make the Area of the Plain ABEFC; and all the parallels to the same BD, as QF, OE, DB &amp; the rest drawn to the points where they cut the same Line BEFC make the Area of the Plain BEFCD. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aggregate of the Swiftnesses wherwith the Plain BEFCD is described is to the aggregate of the Swiftnesses wherewith the Plain ACFEB is described, so is the Plain it self BEFCD to the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59147:85"/>
Plain it self ACFEB. But the aggregate of the Times represented by the parallels AB, GE, HF and the rest, maketh also the Area ACFEB. And therefore as the aggregate of all the Lines QF, OE, DB and all the rest of the Lines parallel to BD and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Line BEFC is to the aggregate of all the Lines HF, GE, AB and all the rest of the Lines parallel to CD &amp; terminated in the same Line BEFC; that is, as the aggregate of the Lines of Swiftness to the aggregate of the lines of Time, or as the whole Swiftness in the parallels to DB to the whole Time in the parallels to CD, so is the Plain BEFCD to the Plain ACFEB. And the proportions of QF to FH, and of OE to EG, and of DB to BA, and so of all the rest taken together, are the proportion of the Plain DBEFC to the Plain ABEFC. But the Lines QF, OE, DB and the rest are the Lines that designe the Swifness; and the Lines HF, GE, AB &amp; the rest are the Lines that designe the Times of the motions; and therefore the proportion of the Plain DBEFC to the Plain ABEFC is the proportions of all the Velocities taken together, to all the Times taken together. Wherefore as the proportions of the Swiftnesses, &amp;c. which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>The same holds also in the diminution of the Circles whereof the lines of Time are the Semidiameters, as may easily be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by imagining the whole Plain ABCD turned round upon the Axis BD; for the Line BEFC will be every where in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies so made, and the Lines HG, GE, AB which here are Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelograms will be there Cylinders, the Diameters of whose bases are the lines HF, GE, AB, &amp;c. and the Altitude a point, that is to say, a quantity less then any quantity that can possibly be named; and the Lines QF, OE, DB, &amp;c. small solids whose lengths and breadths are less then any quantity that can be named.</p>
               <p>But this is to be noted, that unless the proportion of the summe of the Swiftnesses to the proportion of the summe of the Times be determined, the proportion of the Figure DBEFC to the Figure ABEFC cannot be determined.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I define RESISTANCE <hi>to be the endeavour of one moved Body, either wholly or in part contrary to the endeavour of another moved Body, which toucheth the same.</hi> I say wholly contrary, when the endeavour of two Bodies proceeds in the same straight Line from the opposite extremes, and contrary in part, when two Bodies
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59147:85"/>
have their endeavour in two Lines, which proceeding from the extreme points of a straight Line, meet without the same.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that I may define what it is to PRESSE, I say that <hi>Of two moved Bodies one Presses the other, when with its Endeavour it makes either all or part of the other Body to go out of its place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>A Body which is pressed and not wholly removed is said to</hi> RESTORE <hi>it self, when (the pressing Body being taken away) the parts which were moved, do by reason of the internal constitution of the pressed Body, return every one into its own place.</hi> And this we may observe in Springs, in blown Bladders, and in many other Bodies, whose parts yeild more or less to the Endeavour which the pressing Body makes at the first arrival; but afterwards (when the pressing Body is removed) they do by some force within them <hi>Restore</hi> themselves, and give their whole Body the same figure it had before.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I define FORCE <hi>to be the</hi> Impetus <hi>or Quickness of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion multiplyed either into it self, or into the Magnitude of the Movent, by means wherof the said Movent works more or less upon the Body that resists it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Having premised thus much, I shal now demonstrate, First, That if a point moved come to touch another point which is at rest, how little soever the <hi>Impetus</hi> or quickness of its motion be, it shall move that other point. For if by that <hi>Impetus</hi> it do not at all move it out of its place, neither shall it move it, with double the same <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus;</hi> for nothing doubled is still nothing; and for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it shall never move it with that <hi>Impetus</hi> how many times soever it be multiplyed, because nothing how soever it be multiplyed will for ever be nothing. Wherefore when a point is at rest, if it do not yeild to the least <hi>Impetus,</hi> it will yeild to none, and consequently it will be impossible that that which is at rest should ever be moved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that when a point moved, how little soever the <hi>Impetus</hi> thereof be, falls upon a point of any Body at rest, how hard soever that Body be, it will at the first touch make it yeild a little. For if it do not yeild to the <hi>Impetus</hi> which is in that point, neither will it yeild to the <hi>Impetus</hi> of never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points, which have all their <hi>Impetus</hi> severally equal to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> of that point. For seeing all those points together work equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any one of them have no effect, the aggregate of them all together shall have no effect as many times told as there are points in the whole Body, that is, still no effect at all; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59147:86"/>
there would be some Bodies so hard that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to break them; that is, a finite hardnesse, or a finite force would not yeild to that which is infinite; which is absurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> It is therefore manifest, that Rest does nothing at all, nor is of any efficacy; and that nothing but Motion gives Motion to such things as be at Rest, and takes it from things moved,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that Cessation in the Movent does not cause Cessation in that which was moved by it. For (by the 11th Number of the 1 <hi>Article</hi> of this Chapter) whatsoever is moved, persevers in the same way, &amp; with the same Swiftness, as long as it is not hindered by some thing that is moved against it. Now it is manifest, that Cessation is not contrary Motion; and therefore it follows, that the standing still of the Movent, does not make it necessary that the thing moved should also stand still.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> They are therefore deceived, that reckon the taking away of the impediment or resistance, for one of the causes of Motion.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Motion is brought into account for divers respects; First, as in a Body <hi>Undivided,</hi> (that is, considered as a point); or, as in a <hi>Divided</hi> Body. In an Undivided Body, when we suppose the way by which the Motion is made, to be a Line; and in a Divided Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when we compute the Motion of the several parts of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as of Parts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the diversity of the regulation of Motion, it is in a Body considered as Undivided, sometimes <hi>Uniform,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Multiform. Uniform</hi> is that by which equal Lines are alwayes transmitted in equal times; &amp; <hi>Multiform,</hi> when in one time more, in another time less space is transmitted. Again, of Multiform Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there are some in which the degrees of Acceleration and Retardation proceed in the same proportions which the Spaces transmitted have, whether duplicate, or triplicate, or by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever number multiplyed; and others in which it is otherwise.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the number of the Movents; that is, one Motion is made by one Movent onely, and another by the concourse of many Movents.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from the position of that Line in which a Body is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in respect of some other Line; and from hence one Motion is called <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> another <hi>Oblique,</hi> another <hi>Parallel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59147:86"/>Fifthly, from the position of the Movent in respect of the Moved Body; from whence one Motion is <hi>Pulsion</hi> or Driving; another <hi>Tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or Drawing. PULSION, when the Movent makes the Moved Body goe before it; and TRACTION, when it makes it follow. Again, there are two sorts of <hi>Pulsion;</hi> one, when the motions of the Movent and Moved Body begin both together, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led TRUSION or <hi>Thrusting</hi> and VECTION; the other, when the Movent is first moved, and afterwards the Moved Body, which Motion is called PERCUSSION or <hi>Stroke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Motion is considered sometimes from the Effect onely which the Movent works in the Moved Body, which is usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Moment.</hi> Now MOMENT <hi>is the Excess of Motion which the Movent has, above the Motion or Endeavour of the Resisting Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, it may be considered from the diversity of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;</hi> as one Motion may be made in <hi>Vacuity</hi> or <hi>empty Place;</hi> another in a <hi>fluid;</hi> another in a <hi>consistent Medium,</hi> that is, a <hi>Medium</hi> whose parts are by some power so <hi>consistent</hi> and <hi>cohering,</hi> that no part of the same will yeild to the Movent, unless the whole yeild also.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, when a Moved Body is considered as having parts, there arises another distinction of Motion into <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Simple,</hi> when all the several parts describe several equal lines; <hi>Compounded,</hi> when the lines described are Unequal.</p>
               <p n="5">5 All Endeavour tends towards that part, that is to say, in that way which is determined by the Motion of the Movent, if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent be but one; or, if there be many Movents, in that way which their concourse determines. For example, if a Moved Body have direct Motion, its first Endeavour will be in a Straight line; if it have Circular Motion, its first Endeavour will be in the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Circle; &amp; whatsoever the line be in which a Body has its Motion from the concourse of two Movents, as soon as in any point thereof the force of one of the Movents ceases, there immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the former Endeavour of that Body will be changed into an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in the line of the other Movent.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Wherefore, when any Body is carried on by the concourse of two Winds, one of those Winds ceasing, the Endeavour and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Body will be in that line, in which it would have been carried by that Wind alone which blows still. And in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59147:87"/>
of a Circle, where that which is moved has its Motion determined by a Movent in a Tangent, and by the Radius which keeps it in a certain distance from the Center, if the retention of the Radius cease, that Endeavour which was in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Circle, will now be in the Tangent, that is, in a Straight line. For seeing Endeavour is computed in a lesse part of the Circumference then can be given, that is, in a point, the way by which a Body is moved in the Circumference is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of innumerable Straight lines; of which every one is less then can be given, which are therefore called Points. Wherefore when any Body which is moved in the Circumference of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is freed from the retention of the Radius, it will proceed in one of those Straight lines, that is, in a Tangent.</p>
               <p n="7">7 All Endeavour, whether strong or weak, is propagated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite distance; for it is Motion. If therefore the first Endeavour of a Body be made in Space which is empty, it will alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the same Velocity; for it cannot be supposed that it can receive any resistance at all from empty Space; and therefore (by the 7 <hi>Article</hi> of the 9 Chapter) it will alwayes proceed in the same way and with the same Swiftness. And if its Endeavour be in Space which is filled, yet seeing Endeavour is Motion, that which stands next in its way shall be removed, and endeavour further, and again remove that which stands next, &amp; so infinitely. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the propagation of Endeavour from one part of full Space to another, proceeds infinitely. Besides, it reaches in any instant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distance, how great soever; For in the same instant in which the first part of the full <hi>Medium</hi> removes that which is next it, the second also removes that part which is next to it; and therefore all Endeavour, whether it be in empty or in full Space, proceeds not onely to any distance how great soever, but also in any time how little soever, that is, in an instant. Nor makes it any matter, that Endeavour by proceeding growes weaker and weaker, till at last it can no longer be perceived by Sense; for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be insensible; and I do not here examine things by Sense and Experience, but by Reason.</p>
               <p n="8">8 When two Movents are of equal Magnitude, the swifter of them works with greater force then the slower upon a Body that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59147:87"/>
resists their Motion. Also if two Movents have equal Velocity, the greater of them works with more force then the less. For where the Magnitude is equal, the Movent of greater Velocity makes the greater impression upon that Body upon which it falls; and where the Velocity is equal, the Movent of greater Magnitude falling upon the same point, or an equal part of another Body, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses less of its Velocity, because the resisting Body works onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part of the Movent which it touches, and therefore abates the <hi>Impetus</hi> of that part onely, whereas in the mean time the parts which are not touched proceed, and retein their whole force till they also come to be touched, and their force has some effect. Wherfore (for example) in Batteries, a longer then a shorter piece of Timber of the same thickness and velocity, and a thicker then a slenderer piece of the same length and velocity, works a greater effect upon the Wall.</p>

                     <item>1 The Velocity of any Body, in what Time soever it be computed, is that which is made of the multiplication of the <hi>Impetus,</hi> or Quickness of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Time. 2, &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Velocity</hi> of any Body, in whatsoever Time it be moved, has its quantity determined by the sum of all the several Quicknesses or <hi>Impetus</hi> which it hath in the several points of the Time of the Bodies Motion. For seeing Velocity (by the Definition of it <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Art.</hi> 15.) is that Power by which a Body can in a certain time pass through a certain length; and Quickness of <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>Impetus</hi> (by the 15 <hi>Chap.

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59147:88"/>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> If the <hi>Impetus</hi> be the same in every point, any straight line representing it may be taken for the measure of Time; and the Quicknesses or <hi>Impetus</hi> applyed ordinately to any straight line ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Angle with it, and representing the way of the Bodies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will designe a parallelogram which shall represent the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the whole Motion. But if the <hi>Impetus</hi> or Quickness of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begin from Rest, and increase Uniformly, that is, in the same proportion continually with the times which are passed, the whole. Velocity of the Motion shall be represented by a Triangle, one side whereof is the whole time, and the other the greatest <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired in that time; or else by a parallelogram, one of whose sides is the whole time of Motion, and the other, half the greatest <hi>Impetus;</hi> or lastly by a parallelogram having for one side a mean proportional between the whole time &amp; the half of that time, &amp; for the other side the half of the greatest <hi>Impetus.</hi> For both these parallelograms are equal to one another, &amp; severally equal to the triangle which is made of the whole line of time, and the greatest acquired <hi>Impetus;</hi> as is demonstrated in the Elements of Geometry.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In all Uniform Motions the Lengths which are transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are to one another, as the product of the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed into its time, to the product of the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also into its time.</p>
               <p>For let AB (in the first Figure) be the Time, and AC the <hi>Impetus</hi> by which any Body passes with Uniform Motion through the Length DE; &amp; in any part of the time AB, as in the time AF, let another Body be moved with Uniform Motion, first, with the same <hi>Impetus</hi> AC. This Body therefore in the time AB with the <hi>Impetus</hi> AC will pass through the length AF. Seeing therefore, when Bodies are moved in the same Time, &amp; with the same Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity &amp; <hi>Impetus</hi> in every part of their motion, the proportion of one Length transmitted to another Length tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>smitted, is the same w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that of Time to Time, it followeth, that the Length transmitted in the time AB with the <hi>Impetus</hi> AC will be to the Length transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the time AF with the same <hi>Impetus</hi> AC, as AB it self is to AF, that is, as the parallelogram AI is to the parallelogram AH, that is, as the product of the time AB into the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> AC is to the product of the time AF into the same <hi>Impetus</hi> AC. Again, let it be supposed that a Body be moved in the time AF,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59147:89"/>
not with the same but with some other Uniform <hi>Impetus,</hi> as A L. Seeing therfore one of the Bodies has in all the parts of its motion the <hi>Impetus</hi> A C, and the other in like manner the <hi>Impetus</hi> A L, the Length tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>smitted by the Body moved with the <hi>Impetus</hi> A C will be to the Length transmitted by the Body moved with the <hi>Impetus</hi> A L, as A C it self is to A L, that is, as the parallelogram A H is to the parallelogram F L. Wherefore, by ordinate proportion it will be, as the parallelogram A I to the parallelogram F L, that is, as the product of the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> into the Time is to the product of the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> into the Time, so the Length transmitted in the time A B with the <hi>Impetus</hi> A C, to the length transmitted in the time A F with the <hi>Impetus,</hi> A L; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> Seeing therefore in Uniform Motion (as has been shewn) the Lengths transmitted are to one another as the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelograms which are made by the multiplication of the mean <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> into the Times, that is, (by reason of the equality of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> all the way) as the Times themselves, it will also be by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, as to Time to Length, so Time to Length; and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to this place are applicable all the properties and transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Analogismes which I have set down and demonstrated in the 13 Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In Motion begun from Rest, and Uniformly Accelerated (that is, where the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreaseth continually according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Times) it will also be, as one product made by the Mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multiplyed into the Time, to another product made likewise by the Mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multiplyed into the Time, so the Length transmitted in the one Time, to the Length transmitted in the other Time.</p>
               <p>For let A B (in the same 1 figure) represent a Time; in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which Time A, let the <hi>Impetus</hi> be as the point A; but as the Time goes on, so let the <hi>Impetus</hi> encrease Uniformly till in the last point of that Time A B, namely in B, the <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired be B I. Again, let A F represent another Time, in whose beginning A, let the <hi>Impetus</hi> be as the point it self A; but as the Time proceeds, so let the <hi>Impetus</hi> encrease Uniformly till in the last point F of the Time A F the <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired be F K; and let D E be the Length pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through in the Time A B with <hi>Impetus</hi> Uniformly encreased. I say the Length D E, is to the Length transmitted in the Time A F, as the Time A B multiplyed into the Mean of the <hi>Impetus</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59147:89"/>
through the time A B, is to the Time A F multiplyed into the Mean of the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing through the time A F.</p>
               <p>For seeing the Triangle A B I is the whole Velocity of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy moved in the Time A B till the <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired be B I; and the Triangle A F K the whole Velocity of the Body moved in the Time A F with <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing till there be acquired the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> F K; the Length D E to the Length acquired in the Time A F with <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing from Rest in A till there be acquired the Impetus F K, will be as the Triangle A B I to the Triangle A F K, that is, if the Triangles A B I and A F K be like, in duplicate proportion of the Time A B to the Time A F; but if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, in the proportion compounded of the proportions of A B to B I, &amp; of A K to A F. Wherefore, as A B I is to A F K, so let D E be to D P; for so, the Length transmitted in the Time A B with <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> encreasing to B I, will be to the Length transmitted in the Time A F with <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing to F K, as the triangle A B I is to the triangle A F K; But the triangle A B I is made by the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Time A B into the Mean of the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing to B I, and the triangle A F K is made by the multiplication of the Time A F into the Mean of the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing to F K; and therefore the Length D E which is transmitted in the Time A B with <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> encreasing to B I, to the Length D P which is transmitted in the Time A F with <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing to F K, is as the product which is made of the Time A B multiplyed into its mean <hi>Impetus,</hi> to the product of the Time A F multiplyed also into its mean <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus;</hi> which was to be proved.</p>

For if in the first time the Length transmitted be as 1, in the first and second times the Length transmitted will be as 4, which is the Square of 2, and in the three first times, it will be as 9, which is the Square of 3, and in the four first times as 16, and so on.

For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Length D E (in the same 1 figure) is passed through with Velocity as the triangle A B I, it is necessary that for the passing through of a Length which is double to D E, the Velocity be as the parallelogram A I; for the parallelogram A I is double to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle A B I.</item>

               <p n="4">4 In Motion which beginning from Rest, is so accelerated, that the <hi>Impetus</hi> thereof encrease continually in proportion duplicate to the proportion of the times in which it is made, a Length transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one time will be to a Length transmitted in another time, as the product made by the Mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multiplyed into the time of one of those Motions, to the product of the Mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into the time of the other Motion.</p>
               <p>For let A B (in the 2d. figure) represent a Time, in whose first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant A let the <hi>Impetus</hi> be as the point A; but as the time proceeds, so let the <hi>Impetus</hi> encrease continually in duplicate proportion to that of the times, till in the last point of time B the <hi>Impetus</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red be B I; then taking the point F any where in the time A B, let the <hi>Impetus</hi> F K acquired in the time A F be ordinately applyed to that point F. Seeing therefore the proportion of F K to B I is supposed to be duplicate to that of A F to A B, the proportion of A F to A B will be subduplicate to that of F K to B I; and that of A B to A F will be (by Chap. 13. <hi>Article</hi> 16) duplicate to that of B I to F K, and consequently the point K will be in a parabolical line whose diameter is A B and base B I; and for the same reason, to what point soever of the time A B the <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired in that time be ordinately applyed, the straight line designing that <hi>Impetus</hi> will be in the same parabolical line A K I. Wherefore the mean <hi>Impetus</hi> multiplyed into the whole time A B will be the Parabola A K I B, equal to the parallelogram A M, which parallelogram has for one side the line of time A B and for the other the line of the <hi>Impetus</hi> A L, which is two thirds of the <hi>Impetus</hi> B I; for every Parabola is equal to two thirds of that parallelogram with which it has its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and base common. Wherefore the whole Velocity in A B will be the parallelogram A M, as being made by the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Impetus</hi> A L into the time A B. And in like manner, if F N

The Body therefore proceeding from Rest in A with motion Uniformly accelerated in the time AC, when it has passed through the Length AH, will acquire the <hi>Impetus</hi> GH equal to the time AC; that is, such <hi>Impetus,</hi> as that with it the Body will pass through the Length AC in the time AC. Wherefore any Length being given, &amp;c. which was propounded to be done.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Any Length being given which in a given Time is transmitted with Uniform Motion, To find out what Length shall be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the same Time with Motion so accelerated, that the Lengths transmitted be continually in triplicate proportion to that of their Times, and the line of the <hi>Impetus</hi> last of all acquired be equal to the Line of Time given.</p>
               <p>Let the given Length AB (in the 9th figure) be transmitted with Uniform motion in the Time AC; and let it be required to find what Length shall be transmitted in the same time with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so accelerated, that the Lengths transmitted be continually in triplicate proportion to that of their Times, and the <hi>Impetus</hi> last acquired be equal to the Time given.</p>
               <p>Let the parallelogram ABDC be completed; and let BD be so divided in E, that BE be a third part of the whole BD; and let BF be a mean proportional between BD and BE; and let AF be drawn and produced till it meet the straight line CD in G; and lastly, let the parallelogram ACGH be completed. I say AH is the Length required.</p>
               <p>For as triplicate proportion is to single proportion, so let AH be to another line AI, that is, make AI a third part of the whole AH; and let IK be drawn parallel to the straight line AC, cutting the Diagonal AD in K, and the straight line AG in L; then, as AB is to AI, so let AI be to another AN; and from the point N let NQ be drawn parallel to AC, cutting AG, AD, and FK produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in P, M and O; and last of all let FO and LM be drawn, which will be equal and parallel to the straight lines BN and IN. By this construction, the Lengths transmitted AH, AB, AI and AN will be continual proportionals; and in like manner, the Times GH, BF, IL and NP, that is, NQ, NO, NM and NP will be continual proportionals, and in the same proportion with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59147:95"/>
AH, AB, AI, and AN. Wherefore the proportion of AH to AN is the same with that of BD, that is, of NQ to NP; and the proportion of NQ to NP triplicate to that of NQ to NO, that is, triplicate to that of BD to IK; Wherefore also the Length AH is to the Length AN in triplicate proportion to that of the Time BD to the Time IK; and therefore the crooked line of the first three sided figure of two means, whose Diameter is AH, and base GH equal to AC, shall pass through the point O; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently AH shall be transmitted in the time AC, and shall have its last acquired <hi>Impetus</hi> GH equal to AC, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lengths acquired in any of the times triplicate to the proportions of the times themselves. Wherefore AH is the Length required to be found out,</p>
               <p>By the same method, if a Length be given which is transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Uniform Motion in any given Time, another Length may be found out, which shall be transmitted in the same Time with motion so accelerated, that the Lengths transmitted shall be to the Times in which they are transmitted, in proportion quadrupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, quintuplicate, and so on infinitely. For if BD be divided in E, so, that BD be to BE as 4 to 1; and there be taken between BD and BE a mean proportional FB; and as AH is to AB, so AB be made to a third, and again so that third to a fourth, and that fourth to a fifth AN, so that the proportion of AH to AN be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druplicate to that of AH to AB, and the parallelogram NBFO be completed; the crooked line of the first three-sided Figure of three Means will pass through the point O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently the Body moved will acquire the <hi>Impetus</hi> GH equal to AC in the time AC. And so of the rest.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Also, if the proportion of the Lengths transmitted, be to that of their Times, as any number to any number, the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod serves for the finding out of the Length transmitted with such <hi>Impetus,</hi> and in such Time.</p>
               <p>For let AC (in the 10 figure) be the time, in which a Body is transmitted with Uniform Motion from A to B; and the paralle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logram ABDC being completed, let it be required to find out a Length in which that Body may be moved in the same time AC, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> A w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> motion so accelerated, that the proportion of the Lengths transmitted, to that of the Times be continually as 3 to 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59147:96"/>Let BD be so divided in E, that BD be to BE as 3 to 2; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween BD and BE let BF be a mean proportionall; and let AF be drawn and produced till it meet with CD produced in G; and making AM a mean proportional between AH and AB, let it be as AM to AB, so AB to AI; and so the proportion of AH to AI will be to that of AH to AB, as 3 to 2. (for of the proportions of which that of AH to AM is one, that of AH to AB is two, and that of AH to AI is three;) &amp; consequently as 3 to 2 to that of GH to BF, &amp; (FK being drawn parallel to BI, and cutting AD in K) so likewise to that of GH or BD to IK; Wherefore the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Length AH to AI is to the proportion of the Time BD to IK, as 3 to 2; and therefore, if in the time AC, the Body be moved with accelerated motion, as was propounded, till it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the <hi>Impetus</hi> HG equal to AC, the Length transmitted in the same Time will be AH.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But if the proportion of the Lengths to that of the Times had been as 4 to 3, there should then have been taken two mean proportionals between AH and AB, and their proportion should have been continued one term further, so that AH to AB might have three of the same proportions, of which AH to AI has four; and all things else should have been done as is already shewn. Now the way how to interpose any number of Means between two Lines given, is not yet found out. Nevertheless, this may stand for a general Rule; <hi>If there be a Time given, and a Length be transmitted in that Time with Uniform Motion; as for example, if the Time be</hi> AC, <hi>and the Length</hi> AB; <hi>the straight line</hi> AG, <hi>which determines the Length</hi> CG <hi>or</hi> AH <hi>transmitted in the same Time</hi> AC <hi>with any accelerated motion, shall so cut</hi> BD <hi>in</hi> F, <hi>that</hi> BF <hi>shall be a mean proportional between</hi> BD <hi>and</hi> BE, BE <hi>being so taken in</hi> BD, <hi>that the proportion of Length to Length be every where to the proportion of Time to Time, as the whole</hi> BD <hi>is to its part</hi> BE.</p>
               <p n="17">17 If in a given Time, two Lengths be transmitted, One with uniform motion, the other with motion accelerated in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lengths to the Times; and again in part of the same Time, parts of the same Lengths be transmitted with the same motions, the whole Length will exceed the other Length in the same proportion in which one part exceeds the other part.</p>
               <p>For example, let AB (in the 8th. figure) be a Length transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59147:96"/>
in the time AC with uniform Motion; and let AH be another Length transmitted in the same time with Motion uniformly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated, so that the <hi>Impetus</hi> last acquired be GH equal to AC; and in AH let any part AI be taken, and transmitted in part of the time AC with uniform Motion; and let another part AB be taken, and transmitted in the same part of the time AC with Motion u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly accelerated. I say, that as AH is to AB, so will AB be to AI.</p>
               <p>Let BD be drawn parallel and equal to HG, and divided in the midst at E, and between BD and BE, let a mean proportional be taken as BF; &amp; the straight line AG (by the demonstration of the 13th Art.) shal pass through F. And dividing AH in the midst at I, AB shall be a mean proportional between AH and AI. Again (because AI and AB are described by the same Motions) if IK be drawn parallel and equal to BF or AM, and divided in the midst at N, and between IK and IN be taken the mean proportional IL, the straight line AF will (by the demonstration of the same 13th Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) pass through L. And dividing AB in the midst at O, the line AI will be a mean proportional between AB and AO. Where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> AB is divided in I and O in like manner as AH is divided in B and I; and as AH to AB so is AB to AI. Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> Also as AH to AB, so is HB to BI; and so also BI to IO.</p>
               <p>And as this (where one of the Motions is uniformly accelerated) is proved out of the demonstration of the 13th Article; so (when the accelerations are in double proportion to the times) the same may be proved by the demonstration of the 14th Art. and by the same method in all other accelerations, whose proportions to the times are explicable in numbers.</p>
               <p n="18">18 If two sides which contain an Angle in any Parallelogram, be moved in the same time to the sides opposite to them, one of them with Uniform Motion, the other with Motion Uniformly accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that side which is moved Uniformly will effect as much with its concourse through the whole Length transmitted, as it would do if the other Motion were also Uniform, and the Length trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by it in the same time were a mean proportional between the whole and the half.</p>
               <p>Let the side AB of the Parallelogram ABDC (in the 11th Figure) be understood to be moved with Uniform Motion till it be coincident with CD; and let the time of that Motion be AC
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59147:97"/>
or BD. Also in the same time let the side AC be understood to be moved with Motion uniformly accelerated, till it be coincident with BD; then dividing AB in the middle in E, let AF be made a mean proportional between AB and AE; and drawing FG paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to AC, let the side AC be understood to be moved in the same time AC with uniform Motion till it be coincident with FG. I say the whole AB confers as much to the velocity of the Body placed in A when the Motion of AC is uniformly accelerated till it come to BD, as the part AF confers to the same when the side AC is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Uniformly and in the same time to FG.</p>
               <p>For seeing AF is a mean proportional between the whole AB &amp; it is half AE, BD wil (by the 13th <hi>Art.</hi>) be the last <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired by AC with motion uniformly accelerated till it come to the same BD; and consequently the straight line FB will be the excess by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Length transmitted by AC with motion uniformly accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, will exceed the Length transmitted by the same AC in the same time with Uniform Motion, and with <hi>Impetus</hi> every where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to BD. Wherefore if the whole AB be moved Uniformly to CD in the same time in which AC is moved Uniformly to FG, the part FB (seeing it concurs not at all with the Motion of the side AC which is supposed to be moved onely to FG) will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing to its motion. Again, supposing the side AC to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to BD with Motion Uniformly accelerated, the side AB with its uniform Motion to CD will less put forwards the Body when it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is accelerated in all the parallels, then when it is not at all accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; &amp; by how much the greater the acceleration is, by so much the less it will put it forwards (as is shewn in the 12th <hi>Artic.</hi>) When therefore AC is in FG with accelerated Motion, the Body will not be in the side CD at the point G, but at the point D; so that GD wil be the excess by which the Length transmitted with accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Motion to BD, exceeds the Length transmitted with Uniform Motion to FG; so that the Body by its acceleration avoids the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part AF, &amp; comes to the side CD in the time AC, and makes the Length CD, which is equal to the Length AB. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Uniform Motion from AB to CD in the time AC works no more in the whole Length AB upon the Body uniformly accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from AC to BD, then if AC were moved in the same time with uniform Motion to FG; the difference consisting onely in this, that when AB works upon the Body uniformly moved from AC to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59147:97"/>
FG, that by which the accelerated Motion exceeds the Uniform Motion, is altogether in FB, or GD; but when the same AB works upon the Body acclerated, that by which the accelerated Motion exceeds the Uniform Motion, is dispersed through the whole Length AB or CD, yet so that if it were collected and put together, it would be equal to the same FB or GD. Wherefore, If two sides which contain an angle  which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p n="19">19 If two transmitted Lengths have to their Times any other proportion explicable by number, &amp; the side AB be so divided in E, that AB be to AE in the same proportion which the Lengths transmitted have to the Times in which they are transmitted, and between AB and AE there be taken a mean proportional AF, it may be shewn by the same method, that the side which is moved with Uniform Motion, works as much with its concourse through the whole Length AB, as it would do if the other Motion were also Uniform, and the Length transmitted in the same Time AC were that mean proportional AF.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning Motion by concourse.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Call those <hi>Deficient Figures,</hi> which may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be generated by the Uniform Motion of some quantity, which decreases continually, till at last it have no magnitude at all.</p>
               <p>And I call that a <hi>Complete Figure,</hi> answering to a Deficient Figure, which is generated with the same motion, and in the same time, by a Quantity which retaines alwayes its whole magnitude.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Complement</hi> of a Deficient Figure is that, which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Deficient Figure, makes it Complete.</p>
               <p>Four Proportions are said to be <hi>Proportionall,</hi> when the first of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59147:99"/>
them is to the second, as the third is to the fourth. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the first proportion be duplicate to the second; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third be duplicate to the fourth, those Proportions are said to be <hi>Proportionall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Commensurable</hi> Proportions are those, which are to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as number to number. As when to a proportion given, one proportion is duplicate, another triplicate, the duplicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion will be to the triplicate proportion as 2 to 3; but to the given proportion it will be as 2 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and therefore I call those three proportions <hi>Commensurable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 A Deficient Figure, which is made by a Quantity continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decreasing to nothing by proportions every where proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and commensurable, is to its Complement, as the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole altitude, to an altitude diminished in any time, is to the proportion of the whole Quantity which describes the Figure, to the same Quantity diminished in the same time.</p>
               <p>Let the quantity AB (in the 1 figure) by its motion through the altitude AC, describe the Complete Figure AD; and againe, let the same quantity, by decreasing continually to nothing in C, describe the Deficient Figure ABEFC, whose Complement will be the Figure BDCFE. Now let AB be supposed to be moved till it lie in GK, so that the altitude diminished be GC, and AB diminished be GE; and let the proportion of the whole alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude AC to the diminished altitude GC, be (for example) tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the proportion of the whole quantity AB or GK, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished quantity GE. And in like manner, let HI be taken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to GE, &amp; let it be diminished to HF; and let the proportion of GC to HC be triplicate to that of HI to HF; &amp; let the same be done in as many parts of the straight line AC as is possible; and a line be drawn through the points B, E, F and C. I say the Deficient Figure ABEFC, is to its Complement BDCEF as 3 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or as the proportion of AC to GC is to the proportion of AB, that is, of GK to GE.</p>
               <p>For (by the second Article of the 15. Chap.) the proportion of the complement BEFCD to the deficient figure ABEFC, is all the proportions of DB to OE, and of DB to QF, and of all the lines parallel to DB terminated in the line BEFC, to all the parallels to AB terminated in the same points of the line BEFC.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59147:99"/>
And seeing the proportions of DB to OE, and of DB to QF &amp;c are every where triplicate of the proportions of AB to GE, and of AB to HF &amp;c. the proportions of HF to AB, and of GE to AB &amp;c. (by the 16 Article of the 13 Chap.) are triplicate of the proportions of QF to DB, and of OE to DB &amp;c. and therefore the deficient figure ABEFC which is the aggregate of all the lines HF, GE, AB, &amp;c. is triple to the complement BEFCD made of all the lines QF, OE, DB, &amp;c. which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>It follows from hence, That the same complement BEFCD is ¼ of the whole Parallelogram. And by the same method may be calculated in all other Deficient Figures generated as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the proportion of the Parallelogram to either of its parts; as that when the parallels encrease fom a point in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the Parallelogram will be divided into two equal Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; when one encrease is double to the other, it will be divided into a Semiparabola and its Complement, or into 2 and 1.</p>
               <p>The same construction standing, the same conclusion may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be demonstrated, thus.</p>
               <p>Let the straight line CB be drawn cutting GK in L, &amp; through L let MN be drawn parallel to the straight line AC; wherefore the Parallelograms GM and LD will be equal. Then let LK be divided into three equal parts, so that it may be to one of those parts in the same proportion which the proportion of AC to GC or of GK to GL hath to the proportion of GK to GE. Therefore LK will be to one of those three parts as the Arithmetical proportion between GK and GL is to the Arithmetical proportion between GK and the same GK want the third part of LK; and KE will be somwhat greater then a third of LK. Seeing now the altitude AG or ML is by reason of the continual decrease, to be supposed less then any quantity that can be given; LK (which is intercepted between the Diagonal BC and the side BD) will be also less then any quantity that can be given; and consequently, if G be put so neer to A in <hi>g,</hi> as that the difference between <hi>Cg</hi> and CA be less then any quantity that can be assigned, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence also between <hi>Cl</hi> (removing L to <hi>l</hi>) and CB, will be less then any quantity that can be assigned; and the line <hi>gl</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn &amp; produced to the line BD in <hi>k</hi> cutting the crooked line
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59147:100"/>
in <hi>e,</hi> the proportion of <hi>Gk</hi> to <hi>Gl</hi> will still be triplicate to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Gk</hi> to <hi>Ge,</hi> and the difference between <hi>k</hi> and <hi>e</hi> the third part of <hi>kl</hi> will be less then any quantity that can be given; and therefore the Parallelogram <hi>eD</hi> will differ from a third part of the Parallelogram <hi>Ae</hi> by a less difference then any quantity that can be assigned. Again, let HI be drawn parallel and equal to <hi>ge,</hi> cutting CB in P, the crooked line in F, and BD in I, and the proportion of <hi>Cg,</hi> to CH will be triplicate to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of HF to HP, and IF will be greater then the third part of PI. But again, setting H in <hi>h</hi> so neer to <hi>g,</hi> as that the difference between <hi>Ch</hi> and <hi>Cg</hi> may be but as a point, the point P will also in <hi>p</hi> be so neer to <hi>l,</hi> as that the difference between <hi>Cp</hi> and <hi>Cl</hi> will be but as a point; and drawing <hi>hp</hi> till it meet with <hi>gk</hi> in <hi>i,</hi> cutting the crooked line in <hi>f,</hi> and having drawn <hi>eo</hi> parallel to BD, cutting DC in <hi>o,</hi> the Parallelogram <hi>fo</hi> will differ less from the third part of the Parallelogram <hi>gf,</hi> then by any quantity that can be given. And so it will be in all other Spaces generated in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wherefore the differences of the Arithmetical and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Means, which are but as so many points B, <hi>e, f,</hi> &amp;c. (seeing the whole Figure is made up of so many indivisible Spaces) will constitute a certain line, such as is the line BEFC, which will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the complete Figure AD into two parts; whereof one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ABEFC, which I call a Deficient Figure, is triple to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely BDCEF, which I call the Complement thereof. And whereas the proportion of the altitudes to one another, is in this case everywhere triplicate to that of the decreasing quantities to one another; in the same manner if the proportion of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes had been every where quadruplicate to that of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing quantities it might have been demonstrated, that the Deficient Figure had been quadruple to its Complement; and so in any other proportion, Wherefore, a Deficient Figure, which is made, &amp;c. Which was to be demonstrated.</p>

                  </gap> By this Proposition, the magnitudes of all Deficient Figures (when the proportions by which their bases decrease continually, are proportionall to those by which their altitudes decrease) may be compared with the magnitudes of their Complements;
<pb facs="tcp:59147:100"/>
and consequently, with the magnitudes of their Complete Figures. And they will be found to be as I have set them down in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Tables; in which I compare a Parallelogram with three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided Figures; and first with a straight lined triangle, made by the base of the Parallelogram continually decreasing in such manner; that the altitudes be alwayes in proportion to one another as the bases are, and so the triangle will be equal to its Complement; or the proportions of the altitudes and bases wil be as 1 to 1, and then the triangle will be half the Parallelogram. Secondly, with that three-sided Figure which is made by the continual decreasing of the bases in subduplicate proportion to that of the altitudes; and so the Deficient Figure will be double to its Complement, and to the Parallelogram as 2 to 3. Then, with that, where the proportion of the altitudes is triplicate to that of the bases; and then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Figure will be triple to its Complement, and to the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram as 3 to 4. Also the proportion of the altitudes to that of the bases may be as 3 to 2; and then the Deficient Figure will be to its Complement as 3 to 2, &amp; to the Parallelogram as 3 to 5; and so forwards according as more mean proportionals are taken, or as the proportions are more multiplyed, as may be seen in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Table. For example, if the bases decrease so, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the altitudes to that of the bases be alwayes as 5 to 2, and it be demanded what proportion the Figure made has to the Parallelogram, which is supposed to be Unity; then, seeing that where the proportion is taken five times, there must be four Means; look in the Table amongst the three-sided figures of four Means, and seeing the proportion was as 5 to 2, look in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most row for the number 2, and descending in the 2d Columne till you meet with that three-sided Figure, you will finde 5/7; which shews that the Deficient Figure is to the Parallelogram as 5/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4 Now for the better understanding of the nature of these three-sided figures, I will shew how they may be described by points; and first, those which are in the first column of the Table. Any Parallelogram being described, as ABCD (in the 2d. fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,) let the Diagonal BD be drawn; and the straight-lined tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle BCD will be half the Parallelogram; Then let any number of lines, as EF, be drawn parallel to the Side BC, and cutting the Diagonal BD in G; &amp; let it be every where, as EF to EG, so EG to another EH; and through all the points H let the line BHHD be drawn; and the Figure BHHDC will be that which I call a Three-sided Figure of one Mean, because in three proportionals, as EF, EG and EH, there is but one Mean, namely, EG; and this three-sided figure will be ⅔ of the Parallelogram, and is called a <hi>Parabola.</hi> Again, let it be as EG to EH, so EH to another EI, and let the line BIID be drawn, making the three-sided figure BIIDC; &amp; this will be ¾ of the Parallelogram, and is by many called a <hi>Cubique Parabola.</hi> In like manner, if the proportions be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued in EF, there will be made the rest of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59147:101"/>
figures of the first Column; which I thus demonstrate. Let there be drawn straight lines, as HK and GL parallel to the base DC. Seeing therefore the proportion of EF to EH is duplicate of that of EF to EG, or of BC to BL, that is, of CD to LG, or of KM (producing KH to AD in M) to KH, the proportion of BC to BK will be duplicate to that of KM to KH; but as BC is to BK, so is DC, or KM to KN; and therefore the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of KM to KN is duplicate to that of KM to KH; and so it will be wheresoever the parallel KM be placed. Wherefore the Figure BHHDC is double to its Complement BHHDA, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ⅔ of the whole Parallelogram. In the same manner if through I, be drawn OPIQ parallel and equal to CD, it may be demonstrated that the proportion of OQ to OP, that is, of BC to BO, is triplicate to that of OQ to OI, and therefore that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure BIIDC is triple to its Complement BIIDA, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ¾ of the whole Parallelogram, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, such three-sided figures as are in any of the transverse rowes, may be thus described. Let ABCD (in the 3d. <hi>Figure</hi>) be a Parallelogram, whose Diagonal is BD. I would describe in it such figures, as in the preceding Table I call Three-sided Figures of three Means. Parallel to DC, I draw EF as often as is necessary, cutting BD in G; and between EF and EG I take three proportionals EH, EI and EK. If now there be drawn lines through all the points H, I &amp; K; that through all the points H will make the figure BHDC, which is the first of those three-sided figures; and that through all the points I, will make the figure BIDC, which is the second; and that which is drawn through all the points K, will make the figure BKDC the third of those three-sided figures. The first of these (seeing the proportion of EF to EC is quadruplicate of that of EF to EH) will be to its Complement as 4 to 1, and to the Parallelogram as 4 to 5. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (seeing the proportion of EF to EG is to that of EF to EI as 4 to 2) will be double to its Complement, and 4/6 or ⅔ of the Parallelogram. The third (seeing the proportion of EF to EG is to that of EF to EK as 4 to 3) will be to its Complement as 4 to 3, and to the Parallelogram as 4 to 7.</p>
               <p>Any of these, figures being described, may be produced at pleasure, thus; Let ABCD (in the 4th figure) be a Parallelogram, and in it let the figure BKDC be described, namely, the third three-sided figure of three Means. Let BD be produced indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to E, and let EF be made parallel to the base DC, cutting
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59147:102"/>
AD produced in G, and BC produced in F; and in GE let the point H be so taken, that the proportion of FE to FG may be quadruplicate to that of FE to FH (which may be done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king FH the greatest of three proportionals between FE and FG); the crooked line BKD produced, will pass through the point H. For if the straight line BH be drawn, cutting CD in I, and HL be drawn parallel to GD, and meeting CD produced in L; it will be as FE to FG, so CL to CI; that is, in quadruplicate proportion to that of FE to FH, or of CD to CI. Wherefore if the line BKD be produced according to its generation, it will fall upon the point H.</p>
               <p n="5">5 A straight line may be drawn so, as to touch the crooked line of the said figure in any point, in this manner. Let it be required to draw a Tangent to the line BKDH (in the 4th figure) in the point D. Let the points B and D be connected, and drawing DA equal and parallel to BC, let B and A be connected; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this figure is by construction the third of three Means, let there be taken in AB three points, so, that by them the same AB be divided into four equal parts; of which take three, namely, AM, so that AB may be to AM, as the figure BKDC is to its Complement. I say the straight line MD, will touch the figure in the point given D. For let there be drawn any where between AB and DC a parallel, as RQ, cutting the straight line BD, the crooked line BD, the straight line MD, and the straight line AD in the points P, K, O and Q. RK will therefore (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) be the least of three Means in Geometrical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between RQ and RP. Wherefore (by the <hi>Coroll.</hi> of the 28th Article of the 13th Chapter) RK will be less then RO; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore MD will fall without the figure. Now if MD be produced to N, FN will be the least of three Means in Arithmetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between FE and FG; and FH will be the greatest of three Means in Geometrical proportion between the same FE and FG. Wherefore (by the same <hi>Coroll.</hi> of the 28 <hi>Artic.</hi> of the 13th Chap.) FH will be less then FN; and therefore DN will fall without the figure, and the straight line MN will touch the same figure one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the point D.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The proportion of a Deficient Figure to its Complement being known, it may also be known what proportion a straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59147:102"/>
triangle has to the excess of the Deficient Figure above the same triangle; and these proportions I have set down in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Table; where if you seek (for example) how much the fourth three-sided figure of five Means exceeds a triangle of the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and base, you will find in the concourse of the fourth column with the three-sided figures of five Means, 2/10; by which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that that three-sided figure exceeds the triangle by two tenths, or by one fifth part of the same triangle.</p>

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59147:103"/>9 If any of these Deficient Figures, of which I have now spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as A B C D (in the 5th figure) be inscribed within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete figure B E, having A D C E for its Complement; and there be made upon C B produced, the triangle A B I; and the Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram A B I K be completed; and there be drawn parallel to the straight line C I, any number of lines as M F, cutting every one of them the crooked line of the Deficient Figure in D, and the straight lines A C, A B and A I in H, G and L; and as G F is to G D, so G L be made to another G N; and through all the points N there be drawn the line A N I, there will be a Deficient Figure A N I B, whose Complement will be A N I K. I say the figure A N I B is to the triangle A B I, as the Deficient Figure A B C D twice taken, is to the same Deficient Figure together with the Complete figure B E.</p>
               <p>For as the proportion of A B to A G, that is, of G M to G L, is to the proportion of G M to G N; so is the magnitude of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure A N I B, to that of its Complement A N I K (by the 2d. <hi>Art.</hi> of this Chapter.)</p>
               <p>But (by the same Article), As the proportion of A B to A G, that is, of G M to G L, is to the proportion of G F to G D, that is, (by construction) of G L to G N; so is the figure A B C D to its Complement A D C E.</p>
               <p>And by Composition, As the proportion of G M to G L, together with that of G L to G N, is to the proportion of G M to G L; so is the complete figure B E, to the Deficient Figure A B C D.</p>
               <p>And by Conversion, As the proportion of G M to G L, is to both the proportions of G M to G L and of G L to G N, that is, to the proportion of G M to G N (which is the proportion compounded of both); so is the Deficient Figure A B C D, to the complete Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure B E.</p>
               <p>But it was, As the proportion of G M to G L, to that of G M to G N; so the figure A N I B to its Complement A N I K. And therefore, A B C D. B E :: A N I B. A N I K are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. And by Composition, A B C D+B E. A B C D :: B K. A N I B are proportionals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:59147:104"/>And by doubling the Consequents A B C D+B E. 2 A B C D :: B K. 2 A N I B are proportionals.</p>
               <p>And by taking the halfes of the third &amp; the fourth A B C D+B E. 2 A B C D :: A B I. A N I B are also proportionals; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="10">10 From what has been said of Deficient Figures described in a Parallelogram, may be found out what proportions Spaces transmitted with accelerated Motion in determined times, have to the times themselves, according as the moved Body is accelerated in the several times with one or more degrees of Velocity.</p>
               <p>For, let the Parallelogram A B C D (in the 6th figure) and in it the three-sided figure D E B C be described; and let F G be drawn any where parallel to the base, cutting the Diagonal B D in H, and the crooked line B E D in E; &amp; let the proportion of B C to B F be (for example) triplicate to that of F G to F E; whereupon the figure D E B C will be triple to its Complement B E D A; and in like manner, I F being drawn parallel to B C, the three-sided fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure E K B F will be triple to its Complement B K E I. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the parts of the Deficient Figure cut off from the Vertex by straight lines parallel to the base, namely D E B C and E K B F, will be to one another as the Parallelograms A C and I F; that is, in proportion compounded of the proportions of the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and bases. Seeing therefore the proportion of the altitude B C to the altitude B F is triplicate to the proportion of the base D C to the base F E, the figure D E B C to the figure E K B F will be quadruplicate to the proportion of the same D C to F E. And by the same method, may be found out, what proportion any of the said three-sided figures, has to any part of the same cut off from the Vertex by a straight line parallel to the base.</p>
               <p>Now as the said figures are understood to be described by the continual decreasing of the base, as of C D (for example) till it end in a point, as in B; so also they may be understood to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the continual encreasing of a point, as of B, till it acquire any magnitude, as that of C D.</p>
               <p>Suppose now the figure B E D C to be described by the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the point B to the magnitude C D. Seeing therefore the propor ion of B C to B F is triplicate to that of C D to F E, the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59147:104"/>
proportion of F E to C D will by Conversion (as I shall presently demonstrate) be triplicate to that B F to B C. Wherefore, if the straight line B C be taken for the measure of the time in which the point B is moved, the Figure E K B F will represent the Sum of all the encreasing Velocities in the time B F; and the figure D E B C will in like manner represent the Summe of all the encreasing Velocities in the time B C. Seeing therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the figure E K B F to the figure D E B C, is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the proportions of altitude to altitude, and base to base; and seeing the proportion of F E to C D is triplicate to that of B F to B C; the proportion of the figure E K B F to the figure D E B C, will be quadruplicate to that of B F to B C; that is, the proportion of the Sum of the Velocities in the time B F, to the Sum of the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the time B C wil be quadruplicate to the proportion of B F to B C. Wherfore if a Body be moved from B with Velocity so encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that the Velocity acquired in the time B F, be to the Velocity acquired in the time B C in triplicate proportion to that of the times themselves B F to B C, and the Body be carried to F in the time B F; the same Body in the time B C will be carried through a line equal to the fifth proportional from B F in the continual proportion of B F to B C. And by the same manner of working, we may determine, what Spaces are transmitted by Velocities en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing according to any other proportions.</p>
               <p>It remains, that I demonstrate the proportion of F E to C D, to be triplicate to that of B F to B C. Seeing therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of C D, that is of F G to F E is subtriplicate to that of B C to B F; the proportion of F G to F E will also be subtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate to that of F G to F H. Wherefore the proportion of F G to F H is triplicate to that of F G, that is, of C D to F E. But in four continual proportionals, of which the least is the first, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the first to the fourth (by the 16 <hi>Art.</hi> of the 13 Chap.) is subtriplicate to the proportion of the third to the same fourh. Wherefore the proportion of F H to G F is subtriplicate to that of F E to C D; and therefore the proportion of F E to C D is triplicate to that of F H to F G, that is, of B F to B C, which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>It may from hence be collected, that when the Velocity of a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59147:105"/>
Body, is encreased in the same proportion with that of the times, the degrees of Velocity above one another proceed as numbers do in immediate succession from Unity, namely, as 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. And when the Velocity is encreased in proportion duplicate to that of the times, the degrees proceed as numbers from Unity skipping One, as 1, 3, 5, 7, &amp;c. Lastly, when the proportions of the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are triplicate to those of the times, the progression of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is as that of numbers from Unity skipping Two in every place, as 1, 4, 7, 10, &amp;c. and so of other proportions. For Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical proportionals, when they are taken in every point, are the same with Arithmetical proportionals.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Moreover, it is to be noted, that as in quantities which are made by any magnitudes decreasing, the proportions of the figures to one another, are as the proportions of the altitudes to those of the bases; so also it is in those which are made with motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, which motion is nothing else but that power by which the described figures are greater or less. And therefore in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Archimedes</hi> his <hi>Spiral,</hi> which is done by the continual diminution of the Semidiameter of a Circle in the same proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which the Circumference is diminished, the Space which is contained within the Semidiameter and the Spiral Line, is a third part of the whole Circle. For the Semidiameters of Circles, in as much as Circles are understood to be made up of the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of them, are so many Sectors; and therefore in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Spiral, the Sector which describes it, is diminished in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate proportions to the diminutions of the Circumference of the Circle in which it is inscribed; so that the Complement of the Spiral (that is, that space in the Circle which is without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Line,) is double to the space within the Spiral Line. In the same manner, if there be taken a mean proportional every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Semidiameter of the Circle which contains the Spiral, and that part of the Semidiameter which is within the same, there will be made another figure, which will be half the Circle. And to conclude, this Rule serves for all such Spaces as may be described by a Line or Superficies decreasing either in magnitude or power; so that if the proportions in which they decrease, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable to the proportions of the times in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59147:105"/>
the magnitudes of the figures they describe will be known.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The truth of that proposition which I demonstrated in the second <hi>Article</hi> (which is the foundation of all that has been said concerning Deficient Figures) may be derived from the Elements of Philosophy, as having i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> original in this; <hi>That all equality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality between two effects, (that is, all Proportion) proceeds from, and is determined by the equal and unequal causes of those effects, or from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the causes concurring to one effect, have to the causes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the producing of the other effect;</hi> and that therefore the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Quantities are the same with the proportions of their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Seeing therefore two Deficient Figures (of which one is the Complement of the other) are made, one by motion decreasing in a certain time and proportion, the other by the loss of Motion in the same time, the causes which make and determine the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both the figures, so, that they can be no other then they are, differ onely in this, that the proportions by which the quantity which generates the figure proceeds in describing of the same, (that is, the proportions of the remainders of all the times and altitudes) may be other proportions then those by which the same generating quantity decreases in making the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Figure, (that is, the proportions of the quantity which generates the Figure continually diminished.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the proportions of the quantity in which Motion is lost, is to that of the decreasing quantities by which the Deficient Figure is generated, so will the Defect or Complement be to the Figure it self which is generated.</p>
               <p n="13">13 There are also other quantities which are determinable from the knowledge of their causes, namely, from the comparison of the Motions by which they are made, and that more easily then from the common Elements of Geometry. For example, That the Superficies of any portion of a Sphere, is equal to that Circle, whose Radius is a straight Line drawn from the Pole of the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Circumference of its base, I may demonstrate in this manner. Let B A C (in the 7 Figure) be a portion of a Sphere, whose Axis is A E, &amp; whose base is B C; &amp; let A B be the straight line drawn from the Pole A to the base in B; and let A D, equal to A B, touch the great Circle B A C in the Pole A. It is to be proved
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59147:106"/>
that the Circle made by the Radius A D, is equal to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the portion B A C. Let the plain A E B D be understood to make a revolution about the Axis A E; &amp; it is manifest that by the straight line A D a Circle will be described; and by the arch A B the Superficies of a portion of a Sphere, and lastly, by the Subtense A B the Superficies of a right Cone. Now seeing both the straight line A B, and the arch A B make one and the same revolution, and both of them have the same extreme points A and B, the cause why the the Spherical Superficies which is made by the arch, is greater then the Conical Superficies which is made by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, is, that A B the arch, is greater then A B the Subtense; and the cause why it is greater consists in this, that although they be both drawn from A to B, yet the Subtense is drawn straight, but the arch angularly, namely according to that angle which the arch makes with the Subtense, which angle is equal to the angle D A B (for an angle of contingence adds nothing to an angle of a Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as has been shewn in the 14 Chapter at the 16th Article.) Wherefore the magnitude of the angle D A B is the cause why the Superficies of the portion described by the arch A B, is greater then the Superficies of the right Cone described by the Subtense A B.</p>
               <p>Again, the cause why the Circle described by the Tangent A D is greater then the Superficies of the right Cone described by the Subtense A B (notwitstanding that the Tangent and the Subtense are equal, and both moved round in the same time) is this, that A D stands at right angles to the Axis, but A B obliquely; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity consists in the same angle D A B. Seeing therefore the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the angle D A B is that which makes the excess both of the Superficies of the Portion, and of the Circle made by the Radius A D, above the superficies of the Right Cone described by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense A B; it follows, that both the Superficies of the Portion, and that of the Circle, do equally exceed the Superficies of the Cone. Wherefore, the Circle made by A D, or A B, and the Spherical Superficies made by the arch A B, are equal to one another; which was to be proved.</p>

Let it be as R to S, so B C to B F; and let F E be drawn parallel to B A, and cut the crooked line in E; then through E let G H be drawn parallel and equal to the straight line A D, and cut the Diagonal B D in I; for thus we have G I the greatest of two Means between G H and G E, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the description of the figure in the 4th Article. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be as G H to G I, so R to another line T, that T will be the greatest of two Means between R and S. And therefore if it be again as R to T, so T to another line X, that will be done which was required.</p>
               <p>In the same manner, four mean proportionals may be found out, by the description of a three-sided figure of four Means; and so, any other number of Means, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Let the Parabolical Line given be ABC (in the first Figure), and the Diameter found be AD, and the base drawn DC, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram ADCE being completed, draw the straight Line AC. Then dividing AD into two equal parts in F, draw FH equal and parallel to DC, cutting AC in K, and the parabolical line in O; and between FH and FO take a mean proportional FP, and draw AO, AP and PC.

Let therefore AE be the time; and consequently the lines
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59147:108"/>
ordinately applyed in the Semiparabola, will designe the parts of time wherein the Body that describeth the line ABOC is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of the same; so that as at the end of the time AE or DC it is in C, so at the end of the time FO it will be in O. And because the Velocity in AD is encreased uniformly, that is, in the same proportion with the time, the same lines ordinately applyed in the Semiparabola will designe also the continual augmentations of the <hi>Impetus,</hi> till it be at the greatest, designed by the base DC. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore supposing Uniform motion in the line AF, in the time FK the Body in A by the concourse of the two uniform motions in AF and FK will be moved uniformly in the line AK; and KO wil be the encrease of the <hi>Impetus</hi> or Swiftness gained in the time FK; and the line AO will be uniformly described by the concourse of the two uniform motions in AF and FO in the time FO. From O draw OL parallel to EC, cutting AC in L; &amp; draw LN parallel to DC, cutting EC in N, and the parabolical line in M; and produce it on the other side to AD in I; and IN, IM and IL will be (by the construction of a Parabola) in continual proportion, &amp; equal to the three lines FH, FP and FO; and a straight line parallel to EC passing through M will fall on P; and therefore OP will be the encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> gained in the time FO or IL. Lastly, produce PM to CD in Q; and QC, or MN, or PH will be the encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> proportional to the time FP, or IM, or DQ. Suppose now uniform motion from H to C in the time PH. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the time FP with uniform motion and the <hi>Impetus</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in proportion to the times, is described the straight line AP; and in the rest of the time and <hi>Impetus,</hi> namely PH, is described the line CP uniformly; it followeth that the whole line APC is described with the whole <hi>Impetus,</hi> and in the same time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with is described the parabolicall line ABC; and therefore the line APC, made of the two straight lines AP and PC, is equal to the parabolical line ABC; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To find a Straight line equal to the Crooked line of the first Semiparabolaster.</p>
               <p>Let ABC be the Crooked line of the first Semiparabolaster; AD the Diameter; DC the Base; and let the Parallelogram

                  </gap>utting AC in K, the Crooked line in O, and EC in H. Then draw OL parallel to EC, cutting AC in L; and draw LN parallel to the base DC, cutting the Crooked line in M, and the straight line EC in N; and produce it on the other side to AD in I. Lastly, through the point M draw PMQ parallel and equal to HC, cutting FH in P; and joyn CP, AP and AO. I say the two Straight lines AP and PC are equal to the Crooked line ABOC.</p>
               <p>For the line ABOC being the Crooked line of the first Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabolaster, is generated by the concourse of two Motions, one uniform from A to E, the other in the same time accelerated from rest in A to D, so as that the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreaseth in proportion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually triplicate to that of the encrease of the time, or (which is all one) the lengths transmitted are in proportion triplicate to that of the times of their transmission; for as the <hi>Impetus</hi> or Quicknesses encrease, so the Lengths transmitted encrease also. And because the motion from A to E is uniform, the line AE may serve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the time, and consequently the lines ordinately drawn in the Semiparabolaster, will designe the parts of time wherein the Body beginning from rest in A, describeth by its motion the Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line ABOC. And because DC which represents the greatest acquired <hi>Impetus</hi> is equal to AE, the same ordinate lines will represent the several augmentations of the <hi>Impetus</hi> encreasing from rest in A. Therefore supposing uniform Motion from A to F in the time FK, there will be described by the concourse of the two uniform Motions AF and FK the line AK uniformly, and KO will be the encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> in the time FK; And by the concourse of the two uniform Motions in AF and FO, will be described the line AO uniformly. Through the point L draw the straight line LMN parallel to DC, cutting the straight line AD in I, the crooked line ABC in M, and the straight line EC in N; and through the point M the straight line PMQ paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel and equal to HC, cutting DC in Q, and FH in P. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course therefore of the two uniform Motions in AF and FP in the time FP will be uniformly described the straight line AP; and LM or OP will be the encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> to be added for the time FO. And because the proportion if IN
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59147:109"/>
to I L is triplicate to the proportion of I N to I M, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of F H to F O will also be triplicate to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of F H to F P; and the proportional <hi>Impetus</hi> gained in the time F P is P H. So that F H being equal to P C which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the whole <hi>Impetus</hi> acquired by the acceleration, there is no more encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> to be computed. Now in the time P H suppose an uniform motion from H to C; and by the two uniform motions in C H and H P will be described uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly the Straight line P C. Seeing therefore the two Straight lines A P and P C are described in the time A E with the same encrease of <hi>Impetus</hi> wherewith the Crooked line A B C is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the same time A E, that is, seeing the Line A P C and the Line A B C are transmitted by the same Body in the same Time, &amp; with equal Velocities, the Lines themselves are equal; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>By the same method, if any of the Semiparabolasters in the Table of the 3d Article of the precedent Chapter be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be found a Straight line equal to the Crooked line there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, by dividing the Diameter into two equal parts, and proceeding as before. Yet no man hitherto hath compared any Crooked with any Straight Line, though many Geometricians of every Age have endeavoured it. But the cause why they have not done it may be this, that there being in <hi>Euclide</hi> no Definition of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, nor any mark by which to judge of it besides Congruity (which is the 8th. <hi>Axiome</hi> of the first Book of his Elements) a thing of no use at all in the comparing of Straight and Crooked; and others after <hi>Euclide</hi> (except <hi>Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and in our time <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether a Body, falling upon the superficies of another Body and being reflected from it, do make equal angles at that superficies, it belongs not to this place to dispute, being a knowledge which depends upon the natural causes of Reflection; of which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing has been said, but shall be spoken of hereafter.</p>
               <p>In this place therefore let it be supposed, that the angle of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is equal to the angle of Reflection, that our present search may be applyed not to the finding out of the causes, but some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the same.</p>
               <p>I call an <hi>Angle of Incidence,</hi> that which is made between a straight line and another line (straight or crooked) upon which it falls, and which I call the <hi>Line Reflecting;</hi> and an <hi>Angle of Reflection</hi> equal to it, that which is made at the same point between the straight line which is reflected, and the line reflecting.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If two straight lines which fall upon another straight line be be parallel, their reflected lines shall be also parallel.</p>
               <p>Let the two straight lines AB and CD (in the 1 figure) which fall upon the straight line EF, at the points B and D, be parallel; and let the lines reflected from them be BG and DH. I say BG and DH are also parallel.</p>
               <p>For the angles ABE and CDE are equal by reason of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallellelisme of AB and CD; and the angles GBF and HDF are equal to them by supposition; for the lines BG and DH are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the lines AB and CD. Wherefore BG and DH are parallel.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If two straight lines drawn from the same point, fall upon another straight line, the lines reflected from them, if they be drawn out the other way, will meet in an angle equal to the angle of the Incident lines.</p>
               <p>From the point AC (in the 2d. figure) let the two straight lines AB and AD be drawn; and let them fall upon the straight line EK at the points B and D; and let the lines BI and DG be refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them. I say, IB and GD do converge, and that if they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59147:111"/>
be produced on the other side of the line EK they shall meet, as in F; and that the angle BFD shal be equal to the angle BAD.</p>
               <p>For the angle of Reflection IBK is equal to the angle of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ABE; and to the angle IBK, its vertical angle EBF is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; and therefore the angle ABE is equal to the angle EBF. Again the angle ADE is equal to the angle of Reflection GDK, that is, to its vertical angle EDF; and therefore the two angles ABD and ADB of the triangle ABD, are one by one equal to the two angles FBD and FDB of the triangle FBD; Wherfore also the third angle BAD is equal to the third angle BFD, which was to be proved.</p>

                     <hi>Corollary</hi> 1. If the straight line AF be drawn, it will be perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the straight line EK. For both the angles at E will be equal, by reason of the equality of the two angles ABE and FBE, and of the two sides AB and FB.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Corollary</hi> 2. If upon any point between B and D there fall a straight line, as AC, whose reflected line is CH, this also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced beyond C, will fall upon F; which is evident by the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration above.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">3 If from two points taken without a Circle, two straight pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel lines drawn (not oppositely but) from the same parts, fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Circumference; the lines reflected from them, if produced they meet within the Circle, will make an angle double to that which is made by two straight lines drawn from the Center to the points of Incidence.</p>
               <p>Let the two straight parallels AB and DC (in the 3d figure) fall upon the Circumference BC at the points B and C; and let the Center of the Circle be E; and let AB reflected be BF, and DC reflected be CG; and let the lines FB and GC produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced meet within the Circle in H; and let EB and EC be conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. I say the angle FHG is double to the angle BEC.</p>
               <p>For seeing AB and DC are parallels, and EB cuts AB in B, the same EB produced will cut DC somewhere; let it cut it in D, &amp; let DC be produced howsoever to I, and let the intersection of DC &amp; BF be at K. The angle therefore ICH (being external to the triangle CKH,) will be equal to the two opposite angles CKH and CHK. Again, ICE (being external to the triangle CDE)
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59147:112"/>
is equal to the two angles at D and E. Wherefore the angle ICH, being double to the angle ICE, is equal to the angles at D and E twice taken; and therefore the two angles CKH and CHK are equal to the two angles at D and E twice taken. But the angle CKH is equal to the angles D and ABD, that is, D twice taken, (for AB and DC being parallels, the altern angles D, and ABD are equal). Wherefore CHK, that is the angle, FHG is also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the angle at E twice taken; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> If from two points taken within a circle, two straight parallels fall upon the circumference, the lines reflected from them shall meet in an angle, double to that which is made by two straight lines drawn from the center to the points of Incidence. For the parallels LB and IC falling upon the points B and C, are reflected in the lines BH and CH, and make the angle at H double to the angle at E, as was but now demonstrated-</p>
               <p n="4">4 If two straight lines drawn from the same point without a circle, fall upon the circumference, and the lines reflected from them being produced meet within the circle, they will make an angle equal to twice that angle which is made by two straight lines drawn from the center to the points of Incidence together with the angle which the incident lines themselves make.</p>
               <p>Let the two straight lines AB and AC (in the 4th figure) be drawn from the point A to the circumference of the circle, whose center is D; and let the lines reflected from them be BE and CG, and being produced make within the circle the angle H; also let the two straight lines DB and DC be drawn from the center D to the points of Incidence B and C. I say the angle H is equal to twice the angle at D together with the angle at A.</p>
               <p>For let AC be produced howsoever to I. Therefore the angle CH (which is external to the triangle CKH) will be equal to the two angles GKH and CHK. Again, the angle ICD (which is external to the triangle CLD) wil be equal to the two angles CLD and CDL. But the angle ICH is double to the angle ICD, and is therefore equal to the angles CLD and CDL twice taken. Wherefore the angles CKH and CHK are equal to the angles CLD and CDL twice taken. But the angle CLD (being exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59147:112"/>
to the triangle ALB) is equal to the two angles LAB &amp; LBA; &amp; consequently CLD twice taken is equal to LAB &amp; LAB twice taken. Wherefore CKH &amp; CHK are equal to the angle CDL together with LAB and LBA twice taken. Also the angle CKH is equal to the angle LAB once, and ABK, that is, LBA twice taken. Wherefore the Angle CHK is equal to the remaining angle CDL (that is, to the angle at D) twice taken, and the angle LAB (that is, the angle at A) once taken; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> If two straight converging lines, as IC and MB fall upon the concave circumference of a circle, their reflected lines, as CH and BH, will meet in the angle H, equal to twice the angle D, together with the angle at A made by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ncident lines produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Or, if the Incident lines be HB and IC, whose reflected lines CH and BM meet in the point N, the angle CNB will be equal to twice the angle D, together with the angle CKH made by the lines of Incidence. For the angle CNB is equal to the angle H (that is, to twice the angle D) together with the two angles A and NBH (that is KBA). But the angles KBA and A are equal to the angle CKH. Wherefore the angle CNB is equal to twice the angle D, together with the angle CKH made by the lines of Incidence IC and HB produced to K.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If two straight lines drawn from one point, fall upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave circumference of a circle, and the angle they make be lesse then twice the angle at the center; the lines reflected from them, and meeting within the circle, will make an angle, which being added to the angle of the incident lines, will be equal to twice the angle at the center.</p>
               <p>Let the two Lines AB and AC (in the 5th figure) drawn from the point A, fall upon the concave circumference of the circle whose center is D; &amp; let their reflected Lines BE and CE meet in the point E; also let the angle A be less then twice the angle D. I say the angles A and E together taken are equal to twice the angle D.</p>
               <p>For let the straight Lines AB and EC cut the straight Lines DC and DB in the points G and H; and the angle BHC will be equal to the two angles EBH and E; also the same angle BHC will be equal to the two angles D and DCH; and in like manner the angle BGC will be equal to the two angles ACD &amp; A, &amp; the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59147:113"/>
same angle BGC will be also equal to the two angles DBG and D. Wherefore the four angles EBH, E, ACD and A are equal to the four angles D, DCH, DBG and D. If therefore equals be taken away on both sides, namely, on one side ACD and EBH, and on the other side DCH and DBG (for the angle EBH is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the angle DBG, and the angle ACD equal to the angle DCH) the remainders on both sides will be equal, namely, on one side the angles A and E, and on the other the angle D twice taken. Wherefore the angles A and E are equal to twice the angle D.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> If the angle A be greater then twice the angle D, their reflected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ines will diverge. For, by the <hi>Corollary</hi> of the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, if the angle A be equal to twice the angle D, the reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lines BE and CE will be parallel; and if it be lesse, they will concurre, as has now been demonstrated; and therefore if it be greater, the reflected Lines BE and CE will diverge, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if they be produced the other way, they will concurre, and make an angle equal to the excesse of the angle A above twice the angle D; as is evident by the fourth Article.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If through any one point, two unequal chords be drawn, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, either within the circle, or (if they be produced) without it, and the center of the circle be not placed between them, and the Lines reflected from them concurre wheresoever; there cannot through the point through which the former Lines were drawn, be drawn another straight Line, whose reflected Line shall passe through the point where the two former reflected Lines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.</p>
               <p>Let any two unequal chords, as BK and CH (in the 6th Figure) be drawn through the point A in the circle BC; and let their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Lines BD and CE meet in F; and let the center not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween AB and AC; and from the point A let any other straight Line as AG be drawn to the circumference between B and C. I say GN, which passes through the point F, where the reflected Lines BD and CE meet, will not be the reflected Line of AG.</p>
               <p>For let the arch BL be taken equal to the arch BG, and the straight Line BM equal to the straight Line BA; and LM being drawn, let it be produced to the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mference in O. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59147:113"/>
BA and BM are equal, and the arch BL equal to the arch BG, and the angle MBL equal to the angle ABG, AG and ML will also be equal, and (producing GA to the circumference in I) the whole lines LO and GI will in like manner be equal. But LO is greater then GFN (as shall presently be demonstrated) and therefore also GI is greater then GN. Wherefore the angles NGC and IGB are not equal. Wherefore the Line GFN is not reflected from the Line of Incidence AG, and consequently no other straight Line (besides AB and AC) which is drawn through the point A, and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ls upon the circumference BC, can be reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the point F, which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>It remains that I prove LO to be greater then GN; which I shall do in this manner. LO and GN cut one another in P; and PL is greater then PG. Seeing now LP. PG :: PN. PO are proportionals, therefore the two Extremes LP and PO together taken, (that is LO), are greater then PG and PN together taken, (that is, GN,) which remained to be proved.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But if two equal chords be drawn through one point within a circle, and the Lines reflected from them meet in another point, then another straight Line may be drawn between them through the former point, whose reflected Line shall pass through the later point.</p>
               <p>Let the two equal chords BC and ED (in the 7th figure) cut one another in the point A within the circle BCD; and let their reflected Lines CH and DI meet in the point F. Then dividing the arch CD equally in G, let the two chords GK and GL be drawn through the points A and F. I say GL will be the Line re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the chord KG. For the four chords BC, CH, ED and DI, are by supposition all equal to one another; and therefore the arch BCH is equal to the arch EDI; as also the angle BCH to the angle EDI; &amp; the angle AMC to its vertical angle FMD; and the straight Line DM to the straight Line CM; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the straight Line AC to the straight Line FD; and the chords CG and GD being drawn, will also be equal; as also the angles FDG and ACG, in the equal Segments GDI and GCB. Wherefore the straight Lines FG and AG are equal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the angle FGD is equal to the angle AGC, that is, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59147:114"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> By the very sight of the figure, it is manifest, that if G be not the middle point between C and D, the reflected Line GL will not pass through the point F.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Two points in the circumference of a circle being given, to draw two straight Lines to them, so as that their reflected Lines may be parallel, or contain any angle given.</p>
               <p>In the circumference of the circle whose center is A (in the 8th. figure) let the two points B and C be given; and let it be required to draw to them from two points taken without the circle, two incident Lines, so, that their reflected Lines may (first) be parallel.</p>
               <p>Let AB and AC be drawn; as also any incident Line DC, with its reflected Line CF; and let the angle ECD be made double to the angle A; and let HB be drawn parallel to EC, and produced till it meet with DC produced in I. Lastly, producing AB indefinitely to K, let GB be drawn, so, that the angle GBK may be equal to the angle HBK, and then GB will be the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Line of the incident Line HB. I say DC and HB are two incident Lines, whose reflected Lines CF and BG are parallel.</p>
               <p>For seeing the angle ECD is double to the angle BAC, the angle HIC is also (by reason of the parallels EC and HI) double to the same BAC; Therefore also FC and GB (namely the lines reflected from the incident lines DC and HB are parallel. Wherefore the first thing required, is done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be required to draw to the points B &amp; C two straight lines of Incidence, so, that the lines reflected from them may contain the given angle Z.</p>
               <p>To the angle ECD made at the point C, let there be added on one side the angle DCL equal to half Z, and on the other side the angle ECM equal to the angle DCL; and let the straight Line BN be drawn parallel to the straight line CM; and let the angle KBO be made equal to the angle NBK; which being done, BO will be the Line of Reflection from the Line of Incidence NB. Lastly, from the incident Line LC, let the reflected Line CO be drawn, cutting BO at O, and making the angle COB. I say the angle COB is equal to the angle Z.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:59147:114"/>Let NB be produced till it meet with the straight line LC pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in P. Seeing therefore the angle LCM is by construction equal to twice the angle BAC together with the angle Z; the angle NPL (which is equal to LCM by reason of the parallels NP and MC) will also be equal to twice the same angle BAC together with the angle Z. And seeing the two straight lines OC and OB fall from the point O upon the points C and B; and their reflected lines LC and NB meet in the point P; the angle NPL will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to twice the angle BAC together with the angle COP. But I have already proved the angle NPL to be equal to twice the angle BAC together with the angle Z. Therefore the angle COP is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the angle Z; Wherefore, Two points in the circumference of a Circle being given, I have drawn, &amp;c. which was to be done.</p>
               <p>But if it be required to draw the incident Lines from a point within the circle, so, that the Lines reflected from them may contain an angle equal to the angle Z, the same method is to be used, saving that in this case the angle Z is not to be added to twice the angle BAC, but to be taken from it.</p>
               <p n="9">9 If a straight line falling upon the circumference of a circle, be produced till it reach the Semidiameter, and that part of it which is intercepted between the circumference and the Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, be equal to that part of the Semidiameter which is between the point of concourse and the center, the reflected Line will be parallel to the Semidiameter.</p>
               <p>Let any Line AB (in the 9th figure) be the Semidiameter of the circle whose center is A; and upon the circumference BD let the straight Line CD fall, and be produced till it cut AB in E, so, that ED and EA may be equal; &amp; from the incident Line CD let the Line DF be reflected. I say AB and DF will be parallel.</p>
               <p>Let AG be drawn through the point D. Seeing therefore ED and EA are equal, the angles EDA and EAD will also be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. But the angles FDG and EDA are equal (for each of them is half the angle EDH or FDC.) Wherefore the angles FDG and EAD are equal; and consequently DF and AB are parallel; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollahy.</hi> If EA be greater then ED, then DF and AB being produced will concurre; but if EA be less then ED, then BA and DH being produced will concurre.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59147:115"/>10 If from a point within a circle, two straight Lines be drawn to the Circumference, and their reflected Lines meet in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the same circle, the angle made by the Lines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, will be a third part of the angle made by the Lines of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence.</p>
               <p>From the point B (in the 10th figure) taken within the circle whose center is A, let the two straight lines BC and BD be drawn to the circumference; and let their reflected Lines CE and DE meet in the circumference of the same circle at the point E. I say the angle CED will be a third part of the angle CBD.</p>
               <p>Let AC and AD be drawn. Seeing therefore the angles CED and CBD together taken, are equal to twice the angle CAD (as has been demonstrated in the 5th article); and the angle CAD twice taken is quadruple to the angle CED; the angles CED and CBD together taken, will also be equal to the angle CED four times taken; and therefore if the angle CED be taken away on both sides, there will remain the angle CBD on one side, equal to the angle CED thrice taken on the other side; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> Therefore a point being given within a Circle, there may be drawn two Lines from it to the Circumference, so as their refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Lines may meet in the Circumference.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the comparing of an Arch of a Circle with a Straight Line, many and great Geometricians, even from the most ancient times, have exercised their wits; and more had done the same, if they had not seen their pains, though undertaken for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, if not brought to perfection, vilified by those that envy the prayses of other men. Amongst those Ancient Writers whose Works are come to our hands, <hi>Archimedes</hi> was the first that brought the Length of the Perimeter of a Circle within the limits of Numbers very litle differing from the truth; demonstrating the same to be less then three Diameters and a seventh part, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then three Diameters and ten seventy one parts of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that supposing the Radius to consist of 10000000 equal parts, the Arch of a Quadrant will be between 15714285 and 15 04225 of the same parts. In our times <hi>Ludovicus Van Cullen</hi> &amp; <hi>Willebrordus Snellius</hi> with joint endeavour have come yet neerer to the truth; and pronounced from true Principles, that the Arch of a Quadrant (putting, as before 10000000 for Radius) differs not one whole Unity from the number 15707963; which, if they had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59147:117"/>
exhibited their arithmetical operations (and no man had discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any errour in that long work of theirs) had been demonstrated by them. This is the furthest progress that has been made by the way of Numbers; and they that have proceeded thus far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the praise of Industry. Nevertheless, if we consider the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit (which is the scope at which all Speculation should aime) the improvement they have made has been little, or none. For any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man may much sooner, &amp; more accurately find a Straight Line equal to the Perimeter of a Circle, and consequently square the Circle, by winding a small thred about a given Cylinder, then any Geometrician shall do the same by dividing the Radius into 10000000 equal parts. But though the length of the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence were exactly set out, either by Numbers, or mechanically, or onely by chance, yet this would contribute no help at all towards the Section of Angles, unless happily these two Problemes, <hi>To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a given Angle according to any proportion assigned,</hi> and <hi>To finde a Straight Line equal to the Arch of a Circle,</hi> were reciprocal, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one another. Seeing therefore the benefit proceeding from the knowledge of the Length of the Arch of a Quadrant, consists in this, that we may there by divide an Angle according to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, either accurately, or at least accurately enough for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use; and seeing this cannot be done by Arithmetick, I thought fit to attempt the same by Geometry; and in this Chapter to make trial whether it might not be performed by the drawing of Straight and Circular Lines.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Let the Square A B C D (in the first figure) be described; and with the <hi>Radii</hi> A B, B C and D C the three Arches B D, C A and A C; of which let the two B D and C A cut one another in E, and the two B D and A C in F. The Diagonals therefore B D and A C being drawn will cut one another in the center of the Square G, and the two Arches B D and C A into two equal parts in H and Y; and the Arch B H D will be trisected in F and E. Through the Center G let the two Straight Lines K G L and M G N be drawn parallel and equal to the sides of the Square A B and A D, cutting the four sides of the same Square in the points K, L, M and N; which being done, K L will pass through F, and M N through E. Then let O P be drawn parallel and equal to the side B C, cutting the Arch B F D in F, and the sides A B and D C
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59147:117"/>
in O and P. Therefore O F will be the Sine of the arch B F, which is an arch of 30 degrees; and the same O F will be equal to half the Radius. Lastly, dividing the arch B F in the middle in Q, let R Q the Sine of the arch B Q be drawn and produced to S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that Q S be equal to R Q, and consequently R S be equal to the chord of the arch B F; and let F S be drawn and produced to T in the side B C. I say, the Straight Line B T is equal to the Arch B F; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that B V the triple of B T is equal to the Arch of the Quadrant B F E D.</p>
               <p>Let T F be produced till it meet the side B A produced in X; and dividing O F in the middle in Z, let. Q Z be drawn and produced till it meet with the side B A produced. Seeing therefore the Straight Lines R S and O F are parallel, and divided in the midst in Q and Z, Q Z produced will fall upon X, and X Z Q produced to the side B C will cut B T in the midst in α.</p>
               <p>Upon the Straight line F Z the fourth part of the Radius A B let the equilateral triangle <hi>a</hi> Z F be constituted; &amp; upon the center <hi>a,</hi> with the Radius <hi>a</hi> Z let the arch Z F be drawn; which arch Z F will therefore be equal to the arch Q F the half of the arch B F. Again, let the straight line Z O be cut in the midst in <hi>b,</hi> and the straight line <hi>b</hi> O in the midst in <hi>c;</hi> and let the bisection be continued in this manner till the last part O <hi>c</hi> be the least that can possibly be taken; and upon it, and all the rest of the parts equal to it into which the straight line O F may be cut, let so many equilateral triangles be understood to be constituted; of which let the last be <hi>d</hi> O <hi>c.</hi> If therefore upon the center <hi>d,</hi> with the Radius <hi>d</hi> O be drawn the arch O <hi>c,</hi> and upon the rest of the equal parts of the straight line O F be drawn in like manner so many equal arches, all those arches together taken will be equal to the whole arch B F; &amp; the half of them, namely, those that are comprehended between O &amp; Z, or between Z &amp; F will be equal to the arch B Q or Q F and in summe, what part soever the straight line O <hi>c</hi> be of the straight line O F, the same part will the arch O <hi>c</hi> be of the arch O F, though both the arch and the chord be infinitely bisected. Now seeing the arch O <hi>c</hi> is more crooked then that part of the arch B F which is equal to it; and seeing also that the more the straight line X <hi>c</hi> is produced the more it diverges from the straight line X O, if
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59147:118"/>
the points O and <hi>c</hi> be understood to be moved forwards with straight motion in X O and X <hi>c,</hi> the arch O <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> will thereby be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by little and little, till at the last it come some-where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o have the same crookedness with that part of the arch B F which is equal to it. In like manner, if the straight line X <hi>b</hi> be drawn, and the point <hi>b</hi> be understood to be moved forwards at the same time, the arch <hi>c b</hi> will also by little and little be extended, till its crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness come to be equal to the crookedness of that part of the arch B F which is equal to it. And the same will happen in all those smal equal arches which are described upon so many equal parts of the straight line O F. It is also manifest, that by straight motion in X O and X Z all those small arches will lie in the arch B F in the points B, Q and F. And though the same small e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall arches should not be coincident with the equall parts of the arch B F in all the other points thereof, yet certainly they will constitute two crooked lines, not onely equall to the two arches B Q and Q F and equally crooked, but also having their cavity towards the same parts; which how it should be, unlesse all those small arches should be coincident with the arch B F in all its points, is not imaginable. They are therefore coincident, and all the straight lines drawne from X &amp; passing through the points of division of the straight line O F, will also divide the arch B F into the same proportions into which O F is divided.</p>
               <p>Now seeing X <hi>b</hi> cuts off from the point B the fourth part of the arch B F, let that fourth part be B <hi>e;</hi> and let the Sine thereof <hi>f e</hi> be produced to F T in <hi>g,</hi> for so <hi>f e</hi> will be the fourth part of the straight line <hi>f g,</hi> because as O <hi>b</hi> is to O F, so is <hi>f e</hi> to <hi>f g.</hi> But B T is greater then <hi>f g;</hi> and therefore the same B T is greater then four Sines of the fourth part of the arch B F. And in like m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nner, if the arch B F be subdivided into any number of equal par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> whatsoever, it may be proved that the straight line B T is greater then the Sine of one of those small arches so many times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>traight line B T is not lesse then the Arch B F. But neither can it be greater, because if any straight line whatsoever, lesse then B T, be draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> X B and X T, it would cut the arch B F; and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59147:118"/>
so the Sine of some one of the parts of the arch B F taken so often as that small arch is found in the whole arch B F, would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then so many of the same arches; which is absurd. Wherefore the Straight line B T is equal to the Arch B F; &amp; the Straight line B V equal to the Arch of the Quadrant B F D; and B V four times taken, equal to the Perimeter of the Circle described with the Radius A B. Also the Arch B F and the Straight line B T are every where divided into the same proportions; and consequently any given Angle, whether greater or less then B A F may be divided into any proportion given.</p>
               <p>But the straight line B V (though its magnitude fall within the terms assigned by <hi>Archimedes</hi>) is found, if computed by the Canon of Sines, to be somwhat greater then that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is exhibited by the <hi>Ludol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> numbers. Nevertheless, if in the place of B T, another straight line, though never so little less, be substituted, the division of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles is immediatly lost, as may by any man be demonstrated by this very Scheme.</p>
               <p>Howsoever, if any man think this my Straight line B V to be too great, yet, seeing the Arch and all the Parallels are every where so exactly divided, and B V comes so neer to the truth, I desire he would seach out the reason, Why (granting B V to be precisely true) the Arches cut off should not be equal.</p>
               <p>But some man may yet ask the reason why the straight lines drawn from X through the equal parts of the arch B F should cut off in the Tangent B V so many straight lines equal to them, seeing the connected straight line X V passes not through the point D, but cuts the straight line A D produced in <hi>l;</hi> and consequently require some determination of this Probleme. Concerning which, I will say what I think to be the reason, namely, that whilest the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Arch doth not exceed the magnitude of the Radius, that is, the magnitude of the Tangent B C, both the Arch and the Tangent are cut alike by the straight lines drawn from X; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not. For A V being connected, cutting the arch B H D in I, if X C being drawn should cut the same arch in the same point I, it would be as true that the Arch B I is equal to the Radius B C, as it is true that the Arch B F is equal to the straight line B T, and drawing X K it would cut the arch B I in the midst in <hi>i;</hi> Also
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59147:119"/>
drawing A <hi>i</hi> and producing it to the Tangent B C in <hi>k,</hi> the straight line B <hi>k</hi> will be the Tangent of the arch B <hi>i,</hi> (which arch is equal to half the Radius) and the same straight line B <hi>k</hi> will be equal to the straight line <hi>k</hi> I. I say all this is true, if the preceding demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be true; and consequently the proportional section of the Arch and its Tangent proceeds hitherto. But it is manifest by the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule, that taking B <hi>h</hi> double to B T, the line X <hi>h</hi> shall not cut off the arch B E which is double to the arch B F, but a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For the magnitude of the straight lines X M, X B and M E be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known (in numbers) the magnitude of the straight line cut off in the Tangent by the straight line X E produced to the Tangent may also be known; and it will be found to be less then B <hi>h;</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the straight line <hi>Xh</hi> being drawn will cut off a part of the arch of the Quadrant greater then the arch B E. But I shall speak more fully in the next Article concerning the magnitude of the arch B I.</p>
               <p>And let this be the first attempt for the finding out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension of a Circle by the Section of the arch B F.</p>
               <p n="3">3 I shall now attempt the same by arguments drawn from the nature of the Crookedness of the Circle it self; but I shall first set down some Premisses necessary for this speculation; and</p>
               <p>First, If a Straight line be bowed into an Arch of a Circle equal to it, as when a stretched thred which toucheth a Right Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is so bowed in every point, that it be every where coincident with the Perimeter of the base of the Cylinder, the Flexion of that line will be equal, in all its points; and consequently the Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of the Arch of a Circle is every where Uniform; which needs no other demonstration then this, That the Perimeter of a Circle is an Uniform line.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and consequently, If two unequal Arches of the same Circle be made by the bowing of two straight lines equal to them, the Flexion of the longer line (whilest it is bowed into the greater Arch) is greater then the Flexion of the shorter line (whilest it is bowed into the lesser Arch) according to the proportion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themselves; and consequently, the Crookedness of the greater Arch is to the Crookedness of the lesser Arch; as the greater Arch is to the lesser Arch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If two unequal Circles and a straight line touch one
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59147:119"/>
another in the same point, the Crookedness of any Arch taken in the lesser Circle, will be greater then the Crookedness of an Arch equal to it taken in the greater Circle, in reciprocal proportion to that of the <hi>Radii</hi> with which the Circles are described; or, which is all one, any straight line being drawn from the point of Contact till it cut both the circumferences, as the part of that straight line cut off by the circumference of the greater Circle to that part which is cut off by the circumference of the lesser Circle.</p>
               <p>For let A B and A C (in the second figure) be two Circles, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one another and the straight line A D in the point A; and let their Centers be E and F; and let it be supposed, that as A E is to A F, so is the Arch A B to the Arch A H. I say the Crookedness of the Arch A C is to the Crookedness of the Arch A H, as A E is to A F. For let the straight line A D be supposed to be equal to the Arch A B, and the straight line A G to the Arch A C; and let A D (for example) be double to A G. Therefore by reason of the likeness of the Arches A B and A C, the straight line A B will be double to the straight line A C, and the Radius A E double to the Radius A F, and the Arch A B double to the Arch A H. And because the straight line A D is so bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be coincident with the Arch A B equal to it, as the straight line A G is bowed to be coincident with the Arch A C e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual also to it, the Flexion of the straight line A G into the Crooked line A C will be equal to the Flexion of the straight Line A D into the Crooked line A B. But the Flexion of the straight line A D into the Crooked line A B is double to the the Flexion of the straight line A G into the Crooked line A H; and therefore the Flexion of the straight line A G into the Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line A C is double to the Flexion of the same straight line A G into the Crooked line A H. Wherefore, as the Arch A B is to the Arch A C or A H; or as the Radius A E is to the Radius A F; or as the Chord A B is to the Chord A C; so reciprocally is the Flexion or Uniform Crookedness of the Arch A C, to the Flexion or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Crookedness of the Arch A H, namely, here double. And this may by the same method be demonstrated in Circles whose Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters are to one another triple, quadruple, or in whatsoever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proportion. The Crookedness therefore of two equal Arches
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59147:120"/>
taken in several Circles are in proportion reciprocall to that of their <hi>Radii,</hi> or like Arches, or like Chords; which was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>
               <p>Let the Square A B C D be again described (in the third Figure,) and in it the Quadrants A B D, B C A and D A C; and dividing each side of the Square A B C D in the midst in E, F, G and H, let E G and F H be connected, which will cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the center of the Square at I, and divide the arch of the Quadrant A B D into three equal parts in K and L. Also the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonals A C and B D being drawn will cut one another in I, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the arches B K D and C L A into two equal parts in M and N. Then with the Radius B F let the arch F E be drawn, cutting the Diagonal B D in O; and dividing the arch B M in the midst in P, let the straight line E <hi>a</hi> equal to the chord B P be set off from the point E in the arch E F, and let the arch <hi>a b</hi> be taken equal to the arch <hi>O a,</hi> and let B <hi>a</hi> and B <hi>b</hi> be drawn and produced to the arch A N in <hi>c</hi> and <hi>d;</hi> and lastly, let the straight line A <hi>d</hi> be drawn. I say the Straight line A <hi>d</hi> is equal to the Arch A N or B M.</p>
               <p>I have proved in the preceding article, that the arch E O is twice as crooked as the arch B P, that is to say, that the arch E O is so much more crooked then the arch B P, as the arch B P is more crooked then the straight line E <hi>a.</hi> The crookedness therefore of the chord E <hi>a,</hi> of the arch B P, and of the arch E O are as 0, 1, 2. Also the difference between the arches E O and E O, the difference between the arches E O and E <hi>a,</hi> and the difference between the arches E O and E <hi>b</hi> are as 0, 1, 2. So also the difference between the arches A N and A N, the difference between the arches A N and A <hi>c,</hi> and the difference between the arches A N and A <hi>d</hi> are as 0, 1, 2; and the straight line A <hi>c</hi> is double to the chord B P or E <hi>a,</hi> and the straight line A <hi>d</hi> double to the chord E <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, let the straight line B F be divided in the midst in Q, and the arch B P in the midst in R; and describing the Quadrant B Q S (whose arch Q S is a fourth part of the arch of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant B M D, as the arch B R is a fourth part of the arch B M which is the arch of the Semiquadrant A B M) let the chord S <hi>e</hi> equal to the chord B R be set off from the point S in the arch S <hi>Q;</hi> and let B <hi>e</hi> be drawn and produced to the arch A N in <hi>f;</hi> which being done, the straight line A <hi>f</hi> will be quadruple to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59147:120"/>
chord B R or S <hi>e.</hi> And seeing the crookedness of the arch S <hi>e</hi> or of the arch A <hi>c</hi> is double to the crookedness of the arch B R, the excess of the crookedness of the arch A <hi>f</hi> above the crookedness of the arch A <hi>c</hi> will be subduple to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the crookedness of the arch A <hi>c</hi> above the crookedness of the arch A N; and therefore the arch N <hi>c</hi> will be double to the arch <hi>c f.</hi> Wherefore the arch <hi>c d</hi> is divided in the midst in <hi>f,</hi> and the arch N <hi>f</hi> is ¾ of the arch N <hi>d.</hi> And in like manner if the arch B R be bisected in V, and the straight Line B Q in X, and the quadrant B X Y be described, and the straight Line Y <hi>g</hi> equal to the chord B V be set off from the point Y in the arch Y X, it may be demonstrated that the straight Line B <hi>g</hi> being drawn and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the arch A N will cut the arch <hi>f d</hi> into two equal parts, and that a straight Line drawn from A to the point of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will be equal to eight chords of the arch B V, and so on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually; and consequently, that the straight Line A <hi>d</hi> is equal to so many equal chords of equal parts of the arch B M, as may be made by infinite bisections. Wherefore the Straight Line A <hi>d</hi> is equal to the Arch B M or A N, that is, to half the Arch of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant A B D or B C A.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> An Arch being given not greater then the arch of a Quadrant (for being made greater it comes again towards the Radius B A produced, from which it receded before) if a straight Line double to the chord of half the given arch be adapted from the beginning of the arch, and by how much the arch that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it is greater then the given arch, by so much a greater arch be subtended by another straight Line, this Straight Line shall be equal to the first given Arch.</p>
               <p>Supposing the Straight Line B V (in the first Figure) be equal to the arch of the Quadrant B H D, and A V be connected cutting the arch B H D in I, it may be asked what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the arch B I has to the arch I D. Let therefore the arch A Y be divided in the midst in <hi>o,</hi> and in the straight line A D let A <hi>p</hi> be taken equal, and A <hi>q</hi> double to the drawn chord A <hi>o.</hi> Then upon the center A, with the Radius A <hi>q</hi> let an arch of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be drawne cutting the arch A Y in <hi>r,</hi> and let the arch Y <hi>r</hi> be doubled at <hi>t;</hi> which being done, the drawne straight line A <hi>t</hi> (by what has been last demonstrated) will be equall to the arch A Y.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59147:121"/>
Again, upon the Center A with the Radius A <hi>t</hi> let the arch <hi>tu</hi> be drawne cutting AD in <hi>u;</hi> and the straight line A <hi>u</hi> will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the arch AY. From the point <hi>u</hi> let the straight line <hi>us</hi> be drawn equal and parallell to the straight line AB, cutting MN in <hi>x,</hi> and bisected by MN in the same point <hi>x.</hi> Therefore the straight line A <hi>x</hi> being drawn and produced till it meet with BC produced in V, it will cut off BV double to B <hi>s,</hi> that is, equal to the arch BHD. Now let the point where the straight line AV cuts the arch BHD, be I; and let the arch DI be divided in the midst in <hi>y;</hi> and in the straight line DC, let D <hi>z</hi> be taken equal, and D δ double to the drawn chord D <hi>y;</hi> and upon the center D with the Radius D δ let an arch of a circle be drawn cutting the arch BHD in the point <hi>n;</hi> and let the arch <hi>nm</hi> be taken equal to the arch I <hi>n;</hi> which being done, the straight line D <hi>m</hi> will (by the last foregoing <hi>Corollary</hi>) be equal to the arch DI. If now the straight lines D <hi>m</hi> and CV be equal, the arch BI will be equal to the Radius AB or BC; and consequently XC being drawn will pass through the point I. Moreover, if the semicircle BHD β being completed, the straight lines β I and BI be drawn making a right angle (in the Semicircle) at I, and the arch BI be divided in the midst at <hi>i,</hi> it will follow that A <hi>i</hi> being connected will be parallel to the straight line β I, and being produced to BC in <hi>k,</hi> will cut off the straight line B <hi>k</hi> equal to the straight line <hi>k</hi> I, and equal also to the straight line Aγ cut off in AD by the straight line β I. All which is manifest, supposing the arch BI and the Radius BC to be equal.</p>
               <p>But that the arch BI and the Radius BC are precisely equal, cannot (how true soever it he) be demonstrated, unless that be first proved w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is contained in the first article, namely, that the straight lines drawn from X through the equal parts of OF (produced to a certain length) cut off so many parts also in the Tangent BC seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally equal to the several arches cut off; which they do most exactly as far as BC in the Tangent, and BI in the arch BE; in so much that no inequality between the arch BI and the Radius BC can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered either by the hand or by ratiocination. It is therefore to be further enquired, whether the straight line AV cut the arch of the Quadrant in I in the same proportion as the point C divides
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59147:121"/>
the straight line BV which is equal to the arch of the Quadrant. But however this be, it has been demonstrated that the straight line BV is equal to the arch BHD.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I shall now attempt the same dimension of a Circle another way, assuming the two following <hi>Lemma's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lemma</hi> 1. If to the Arch of a Quadrant, and the Radius, there be taken in continual proportion a third Line Z; then the Arch of the Semiquadrant, Half the chord of the Quadrant, and Z will also be in continual proportion.</p>
               <p>For seeing the Radius is a mean proportional between the Chord of a Quadrant and its Semichord, and the same Radius a mean proportional between the Arch of the Quadrant and Z, the Square of the Radius will be equal as well to the Rectangle made of the Chord and Semichord of the Quadrant, as to the Rectangle made of the Arch of the Quadrant and Z; and these two Rectangles will be equal to one another. Wherfore, as the Arch of a Quadrant is to its Chord, so reciprocally is half the Chord of the Quadrant to Z. But as the Arch of the Quadrant is to its Chord, so is half the Arch of the Quadrant to half the Chord of the Quadrant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as half the arch of the Quadrant is to half the Chord of the Quadrant (or to the Sine of 45 degrees) so is half the Chord of the Quadrant to Z; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lemma</hi> 2. The Radius, the Arch of the Semiquadrant, the Sine of 45 degrees, and the Semiradius are proportional.</p>
               <p>For seeing the Sine of 45 degrees is a mean proportional be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Radius and the Semiradius; and the same Sine of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is also a mean proportional (by the precedent <hi>Lemma</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Arch of 45 degrees and Z; the Square of the Sine of 45 degrees will be equal as well to the Rectangle made of the Radius and Semiradius, as to the Rectangle made of the Arch of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Z. Wherefore, as the Radius is to the Arch of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, so reciprocally is Z to the Semiradius; which was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>
               <p>Let now ABCD (in the fourth Figure) be a Square; and with the <hi>Radii</hi> AB, BC and DA let the three Quadrants ABD, BCA and DAC be described; and let the straight lines EF and GH drawn parallel to the Sides BC &amp; AB, divide the Square ABCD into foure equal Squares. They will therefore cut the arch of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59147:122"/>
Quadrant ABD into three equal parts in I and K, and the arch of the Quadrant BCA into three equal parts in K and L. Also let the Diagonals AC and BD be drawn, cutting the arches BID and ALC in M and N. Then upon the center H with the Radius HF equal to half the Chord of the arch BMD, or to the Sine of 45 degrees, let the arch FO be drawn cutting the arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> CK in O; and let AO be drawn and produced till it meet with BC produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in P; also let it cut the arch BMD in Q, and the straight line DC in R. If now the straight line H <hi>Q</hi> be equal to the straight line DR, and being produced to DC in S cut off DS equal to half the straight line BP; I say then the Straight Line BP will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Arch BMD.</p>
               <p>For seeing PBA and ADR are like triangles, it will be as PB to the Radius BA or AD, so AD to DR; and therefore as well PB, AD and DR, as PB, AD (or A <hi>Q</hi>) and <hi>Q</hi> H are in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proportion; and producing HO to DC in T, DT will be equal to the Sine of 45 degrees, as shall by and by be demonstrated. Now DS, DT and DR are in continual porportion by the first <hi>Lemma;</hi> and by the second <hi>Lemma</hi> DC. DS:: DR. DF are proportionals. And thus it will be, whether BP be equal or not equal to the arch of the Quadrant BMD. But if they be equal, it will then be, as that part of the arch BMD which is equal to the Radius, is to the remainder of the same arch BMD; so A <hi>Q</hi> to H <hi>Q,</hi> or so BC to CP. And then will BP and the arch BMD be equal. But it is not demonstrated that the Straight Lines H <hi>Q</hi> and DR are equal; though if from the point B there be drawn (by the construction of the first figure) a Straight Line equal to the arch BMD, then DR to H <hi>Q,</hi> and also the half of the Straight Line BP to DS, will always be so equal, that no inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can be discovered between them. I will therefore leave this to be further searched into. For though it be almost out of doubt, that the Straight Line BP and the arch BMD are equal, yet that may not be received without demonstration; and means of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration the Circular Line admitteth none that is not grounded upon the nature of Flexion, or of Angles. But by that way I have already exhibited a Straight Line equal to the Arch of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant in the First and Second aggression.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59147:122"/>It remains that I prove DT to be equal to the Sine of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>In BA produced let AV he taken equal to the Sine of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and drawing and producing VH, it will cut the arch of the Quadrant CNA in the midst in N, and the same arch again in O, and the Straight line DC in T, so, that DT will be equal to the Sine of 45 degrees, or to the straight line AV; also the Straight line VH will be equal to the straight line HI or the Sine of 60 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>For the square of AV is equal to two squares of the Semiradius; and consequently the square of VH is equal to three Squares of the Semiradius. But HI is a mean proportional between the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radius and three <hi>Semiradii;</hi> and therefore the square of HI is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to three Squares of the Semiradius. Wherefore HI is eqval to HV. But because AD is cut in the midst in H, therefore VH and HT are equal; and therefore also DT is equal to the Sine of 45 degrees. In the Radius BA let BX be taken equal to the Sine of 45 degrees; for so VX will be equal to the Radius; and it will be as VA to AH the Semiradius, so VX the Radius to XN the Sine of 45 degrees. Wherefore VH produced passes through N. Lastly, upon the center V with the Radius VA let the arch of a circle be drawn cutting VH in Y; which being done, VY will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to HO (for HO is by construction equal to the Sine of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) and YH will be equal to OT; &amp; therefore VT passes through O. All which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>I will here add certain Problemes, of which if any Analyst can make the construction, he will thereby be able to judge clearly of what I have now said concerning the dimension of a Circle. Now these Problems are nothing else (at least to sense) but certain symptomes accompanying the construction of the first and third fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Describing therefore again the Square ABCD (in the fifth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) and the three Quadrants ABD, BCA and DAC, let the Diagonals AC &amp; BD be drawn, cutting the arches BHD &amp; CIA in the middle in H and I; &amp; the straight lines EF and GL, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the square ABCD into four equal squares, and trisecting the arches BHD and CIA, namely, BHD in K and M, and CIA
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59147:123"/>
in M and O. Then dividing the arch BK in the midst in P, let QP the Sine of the arch BP be drawn and produced to R, so that QR be double to QP; and connecting KR, let it be produced one way to BC in S, and the other way to BA produced in T. Also let BV be made triple to BS, and consequently (by the second article of this Chapter) equall to the arch BD. This construction is the same with that of the first figure, which I thought fit to renew discharged of all lines but such as are necessary for my present purpose.</p>
               <p>In the first place therefore, if AV be drawn, cutting the arch BHD in X, and the side DC in Z, I desire some Analyst would (if he can) give a reason, Why the straight lines TE and TC should cut the arch BD the one in Y, the other in X, so as to make the arch BY equal to the arch YX; or if they be not equal, that he would determine their difference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if in the side DA, the straight line <hi>Da</hi> be taken equal to DZ, and <hi>Va</hi> be drawn; Why <hi>Va</hi> and VB should be equal; or if they be not equal, What is the difference.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, drawing <hi>Zb</hi> parallel and equal to the side CB, cutting the arch BHD in <hi>c,</hi> and drawing the straight line <hi>Ac,</hi> and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it to BV in <hi>d;</hi> Why <hi>Ad</hi> should be equal and parallel to the straight line <hi>aV,</hi> and consequently equal also to the arch BD.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, drawing <hi>eK</hi> the Sine of the arch BK, &amp; taking (in <hi>eA</hi> produced) <hi>ef</hi> equal to the Diagonal AC, and connecting <hi>fC;</hi> Why <hi>fC</hi> should pass through <hi>a</hi> (which point being given, the length of the arch BHD is also given) and <hi>c;</hi> and why <hi>fe</hi> and <hi>fc</hi> should be equal; or if not, why unequal.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, drawing <hi>fZ,</hi> I desire he would shew, Why it is equal to BV, or to the arch BD; or if they be not equal, What is their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, granting <hi>fZ</hi> to be equal to the arch BD, I desire he would determine whether it fall all without the arch BCA, or cut the same; or touch it, and in what point.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Semicircle <hi>BDg</hi> being completed; Why <hi>gI</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn and produced, should pass through X (by which point X the length of the arch BD is determined). And the same <hi>gI</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet further produced to DC in <hi>h;</hi> Why <hi>Ad</hi> (which is equal
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59147:123"/>
to the arch BD) should pass through that point <hi>h.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, upon the Center of the square ABCD, which let be <hi>k,</hi> the arch of the quadrant EiL being drawn, cutting <hi>eK</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>i;</hi> Why the drawn straight line <hi>iX</hi> should be parallel to the side CD.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, in the sides BA and BC taking <hi>Bl</hi> and <hi>Bm</hi> severally equal to half BV, or to the arch BH, and drawing <hi>mn</hi> parallel and equal to the side BA, cutting the arch BD in <hi>o;</hi> Why the straight line wich connects <hi>Vl</hi> should pass through the point <hi>o,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, I would know of him, Why the straight line which connects <hi>aH</hi> should be equal to <hi>Bm;</hi> or if not, how much it differs from it.</p>
               <p>The Analyst that can solve these Problemes without knowing first the length of the arch BD, or using any other known Method then that which proceeds by perpetual bisection of an angle, or is drawn from the consideration of the nature of Flexion, shall do more then ordinary Geometry is able to perform. But if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension of a Circle cannot be found by any other Method; then I have either found it, or it is not at all to be found.</p>
               <p>From the known Length of the Arch of a Quadrant, and from the proportional Division of the Arch and of the Tangent BC, may be deduced the Section of an Angle into any given proportion; as also the Squaring of the Circle, the Squaring of a given Sector, and many the like propositions, which it is not necessary here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate. I will therefore onely exhibit a Straight line equal to the Spiral of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and so dismiss this speculation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The length of the Perimeter of a Circle being found, that Straight line is also found, which touches a Spiral at the end of its first conversion. For upon the center A (in the sixth figure) let the circle BCDE be described; and in it let <hi>Archimedes</hi> his Spiral AFGHB be drawn, beginning at A and ending at B. Through the center A let the straight line CE be drawn, cutting the Diameter BD at right angles; and let it be produced to I, so, that AI be equal to the Perimeter BCDEB. Therefore IB be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn will touch the Spiral AFGHB in B; which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by <hi>Archimedes</hi> in his book <hi>de Spiralibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a Straight Line equal to the given Spiral AFGHB, it may be found thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59147:124"/>Let the straight line AI (which is equal to the Perimeter BCDE) be bisected in K; and taking KL equal to the Radius AB, let the rectangle IL be completed. Let ML be understood to be the axis, and KL the base of a Parabola, and let MK be the crooked line thereof. Now if the point M be conceived to be so moved by the concourse of two movents, the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> IM to KL with velocity encreasing continually in the same proportion with the Times, the other from ML to IK uniformly, that both those moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begin together in M and end in K; <hi>Galilaeus</hi> has demonstrated that by such motion of the point M, the crooked line of a Parabola will be described. Again, if the point A be conceived to be moved uniformly in the straight line AB, and in the same time to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried round upon the center A by the circular motion of all the points between A and B; <hi>Archimedes</hi> has demonstrated that by such motion will be described a Spiral line. And seeing the circles of all these motions are concentrick in A; and the interiour circle is alwayes lesse then the exteriour in the proportion of the times in which AB is passed over with uniform motion; the velocity also of the circular motion of the point A, will continually encrease proportionally to the times. And thus far the generations of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical line MK, and of the Spiral line AFGHB, are like. But the Uniform motion in AB concurring with circular motion in the Perimeters of all the concentrick circles, describes that circle, whose center is A, and Perimeter BCDE; and therefore that circle is (by the <hi>Coroll.</hi> of the first article of the 16 Chapter) the aggregate of all the Velocities together taken of the point A whilst it describes the Spiral AFGHB. Also the rectangle IKLM is the aggregate of all the Velocities together taken of the point M, whilest it describes the crooked line MK. And therefore the whole velocity, by which the Parabolicall line MK is described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to the whole velocity with which the Spiral line AFGHB is described in the same time, as the rectangle IKLM, is to the Circle BCDE, that is to the triangle AIB. But because AI is bisected in K &amp; the straight lines IM &amp; AB are equal, therefore the rectangle IKLM and the triangle AIB are also equal. Wherefore the Spiral line AFGHB, and the Parabolical line MK, being described with equal velocity and in equal times, are equal to one another. Now in the first article of the 18 Chapter a straight line is found
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59147:124"/>
out equal to any Parabolical line. Wherefore also a Straight line is found out, equal to a given Spiral line of the first revolution descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Archimedes;</hi> which was to be done.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Analysis,</hi> is continual Reasoning from the Definitions of the terms of a proposition we suppose true, and again from the Definitions of the terms of those Definitions, and so on, till we come to some things known, the Composition whereof is the demonstration of the truth or falsity of the first suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and this Composition or Demonstration is that we call <hi>Synthesis. Analytica</hi> therefore is that art, by which our reason pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from something supposed, to Principles, that is, to prime Propositions, or to such as are known by these, till we have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny known Propositions as are sufficient for the demonstration of the truth or falsity of the thing supposed. <hi>Synthetica</hi> is the art it self of Demonstration. <hi>Synthesis</hi> therefore and <hi>Analysis</hi> differ in nothing, but in proceeding forwards or backwards; and <hi>Logistica</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both. So that in the <hi>Analysis</hi> or <hi>Synthesis</hi> of any question, that is to say, of any Probleme, the Terms of all the Propositions ought to be convertible; or if they be enunciated Hypothetically, the truth of the Consequent ought not onely to follow out of the truth of its Antecedent, but contrarily also the truth of the Antecedent must necessarily be inferred from the truth of the Consequent. For otherwise, when by Resolution we are arrived at Principles, we cannot by Composition return directly back to the thing sought for. For those Terms which are the first in <hi>Analysis,</hi> will be the last in <hi>Synthesis;</hi> as for example, when in <hi>Resol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59147:125"/>Now in every <hi>Analysis,</hi> that which is sought, is the Proportion of two quantities; by which proportion (a figure being described) the quantity sought for may be exposed to Sense.

               <p>And seeing <hi>Analysis</hi> is reasoning from something supposed, till we come to Principles, that is, to Definitions, or to Theoremes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known; and seeing the same reasoning tends in the last place to some Equation; we can therefore make no end of Resolving, till we come at last to the causes themselves of Equality and Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to Theoremes formerly demonstrated from those causes; and so have a sufficient number of those Theoremes for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the thing sought for.</p>
               <p>And seeing also, that the end of the <hi>Analyticks,</hi> is either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of such a Probleme as is possible, or the detection of the impossibility thereof; whensoever the Probleme may be solved, the <hi>Analyst</hi> must not stay, till he come to those things which contain the efficient cause of that whereof he is to make construction. But he must of necessity stay when he comes to prime Propositions; and these are Definitions. These Definitions therefore must contain the efficient cause of his Construction; I say of his Construction, not of the Conclusion which he demonstrates; for the cause of the Conclusion is contained in the premised propositions; that is to say, the truth of the proposition he proves, is drawn from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions which prove the same. But the cause of his constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the things themselves, and consists in motion, or in the concourse of motions. Wherefore those propositions in which <hi>Analysis</hi> ends, are Definitions, but such, as signifie in what manner the construction, or generation of the thing proceeds. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when he goes back by <hi>Synthesis</hi> to the proofe of his Probleme, he will come to no Demonstration at all; there being no true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration but such as is scientificall; and no Demonstration is scientifical but that which proceeds from the knowledge of the causes from which the construction of the Probleme is drawne. To collect therefore what has been said into few words; ANALY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS <hi>is Ratiocination from the supposed construction or generation of a thing to the efficient cause, or coefficient causes of that which is constructed or generated. And</hi> SYNTHESIS <hi>is Ratiocination from the first cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:59147:125"/>
                  <hi>of the Construction, continued through all the middle causes till we come to the thing it selfe which is constructed or generated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because there are many means by which the same thing may be generated, or the same Probleme be constructed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither do all Geometricians, nor doth the same Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian alwayes use one and the same Method. For if to a certain quantity given, it be required to construct another quantity equal, there may be some that will enquire whether this may not be done by means of some motion. For there are quantities, whose equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inequality may be argued from Motion and Time, as well as from Congruence; and there is motion, by which two quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether Lines or Superficies, though one of them be crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other straight, may be made congruous or coincident. And this method <hi>Archimedes</hi> made use of in his Book <hi>de Spiralibus.</hi> Also the equality or inequality of two quantities may be found out and demonstrated from the consideration of Waight, as the same <hi>Archimedes</hi> did in his Quadrature of the Parabola. Besides, equality and equality are found out often by the division of the two quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes into parts which are considered as undivisible; as <hi>Cavallerius Bonaventura</hi> has done in our time, and <hi>Archimedes</hi> often. Lastly, the same is performed by the consideration of the <hi>Powers</hi> of lines, or the roots of those <hi>Powers,</hi> and by the multiplication, division, addition and substraction, as also by the extraction of the roots of those <hi>Powers,</hi> or by finding where straight lines of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion terminate. For example, when any number of straight lines, how many soever, are drawne from a straight line, and passe all through the same point, looke what proportion they have, and if their parts continued from the point retaine every where the same proportion, they shall all terminate in a straight line. And the same happens if the point be taken between two Circles. So that the places of all their points of termination make either straight lines, or circumferences of Circles, and are called <hi>Plain Places.</hi> So also when straight parallel lines are applyed to one straight line, if the parts of the straight line to which they are applyed be to one another in proportion dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to that of the contiguous applyed lines, they will all termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a Conical Section; which Section being the place of their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59147:126"/>
termination, is called a <hi>Solid Place,</hi> because it serves for the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the quantity of any Equation which consists of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions. There are therfore three ways of finding out the cause of Equality or Inequality between two given quantities; namely, First by the Computation of <hi>Motions</hi> (for by equal Motion, &amp; equal Time equal Spaces are described,) and Ponderation is motion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly By <hi>Indivisibles;</hi> because all the parts together taken are equal to the whole. And thirdly by the <hi>Powers;</hi> for when they are equall, their roots also are equall; and contrarily, the <hi>Powers</hi> are equall, when their roots are equal. But if the question be much complicated, there cannot by any of these wayes be constituted a certaine Rule, from the supposition of which of the unknown quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities the <hi>Analysis</hi> may best begin; nor out of the variety of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that at first appeare, which we were best to choose; but the successe will depend upon dexterity, upon formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Science, and many times upon fortune.</p>
               <p>For no man can ever be a good <hi>Analyst</hi> without being first a good Geometrician; nor do the rules of <hi>Analysis</hi> make a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician, as <hi>Synthesis</hi> doth; which begins at the very Elements, and proceeds by a Logical Use of the same. For the true teaching of Geometry is by <hi>Synthesis,</hi> according to <hi>Euclides</hi> method; and he that hath <hi>Euclide</hi> for his Master, may be a Geometrician without <hi>Vieta</hi> (though <hi>Vieta</hi> was a most admirable Geometrician); but he that has <hi>Vieta</hi> for his master, not so, without <hi>Euclide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for that part of <hi>Analysis</hi> which works by the Powers, though it be esteemed by some Geometricians (not the chiefest) to be the best way of solving all Problemes, yet it is a thing of no great extent; it being all contained in the doctrine of rectangles, and rectangled Solids. So that although they come to an Equati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which determines the quantity sought, yet they cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by art exhibit that quantity in a Plain, but in some Conique Section; that is, as Geometricians say, not Geometrically, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically. Now such Problemes as these, they call <hi>Solid;</hi> and when they cannot exhibit the quantity sought for with the helpe of a conique Section, they call it a <hi>Lineary</hi> Probleme. And therefore in the quantities of angles, and of the arches of Circles, there is no use at all of the <hi>Analyticks</hi> which proceed by the <hi>Powers;</hi> so that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59147:126"/>
the Antients pronounced it impossible, to exhibit in a plaine the Division of Angles, except bisection, and the bisection of the bisected parts, otherwise then mechanically. For <hi>Pappus,</hi> (before the 31 proposition of his fourth Book) distinguishing and defining the several kinds of Problemes, says that <hi>some are</hi> Plain, <hi>others</hi> Solid, <hi>and others</hi> Lineary. <hi>Those therefore which may be solved by straight lines and the circumferences of Circles</hi> (that is, which may be described with the Rule and Compass, without any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument) <hi>are fitly called</hi> Plain; <hi>for the lines by which such Problemes are found out, have their generation in a Plain. But those which are solved by the using of some one or more Conique Sections in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, are called</hi> Solid, <hi>because their construction cannot be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out using the superficies of solid figures, namely of Cones. There remains the third kinde, which is called</hi> Lineary, <hi>because other lines besides those already mentioned are made use of in their construction, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after he sayes, <hi>Of this kinde are the</hi> Spiral <hi>lines, the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratrices, <hi>the</hi> Conchoeides, <hi>and the</hi> Cissoeides. <hi>And Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians think it no small fault, when for the finding out of a</hi> Plain <hi>Probleme any man makes use of</hi> Coniques, <hi>or new</hi> Lines. Now he ranks the <hi>Trisection</hi> of an angle among <hi>Solid</hi> Problemes, and the <hi>Quinquesection</hi> among <hi>Lineary.</hi> But what! are the ancient Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians to be blamed, who made use of the <hi>Quadratrix</hi> for the finding out of a straight line equal to the arch of a Circle? and <hi>Pappus</hi> himself, was he faulty when he found out the trisection of an Angle by the help of an <hi>Hyperbole?</hi> Or am I in the wrong, who think I have found out the construction of both these Problemes by the Rule and Compass onely? Neither they, nor I. For the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made use of this <hi>Analysis</hi> which proceeds by the Powers; and with them it was a fault to do that by a more remote Power, which might be done by a neerer; as being an argument that they did not sufficiently understand the nature of the thing. The virtue of this kind of <hi>Analysis</hi> consists in the changing and turning and tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Rectangles and Analogismes; and the skill of <hi>Analysts</hi> is meer Logick, by which they are able methodically to find out whatsoever lies hid either in the Subject or Predicate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sought for. But this doth not properly belong to <hi>Algebra,</hi> or the <hi>Analyticks Specious, Symbolical</hi> or <hi>Cossick;</hi> which are, as I may say, the <hi>Brachygraphy</hi> of the <hi>Analyticks,</hi> and an art, neither of teaching nor
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59147:127"/>
learning Geometry, but of registring with brevity and celerity, the inventions of Geometricians. For though it be easie to discourse by <hi>Symbols</hi> of very remote propositions; yet whether such discourse deserve to be thought very profitable, when it is made without any <hi>Ideas</hi> of the things themselves, I know not.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have already defined <hi>Simple Motion</hi> to be that, in which the several points taken in a moved Body, do in several equal times describe several equal arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And therefore in Simple Circular Motion it is necessary that every Straight Line taken in the Moved Body be alwayes carried parallel to itself; which I thus demonstrate.</p>
               <p>First, let A B (in the first figure) be any Straight Line taken in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59147:129"/>
any Solid Body; and let AD be any arch drawn upon any Center C and Radius CA. Let the point B be understood to describe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same parts the arch BE, like and equall to the arch AD. Now in the same time in which the point A transmits the arch AD, the point B (which by reason of its simple motion is supposed to be carried with velocity equall to that of A) will transmit the arch BE; and at the end of the same time the whole AB will be in DE; and therefore AB and DE are equall. And seeing the arches AD and BE are like and equall, their subtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing straight lines AD and BE will also be equall; and therefore the four sided figure ABDE will be a parallelogram. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore AB is carried parallel to it selfe. And the same may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the same method, if any other straight line be taken in the same moved Body in which the straight line AB was taken. So that all straight lines taken in a Body moved with Simple Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cular Motion will be carried parallel to themselves.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1 It is manifest that the same will also happen in any Body which hath Simple Motion, though not Circular. For all the points of any straight line whatsoever, will describe lines though not Circular, yet equall; so that though the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lines AD and BE were not arches of Circles, but of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolas, Ellipses,</hi> or of any other figures; yet both they, and their Subtenses, and the straight lines which joyne them, would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and parallel.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2 It is also manifest, that the <hi>Radii</hi> of the equall circles AD and BE, or the Axis of a Sphere, will be so carried, as to be allwayes parallel to the places in which they formerly were. For the straight line BF drawn to the center of the arch BE be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equall to the Radius AC, will also be equall to the straight line FE or CD; and the angle BFE will be equall to the angle ACD. Now the intersection of the straight lines CA and BE, being at G, the angle CGE (seeing BE and AD are parallel) will be equal to the angle DAC. But the angle EBF is equal to the same angle DAC; and therefore the angles CGE and EBF are also equal. Wherefore AC and BF are parallel; which was to be demonstrated.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2 Let there be a Circle given (in the second figure), whose
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59147:129"/>
center is A, and Radius AB; and upon the center B and any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius BC let the Epicycle CDE be described. Let the center B be understood to be carried about the center A, and the whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picycle with it till it be coincident with the Circle FGH, whose center is I; and let BAI be any angle given. But in the time that the center B is moved to I, let the Epicycle CDE have a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revolution upon its own center, namely from E by D to C ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same proportions; that is, in such manner, that in both the Circles, equal angles be made in equal times. I say EC the Axis of the Epicycle will be alwayes carried parallel to it self. Let the angle FIG be made equal to the angle BAI; IF and AB will therefore be parallel; and how much the Axis AG has departed from its former place AC (the measure of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression is the angle CAG, or CBD which I suppose equal to it), so much in the same time has the Axis IG (the same with BC) departed from its own former situation. Wherefore, in what time BC comes to IG by the motion from B to I upon the center A, in the same time G will come to F by the contrary motion of the Epicycle; that is, it will be turned backwards to F, &amp; IG will lie in IF. But the angles FIG and GAC are equal; and therefore AC, that is, BC), and IG, (that is the Axis, though in different places) will be parallel. Wherefore, the Axis of the Epicycle EDC will be carried alwayes parallel to it self; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> From hence it is manifest, that those two annual Motions which <hi>Copernicus</hi> ascribes to the Earth, are reducible to this one Circular Simple Motion, by which all the points of the moved Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are carried always with equal velocity, that is, in equal times they make equal revolutions uniformly.</p>
               <p>This, as it is the most simple, so it is the most frequent of all Circular Motions; being the same which is used by all men when they turn any thing round with their arms, as they do in grinding or sifting. For all the points of the thing moved, describe lines which are like and equal to one another. So that if a man had a Ruler, in which many Pens points of equal length were fastned, he might with this one Motion write many lines at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Having shewed what Simple Motion is, I will here also set down some properties of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59147:130"/>First, when a Body is moved with Simple Motion in a fluid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium which hath no vacuity, it changes the situation of all the parts of the fluid ambient which resist its motion; I say there are no parts so small of the fluid ambient, how farre soever it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but do change their situation, in such manner, as that they leave their places continually to other small parts that come into the same.</p>
               <p>For (in the same second figure) let any Body, as KLMN, be understood to be moved with Simple Circular Motion; and let the Circle which every point thereof describes have any determined quantity, suppose that of the same KLMN. Wherefore the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter A, and every other point, and consequently the moved Body it self, will be carried sometimes towards the side where is K, and sometimes towards the other side where is M. When therefore it is carried to K, the parts of the fluid Medium on that side will go back; and (supposing all space to be full) others on the other side will succeed. And so it will be when the Body is carried to the side M, and to N, and every way. Now when the neerest parts of the fluid Medium go back, it is necessary that the parts next to those neerest parts go back also; and (supposing still all space to be full) other parts will come into their places with succession per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and infinite. Wherefore all, even the least parts of the fluid Medium change their places, &amp;c. which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>It is evident from hence, that Simple Motion, whether Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or not Circular, of Bodies which make perpetual returns to their former places, hath greater or less force to dissipate the parts of resisting Bodies, as it is more or less swift, and as the lines described have greater or less magnitude. Now the greatest Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that can be, may be understood to be in the least circuit, and the least in the greatest; and may be so supposed when there is need.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Secondly, supposing the same Simple Motion in the Aire, Water, or other fluid Medium; the parts of the Medium which adhere to the Moved Body will be carried about with the same Motion and Velocity, so that in what time soever any point of the Movent finishes its Circle, in the same time every part of the Medium which adheres to the Movent, shall also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59147:130"/>
such a part of its Circle, as is equal to the whole Circle of the Movent; I say it shall describe a part, and not the whole Circle, because all its parts receive their motion from an interiour concentrique Movent, and of Concentrique Circles the exteriour are alwayes greater then the interiour; nor can the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imprinted by any Movent be of greater Velocity then that of the Movent it self. From whence it follows, that the more remote parts of the fluid ambient, shall finish their Circles in times which have to one another the same proportion with their distances from the Movent. For every point of the fluid ambient, as long as it toucheth the Body which carries it about, is carried about with it, and would make the same Circle, but that it is left behind so much as the exteriour Circle exceeds the interiour. So that if we suppose some thing which is not fluid to float in that part of the fluid ambient which is neerest to the Movent, it will together with the Movent be carried about. Now that part of the fluid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient which is not the neerest but almost the neerest, receiving its degree of velocity from the neerest, (which degree cannot be greater then it was in the giver) doth therefore in the same time make a Circular Line, not a whole Circle, yet equal to the whole Circle of the neerest. Therefore in the same time that the Movent describes its Circle, that which doth not touch it shall not describe its Circle; yet it shall describe such a part of it, as is equal to the whole Circle of the Movent. And after the same manner, the more remote parts of the ambient will describe in the same time such parts of their Circles as shall be severally equal to the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Movent; and by consequent they shall finish their whole Circles in times proportional to their distances from the Movent; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Thirdly, The same Simple Motion of a Body placed in a fluid Medium, congregates, or gathers into one place such things as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally float in that Medium, if they be Homogeneous; and if they be Heterogeneous, it separates and dissipates them. But if such things as be Heterogeneous do not float, but settle, then the same Motion stirs and mingles them disorderly together. For seeing Bodies which are unlike to one another, that is, Heterogeneous Bodies, are not unlike in that they are Bodies (for Bodies, as Bodies,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59147:131"/>
have no difference) but onely from some special Cause, that is, from some internal Motion, or Motions of their smallest parts (for I have shewn in the 9th Chapter and 9th Article, that all Mutation is such Motion), it remains that Heterogeneous Bodies have their unlikeness or difference from one another from their internal or specifical Motions. Now Bodies w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have such difference, receive unlike &amp; different Motions from the same external common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and therefore they will not be moved together, that is to say, they will be dissipated. And being dissipated they will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily at some time or other meet with Bodies like themselves, and be moved alike and together with them; and afterwards meeting with more Bodies like themselves, they will unite and become greater Bodies. Wherefore Homogeneous Bodies are congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and Heterogenous dissipated by Simple Motion in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium where they naturally float. Again, such as being in a fluid Medium, do not float, but sink, if the Motion of the fluid Medium be strong enough, will be stirred up and carried away by that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and consequently they will be hindred from returning to that place to which they sink naturally, and in which onely they would unite, and out of which they are promiscuously carried; that is, they are disorderly mingled.</p>
               <p>Now this Motion by which Homogeneous Bodies are congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Heterogeneous are scattered, is that which is commonly called <hi>Fermentation,</hi> from the Latine <hi>Fervere;</hi> as the Greeks have their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which signifies the same) from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ferveo.</hi> For Seeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes all the parts of the Water change their places; and the parts of any thing that is thrown into it, will go several wayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several natures. And yet all <hi>Fervor</hi> or Seething is not caused by Fire; for New Wine and many other things have also their Fermentation and <hi>Fervor,</hi> to which Fire contributes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and some times nothing.

               <p n="6">6 Fourthly, in what time soever the Movent whose Center is A (in the 2d figure) moved in KLN shall by any number of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions (that is, when the Perimeters BI and KLN be commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) have described a Line equal to the Circle which passes through the points B and I; in the same time all the points of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59147:131"/>
floating Body whose Center is B, shall return to have the same si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in respect of the Movent, from which they departed. For seeing it is as the distance BA, that is, as the Radius of the Circle which passes through BI, is to the Perimeter it self BI, so the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius of the Circle KLN is to the Perimeter KLN; and seeing the velocities of the points B and K are equal, the time also of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in IB to the time of one revolution in KLN, will be as the Perimeter BI to the Perimeter KLN; and therefore so many revolutions in KLN as together taken are equal to the Perimeter BI, will be finished in the same time in which the whole Perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter BI is finished; &amp; therefore also the points L, N, F &amp; H, or any of the rest, will in the same time return to the same situation from which they departed; and this may be demonstrated whatsoever be the points considered. Wherefore all the points shall in that time return to the same situation; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>From hence it follows, that if the Perimeters BI and LKN be not commensurable, then all the points wil never return to have the same situation or configuration in respect of one another.</p>
               <p n="7">7 In Simple Motion, if the Body moved be of a Spherical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, it hath less force towards its Poles then towards its middle, to dissipate Heterogeneous, or to congregate Homogeneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Let there be a Sphere (as in the third figure) whose Center is A and Diameter BC; &amp; let it be conceived to be moved with Simple Circular Motion; of which Motion let the Axis be the Straight Line DE, cutting the Diameter BC at right angles in A. Let now the Circle which is described by any point B of the Sphere, have BF for its Diameter; and taking FG equal to BC, and dividing it in the middle in H, the Center of the Sphere A, will when half a revolution is finished, lie in H. And seeing HF and AB are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, a Circle described upon the Center H with the Radius HF or HG, will be equal to the Circle whose Center is A and Radius AB. And if the same Motion be continued, the point B will at the end of another half revolution return to the place from whence it began to be moved; and therefore at the end of half a revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the point B will be carried to F, and the whole Hemisphere DBE into that Hemisphere in which are the points L, K and F. Wherfore that part of the fluid Medium which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiguous to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59147:132"/>
point F, will in the same time go back the length of the Straight Line BF; and in the return of the point F to B, that is, of G to C, the fluid Medium wil go back as much in a Straight Line from the point C. And this is the effect of Simple Motion in the middle of the Sphere, where the distance from the Poles is greatest. Let now the point I be taken in the same Sphere neerer to the Pole E, and through it let the Straight Line IK be drawn parallel to the Straight Line BF, cutting the arch FL in K, &amp; the Axis HL in M; then connecting HK, upon HF let the perpendicular KN be drawn. In the same time therefore that B comes to F, the point I will come to K, BF and IK being equal, and described with the same velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Now the Motion in IK to the fluid Medium upon which it works, namely to that part of the Medium which is contiguous to the point K, is oblique, whereas if it proceeded in the Straight Line HK, it would be perpendicular; and therefore the Motion which proceeds in IK has less power, then that which proceeds in HK with the same velocity. But the Motions in HK and HF do equally thrust back the Medium; and therefore the part of the Sphere at K, moves the Medium less, then the part at F; namely so much less, as KN is less then HF. Wherefore also the same Motion hath less power to disperse Heterogeneous, and to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Homogeneous Bodies, when it is neerer, then when it is more remote from the Poles; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> It is also necessary, that in Plains which are perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Axis, and more remote then the Pole it self from the middle of the Sphere, this Simple Motion have no effect. For the Axis DE with Simple Motion describes the Superficies of a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder; and towards the Bases of the Cylinder there is in this Motion no endeavour at all.</p>
               <p n="8">8 If in a fluid Medium, moved about (as hath been said) with Simple Motion, there be conceived to float some other Spherical Body which is not fluid, the parts of the Medium which are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by that Body, will endeavour to spread themselves every way upon the Superficies of it. And this is manifest enough by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, namely by the spreading of water poured out upon a pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the reason of it may be this. Seeing the Sphere A (in the 3d figure) is moved towards B, the Medium also in which it is moved, will have the same Motion. But because in this Motion
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59147:132"/>
it falls upon a Body not liquid, as G, so that it cannot go on; and seeing the small parts of the Medium can not go forwards, nor can they go directly backwards; against the force of the Movent; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns therefore that they diffuse themselves upon the Superficies of that Body, as towards O and P, Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Compounded Circular Motion (in which all the parts of the moved Body do at once describe Circumferences, some great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, others less, according to the proportion of their several distances from the common Center) carries about with it such Bodies, as being not fluid, adhere to the Body so moved; and such as do not adhere, it casteth forwards in a Straight Line which is a Tangent to the point from which they are cast off.</p>
               <p>For let there be a Circle whose Radius is AB (in the fourth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure); and let a Body be placed in the Circumference in B, which if it be fixed there, will necessarily be carried about with it, as is manifest of it self. But whilest the motion proceeds, let us suppose that Body to be unfixed in B. I say the Body wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue its motion in the Tangent BC. For let both the Radius AB, and the Sphere B, be conceived to consist of hard matter; and let us suppose the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius AB to be stricken in the point B by some other Body which falls upon it in the Tangent DB. Now therefore there will be a motion made by the concourse of two things, the one, Endeavour towards C in the Straight Line DB produced, (in which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy B would proceed, if it were not retained by the Radius AB); the other, the Retention it self. But the Retention alone causeth no endeavour towards the Center; and therefore the Retention being taken away, (which is done by the unfixing of B) there will remain but one Endeavour in B, namely, that in the Tangent BC. Wherefore the Motion of the Body B unfixed, will proceed in the Tangent BC; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>By this demonstration it is manifest, that Circular Motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an unmoved Axis, shakes off, and puts further from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its motion such things as touch, but do not stick fast to its Superficies; and the more, by how much the distance is greater from the Poles of the Circular Motion; and so much the more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, by how much the things that are shaken off, are less driven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center by the fluid ambient, for other Causes.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59147:133"/>10 If in a fluid Medium a Spherical Body be moved with sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Circular Motion; and in the same Medium there float another Sphere whose matter is not fluid; this Sphere also shall be moved with simple Circular Motion.</p>
               <p>Let BCD (in the 5th figure) be a Circle, whose Center is A, and in whose Circumference there is a Sphere so moved that it describes with Simple Motion the Perimeter BCD. Let also EFG be another Sphere of Consistent matter, whose Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is EH, and Center H; and with the Radius AH let the Circle HI be described. I say the Sphere EFG will (by the Motion of the Body in BCD) be moved in the Circumference HI with Simple Motion.</p>
               <p>For seeing the Motion in BCD (by the 4th Article of this Chapter) makes all the points of the fluid Medium describe in the same time Circular Lines equal to one another, the points E, H and G of the Straight Line EHG will in the same time describe with equal <hi>Radii</hi> equal Circles. Let EB be drawn equal and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Straight Line AH; and let AB be connected, which will therefore be equal and parallel to EH; and therefore also, if upon the Center B and Radius BE the arch EK be drawn equal to the arch HI, and the straight Lines AI, BK and IK be drawn, BK and AI will be equal; and they will also be parallel, because the two arches EK and HI, that is, the two angles KBE and IAH are equal; and consequently the Straight Lines AB and KI which connect them will also be equal and parallel. Wherefore KI and EH are parallel. Seeing therefore E and H are carried in the same time to K and I, the whole Straight Line IK will be parallel to EH, from whence it departed. And therefore, (seeing the Sphere EFG is supposed to be of consistent matter, so as all its points keep alwayes the same situation) it is necessary that every other Straight Line taken in the same Sphere, be carried alwayes paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the places in which it formerly was. Wherefore the Sphere EFG is moved with simple Circular Motion; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="11">11 If in a fluid Medium, whose parts are stirred by a Body mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Simple Motion, there float annother Body, which hath its Superficies either wholly hard, or wholly fluid; the parts of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59147:133"/>
this Body shall approach the Center equally on all sides, that is to say, the motion of the Body shall be Circular, and Concentrique with the motion of the Movent. But if it have one side hard, and the other side fluid, then both those Motions shall not have the same center, nor shall the floating Body be moved in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a perfect Circle.</p>
               <p>Let a Body be moved in the Circumference of the Circle KL MN (in the 2d figure) whose center is A. And let there be another Body at I, whose Superficies is either all hard, or all fluid. Also let the Medium in which both the Bodies are placed, be fluid. I say the Body at I will be moved in the Circle IB about the Center A. For this has been demonstrated in the last Article.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the Superficies of the Body at I, be fluid on one side, and hard on the other. And first, let the fluid side be towards the Center. Seeing therefore the Motion of the Medium is such, as that its parts do continually change their places, (as hath been shewn in the 5th Article); if this change of place be considered in those parts of the Medium which are contiguous to the fluid Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, it must needs be, that the small parts of that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies enter into the places of the small parts of the Medium which are contiguous to them; And the like change of place will be made with the next contiguous parts towards A. And if the fluid parts of the Body at I, have any degree at all of tenacity (for there are degrees of tenacity, as in the Aire and Water) the whole fluid side will be lifted up a little; but so much the less, as its parts have less tenacity; whereas the hard part of the Superficies which is contiguous to the fluid part, has no cause at all of elevation, that is to say, no endeavour towards A.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the hard Superficies of the Body at I, be towards A. By reason therefore of the said change of place of the parts which are contiguous to it, the hard Superficies must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (seeing by Supposition there is no empty Space) either come neerer to A, or else its smallest parts must supply the contiguous places of the Medium, which otherwise would be empty. But this cannot be by reason of the supposed hardness; and therefore the other must needs be, namely, that the Body come neerer to A. Wherefore the Body at I, has greater endeavour towards the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59147:134"/>
A, when its hard side is next it, then when it is averted from it. But the Body in I, while it is moving in the circumference of the Circle IB, has sometimes one side, sometimes another turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center; and therefore it is sometimes neerer, sometimes further off from the center A. Wherefore the Body at I, is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the circumference of a perfect Circle; which was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have already (in the 15th Chap. at the 2d Article) defined Endeavour to be Motion through some Length, though not considered as Length, but as a Point. Whether therefore there be resistance or no resistance, the Endeavour will still be the same. For simply to Endeavour, is to Go. But when two Bodies having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Endeavours press one another, then the Endeavour of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is that which we call Pressure, and is mutual when their pressures are opposite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bodies moved, and also the Mediums in which they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are of two kinds. For either they have their parts coherent in such manner, as no part of the Moved Body will easily yeild to the Mouent, except the whole Body yeild also, and such are the things
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59147:136"/>
we call <hi>Hard;</hi> Or else their parts, while the whole remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, will easily yeild to the Movent; and these we call <hi>Fluid</hi> or <hi>Soft</hi> Bodies. For the words <hi>Fluid, Soft, Tough</hi> and <hi>Hard</hi> (in the same manner as <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little</hi>) are used onely comparatively; and are not different kinds, but different degrees of Quality.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To <hi>Do,</hi> and to <hi>Suffer</hi> is to Move and to be moved; and nothing is moved, but by that which toucheth it, and is also moved, (as has been formerly shewn). And how great sover the distance be, we say the first Movent moveth the last moved Body; but mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; namely so, as that the first moveth the second, the second the third, and so on, till the last of all be touched. When therefore one Body having opposite Endeavour to another Body, moveth the same, and that moveth a third, and so on, I call that action <hi>Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 When two fluid Bodies which are in a free and open Space, press one another, their parts will endeavour, or be moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sides, not onely those parts which are there where the mutual contact is, but all the other parts. For in the first contact, the parts which are pressed by both the endeavouring Bodies, have no place either forwards or backwards in which they can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore they are pressed out towards the sides. And this expressure, when the forces are equal, is in a line perpendicular to the Bodies pressing. But whensoever the formost parts of both the Bodies are pressed, the hindermost also must be pressed at the same time; for the motion of the hindermost parts cannot in an instant be stopped by the resistance of the formost parts, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds for some time; and therefore seeing they must have some place in which they may be moved, and that there is no place at all for them forwards, it is necessary that they be moved into the places which are towards the sides every way. And this effect followes of necessity, not onely in Fluid, but in Consistent and Hard Bodies, though it be not alwayes manifest to sense. For though from the compression of two stones we cannot with our eyes discerne any swelling outwards towards the sides, (as we perceive in two Bodies of wax;) yet we know well enough by reason, that some tumor must needs be there, though it be but little.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59147:136"/>5 But when the Space is enclosed, and both the Bodies be fluid, they will (if they be pressed together) penetrate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, though differently according to their different endeavours. For suppose a hollow Cylinder of hard matter, well stopped at both ends, but filled first, below with some heavy fluid Body, as Quicksilver; and above with Water or Aire. If now the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Cylinder be turned upwards, the heaviest fluid Body which is now at the top, having the greatest endeavour down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and being by the hard sides of the vessel hindered from extending it selfe sidewayes, must of necessity either be received by the lighter Body, that it may sink through it, or else it must open a passage through it selfe, by which the lighter Body may ascend. For of the two Bodies, that whose parts are most easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, will the first be divided; which being done, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the parts of the other, suffer any separation at all. And therefore when two Liquours which are enclosed in the same ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, change their places, there is no need that their smallest parts should be mingled with one another; for a way being opened through one of them, the parts of the other need not be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Now if a fluid Body which is not enclosed press a hard Body, its endeavour will indeed be towards the internal parts of that hard Body; but (being excluded by the resistance of it) the parts of the fluid Body will be moved every way according to the Superficies of the hard Body, and that equally, if the pressure be perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for when all the parts of the Cause are equal, the Effects will be equal also. But if the pressure be not perpendicular, then the angles of Incidence being unequal, the expansion also will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, namely, greater on that side where the angle is greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that motion is most direct which proceeds by the directest Line.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If a Body, pressing another Body do not penetrate it, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless give to the part it presseth, an endeavour to yeild and recede in a straight line perpendicular to its Superficies in that point in which it is pressed.</p>
               <p>Let ABCD (in the first figure) be a hard Body; and let ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body, falling upon it in the straight line EA, with any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or without inclination, press it in the point A. I say the Body so
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59147:137"/>
pressing, &amp; not penetrating it, will give to the part A an endeavour to yeild or recede in a straight Line perpendicular to the line AD.</p>
               <p>For let AB be perpendicular to AD; and let BA be produced to F. If therefore AF be coincident with AE, it is of it self mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the motion in EA will make A to endeavour in the line AB. Let now EA be oblique to AD; and from the point E let the straight line EC be drawn, cutting AD at right angles in D; and let the rectangles ABCD and ADEF be completed. I have shewn (in the 8th Article of the 16th Chapter) that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will be carried from E to A by the concourse of two Uniform Motions, the one in EF and its parallels, the other in ED and its parallels. But the motion in EF and its parallels (whereof DA is one) contributes nothing to the Body in A, to make it endeavour or press towards B; and therefore the whole endeavour which the Body hath in the inclined line EA, to pass, or press the Straight line AD, it hath it all from the perpendicular motion or endeavour in FA. Wherefore the Body E after it is in A, will have onely that perpendicular endeavour which proceeds from the motion in FA, that is, in AB; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If a hard Body falling upon, or pressing another Body, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the same, its endeavour after its first penetration will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the inclined line produced, nor in the perpendicular, but sometimes betwixt both, sometimes without them.</p>
               <p>Let EAG (in the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> figure) be the inclined line produced; and First, let the passage through the Medium in which EA is, be easier then the passage through the Medium in which AG is. As soon therefore as the Body is within the Medium in which is AG, it will finde greater resistance to its motion in DA and its parallels, then it did whilest it was above AD; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low AD it will proceed with slower motion in the parallels of DA, then above it. Wherefore the motion which is compounded of the two motions in EF and ED will be slower below AD, then above it; and therefore also, the Body will not proceed from A in EA produced, but below it. Seeing therefore the endeavour in AB is generated by the endeavour in FA; if to the endeavour in FA there be added the endeavour in DA, (which is not all taken away by the immersion of the point A into the lower Medium) the Body will not proceed from A in the perpendicular AB, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59147:137"/>
it, namely, in some straight line between AB and AG, as in the line AH.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the passage through the Medium EA, be less easie then that through AG. The motion therefore which is made by the concourse of the motions in EF and FB, is slower above AD then below it; and consequently, the endeavour will not proceed from A in EA produced, but beyond it, as in AI. Wherefore, If a hard Body falling,  which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>This Divergency of the Straight line AH from the straight line AG, is that which the Writers of <hi>Opticks</hi> commonly call <hi>Refraction;</hi> which, when the passage is ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ier in the first then in the second Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, is made by diverging from the line of Inclination towards the perpendicular; and contrarily, when the passage is not so easie in the first Medium, by departing farther from the perpendicular.</p>
               <p n="8">8 By the 6th <hi>Theoreme</hi> it is manifest, that the force of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent may be so placed, as that the Body moved by it, may proceed in a way almost directly contrary to that of the Movent; as we see in the motion of Ships.</p>
               <p>For let AB (in the 2d figure) represent a Ship, whose length from the prow to the poop is AB; and let the winde lie upon it in the straight parallel lines CB, DE and FG; and let DE and FG be cut in E and G by a straight Line drawn from B perpendicular to AB; also let BE and EG be equal, and the angle ABC any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle how small soever. Then between BC and BA let the straight line BI be drawn; and let the Sail be conceived to be spred in the same line BI, and the winde to fall upon it in the points L, M and B; from which points, perpendicular to BI, let BK, MQ and LP be drawn. Lastly, let EN and GO be drawn perpendicular to BG, and cutting BK in H and K; and let HN and KO be made equal to one another, and severally equal to BA. I say the Ship BA by the winde falling upon it in CB, DE, FG, and other lines parallel to them, will be carried forwards almost opposite to the winde, that is to say, in a way almost contrary to the way of the Movent.</p>
               <p>For the Winde that blowes in the Line CB, will (as hath been shewn in the 6th Article) give to the point B an endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a straight line perpendicular to the straight line BI, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59147:138"/>
is, in the straight line BK; and to the points M and L an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to proceed in the straight lines MQ and LP, which are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to BK. Let now the measure of the time be BG, which is divided in the middle in E; &amp; let the point B be carried to H in the time BE. In the same time therefore by the wind blowing in DM &amp; FL (and as many other lines as may be drawn parallel to them) the whole Ship will be applyed to the straight line HN. Also at the end of the second time EG, it will be applyed to the straight line KO. Wherefore the Ship will always go forwards; and the angle it makes with the winde will be equal to the angle ABC, how small soever that angle be; and the way it makes will in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time be equal to the straight line EH. I say thus it would be, if the Ship might be moved with as great celerity sidewayes from BA towards KO, as it may be moved forwards in the line BA. But this is impossible, by reason of the resistance made by the great quantity of water which presseth the side, much exceeding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance made by the much smaller quantity which presseth the prow of the Ship; so that the way the Ship makes sidewayes is scarce sensible; and therefore the point B will proceed almost in the very line BA, making with the winde the angle ABC, how acute soever, that is to say, it will proceed almost in the straight line BC, that is, in a way almost contrary to the way of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>But the Sayl in BI must be so stretched, as that there be left in it no bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome at all; for otherwise the straight lines LP, MQ &amp; BK will not be perpendicular to the plain of the Sayl, but falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low P, Q and K will drive the Ship backwards. But by making use of a small Board for a Sayl, a little Waggon with wheels for the Ship, and of a smooth Pavement for the Sea, I have by experience found this to be so true, that I could scarce oppose the board to the winde in any obliquity though never so small, but the Waggon was carried forwards by it.</p>
               <p>By the same 6th. <hi>Theoreme,</hi> it may be found, how much a stroke which falls obliquely, is weaker then a stroke falling perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, they being like and equal in all other respects.</p>
               <p>Let a stroke fall upon the Wall AB obliquely, as (for example) in the straight line CA (in the 3d figure). Let CE be drawn pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59147:138"/>
to AB, &amp; DA perpendicular to the same AB &amp; equal to CA; &amp; let both the velocity &amp; time of the motion in CA be equal to the velocity &amp; time of the motion in DA. I say the stroke in CA will be weaker then that in DA in the proportion of EA to DA. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing DA howsoever to F, the endeavour of both the strokes will (by the 6th Art.) proceed from A in the perpendicular AF. But the stroke in CA is made by the concourse of two motions in CE and EA; of which that in CE contributes nothing to the stroke in A, because CE and BA are parallels; and therefore the stroke in CA is made by the motion which is in EA onely. But the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or force of the perpendicular stroke in EA, to the velocity or force of the stroke in DA, is as EA to DA. Wherefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique stroke in CA is weaker then the perpendicular stroke in DA, in the proportion of EA to DA or CA; Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="9">9 In a full Medium, all Endeavour proceeds as far as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium it self reacheth; that is to say, if the Medium be infinite, the Endeavour will proceed infinitely.</p>
               <p>For whatsoever Endeavoureth, is Moved, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever standeth in its way, it maketh it yeild, at least a little, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so far as the Movent it self is moved forwards. But that which yeildeth is also moved, and consequently maketh that to yeild which is in its way, and so on successively as long as the Medium is full; that is to say, infinitely, if the full Medium be infinite, which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>Now although Endeavour thus perpetually propagated, do not alwayes appear to the Senses as Motion; yet it appears as Action, or as the efficient cause of some Mutation. For if there be placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes some very little object, as (for example) a small grain of sand, which at a certain distance is visible; it is manifest that it may be removed to such a distance as not to be any longer seen, though by its action it still work upon the organs of sight, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from that (which was last proved) that all Endeavour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds infinitely. Let it be conceived therefore to be removed from our Eyes to any distance how great soever, and a sufficient number of other grains of sand of the same bigness added to it; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the aggregate of all those sands will be visible; and though none of them can be seen when it is single and severed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59147:139"/>
from the rest, yet the whole heap or hill which they make wil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appear to the sight; which would be impossible if some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did not proceed from each several part of the whole heap.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Between the degrees of <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Soft,</hi> are those things which we call <hi>Tough, Tough</hi> being that, which may be bended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being altered from what it was; and the Bending of a Line, is either the adduction or diduction of the extreme parts, that is, a morion from Straightness to Crookedness, or contrarily, whilest the line remains still the same it was; for by drawing out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme points of a line to their greatest distance, the line is made straight, which otherwise is Crooked. So also the Bending of a Superficies, is the diduction or adduction of its extreme lines, that is, their Dilatation and Contraction.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Contraction,</hi> as also all <hi>Flexion</hi> supposes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that the internal parts of the Body bowed do either come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the external parts, or go further from them. For though <hi>Flexion</hi> be considered onely in the length of a Body, yet when that Body is bowed, the line which is made on one side will be convex, and the line on the other side will be concave; of which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave being the interiour line, will (unless something be taken from it and added to the convex line) be the more crooked, that is, the greater of the two. But they are equal; and therefore in <hi>Flexion</hi> there is an accession made from the interiour to the exteriour parts; and on the contrary, in <hi>Tension,</hi> from the exteriour to the interiour parts. And as for those things which do not easily suffer such transposition of their parts, they are called <hi>Brittle;</hi> and the great force they require to make them yield, makes them also with sudden motion to leap asunder, and break in pieces.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Also Motion is distinguished into <hi>Pulsion</hi> and <hi>Traction.</hi> And <hi>Pulsion,</hi> as I have already defined it, is when that which is moved, goes before that which moveth it. But contrarily, in <hi>Traction</hi> the Movent goes before that which is moved. Nevertheless, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with greater attention, it seemeth to be the same with <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For of two parts of a hard Body, when that which is foremost drives before it the Medium in which the motion is made, at the same time that which is thrust forwards, thrusteth the next, and this again the next, and so on successively. In which action, if we
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59147:139"/>
suppose that there is no place void, it must needs be, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Pulsion, namely, when that action has gone round, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent will be behind that part which at the first seemed not to be thrust forwards, but to be drawn; so that now the Body which was drawn, goes before the Body which gives it motion; and its motion is no longer Traction, but Pulsion.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Such things as are removed from their places by forcible Compression or Extension, and as soon as the force is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, doe presently return and restore themselves to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer situation, have the beginning of their restitution within themselves, namely, a certain motion in their internal parts, which was there, when, before the taking away of the force, they were compressed, or extended. For that Restitution is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that which is at rest cannot be moved, but by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and a Contiguous Movent. Nor doth the cause of their Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution proceed from the taking away of the force by which they were compressed or extended; for the removing of impediments hath not the efficacy of a cause (as has been shewn at the end of the 3d Article of the 15th Chapter). The Cause therefore of their Restitution, is some motion either of the parts of the Ambient; or of the parts of the Body compressed or extended. But the parts of the Ambient have no endeavour which contributes to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or Extension, nor to the setting of them at liberty, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. It remayns therefore that from the time of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or Extension there be left some endeavour (or motion) by which, the impediment being removed, every part resumes its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place; that is to say, the whole Restores it self.</p>
               <p n="14">14 In the <hi>Carriage</hi> of Bodies if that Body which carries ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hit upon any obstacle, or be by any means suddenly stopped, and that which is carried be not stopped, it will go on, till its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be by some external impediment taken away.</p>
               <p>For I have demonstrated in the 8th Chapter at the 19th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that Motion, unless it be hindred by some external resistance, will be continued eternally with the same celerity; and in the 7th Article of the 9th Chap. that the action of an external Agent is of no effect without contact. When therefore that which carrieth another thing, is stopped, that stop doth not presently take away the motion of that which is carried. It will therefore proceed,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59147:140"/>
till its motion be by little and little extinguished by some external resistance; Which was to be proved; Though experience alone had been sufficient to prove this.</p>
               <p>In like manner, if that Body which carrieth another be put from rest into sudden motion; that which is carried will not be moved forwards together with it, but will be left behind. For the contiguous part of the Body carried, hath almost the same motion with the Body which carries it; and the remote parts will receive different Velocities according to their different distances from the Body that carries them; namely, the more remote the parts are, the less will be their degrees of Velocity. It is necessary therefore that the Body which is carried, be left accordingly more or less behind. And this also is manifest by experience, when at the start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward of the Horse, the Rider falleth backwards.</p>
               <p n="15">15 In <hi>Percussion</hi> therefore, when one hard Body is in some small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art of it stricken by another with great force, it is not necessary that the whole Body should yeild to the stroke with the same ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity with which the stricken part yeilds. For the rest of the parts receive their motion from the motion of the part stricken and yeilding, which motion is less propagated every way towards the sides then it is directly forwards. And hence it is, that sometimes very hard Bodies, which being erected can hardly be made to stand, are more easily broken, then thrown down by a violent stroke; when nevertheless, if all their parts together were by any weak motion thrust forwards they would easily be cast down.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Though the difference between <hi>Trusion</hi> and <hi>Percussion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist onely in this, that in <hi>Trusion</hi> the motion both of the Movent and Moved Body begin both together in their very contact; and in <hi>Percussion</hi> the striking Body is first moved, and afterwards the Body stricken; Yet their Effects are so different, that it seems scarce possible to compare their forces with one another. I say, any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Percussion being propounded, as for example the stroke of a Beetle of any weight assigned, by which a Pile of any given length, is to be driven into earth of any tenacity given, it seems to me very hard if not impossible to define, with what weight, or with what stroke, and in what time, the same pile may be driven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a depth assigned into the same earth. The cause of which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59147:140"/>
is this, that the velocity of the Percutient is to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the magnitude of the Ponderant. Now Velocity, seeing it is computed by the length of space transmitted, is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but as one Dimension; but Waight, is as a solid thing, being measured by the dimension of the whole Body. And there is no comparison to be made of a Solid Body with a Length, that is, with a Line.</p>
               <p n="17">17 If the internal parts of a Body be at rest, or retain the same situation with one another for any time how little soever, there cannot in those parts be generated any new motion, or endeavour, whereof the efficient cause is not without the Body of which they are parts. For if any small part which is comprehended within the Superficies of the whole Body, be supposed to be now at rest, and by and by to be moved, that part must of necessity receive its motion from some moved and contiguous Body. But (by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) there is no such moved and contiguous part within the Body. Wherefore, if there be any Endeavour or Motion, or change of situation, in the internal parts of that Body, it must needs arise from some efficient cause that is without the Body which contains them; Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="18">18 In hard Bodies therefore which are compressed or extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if that which compresseth or extendeth them being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they restore themselves to their former place or situation, it must needs be, that that Endeavour (or Motion) of their internal parts, by which they were able to recover their former places or situations, was not extinguished when the force by which they were compressed or extended was taken away. Therefore when the Lath of a Cross-bow bent, doth, as soon as it is at liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it self, though to him that judges by Sense, both it and all its parts seem to be at rest; yet he that judging by Reason, doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the taking away of impediment for an efficient cause, nor conceives that without an efficient cause any thing can pass from Rest to Motion, will conclude, that the parts were already in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before they began to restore themselves.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Reaction</hi> proceed in the same Line, but from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Terms. For seeing Reaction is nothing but Endeavour in the Patient to restore it self to that situation from which it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59147:141"/>
by the Agent; the endeavour or motion both of the Agent and Patient (or Reagent) will be propagated between the same terms, (yet so, as that in Action the Term <hi>from which,</hi> is in Reaction the Term <hi>to which</hi>). And seeing all Action proceeds in this manner, not onely between the opposite Terms of the whole line in which it is propagated, but also in all the parts of that line, the Terms <hi>from which</hi> and <hi>to which,</hi> both of the Action and Reaction, will be in the same line. Wherefore Action and Reaction proceed in the same line, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="20">20 To what has been said of Motion, I will add what I have to say concerning Habit. <hi>Habit</hi> therefore is a generation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of Motion simply, but an easie conducting of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Body in a certain and designed way. And seeing it is attained by the weakning of such endeavours as divert its motion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such endeavours are to be weakned by little and little. But this cannot be done but by the long continuance of action, or by actions often repeated; and therefore Custome begets that Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, which is commonly and rightly called <hi>Habit;</hi> and it may be defined thus; HABIT <hi>is Motion made more easie and ready by Custome; that is to say, by perpetual endeavour, or by iterated endevours in a way differing from that in which the Motion proceeded from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and opposing such endeavours as resist.</hi> And to make this more perspicuous by example, We may observe, that when one that has no skill in Musique, first, puts his hand to an Instrument, he cannot after the first stroke carry to his hand to the place where he would make the second stroke, without taking it back by a new endeavour, and as it were beginning again, pass from the first to the second. Nor will he be able to go on to the third place without another new endeavour, but he will be forced to draw back his hand again, and so successively, by renewing his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at every stroke, till at the last by doing this often, and by compounding many interrupted motions or endeavours into one equal endeavour, he be able to make his hand go readily on from stroke to stroke in that order and way which was at the first designed. Nor are <hi>Habits</hi> to be observed in living creatures only, but also in Bodies inanimate. For we find, that when the Lath of a Crossbow is strongly bent, and would if the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59147:141"/>
were removed return again with great force, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a long time bent, it will get such a <hi>Habit,</hi> that when it is loosed and left to its own freedome, it will not onely not restore it self, but will require as much force for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it back to its first posture, as it did for the bending of it at the first.</p>

For seeing the parts A E F D and E B C F of the Ponderant A B C D, are equally pois'd; and the weight E G H F is added to the part A E F D, and nothing is added to the part E B C F, but the weight E G H F is taken from it; therefore (by the first Supposition) the parts A G H D and G B C H will not be equally pois'd; and consequently G H is not a Plain of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation. Wherefore, No two Plains of Equiponderation, &amp;c. Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Center of Equiponderation is in every Plain of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation.</p>
               <p>For if another Plain of Equiponderation be taken, it will not (by the last Article) be parallel to the former Plain; and therefore both those Plains will cut one another. Now that Section (by the 6th Definition) is the Diameter of Equiponderation. Again, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diameter of Equiponderation be taken, it will cut that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diameter; and in that Section (by the 7th Definition) is the Center of Equiponderation. Wherefore the Center of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation is in that Diameter which lies in the said Plain of Equiponderation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Moment of any Ponderant applyed to one point of the Beam, to the Moment of the same, or an equal Ponderant applyed to any other point of the Beam, is as the distance of the former point from the Center of the Scale, to the distance of the later point from the same Center. Or thus, Those Moments are to one another, as the Arches of Circles which are made upon the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scale through those points, in the same time. Or lastly thus; They are, as the parallel bases of two Triangles, which have a common angle at the Center of the Scale.</p>
               <p>Let A (in the 2d figure) be the Center of the Scale; and let the equal Poderants D and E press the Beam A B in the points B and C; also let the straight lines B D and C E be Diameters of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation; and the points D and E in the Ponderants D and E be their Centers of Equiponderation. Let A G F be drawn how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59147:144"/>
cutting D B produced in F, and E C in G; and lastly, upon the common Center A, let the two arches B H and C I be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, cutting A G F in H and I. I say the Moment of the Ponderant D to the Moment of the Ponderant E, is as A B to A C, or as B H to C I, or as B F to C G. For the effect of the Ponderant D in the point B, is circular motion in the arch B H; and the effect of the Ponderant E in the point C, circular motion in the arch C I; and by reason of the equality of the Ponderants D and E, these moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to one another as the Quicknesses or Velocities with which the points B and C describe the arches B H and C I, that is, as the arches themselves B H and C I, or as the straight parallels B F and C G, or as the parts of the Beam A B and A C; for A B. A C :: B F. C G :: B H. C I. are proportionals; and therefore the effects, that is, (by the 4th Definition) the Moments of the equal Ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants applyed to several points of the Beam, are to one another, as A B and A C; or as the distances of those points from the center of the Scale; or as the parallel bases of the Triangles which have a common angle at A; or as the concentrick arches B H and C I; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Unequal Ponderants, when they are applyed to several points of the Beam, and hang at liberty (that is, so as the line by which they hang be the Diameter of Equiponderation, whatsoever be the figure of the Ponderant), have their Moments to one another in proportion compounded of the proportions of their distances from the center of the Scale, and of their Waights.</p>
               <p>Let A (in the 3d figure) be the center of the Scale, and A B the Beam; to which let the two Ponderants C &amp; D be applied at the points B and E. I say the proportion of the Moment of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derant C, to the Moment of the Ponderant D, is compounded of the proportions of A B to A E and of the Waight C to the Waight D; or (if C and D be of the same species) of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude C to the magnitude D.</p>
               <p>Let either of them, as C, be supposed to be bigger then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther D. If therefore by the addition of F, F and D together be as one Body equal to C, the Moment of C to the Moment of F + D will be (by the last article) as B G is to E H. Now as F + D is to D, so let E H be to another E I; and the moment of F + D, that is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59147:144"/>
of C, to the moment of D, will be as B G to E I. But the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of B G to E I is compounded of the proportions (of B G to E H that is) of A B to A E, and (of E H to E I, that is) of the waight C to the waight D. Wherefore unequal Ponderants, when they are applied, &amp;c. which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The same figure remaining, if I K be drawn parallel to the Beame A B, and cutting A G in K; and K L be drawn parallel to to B G, cutting A B in L, the distances A B and A L from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will be proportional to the moments of C and D. For the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of C is B G, and the moment of D is E I, to which K L is equal. But as the distance A B from the center, is to the distance A L from the center, so is B G the moment of the Ponderant C, to L K, or E I the moment of the Ponderant D.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If two Ponderants have their waights and distances from the center in reciprocal proportion, and the center of the Scale be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the points to which the Ponderants are applied, they will be equally poised. And contrarily, if they be equally poised, their waights and distances from the center of the Scale will be in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall proportion.</p>
               <p>Let the center of the Scale (in the same 3d figure) be A, the Beam A B; and let any Ponderant C, having B G for its moment, be applied to the point B; also let any other Ponderant D, whose moment is E I, be applied to the point E. Through the point I, let I K be drawn parallel to the Beam A B, cutting A G in K; also let K L be drawn parallel to B G. K L will then be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ponderant D; and (by the last Article) it will be as B G the Moment of the Ponderant C in the point B, to L K the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ponderant D in the point E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so A B to A L. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the center of the Scale, let A N be taken equal to A L; and to the point N let there be applyed the Ponderant O, having to the Ponderant C the proportion of A B to A N. I say the Ponderants in B and N will be equally poised. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Moment of the Ponderant O in the point N, to the Moment of the Ponderant C in the point B, is (by the 5th Article) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of the proportions of the waight O to the waight B, &amp; of the distance (from the center of the Scale) A N or A L to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the center of the Scale) A B. But seeing we have supposed, that the distance A B to the distance A N, is in reciprocal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59147:145"/>
of the Waight O to the waight C, the proportion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ponderant O in the point N, to the Moment of the Ponderant C in the point B, will be compounded of the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of A B to A N, and of A N to A B. Wherefore, setting in order A B, A N, A B, the Moment of O to the Moment of C will be as the first to the last, that is, as A B to A B. Their Moments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are equal; and consequently the Plain which passes through A, will (by the fifth Definition) be a Plain of Equiponderation. Wherefore they will be equally poised; as was to be proved.</p>
               <p>Now the converse of this is manifest. For if there be Equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and the proportion of the Waights and Distances be not reciprocal, then both the Waights will alwayes have the same Moments, although one of them have more waight added to it, or its distance changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> When Ponderants are of the same Species, and their Moments be equal; their Magnitudes and Distances from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scale will be reciprocally proportional.

               <p n="8">8 If to the whole length of the Beam there be applyed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram, or a <hi>Parallelopipedum,</hi> or a <hi>Prisma,</hi> or a Cylinder, or the Superficies of a Cylinder, ot of a Sphere, or of any portion of a Sphere or <hi>Prisma;</hi> the parts of any of them cut off with plains pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the base, will have their Moments in the same proportion with the parts of a Triangle which has its Vertex in the center of the Scale, and for one of its sides the Beam it self, which parts are cut off by Plains parallel to the base.</p>
               <p>First, let the rectangled Parallelogram A B C D (in the 4th fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) be applyed to the whole length of the Beam A B; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing C B howsoever to E, let the Triangle A B E be described. Let now any part of the Parallelogram, as A F, be cut off by the plain F G, parallel to the base C B; and let F G be produced to A E in the point H. I say the Moment of the whole A B C D to the Moment of its part A F, is as the Triangle A B E to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle A G H, that is, in proportion duplicate to that of the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the center of the Scale.</p>
               <p>For, the Parallelogram A B C D being divided into equal parts
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59147:145"/>
infinite in number, by straight lines drawn parallel to the base; and supposing the Moment of the straight line C B to be B E; the Moment of the straight line F G, will (by the 7th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) be G H; and the Moments of all the straight lines of that Parallelogram, will be so many straight lines in the Triangle A B E drawn parallel to the base B E; all which parallels together taken are the Moment of the whole Parallelogram A B C D; and the same parallels do also constitute the superficies of the Triangle A B E. Wherefore the Moment of the Parallelogram A B C D, is the Triangle A B E; and for the same reason, the Moment of the Parallelogram A F, is the Triangle A G H; and therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Parallelogram, to the Moment of a Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram which is part of the same, is as the Triangle A B E, to the Triangle A G H, or in proportion duplicate to that of the Beams to which they are applyed. And what is here demonstrated in the case of a Parallelogram, may be understood to serve for that of a Cylinder, and of a <hi>Prisma,</hi> and their Superficies; as also for the Superficies of a Sphere, of an Hemisphere, or any portion of a Sphere, (for the parts of the Superficies of a Sphere, have the same proportion with that of the parts of the Axis cut off by the same parallels by which the parts of the Superficies are cut off, as <hi>Archimedes</hi> has demonstrated); and therefore when the parts of any of these figures are equal and at equal distances from the Center of the Scale, their Moments also are equal, in the same manner as they are in Parallelograms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the Parallelogram A K I B not be rectangled; the straight line I B wil nevertheless press the point B perpendicularly in the straight line B E; &amp; the straight line L G wil press the point G perpendicularly in the straight line G H; and all the rest of the straight lines which are parallel to I B will do the like. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore the Moment be which is assigned to the straight line I B, as here (for example) it is supposed to be B E, if A E be drawn, the Moment of the whole Parallelogram A I will be the Triangle A B E; and the Moment of the part A L will be the Triangle A G H. Wherefore the Moment of any Ponderant, which has its sides equally applyed to the Beam, (whether they be applyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly or obliquely) will be always to the Moment of a part of the same, in such proportion, as the whole Triangle has to a part

of the same cut off by a plain which is parallel to the base.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The Center of Equiponderation of any figure which is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient according to commensurable proportions of the altitude and base diminished, and whose complete figure is either a Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, or a Cylinder, or a <hi>Parallelopipedum,</hi> divides the Axis, so, that the part next the Vertex, to the other part, is as the complete fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure to the deficient figure.</p>
               <p>For let C I A P E (in the 5th figure) be a deficient figure, whose Axis is A B, and whose complete figure is C D F E; and let the Axis A B be so divided in Z, that A Z be to Z B as C D F E is to C I A P E. I say the center of Equiponderation of the figure C I A P E will be in the point Z.</p>
               <p>First, that the Center of Equiponderation of the figure C I A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>P E is somewhere in the Axis A B, is manifest of it self; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore A B is a Diameter of Equiponderation. Let A E be drawn, and let B E be put for the Moment of the straight line C E; the Triangle A B E will therefore (by the 3d Article) be the Moment of the complete figure C D F E. Let the Axis A B be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in L, and let G L H be drawn parallel and equal to the straight line C E, cutting the crooked line C I A P E in I and P, and the straight lines A C and A E in K and M. Moreover, let Z O be drawn parallel to the same C E; and let it be, as L G to L I, so L M to another L N; and let the same be done in all the rest of the straight lines possible, parallel to the base; and through all the points N, let the line A N E be drawn; the three-sided figure A N E B will therefore be the Moment of the figure C I A P E. Now the Triangle A B E is (by the 9th Article of the 17th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to the three-sided figure A N E B, as A B C D + A I C B is to A I C B twice taken, that is, as C D F E + C I A P E is to C I A P E twice taken. But as C I A P E is to C D F E, that is, as the waight of the deficient figure, is to the waight of the complete figure, so is C I A P E twice taken, to C D F E twice taken. Wherefore, setting in order C D F E + C I A P E. 2 C I A P E. 2 C D F E; the proportion of C D F E + C I A P E to C D F E twice taken, will be compounded of the proportion of C D F E + C I A P E to C I A P E twice taken, that is, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Triangle A B E to the threesided figure A N E B, that is, of the Moment of the complete figure to the Moment of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59147:146"/>
the deficient figure, and of the proportion of C I A P E twice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to C D F E twice taken, that is, to the proportion reciprocally taken of the waight of the deficient figure to the waight of the complete figure.</p>
               <p>Again, seeing by supposition A Z. Z B :: C D F E. C I A P E are proportionals; A B. A Z :: C D F E + C I A P E. C D F E will also (by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounding) be proportionals. And seeing A L is the half of A B, A L. A Z :: C D F E + C I A P E. 2 C D F E will also be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals. But the proportion of C D F E + C I A P E to 2 C D F E is compounded (as was but now shewn) of the proportions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Moment &amp;c. and therefore the proportion of A L to A Z is compounded of the proportion of the Moment of the complete figure C D F E to the Moment of the deficient figure C I A P E, and of the proportion of the waight of the deficient figure C I A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>P E, to the waight of the complete figure C D F E; But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of A L to A Z is compounded of the proportions of A L to B Z and of B Z to A Z. Now the proportion of B Z to A Z is the proportion of the Waights reciprocally taken, that is to say, of the waight C I A P F to the waight C D F E. Therefore the remayning proportion of A L to B Z, that is, of L B to B Z is the proportion of the Moment of the waight C D F E to the Moment of the waight C I A P E. But the proportion of A L to B Z is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the proportions of A L to A Z and of A Z to Z B; of which proportions that of A Z to Z B is the proportion of the waight C D F E to the waight C I A P E. Wherefore (by the 5th Article of this Chapter) the remayning proportion of A L to A Z is the proportion of the distances of the points Z and L from the center of the Scale, which is A. And therefore (by the 6th Article) the waight C I A P E shall hang from O in the straight line O Z. So that O Z is one Diameter of Equiponderation of the waight C I A P E. But the straight line A B is the other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of Equiponderation of the same waight C I A P E. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by the 7th Definition) the point Z is the center of the same Equiponderation; which point (by construction) divides the axis so, that the part A Z which is the part next the vertex, is to the other part Z B, as the complete figure C D F E is to the deficient figure C I A P E; which is that which was to be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

Also the Solid of a three-sided figure of one Meane, that is, a parabolical Solid, seeing it is 2/4, that is ½ of its Cylinder, will have its Center of Equiponderation in that point, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the axis, so, that the part towards the vertex be double to the part towards the base.</item>

               <p>For let A I C B (in the same 5 fig.) be the halfe of a Parabola, or of any other of those three-sided figures which are in the Table of the 3d article of the 17th Chap whose Axis is A B, and base B C; having A D drawn from the Vertex, equall and parallel to the base B C; and whose complete figure is the parallelogramme A B C D. Let I Q be drawne, at any distance from the side C D,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59147:147"/>
but parallel to it; and let A D be the altitude of the Complement A I C D, and Q I a line ordinately applyed in it. Wherefore the altitude A L in the deficient figure A I C B, is equal to Q I the line ordinately applyed in its Complement; and contrarily, L I the line ordinately applyed in the figure A I C B, is equall to the altitude A Q in its Complement; and so in all the rest of the ordinate lines and altitudes, the mutation is such, that that line which is ordinately applyed in the figure, is the altitude of its Complement. And therefore the proportion of the altitudes decreasing, to that of the ordinate lines decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, being multiplicate according to any number in the deficient figure, is submultiplicate according to the same number in its Complement. For example, if A I C B be a Parabola, seeing the proportion of A B to A L is duplicate to that of B C to L I, the proportion of A D to A Q in the Complement A I C D (which is the same with that of B C to L I) will be subduplicate to that of C D to Q I (which is the same with that of A B to A L); and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, in a Parabola, the Complement will be to the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogramme as 1 to 3; in a three-sided figure of two Meanes, as 1 to 4; in a three-sided figure of three Meanes, as 1 to 5, &amp;c. But all the ordinate lines together in A I C D are its moment; and all the ordinate lines in A I C B are its moment. Wherefore the moments of the Complements of the halves of Deficient figures in the Table of the 3d article of the 17th Chap. being compared, are as the Deficient figures themselves; and therefore the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of Equiponderation will divide the straight line A D in such proportion, that the part next the Vertex be to the other part, as the complete figure A B C D is to the Complement A I C D.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59147:148"/>
And in like manner, any other of the said three-sided figures being propounded, if the numerator of its fraction (found out in the Table) be taken from the denominator, the straight line drawn from the Vertex is to be divided, so, that the part next the Vertex be to the other part, as the denominator is to the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which that substraction leaves.</p>

               <p>For example, let the first figure of three Means be taken, whose half is A B C D (in the 6th figure), and let the rectangle A B E D be completed. The Complement therefore will be B C D E. And seeing A B E D is to the figure A B C D (by the Table) as 5 to 4, the same A B E D will be to the Complement B C D E as 5 to 1.

Let P R be taken quadruple to P Q; and let R M be drawn and produced to F G in S. R M therefore will be to M S as 4 to 1, that is, as the figure A B C D to its Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment B C D E. Wherefore seeing M is the center of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete figure A B E D, and the distances of R and S from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter M be in proportion reciprocall to that of the waight of the Complement B C D E to the waight of the figure A B C D, R and S will either be the centers of Equiponderation of their own
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59147:148"/>
figures, or those centers will be in some other points of the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Equiponderation H I and F G. But this last is impossible. For no other straight line can be drawn through the point M ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in the straight lines H I and F G, and retaining the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of M R to M S, that is, of the figure A B C D to its comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment B C D E. The center therefore of Equiponderation of the figure A B C D is in the point S. Now seeing P M hath the same proportion to Q S which R P hath to R Q, Q S will be 5 of those parts of which P M is 4, that is, of which I N is 4. But I N or P M is 2 of those parts of which E B or F G is 6; and therefore if it be, as 4 to 5, so 2 to a fourth, that fourth will be 2½. Wherefore Q S is 2½ of those parts of which F G is 6. But F Q is 1; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore F S is 3½. Wherefore the remayning part G S is 2½. So that F G is so divided in S, that the part towards the Axis, is in proportion to the other part as 2½ to 3½, that is, as 5 to 7; which answereth to the fraction 5/7 in the second row, next under the fraction ⅘ in the first row. Wherefore drawing S T parallel to the Axis, the base wil be divided in like manner.</p>
               <p>By this Method it is manifest, that the base of a Semiparabola will be divided into 3 and 5; and the base of the first three-sided figure of two Means, into 4 and 6; and of the first three-sided figure of four Means, into 6 and 8. The fractions therefore of the second row denote the proportions into which the bases of the figures of the first row are divided by the diameters of Equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. But the first row begins one place higher then the second row.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The center of Equiponderation of the half of any of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the second row of the same Table of the 3d article of the 17th Chapter, is in a straight line parallel to the Axis, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the base according to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the fraction in the fourth row, two places lower, so, as that the Numerator be answerable to that part which is next the Axis.</p>
               <p>Let the half of the second three-sided figure of two Means be taken; and let it be A B C D (in the 7th Figure); whose comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is B C D E, and the rectangle completed A B E D. Let this rectangle be divided by the two straight lines L K &amp; N O, cutting one another in the center M at right angles; and because A B E D

is to A B C D as 5 to 3, let A B be divided in G, so, that A G to B G be as 3 to 5; and let F G be drawn parallel to the base. Also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause A B E D is (by the 9th article) to B C D E as 5 to 2, let B E be divided in the point I, so, that B I be to I E as 5 to 2; and let I H be drawn parallel to the Axis, cutting L K and F G in P and Q. Let now P R be so taken, that it be to P Q as 3 to 2, and let R M be drawn and produced to F G in S. Seeing therefore R P is to R Q, that is, R M to M S, as A B C D is to its complement B C D E, and the centers of Equiponderation of A B C D and B C D E are in the straight lines F G and H I, and the center of Equiponderation of them both together in the point M; R will be the center of the Complement B C D E, and S the center of the Figure A B C D. And seeing P M, that is I N, is to Q S, as R P is to R Q; and I N, or P M is 3 of those parts, of which B E, that is, F G is 14; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Q S is 5 of the same parts; and E I, that is F Q, 4; and F S, 9; and G S, 5. Wherefore the straight line S T being drawn parallel to the Axis, will divide the base A D into 5 and 9. But the fraction 5/9 is found in the fourth row of the Table, two places below the fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 9/5 in the second row.</p>
               <p>By the same method, if in the same second row, there be taken the second three-sided Figure of three Meanes, the center of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of the half of it, will be found to be in a straight line parallel to the Axis, dividing the base according to the numbers of the fraction 6/10, two places below in the fourth row. And the same way serves for all the rest of the Figures in the second row. In like manner, the center of Equiponderation of the third three-sided Figure of three Means, will be found to be in a straight line paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Axis, dividing the base, so, that the part next the Axis, be to the other part, as 7 to 13, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59147:149"/>For example, let the Semiparabola A B C D (in the 8th Fig.) be taken; whose Axis is A B; whose complete Figure is A B E D; and whose excess above its triangle is B C D B. Its center of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiponderation may be found out in this manner. Let F G be drawn parallel to the base, so, that A F be a third part of the Axis; and let H I be drawn parallel to the Axis, so, that A H be a third part of the base. This being done, the center of Equiponderation of the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle A B D, will be I. Again, let K L be drawn parallel to the base, so, that A K be to A B as 2 to 5; and M N parallel to the Axis, so, that A M be to A D as 3 to 8; and let M N terminate in the straight line K L. The center therefore of Equiponderation of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola A B C D is N; and therefore we have the centers of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of the Semiparabola A B C D, and of its part the triangle A B D. That we may now finde the Center of Equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the remayning part B C D B, let I N be drawn and produced to O, so, that N O be triple to I N; and O will be the center sought for. For seeing the waight of A B D, to the waight of B C D B is in proportion reciprocall to that of the straight line N O to the straight line I N; and N is the center of the whole, and I the center of the triangle A B D; O will be the center of the remaining part, namely, of the figure B D C B; which was to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> The Center of Equiponderation of the figure B D C B, is in the concourse of two straight lines, whereof one is paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the base, and divides the Axis, so, that the part next the base be ⅖ or 6/15 of the whole Axis; the other is parallel to the Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, and so divides the base, that the part towards the Axis be ½ or 12/24 of the whole base. For drawing O P parallel to the base, it will be as I N to N O, so F K to K P, that is, so 1 to 3, or 5 to 15. But A F is 5/15 or ⅓ of the whole A B; and A K is 6/15 or ⅖; and F K <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The excesses of the rest of the three-sided figures in the first row of the Table of the 3d article of the 17th Chapter, have their centers of Equiponderation in two straight lines which divide the

Lastly let A G be ¾ of the straight line A F. I say G is the center of Equiponderation of the Sector A B C.</p>
               <p>Let the straight line F H be drawne of any length, making right angles with A F at F; and drawing the straight line A H, let the triangle A F H be made. Then upon the same center A let any arch I K be drawne, cutting A D in L; and its chord, cutting A D in M; and dividing M L equally in N, let N O be drawne parallel to the straight line F H, and meeting with the straight line A H in O.</p>
               <p>Seeing now B D C is the Spherical Superficies of the portion cut off with a plain passing through B C, and cutting the Axis at right angles; and seeing F H divides E D the Axis of the portion into two equal parts in F; the center of Equiponderation of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59147:150"/>
B D C will be in F (by the 8th article); and for the same reason the center of Equiponderation of the Superficies I L K (K being in the straight line A C) will be in N. And in like manner, if there were drawne between the center of the Sphere A and the outermost Spherical Superficies of the Sector, arches infinite in number, the centers of Equiponderation of the Sphericall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies in which those arches are,, would be found to be in that part of the Axis, which is intercepted between the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it selfe and a plaine passing along by the chord of the arch, and cutting the Axis in the middle at right angles.</p>
               <p>Let it now be supposed that the moment of the outermost sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Superficies B D C is F H. Seeing therefore the Superficies B D C is to the Superficies I L K in proportion duplicate to that of the arch B D C to the arch I L K, that is, of B E to I M, that is, of F H to N O; let it be as F H to N O, so N O to another N P; and again, as N O to N P, so N P to another N Q; and let this be done in all the straight lines parallel to the base F H that can possibly be drawn between the base and the vertex of the triangle A F H.

Let now F H be understood to be the semidiameter of the base of a right Cone, whose side is A H, and Axis A F. Wherfore seeing the bases of the Cones which passe through F and N and the rest of the points of the Axis, are in proportion duplicate to that of the straight lines F H and N O, &amp;c. the moment of all the bases together, that is, of the whole Cone, will be the figure it self A F H Q A; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the center of Equiponderation of the Cone A F H is the same with that of the solid Sector. Wherefore seeing A G is ¾ of the Axis A F, the center of Equiponderation of the Cone A F H is in G; and therefore the center of the solid Sector is in G also, and divides the part A F of the Axis, so, that A G is triple to G F; that is, A G is to A F as 3 to 4; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Note, that when the Sector is a Hemisphere, the Axis of the

Which being so, Refraction on one side will destroy Refraction on the other side; and consequently, either the Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted line will be every where, (which is absurd), or there will be no Refracted line at all; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> It is manifest from hence, that the cause of Refraction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth onely in the obliquity of the line of Incidence, whether the Incident Body penetrate both the Mediums, or without penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, propagate motion by Pressure onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If a Body, without any change of situation of its internal parts, as a stone, be moved obliquely out of the thinner Medium, and proceed penetrating the thicker Medium; and the thicker Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium be such, as that its internal parts being moved, restore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their former situation; the angle Refracted will be greater then the angle of Inclination.</p>
               <p>For let D B E (in the same first figure) be the separating Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of two Mediums; and let a Body, as a stone thrown, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be moved as is supposed in the straight line A B C; and let A B be in the thinner Medium, as in the Aire; and B C in the thicker, as in the Water. I say the stone, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being thrown, is moved in the line A B, will not proceed in the line B C, but in some other line, namely that, with which the perpendicular B H makes the Refracted angle H B F greater then the angle of Inclination H B C.</p>
               <p>For seeing the stone coming from A, and falling upon B, makes that which is at B proceed towards H, and that the like is done in all the straight lines which are parallel to B H; and seeing the parts moved restore themselves by contrary motion in the same line; there will be contrary motion generated in H B, and in all the straight lines which are parallel to it. Wherefore the motion of the stone will be made by the concourse of the motions in A G, that is, in D B, and in G B, that is, in B H, and lastly, in H B, that is, by the concourse of three motions. But by the concourse of the motions in A G and B H, the stone will be carried to C; and therefore by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the motion in H B, it will be carried higher in some other line, as in B F, and make the angle H B F greater then the angle H B C.</p>
               <p>And from hence may be derived the cause, why Bodies which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59147:154"/>
are thrown in a very oblique line, if either they be any thing flat, or be thrown with great force, will when they fall upon the water, be cast up again from the water into the aire.</p>
               <p>For let A B (in the 2d figure) be the superficies of the water; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which from the point C, let a stone be thrown in the straight line C A, making with the line B A produced a very little angle C A D; and producing B A indefinitely to D, let C D be drawn perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to it, and A E parallel to C D. The stone therefore will be moved in C A by the concourse of two motions in C D and D A, whose velocities are as the lines themselves C D and D A. And from the motion in C D and all its parallels downwards, as soon as the stone falls upon A, there will be Reaction upwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the water restores it self to its former situation. If now the stone be thrown with sufficient obliquity, that is, if the straight line C D be short enough, that is, if the endeavour of the stone downwards be less then the Reaction of the water upwards, that is, less then the endeavour it hath from its own gravity, (for that may be), the stone will (by reason of the excess of the endeavour which the water hath to restore it self, above that which the stone hath downwards) be raised again above the Superficies A B, and be carried higher, being reflected in a line which goes higher, as the line A G.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If from a point, whatsoever the Medium be, Endeavour be propagated every way into all the parts of that Medium; and to the same Endeavour there be obliquely opposed another Medium of a different nature, that is, either thinner or thicker; that Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour will be so refracted, that the sine of the angle Refracted, to the sine of the angle of Inclination, will be as the density of the first Medium to the density of the second Medium, reciprocally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>First, let a Body be in the thinner Medium in A (Figure 3d.); and let it be understood to have endeavour every way, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that its endeavour proceed in the lines A B and A <hi>b;</hi> to which let B <hi>b</hi> the superficies of the thicker Medium be obliquely opposed in B and <hi>b,</hi> so that A B and A <hi>b</hi> be equal; and let the straight line B <hi>b</hi> be produced both wayes. From the points B and <hi>b</hi> let the perpendiculars B C and <hi>b c</hi> be drawn; and upon the centers
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59147:154"/>
B and <hi>b,</hi> and at the equal distances B A and <hi>b</hi> A, let the Circles A C and A <hi>c</hi> be described, cutting B C and <hi>b c</hi> in C and <hi>c,</hi> and the same C B and <hi>c b</hi> produced in D and <hi>d,</hi> as also A B and A <hi>b</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in E and <hi>e.</hi> Then from the point A to the straight lines B C and <hi>b c</hi> let the perpendiculars A F and A <hi>f</hi> be drawn. A F therefore will be the sine of the angle of Inclination of the straight line A B, and A <hi>f</hi> the sine of the angle of Inclination of the straight line A <hi>h,</hi> which two Inclinations are by construction made equal. I say, as the density of the Medium in which are B C and <hi>b c,</hi> is to the density of the Medium in which are B D and <hi>b d,</hi> so is the sine of the angle Refracted, to the sine of the angle of Inclination.</p>
               <p>Let the straight line F G be drawn parallel to the straight line A B, meeting with the straight line <hi>b</hi> B produced in G.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore A F and B G are also parallels, they will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; and consequently, the endeavour in A F is propagated in the same time, in which the endeavour in B G would be propagated if the Medium were of the same density. But because B G is in a thicker Medium, that is, in a Medium which resists the endeavour more then the Medium in which A F is, the endeavour will be propagated less in B G then in A F, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the density of the Medium in which A F is, hath to the density of the Medium in which B G is. Let therefore the density of the Medium in which B G is, be to the density of the Medium in which A F is, as B G is to B H; and let the measure of the time be the Radius of the Circle. Let H I be drawn parallel to B D, meeting with the circumference in I; and from the point I let I K be drawn perpendicular to B D; which being done, B H and I K will be equal; and I K will be to A F, as the density of the Medium in which is A F, is to the density of the Medium in which is I K. Seeing therefore in the time A B (which is the Radius of the Circle) the endeavour is propagated in A F in the thinner Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, it will be propagated in the same time, that is, in the time B I in the thicker Medium from K to I. Therefore B I is the Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted line of the line of Incidence A B; and I K is the sine of the angle Refracted; and A F, the sine of the angle of Inclination. Wherefore seeing I K is to A F, as the density of the Medium in which is A F to the density of the Medium in which is I K; it will be as the density of the Medium in which is A F, (or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59147:155"/>
B C) to the density of the Medium in which is I K (or B D), so the sine of the angle Refracted to the sine of the angle of Inclination. And by the same reason it may be shewn, that as the density of the thinner Medium is to the density of the thicker Medium, so will K I the sine of the angle Refracted be to A F the sine of the Angle of Inclination.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the Body which endeavoureth every way, be in the thicker Medium at I. If therefore both the Mediums were of the same density, the endeavour of the Body in I B would tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to L; and the sine of the angle of Inclination L M would be equal to I K or B H. But because the density of the Medium in which is IK, to the density of the Medium in which is L M, is as BH to B G, that is, to A F, the endeavour will be propagated further in the Medium in which L M is, then in the Medium in which I K is, in the proportion of density to density, that is, of M L to A F. Wherefore B A being drawn, the angle Refracted will be C B A, and its sine A F. But L M is the sine of the angle of Inclination; and therefore again, as the density of one Medium is to the densi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the different Medium, so reciprocally is the sine of the angle Refracted to the sine of the angle of Inclination, which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>In this Demonstration, I have made the separating Superficies B <hi>b</hi> plain by construction. But though it were concave or convex, the Theoreme would nevertheless be true. For the Refraction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in the point B of the plain separating Superficies, if a crooked line, as P Q be drawn, touching the separating line in the point B; neither the Refracted line B I, nor the perpendicular B D will be altered; and the Refracted angle K B I, as also its sine K I will be still the same they were.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The sine of the angle Refracted in one Inclination, is to the sine of the angle Refracted in another Inclination, as the sine of the angle of that Inclination to the sine of the angle of this Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>For seeing the sine of the Refracted angle is to the sine of the angle of Inclination, (whatsoever that Inclination be) as the density of one Medium, to the density of the other Medium; the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sine of the Refracted angle, to the sine of the angle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, will be compounded of the proportions of density to den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59147:155"/>
and of the sine of the angle of one Inclination to the sine of the angle of the other Inclination. But the proportions of the densities in the same Homogeneous Body, are supposed to be the same. Wherefore Refracted angles in different Inclinations, are as the sines of the angles of those Inclinations; which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If two lines of Incidence having equal inclination, be the one in a thinner, the other in a thicker Medium; the sine of the angle of their Inclination, will be a mean proportional between the two sines of their angles Refracted.</p>
               <p>For let the straight line AB (in the same 3d figure) have its Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the thinner Medium, and be refracted in the thicker Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium in B I; and let E B have as much Inclination in the thicker Medium, and be refracted in the thinner Medium in B S; and let R S the sine of the angle Refracted be drawn. I say the straight lines R S, A F and I K are in continual proportion. For it is, as the density of the thicker Medium to the density of the thinner Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, so R S to A F. But it is also, as the density of the same thicker Medium, to that of the same thinner Medium, so AF to IK. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore R S. A F : : A F. I K are propoortionals; that is, R S, A F and I K are in continual proportion, and A F is the Mean proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If the angle of Inclination be semirect, and the line of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be in the thicker Medium, and the proportion of the Densi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be as that of a Diagonal to the side of its Square, and the separating Superficies be plain, the Refracted line will be in that separating Superficies.</p>
               <p>For in the Circle A C (in the 4th figure) let the angle of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation A B C be an angle of 45 degrees. Let C B be produced to the Circumference in D; &amp; let C E (the sine of the angle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> B C) be drawn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which, let B F be taken equal in the separating line B G. B C E F will therefore be a Parallelogram, &amp; F E &amp; B C, that is, F E and B G equal. Let AG be drawn, namely, the Diagonal of the Square whose side is B G; and it will be, as A G to E F, so B G to B F; &amp; so (by supposition) the density of the Medium in which C is, to the density of the Medium in which D is; and so also the sine of the angle Refracted to the sine of the angle of Inclination.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59147:156"/>
Drawing therefore F D, &amp; from D the line D H perpendicular to A B produced, DH will be the sine of the angle of Inclination. And seeing the sine of the angle Refracted is to the sine of the angle of Inclination, as the density of the Medium in which is C, is to the density of the Medium in which is D, that is, (by supposition) as A G is to F E, that is, as D H is to B G; and seeing D H is the sine of the angle of Inclination, B G will therefore be the sine of the angle Refracted. Wherefore B G will be the Refracted line, and lye in the plain separating Superficies; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> It is therefore manifest, that when the Inclination is greater then 45 degrees, as also when it is less, provided the densi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be greater, it may happen that the Refraction will not enter the thinner Medium at all.</p>
               <p n="8">8 If a Body fall in a straight line upon another Body, and do not penetrate it, but be reflected from it, the angle of Reflexion will be equal to the angle of Incidence.</p>
               <p>Let there be a Body at A (in the 5th figure), which falling with straight motion in the line A C upon another Body at C, passeth no further, but is reflected; and let the angle of Incidence be any angle, as A C D. Let the straight line C E be drawn, making with D C produced the angle E C F equall to the angle A C D; and let A D be drawn perpendicular to the straight line D F. Also in the same straight line D F let C G be taken equall to C D; and let the perpendicular G E be raised, cutting C E in E. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the triangles A C D and E C G will be equall and like. Let C H be drawn equal and parallel to the straight line A D; and let H C be produced indefinitely to I. Lastly let E A be drawn, which will passe through H, and be parallel and equall to G D. I say the motion from A to C in the straight line of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence AC, will be reflected in the straight line C E.</p>
               <p>For the motion from A to C is made by two coefficient or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current motions, the one in A H parallel to D G, the other in A D perpendicular to the same D G; of which two motions, that in A H workes nothing upon the Body A after it has been moved as farre as C, because (by supposition) it doth not passe the straight line D G; whereas the endeavour in A D, that is in H C, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth further towards I. But seeing it doth onely presse and not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59147:156"/>
there will be reaction in H, which causeth motion from C towards H; and in the mean time the motion in H E re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the same it was in A H; and therefore the Body will now be moved by the concourse of two motions in C H and H E, which are equall to the two motions it had formerly in A H and H C. Wherefore it will be carried on in C E. The angle therefore of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection will be E C G, equall (by construction) to the angle A C D; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Now when the Body is considered but as a point, it is all one, whether the Superficies or line in which the Reflection is made, be straight or crooked; for the point of Incidence and Reflexion C, is as well in the crooked line which toucheth D G in C, as in D G it selfe.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But if we suppose that not a Body be moved, but some Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour onely be propagated from A to C, the Demonstration will neverthelesse be the same. For all Endeavour is motion; and when it hath reached the Solid Body in C, it presseth it, and endeavoureth further in C I. Wherefore the reaction will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in C H; and the endeavour in C H concurring with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in H E, will generate the endeavour in C E, in the same manner as in the repercussion of Bodies moved.</p>
               <p>If therefore Endeavour be propagated from any point to the concave Superficies of a Spherical Body, the Reflected line with the circumference of a great circle in the same Sphere, will make an angle equall to the angle of Incidence.</p>
               <p>For if Endeavour be propagated from A (in the 6 fig.) to the circumference in B, and the center of the Sphere be C, and the line C B be drawne, as also the Tangent D B E; and lastly if the angle F B D be made equall to the angle A B E, the Reflexion will be made in the line B F, as hath been newly shewn. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the angles which the straight lines A B and F B make with the circumference, will also be equall. But it is here to be noted that if C B be produced howsoever to G, the endeavour in the line G B C will proceed onely from the perpendicular reaction in G B; and that therefore there will be no other endeavour in the point B towards the parts which are within the Sphere, besides that which tends towards the center.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have (in the first Chapter) defined <hi>Philosophy</hi> to be <hi>Knowledge of Effects acquired by true Ratiocination, from knowledge first had of their Causes and Generation; and of such Causes or Generations as may be, from former knowledge of their Effects or Appearances.</hi> There are therefore two Methods of Philosophy, One from the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things to their possible Effects, and the other from their Effects or Appearances to some possible Generation of the same. In the former of these, the Truth of the first Principles of our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination (namely Definitions) is made and constituted by our selves, whilest we consent and agree about the Appellations of things. And this part I have finished in the foregoing Chapters; in which (if I am not deceived) I have affirmed nothing (saving
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59147:159"/>
the Definitions themselves) which hath not good coherence with the Definitions I have given; that is to say, which is not sufficiently demonstrated to all those that agree with me in the use of Words and Appellations; for whose sake onely I have written the same. I now enter upon the other part; which is the finding out by the Appearances or Effects of Nature which we know by Sense, some wayes and means by which they may be (I do not say, they are) generated. The Principles therefore, upon which the following discourse depends, are not such as we our selves make and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in general terms, as Definitions; but such, as being placed in the things themselves by the Authour of Nature, are by us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in them; and we make use of them in single and particular, not universal propositions. Nor do they impose upon us any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of constituting Theoremes; their use being onely (though not without such general Propositions as have been already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated) to shew us the possibility of some production or generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Seeing therefore the Science which is here taught, hath its Principles in the Appearances of Nature, and endeth in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of some knowledge of Natural causes, I have given to this Part, the title of PHYSIQUES, or the PHAENOMENA of NATURE. Now such things as <hi>appear,</hi> or are <hi>shewn</hi> to us by Nature, we call <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Appearances.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or <hi>Appearances</hi> which are neer us, the most admirable is <hi>Apparition</hi> it self, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; namely, that some Natural Bodies have in themselves the patterns almost of all things, and others of none at all. So that if the <hi>Appearances</hi> be the Principles by which we know all other things, we must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Sense</hi> to be the Principle by which we know those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; &amp; that all the knowledge we have is derived from it. And as for the causes of <hi>Sense,</hi> we cannot begin our search of them from any other <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> then that of <hi>Sense</hi> it self. But you will say, by what Sense shall we take notice of Sense? I answer, by Sense it self, namely, by the Memory which for some time remains in us of things sensible, though they themselves pass away. For he that perceiues that he hath perceived, <hi>remembers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first place therefore the causes of our Perception, that is, the causes of those Ideas and Phantasmes which are perpetually
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59147:159"/>
generated within us whilest we make use of our Senses, are to be enquired into; and in what manner their generation proceeds. To help which Inquisition, we may observe first of all, that our Phantasmes or Ideas are not alwayes the same; but that new ones appear to us, and old ones vanish, according as we apply our Organs of Sense, now to one Object, now to another. Wherefore they are generated, and perish. And from hence it is manifest, that they are some change or mutation in the Sentient.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now that all Mutation or Alteration is Motion, or Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (and Endeavour also is Motion) in the internal parts of the thing that is altered, hath been proved (in the 9th Article of the 8th Chapter) from this, that whilest even the least parts of any Body remain in the same situation in respect of one another, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said that any alteration (unless perhaps that the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together hath been moved) hath hapned to it; but that it both appeareth and is the same it appeared &amp; was before. Sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Sentient, can be nothing else but motion in some of the internal parts of the Sentient; and the parts so moved, are parts of the Organs of Sense. For the parts of our Body by which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing, are those we commonly call the <hi>Organs of Sense.</hi> And so we find what is the Subject of our Sense, namely, that in which are the Phantasmes; and partly also we have discovered the nature of Sense, namely, that it is some internal Motion in the Sentient.</p>
               <p>I have shewn besides (in the 8th Chap. at the 7th Article) that no Motion is generated but by a Body contiguous and Moved. From whence it is manifest, that the immediate cause of Sense or Perception consists in this, that the first Organ of Sense is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pressed. For when the uttermost part of the Organ is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it no sooner yeilds, but the part next within it, is pressed also; and in this manner, the pressure or Motion is propagated through all the parts of the Organ to the innermost. And thus also the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the uttermost part proceeds from the pressure of some more remote Body, and so continually, till we come to that from which, as from its fountain we derive the Phantasme or Idea that is made in us by our Sense. And this, whatsoever it be, is that we commonly call the <hi>Object.</hi> Sense therefore is some internal Motion
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59147:160"/>
in the Sentient, generated by some internal Motion of the parts of the Object, and propagated through all the <hi>Media</hi> to the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of the Organ. By which words I have almost defined what Sense is.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I have shewn (in the 2d Article of the 15 Chapter) that all Resistance is Endeavour opposite to another Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that is to say, Reaction. Seeing therefore there is in the whole Organ by reason of its own internal natural Motion; some Resistance or Reaction against the Motion which is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from the Object to the innermost part of the Organ, there is also in the same Organ an Endeavour opposite to the Endeavour which proceeds from the Object; so that when that Endeavour inwards is the last action in the act of Sense, then from the Reaction, how little soever the duration of it be, a Phantasme or Idea hath its being; which by reason the Endeavour is now out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, doth alwayes appear as something situate without the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. So that now I shall give you the whole Definition of Sense, as it is drawn from the explication of the causes thereof, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its generation, thus; SENSE <hi>is a Phantasme, made by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and endeavour outwards in the Organ of Sense, caused by an Endeavour inwards from the Object, remayning for some time more or less.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Subject</hi> of Sense, is the <hi>Sentient</hi> it self, namely, some living Creature; and we speak more correctly, when we say a <hi>Living Creature</hi> seeth, then when we say the <hi>Eye</hi> seeth. The <hi>Object,</hi> is the thing <hi>Perceived;</hi> and it is more accurately said, that we see the Sun, then that we see the Light. For Light &amp; Colour &amp; Heat &amp; Sound, and other qualities which are commonly called <hi>Sensible,</hi> are not <hi>Objects,</hi> but Phantasms in the Sentients. For a Phantasm is the act of Sense, and differs no otherwise from Sense then <hi>fieri</hi> (that is, Being a doing) differs from <hi>Factum esse,</hi> (that is, Being done;) which difference, in things that are done in an Instant, is none at all; and a Phantasme is made in an Instant. For in all Motion which proceeds by perpetual propagation, the first part being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moves the second, the second the third, and so on to the last, and that to any distance how great soever. And in what point of time the first or formost part proceeded to the place of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is thrust on; in the same point of time the last save

one proceeded into the place of the last yeilding part; which by reaction, in the same instant, if the reaction be strong enough, makes a Phantasme; and a Phantasme being made, Perception is made together with it,</p>
               <p n="4">4 The <hi>Organs</hi> of Sense, which are in the Sentient, are such parts thereof, that if they be hurt, the very generation of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes is thereby destroyed, though all the rest of the parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main intire. Now these parts in the most of Living Creatures are found to be certain Spirits and Membranes, which proceeding from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> involve the Brain and all the Nerves; also the Brain it self, and the Arteries which are in the Brain; and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, as being stirred, the Hart also, which is the fountain of all Sense is stirred together with them. For whensoever the action of the Object reacheth the Body of the Sentient, that action is by some Nerve propagated to the Brain; and if the Nerve leading thither be so hurt or obstructed, that the Motion can be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no further, no Sense follows. Also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the motion be intercepted between the Brain and the Heart by the defect of the Organ by which the action is propagated, there will be no perception of the Object.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But though all Sense, as I have said, be made by Reaction, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it is not necessary that every thing that Reacteth should have Sense. I know there have been Philosophers, &amp; those learned men, who have maintained that all Bodies are endued with Sense. Nor do I see how they can be refuted, if the nature of Sense be placed in Reaction onely. And, though by the Reaction of Bodies inanimate a Phantasme might be made, it would nevertheless cease, as soon as ever the Object were removed. For unless those Bodies had Organs, (as living Creatures have) fit for the retaining of such Motion as is made in them, their Sense would be such, as that they should never reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the same. And therefore this hath nothing to do with that Sense which is the subject of my discourse. For by Sense we commonly understand the judgement we make of Objects by their Phantasmes; namely, by comparing and distinguishing those Phantasmes; which we could never do, if that motion in the Organ, by which the Phantasme is made, did not remain there for some time, and make the same Phantasme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59147:161"/>
Wherefore Sense, as I here understand it, and which is commonly so called, hath necessarily some memory adhering to it, by which former and later Phantasmes may be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and distinguished from one another.</p>
               <p>Sense therefore properly so called, must necessarily have in it a perpetual variety of Phantasmes, that they may be discerned one from another. For if we should suppose a man to be made with cleer Eyes, and all the rest of his Organs of Sight well disposed, but endued with no other Sense; and that he should look onely upon one thing, which is alwayes of the same colour and figure without the least appearance of variety, he would seem to me, whatsoever others may say, to see, no more then I seem to my self to feel the Bones of my own Limbs by my Organs of Feeling; and yet those Bones are alwayes, and on all sides touched by a most sensible Membrane. I might perhaps say he were astonished, and looked upon it; but I should not say he saw it; it being almost all one for a man to be alwayes sensible of one and the same thing, and not to be sensible at all of any thing.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And yet such is the nature of Sense, that it does not permit a man to discern many things at once. For seeing the nature of Sense consists in Motion; as long as the Organs are employed about one Object, they cannot be so Moved by another at the same time, as to make by both their Motions one sincere Phantasme of each of them at once. And therefore two several Phantasmes will not be made by two Objects working together, but onely one Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme compounded from the action of both.</p>
               <p>Besides, as when we divide a Body, we divide its place; and when we reckon many Bodies, we must necessarily reckon as many places; and contrarily, as I have shewn in the first Article of the 7th Chapter; so what number soever we say there be of Times, we must understand the same number of Motions also; and as oft as we count many Motions, so oft we reckon many times. For though the object we looke upon be of diverse colours, yet with those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse colours it is but one varied Object, and not variety of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whilest those Organs which are common to all the Senses (such as are those parts of every Organ which proceed (in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59147:161"/>
Men) from the root of the Nerves, to the Hart) are vehemently stirred by a strong action from some one Object, they are (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the contumacy which the motion they have already gives them against the reception of all other motion) made the lesse fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other impression from whatsoever other Objects, to what sense soever those Objects belong. And hence it is, that an earnest studying of one Object, takes away the Sense of all other Objects for the present. For <hi>Study</hi> is nothing else but a possession of the mind, that is to say, a vehement motion made by some one Object in the Organs of Sense, which are stupid to all other moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as long as this lasteth; according to what was said by <hi>Terence, Populus studio stupidus in funambulo animum occuparat.</hi> For what is <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por</hi> but that which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Sense of other things? Wherefore at one and the same time, we cannot by Sense perceive more then one single Object; as in reading, we see the letters successively one by one, and not all together, though the whole Page be presented to our eye; and though every severall letter be distinctly written there, yet when we looke upon the whole page at once, we read nothing.</p>
               <p>From hence it is manifest, that every endeavour of the Organ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utwards, is not to be called Sense, but that onely which at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times is by Vehemence made stronger and more praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant than the rest; which deprives us of the Sense of other Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes, no otherwise then the Sun deprives the rest of the starres of light, not by hindering their action, but by obscuring and hiding them with his excesse of brightnesse.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But the motion of the Organ, by which a Phantasme is made, is not commonly called Sense, except the Object be present. And the Phantasme remaining after the Object is removed or past by, is called <hi>Fancy,</hi> and in latine <hi>Imaginatio;</hi> which word (because all Phantasmes are not Images) doth not fully answer the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word <hi>Fancy</hi> in its generall acceptation. Neverthelesse I may use it safely enough, by understanding it for the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>IMAGINATION therefore is nothing else but <hi>Sense decaying,</hi> or <hi>weakned,</hi> by the absence of the Object. But what may be the cause of this decay or weakning? Is the Motion the weaker because the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59147:162"/>
Object is taken away? If it were, then Phantasmes would alwayes and necessarily be less cleare in the Imagination, then they are in Sense; which is not true. For in Dreams (which are the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those that sleep) they are no less clear then in Sense it self. But the reason why in men Waking the Phantasms of things past are more obscure then those of things present, is this, that their Organs being at the same time moved by other present Objects, those Phantasmes are the lesse praedominant. Whereas in Sleep, the passages being shut up, externall action doth not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe or hinder internall motion.</p>
               <p>If this be true, the next thing to be considered, will be, whether any cause may be found out, from the supposition whereof it will follow, that the passage is shut up from the externall Objects of Sense to the internall Organ. I suppose therefore, that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall action of Objects, (to which a Reaction of the Organ, and more esqecially of the Spirits, is necessarily consequent) the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan is wearied, that is, its parts are no longer moved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits without some pain; and consequently the Nerves being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and grown slack, they retire to their fountain which is the cavity either of the Brain or of the Heart; by which means the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which proceeded by the Nerves is necessarily intercepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Action, upon a Patient that retires from it, makes but little Impression at the first; and at last, when the Nerves are by little and little slack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, none at all. And therefore there is no more Reaction, that is, no more Sense, till the Organ being refreshed by Rest, and by a supply of new Spirits recovering strength and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sentient awaketh. And thus it seems to be alwayes, unless some other praeternatural cause intervene; as Heat in the internal parts from lassitude, or from some disease stirring the Spirits and other parts of the Organ in some extraordinary manner.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Now it is not without cause, nor so casual a thing as many perhaps think it, that Phantasmes in this their great variety, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one another; and that the same Phantasmes sometimes bring into the mind other Phantasmes like themselves, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times extreamly unlike. For in the motion of any continued Body, one part followes another by cohaesion; and therefore, whilst we turne our Eies and other Organs successively to many
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59147:162"/>
Objects, the motion which was made by every one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, the Phantasmes are renewed as often as any of those motions comes to be praedominant above the rest; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come praedominant in the same order, in which at any time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they were generated by Sense. So that when by length of time very many Phantasmes have been generated within us by Sense, then allmost any thought may arise from any other thought; in so much that it may seeme to be a thing indifferent and casuall, which thought shall follow which. But for the most part this is not so uncertain a thing to waking as to sleeping men. For the thought or Phantasme of the desired End, brings in all the Phantasmes that are meanes conducing to that end, and that in order backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the last to the first, and againe forwards from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the End: But this supposes both Appetite, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discerne what meanes conduce to the end; which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Experience; and Experience is store of Phantasmes, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the sense of very many things. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse, Fancy</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> differ onely in this, that Memory supposeth the time past, which Fancy doth not. In Memory, the Phantasmes we consider are as if they were worne out with time; but in our Fancy we consider them as they are; which distinction is not of the things themselves, but of the considerations of the Sentient. For there is in Memory, something like that which happens in looking upon things at a great distance; in which, as the small parts of the Object are not discerned by reason of their remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; so in Memory, many accidents and places and parts of things, which were formerly perceived by Sense, are by length of time decayed and lost.</p>
               <p>The perpetuall arising of Phantasmes, both in Sense and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, is that which we commonly call <hi>Discourse of the Mind,</hi> and is common to men with other living Creatures. For he thta thinketh, compareth the Phantasmes that passe, that is, taketh notice of their likenesse or unlikenesse to one another. And as he that observes readily the likenesses of things of different natures, or that are very remote from one another, is said to have a good Fancy; so he is said to have a good Judgement, that finds out the unlikenesses or differences of things that are like one another.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59147:163"/>
Now this observation of differences, is not perception made by a common Organ of Sense, distinct from Sense or Perception pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called; but is Memory of the differences of particular Phantasmes remaining for some time; as the distinction between Hot and Lucid, is nothing else but the Memory both of a Heating, and of an Enlightning Object.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The Phantasmes of men that sleep, are DREAMS. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we are taught by experience these five things. First, that for the most part there is neither order nor coherence in them. Secondly, that we dream of nothing but what is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made up of the Phantasmes of Sense past. Thirdly, that somtimes they proceed (as in those that are drowsy) from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Phantasmes by little and little broken and altered through sleepiness; and sometimes also they begin in the midst of sleep. Fourthly, that they are clearer then the Imaginations of waking men, except such as are made by Sense itself, to which they are equal in clearness. Fifthly, that when we dream, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire neither the places nor the looks of the things that appear to us. Now from what hath been said, it is not hard to shew what may be the causes of these <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> For as for the first, seeing all Order and Coherence proceeds from frequent looking back to the End, that is, from Consultation; it must needs be, that seeing in sleep we lose all thought of the End, our Phantasmes succeed one another, not in that order which tends to any End, but as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and in such manner, as Objects present themselves to our Eyes when we look indifferently upon all things before us, and see them, not because we would see them, but because we do not shut our Eyes; for then they appear to us without any order at all. The second proceeds from this, that in the silence of Sense, there is no new motion from the Objects, and therefore no new Phantasme, unless we call that new, which is compounded of old ones, as a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a golden Mountain, and the like. As for the third, why a Dream is sometimes as it were the continuation of Sense, made up of broken Phantasmes, as in men distempered with sickness, the reason is manifestly this, that in some of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans Sense remains, and in others it faileth. But how some Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes may be revived, when all the exteriour Organs are benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with sleep, is not so easily shewn. Nevertheless, that which
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59147:163"/>
hath already been said, contains the reason of this also. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever strikes the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> reviveth some of those Phantasmes that are still in motion in the Brain; and when any internal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart reacheth that Membrane, then the praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant motion in the Brain makes the Phantasme. Now the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heart are Appetites and Aversions, of which I shall presently speak further. And as Appetites and Aversions are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by Phantasmes, so reciprocally Phantasmes are generated by Appetites and Aversions. For example, Heat in the Heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Anger and Fighting; and again from Heat in the Heart, (whatsoever be the cause of it) is generated Anger, and the Image of an Enemy in Sleep. And as Love and Beauty stirre up heat in certain Organs; so Heat in the same Organs, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it proceeds, often causeth Desire, and the Image of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resisting Beauty. Lastly, Cold doth in the same manner generate Feare in those that sleep, and causeth them to dream of Ghosts, and to have Phantasmes of horrour and danger; as Fear also causeth Cold in those that wake; so reciprocal are the motions of the Heart and Brain. The fourth, namely, that the things we seem to see and feel in sleep, are as clear as in sense it self, proceeds from two causes; one, that having then no sense of things without us, that internal motion which makes the Phantasme, in the absence of all other impressions, is praedominant; and the other, that the parts of our Phantasms which are decayed and worn out by time, are made up with other fictitious parts. To conclude, when we dream, we do not wonder at strange places, and the appearances of things unknown to us, because Admiration requires that the things appearing be new and unusual, which can happen to none but those that remember former appearances; whereas in sleep, all things appear as present.</p>
               <p>But it is here to be observed, that certain Dreams, especially such as some men have when they are between sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and such as happen to those that have no knowledge of the nature of Dreams, and are with all superstitious, were not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor are now accounted Dreams. For the Apparitions men thought they saw, and the Voices they thought they heard in sleep, were not believed to be Phantasmes, but things subsisting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59147:164"/>
and Objects without those that dreamed. For to some men, as well sleeping as waking, but especially to guilty men, and in the night, and in hallowed places, Feare alone, helped a little with the stories of such Apparitions, hath raised in their minds terrible Phantasmes, which have been, and are still deceiptfully received for things really true, under the names of <hi>Ghosts</hi> and <hi>Incorporeal Substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 In most living Creatures there are observed five kinds of Senses, which are distinguished by their Organs, and by their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of Phantasmes; namely, <hi>Sight, Hearing, Smell, Tast</hi> and <hi>Touch;</hi> and these have their Organs partly peculiar to each of them severally, and partly common to them all. The Organ of Sight is partly <hi>animate,</hi> and partly <hi>inanimate.</hi> The inanimate parts, are the three <hi>Humours;</hi> namely, the <hi>Watry Humour,</hi> which by the interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Membrane called <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ea,</hi> (the perforation whereof is called the <hi>Apple</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi>) is contained on one side by the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave superficies of the Eye, and on the other side by the <hi>Ciliary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses</hi> and the Coat of the <hi>Cristalline humour;</hi> the <hi>Cristalline,</hi> which (hanging in the midst between the Ciliary processes, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of Spherical figure, and of a thick consistence) is inclosed on all sides with its own transparent Coat; and the <hi>Vitreous</hi> or <hi>Glassie Humour,</hi> which filleth all the rest of the Cavity of the Eye, and is somewhat thicker then the Watry Humour, but thinner then the Cristalline. The <hi>animate</hi> part of the Organ is, first, the Membrane <hi>Choroeides,</hi> which is a part of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> saving that it is covered with a Coat derived from the marrow of the Optique Nerve, which is called the <hi>Retina;</hi> and this <hi>Choroeides,</hi> seeing it is part of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> is continued to the beginning of the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> within the Scull, in which all the Nerves which are within the Head have their roots. Wherefore all the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> that the Nerves receive, enter into them there, for it is not imaginable that they can enter into them any where else. Seeing therefore Sense is nothing else but the action of Objects propagated to the furthest part of the Organ; and seeing also that <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are nothing but <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> purified by the Hart and carried from it by the Arteries; it follows necessarily, that the action is derived from the Heart by some of the Arteries to the roots of the Nerves
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59147:164"/>
which are in the Head, whether those Arteries be the <hi>Plexus Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis,</hi> or whether they be other Arteries which are inserted into the substance of the Brain. And therefore those Arteries are the Complement, or the remaying part of the whole Organ of Sight. And this last part is a common Organ to all the Senses; wheras that which reacheth from the Eie to the roots of the Nerves is proper onely to Sight. The proper Organ of Hearing is the <hi>Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of the Eare, and its own Nerve; from which to the Heart the Organ is Common. So the proper Organs of Smel &amp; Tast are Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Membranes, in the Palate and Tongue for the Taste, and in the Nostrils for the Smell; and from the roots of those Nerves to the Heart all is common. Lastly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he proper Organ of Touch are Nerves and Membranes dispersed through the whole Body; which Membranes are derived from the root of the Nerves. And all things else belonging alike to all the Senses seem to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by the Arteries, and not by the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The proper Phantasme of Sight is <hi>Light;</hi> and under this name of Light, <hi>Colour</hi> also (which is nothing but perturbed Light) is comprehended. Wherefore the Phantasme of a Lucid Body, is Light; and of a coloured Body, Colour. But the Object of Sight, properly so called is neither Light nor Colour, but the Body itself which is lucid, or enlightned, or coloured. For Light and Colour being Phantasmes of the Sentient, cannot be Accidents of the Object. Which is manifest enough from this, that Visible things appear oftentimes in places, in which we know assuredly they are not, and that in different places they are of different colours, and may at one and the same time appear in divers places. Motion, Rest, Magnitude and Figure are common both to the Sight and Touch; and the whole appearance together of <hi>Figure, and Light or Colour,</hi> is by the Greeks commonly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and by the Latines, <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Imago;</hi> all which names signifie no more but <hi>Appearance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The phantasme which is made by Hearing, is <hi>Sound;</hi> by Smell, <hi>Odour;</hi> by Tast, <hi>Savour;</hi> and by Touch, <hi>Hardness</hi> and <hi>Softness, Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold, Wetness, Oiliness,</hi> and many more, which are easier to be distinguished by sense then words. <hi>Smoothness, Roughness, Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Density</hi> refer to Figure, and are therefore common both to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59147:165"/>
Touch and Sight. And as for the Objects of Hearing, Smel, Tast, and Touch, they are not Sound, Odour, Savour, Hardness, &amp;c. but the Bodies themselves from which Sound, Odour, Savour, Hardness, &amp;c. proceed; Of the causes of which, and of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they are produced, I shall speak hereafter.</p>
               <p>But these Phantasmes, though they be effects in the Sentient, (as Subject) produced by Objects working upon the Organs; yet there are also other effects besides these, produced by the same Objects, in the same Organs; namely, certain Motions proceeding from Sense, which are called <hi>Animal Motions.</hi> For seeing in all Sense of external things, there is mutual Action and Reaction, that is, two Endeavours opposing one another, it is manifest, that the motion of both of them together will be continued every way, especially to the confines of both the Bodies. And when this happens in the internal Organ, the Endeavour outwards will proceed in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Angle, which will be greater, and consequently the Idea greater, then it would have been if the impression had been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
               <p n="11">11 From hence the Natural cause is manifest, First, why those things seem to be greater, which (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) are seen in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Angle. Secondly, why in a serene cold night when the Moon doth not shine, more of the fixed Stars appear, then at another time. For their action is less hindred by the serenity of the Aire, and not obscured by the greater Light of the Moon, which is then absent; and the Cold making the Air more pressing, helpeth or strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the action of the Stars upon our Eies, in so much as Stars may then be seen which are seen at no other time. And this may suffice to be said in general concerning Sense made by the Reaction of the Organ. For, as for the place of the Image, the deceptions of Sight, and other things of which we have experience in our selves by Sense, being they depend for the most part upon the Fabrick it self of the Eie of Man, I shall speak of them then when I come to speak of Man.</p>
               <p n="12">12 But, there is another kind of Sense, of which I will say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this place, namely, the Sense of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not from the Reaction of the Heart outwards, but from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual action from the outermost part of the Organ towards the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59147:165"/>
Heart. For the original of Life being in the Heart, that motion in the Sentient which is propagated to the Heart, must necessarily make some alteration or diversion of Vital Motion, namely, by quickning or slackening, helping or hindering the same. Now when it helpeth, it is Pleasure, and when it hindereth, it is Pain, Trouble, Grief, &amp;c. And as Phantasmes seem to be without, by reason of the Endeavour outwards; so Pleasure and Pain by reason of the Endeavour of the Organ inwards seem to be within, namely, there where the first Cause of the Pleasure or Pain is; as when the Pain proceeds from a Wound, we think the Pain and the Wound are both in the same place.</p>
               <p>Now Vital Motion, is the Motion of the Bloud, perpetually cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating (as hath been shewn from many infallible signes and marks by Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> the first Observer of it) in the Veins and Arteries. Which Motion, when it is hindered by some other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the action of sensible Objects, may be restored again either by bending or setting straight the parts of the Body; which is done when the Spirits are carried now into these, now into other Nerves, till the Pain (as farre as is possible) be quite taken away. But if Vital Motion be helped by Motion made by Sense, then the parts of the Organ will be disposed to guide the Spirits in such manner, as conduceth most to the preservation and augmentation of that motion by the help of the Nerves. And in animal motion this is the very first Endeavour, and found even in the <hi>Embrio;</hi> which while it is in the wombe, moveth its limbes with voluntary motion, for the avoiding of whatsoever troubleth it, or for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of what pleaseth it. And this first Endeavour, when it tends towards such things as are known by experience to be pleasant, is called APPETITE, (that is, an Approaching;) and when it shuns what is troublesome, AVERSION, or Flying from it. And little Infants, at the beginning, and as soon as they are born, have appetite to very few things, as also they avoid very few, by reason of their want of Experience and Memory; &amp; therefore they have not so great a variety of animal Motion as we see in those that are more grown. For it is not possible, without such knowledge as is derived from Sense, that is, without Experience and Memory, to know what will prove pleasant, or hurtful; onely there is some
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59147:166"/>
place for conjecture from the looks or aspects of things. And hence it is, that though they do not know what may do them good or harm, yet sometimes they approach, and sometimes retire from the same thing as their doubt prompts them. But afterwards by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customing themselves by little and little, they come to know rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily what is to be pursued, and what to be avoided; and also to have a ready use of their Nerves and other Organs in the pursuing and avoiding of good and bad. Wherefore <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Aversion</hi> are the first Endeavours of <hi>Animal Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consequent to this first Endeavour, is the Impulsion into the Nerves, and Retraction again of Animal Spirits, of which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary there be some Receptacle on place neer the original of the Nerves; and this Motion or Endeavour is followed by a swelling and Relaxation of the Muscles; and lastly, these are followed by Contraction and Extension of the limbes, which is Animal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="13">13 The Considerations of Appetites and Aversions are divers. For seeing Living Creatures have sometimes Appetite, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Aversion to the same thing, as they think it will either be for their good or their hurt, while that vicissitude of Appetites and Aversions remains in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have that series of Thoughts which is called DELIBERATION; which lasteth as long as they have it in their power to obtain that which pleaseth, or to avoid that which displeaseth them. <hi>Appetite</hi> therefore and <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> are simply so called as long as they follow not Deliberation. But if Deliberation have gone before, then the last act of it, if it be Appetite, is called WILL; if Aversion, UNWILLINGNESSE; so that the same thing is called both <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Appetite;</hi> but the consideration of them (namely, before and after Deliberation) is divers. Nor is that which is done within a Man whilest he Willeth any thing, different from that which is done in other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilest (Deliberation having preceded) they have Appetite.</p>
               <p>Neither is the freedome of Willing, or not willing, greater in Man, then in other living Creatures. For where there is Appetite, the entire cause of Appetite hath preceded; and consequently the act of Appetite could not choose but follow, that is, hath of necessity followed, (as is shewn Chapt. 9th Article 5.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59147:166"/>
such a <hi>Liberty</hi> as is free from <hi>Necessity,</hi> is not to be found in the <hi>Will</hi> either of Men or Beasts. But if by <hi>Liberty</hi> we understand the faculty or power, not of <hi>Willing,</hi> but of <hi>Doing</hi> what they Will, then certainly that Liberty is to be allowed to both; and both may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually have it, whensover it is to be had.</p>
               <p>Again, when Appetite and Aversion do with celerity succeed one another, the whole series made by them, hath its name some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from one, sometimes from the other. For the same Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (whilest it inclines sometimes to one, sometimes to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) is from Appetite called HOPE, and from Aversion FEAR. For where there is no Hope, it is not to be called Fear, but HATE; and where no Fear, not Hope, but DESIRE. To conclude, all the Passions, called <hi>Passions of the Minde,</hi> consist of Appetite and Aversion (except pure Pleasure and Pain, which are a certain <hi>Fruition</hi> of good or Evil;) as <hi>Anger,</hi> is Aversion from some immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent evil, but such as is joyned with Appetite of avoiding that evil by force. But because the Passions and Perturbations of the Minde are innumerable; and many of them not to be discerned in any Creatures besides Men; I will speak of them more at large in that Section which is concerning <hi>Man.</hi> As for those Objects (if there be any such) which do not at all stir the Mind, we are said to <hi>Contemn</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And thus much of Sense in general. In the next place I shall speak of Sensible Objects.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsequent to the Contemplation of <hi>Sense</hi> is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are the efficient causes or Objects of Sense. Now every <hi>Object</hi> is either a part of the whole World, or an Aggregate of parts. The greatest of all Bodies, or sensible Objects, is the <hi>World</hi> it self, which we behold when we look round about us from this point of the same which we call the Earth. Concerning the World, as it is one Aggregate of many parts, the things that fall under inquiry are but few; and those we can determine, none. Of the whole World we may inquire what is its <hi>Magnitude,</hi> what its <hi>Duration,</hi> and how many there be; but nothing else. For as for <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> that is to say, Magnitude and Duration, they are only our own fancies of a Body simply so called, that is to say of a Body indefinitely taken, as I have shewne before in the 7 chapter. All other Phantasmes, are of Bodies or Objects as they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from one another; as Colour, the Phantasme of coloured Bodies; Sound, of Bodies that move the Sense of Hearing, &amp;c. The questions concerning the Magnitude of the World, are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Finite</hi> or <hi>Infinite, Full</hi> or <hi>not Full;</hi> Concerning its Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it had a <hi>Beginning,</hi> or be <hi>Eternall;</hi> and concerning the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59147:167"/>
number, whether there be <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Many</hi> (though as concerning the Number, if it were of infinite Magnitude, there could be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy at all.) Also if it had a beginning, then by what <hi>Cause</hi> and of what <hi>Matter</hi> it was made; and againe, from whence that Cause and that Matter had their being, will be new questions; till at last we come to one or many eternall Cause or Causes. And the determination of all these things belongeth to him that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the universal doctrine of Philosophy, in case as much could be known as can be sought. But the knowledge of what is Infinite can never be attained by a finite Inquirer. Whatsoever we know that are Men, we learn it from our Phantasmes; and of <hi>Infinite</hi> (whether Magnitude or Time) there is no Phantasme at all; so that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible either for a man, or any other creature to have any concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Infinite.</hi> And though a man may from some Effect proceed to the immediate Cause thereof, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that to a more remote Cause, and so ascend continually by right ratiocination from Cause to Cause; yet he will not be able to proceed eternally; but wearied, will at last give over, without knowing whether it were possible for him to proceed to an end, or not. But whether we suppose the World to be Finite, or Infinite, no absurdity will follow. For the same things which now appear, might appear, whether the Creator had pleased it should be Finite or Infinite. Besides, though from this, that nothing can move it self, it may rightly be inferred that there was some first eternal Movent; yet it can never be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (though some use to make such inference) that that Movent was eternally Immoveable, but rather eternally Moved. For as it is true, that nothing is moved by it self; so it is true also that nothing is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but by that which is already moved. The questions therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Magnitude</hi> and <hi>Beginning</hi> of the World, are not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Philosophers, but by those that are lawfully authorised to order the Worship of God. For as Almighty God, when he had brought his People into <hi>Judaea,</hi> allowed the Priests the first fruits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to himself; so when he had delivered up the World to the disputations of Men, it was his pleasure, that all Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> known onely to himself, should (as the first-fruits of Wisdom) be judged by those whose Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he meant to use in the ordering of Religion. I cannot therefore
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59147:168"/>
commend those that boast they have demonstrated by reasons drawn from natural things, that the World had a Beginning. They are contemned by Idiots, because they understand them not; and by the Learned, because they understand them; by both deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For who can commend him that demonstrates thus? If the World be Eternal, then an infinite number of dayes (or other measures of Time) preceded the birth of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> preceded the birth of <hi>Isaac;</hi> and therefore one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is greater then another Infinite, or one Eternal then another Eternal; which (he sayes) is absurd. This Demonstration is like his, who from this, that the number of even Numbers is infinite, would conclude, that there are as many even Numbers, as there are Numbers simply, that is to say, the even Numbers are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as all the even and od together. They which in this manner take away Eternity from the World, do they not by the same means take away Eternity from the Creator of the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld? From this absurdity therefore they run into another, being forced to call E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity <hi>Nunc stans,</hi> a standing still of the present Time, or <hi>an abiding Now;</hi> and (which is much more absurd) to give to the infinite number of Numbers, the name of <hi>Unity.</hi> But why should Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be called an <hi>Abiding Now,</hi> rather then an <hi>Abiding Then?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must either be many Eternities, or <hi>Now</hi> and <hi>Then</hi> must signifie the same. With such Demonstrators as these, that speak in another language, it is impossible to enter into disputation. And the men that reason thus absurdly, are not Idiots, but (which makes the absurdity unpardonable) Geometricians, and such as take upon them to be Judges (impertinent, but severe Judges) of other mens Demonstrations. The reason is this, that as soon as they are entangled in the Words <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> (of which we have in our mind no Idea, but that of our own insufficiency to comprehend them) they are forced either to speak something ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, or (which they love worse) to hold their peace. For Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath in it somewhat like Wine; which when new, is windy; but afterwards though less pleasant, yet more wholsome. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore is true, young Geometricians think Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but elder not. Wherefore I purposely pass over the Questions of Infinite and Eternal; contenting my self with that Doctrine
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59147:168"/>
concerning the Beginning and Magnitude of the World, which I have been perswaded to by the holy Scriptures, and fame of the Miracles which confirm them; and by the Custome of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and reverence due to the Laws. And so I pass on to such things as it is not unlawful to dispute of.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Concerning the World it is further questioned, whether the parts thereof be contiguous to one another, in such manner, as not to admit of the least empty space between; and the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation both for &amp; against it, is carried on with probability enough. For the taking away of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> I will instance in onely one experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a common one, but (I think) unanswerable.</p>
               <p>Let AB (in the first fig.) represent a vessel (such as Gardiners use to water their Gardens withal;) whose bottom B is ful of litle holes; &amp; whose mouth A may be stopt with ones finger when there shall be need. If now this vessel be filled with water, the hole at the top A being stopt, the water will not flow out at any of the holes in the bottom B. But if the finger be removed to let in the air above, it will run out at them all; and as soon as the finger is applyed to it again, the water wil suddenly &amp; totally be stayed again from running out. The cause whereof seems to be no other but this, that the Water cannot by its natural endeavour to descend, drive down the aire below it, because there is no place for it to go into, unless either by thrusting away the next contiguous aire it proceed by continual endeavour to the hole A, where it may enter and succeed into the place of the water that floweth out; or else by resisting the endeavour of the water Downwards, penetrate the same, and pass up through it. By the first of these wayes (while the hole at A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains stopped) there is no possible passage; nor by the second, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the holes be so great, that the water flowing out at them, can by its own waight force the Air at the same time to ascend into the vessel by the same holes; as we see it does in a vessel whose mouth is wide enough, when we turn suddenly the bottom upwards to poure out the water; for then the Aire being forced by the waight of the water, enters (as is evident by the sobbing and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the water) at the sides or circumference of the orifice. And this I take for a sign that all Space is full; for without this the naturall motion of the water (which is a heavy Body) down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, would not be hindered.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59147:169"/>3 On the contrary, for the establishing of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> many &amp; specious arguments and experiments have been brought. Neverthelesse there seemes to be something wanting in all of them to conclude it firmely. These arguments for <hi>Vacuum</hi> are partly made by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the doctrine of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> who taught that the World consists of very small Spaces not filled by any Bodie, and of very small Bodies that have within them no empty Space, (which by reason of their hardnesse he calls <hi>Atomes</hi>); and that these small Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Spaces are every where intermingled. Their arguments are thus delivered by <hi>Lucretius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first he sayes that unlesse it were so, there could be no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For the office and property of Bodies is to withstand and hinder motion. If therfore the Universe were filled with Body, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would every where be hindered, so, as to have no beginning any where; &amp; consequently there would be no motion at all. It is true that in whatsoever is full, and at rest in all its parts, it is not possible motion should have beginning. But nothing is drawn from hence for the proving of <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For though it should be granted that there is <hi>Vacuum;</hi> yet if the Bodies which are intermingled with it, should all at once and together be at rest, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved again. For it has been demonstrated above (in the 9th Chapter 7th Article) that nothing can be moved but by that which is contiguous and already moved. But supposing that all things are at rest together, there can be nothing contiguous and moved; and therefore no beginning of motion. Now the denying of the beginning of motion, doth not take away present motion, unless beginning be taken away from Body also. For motion may be either coeternal, or concreated with Body. Nor doth it seem more necessary that Bodies were first at rest, and afterwards mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then that they were first moved, and rested (if ever they rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all) afterwards. Neither doth there appear any cause, why the matter of the World should for the admission of motion, be intermingled with empty spaces, rather then full; I say full, but withall fluid. Nor lastly, is there any reason why those hard A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes may not also by the motion of intermingled fluid matter be congregated &amp; brought together into compounded Bodies of such bigness as we see. Wherefore nothing can by this argument be
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59147:169"/>
concluded, but that motion was either coeternal, or of the same duration with that which is moved; neither of which conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons consisteth with the doctrine of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who allows neither to the World nor to Motion any Beginning at all. The necessity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Vacuum</hi> is not hitherto demonstrated. And the cause (as far as I understand from them that have discoursed with me of <hi>Vacuum</hi>) is this, that whilest they contemplate the nature of <hi>Fluid,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to consist as it were of small grains of hard matter, in such manner as meal is fluid, made so by grinding of the Corn; when nevertheless it is possible to conceive <hi>Fluid</hi> to be of its own nature as homogeneous, as either an Atome, or as <hi>Vacuum,</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>The second of their arguments is taken from waight, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in these Verses of <hi>Lucretius,</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Corporis officium est quoniam premere omnia deorsum;</l>
                  <l>Contrà autem natura manet sine Pondere Inanis;</l>
                  <l>Ergo quod magnum est aeque, Leviusque videtur,</l>
                  <l>Nimirum plus esse sibi declarat Inanis.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>That is to say, <hi>Seeing the office and property of Body is to press all things downwards; and on the contrary, seeing the nature of</hi> Vacuum <hi>is to have no waight at all; Therefore when of two Bodies of equal magnitude, one is lighter then the other, it is manifest that the lighter Body hath in it more</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum <hi>then the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say nothing of the Assumption concerning the endeavour of Bodies downwards, which is not rightly assumed, because the World hath nothing to do with <hi>Downwards,</hi> which is a mere fiction of ours; Nor of this, that if al things tended to the same lowest part of the World, either there would be no coalescence at all of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or they would all be gathered together into the same place. This onely is sufficient to take away the force of the argument, that Aire intermingled with those his Atomes, had served as well for his purpose, as his intermingled <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third argument is drawn from this, That Lightning, Sound, Heat and Cold do penetrate all Bodies (except Atomes) how solid soever they be. But this reason, except it be first demonstrated that the same things cannot happen (without <hi>Vacuum</hi>) by perpetual
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59147:170"/>
generation of Motion, is altogether invalid. But that all the same things may so happen, shall in due place be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the fourth argument is set down by the same <hi>Lucretius</hi> in these Verses.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Duo de concursu corpora lata</l>
                  <l>Si citò dissiliant, nempe aer omne necesse est</l>
                  <l>Inter corpora quod fuerat, possidat Inane.</l>
                  <l>Is porro quamvis circum celerantibus auris</l>
                  <l>Confluat, haud poterit tamen uno tempore totum</l>
                  <l>Compleri spatium; nam primum quemque necesse est</l>
                  <l>Occupet ille locum, deinde omnia possideantur.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>That is, <hi>If two flat Bodies be suddenly pulled asunder, of necessity the Air must come between them to fill all the space they left empty. But with what celerity soever the Air flow in, yet it cannot in one instant of time fill the whole space, but first one part of it, then successively all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which nevertheless is more repugnant to the opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> then of those that deny <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For though it be true, that if two Bodies were of infinite hardness, and were joyned together by their Superficies which were most exactly plain, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to pull them asunder, in regard it could not be done but by Motion in an instant; yet, if as the greatest of all Magnitudes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given, nor the swiftest of all Motions, so neither the hardest of all hard Bodies; it might be, that by the application of very great force, there might be place made for a successive flowing in of the Aire, namely by separating the parts of the joyned Bodies by succession, beginning at the outermost and ending at the innermost part. He ought therefore first to have proved, that there are some Bodies extreamly hard, not relatively, as compared with softer Bodies, but absolutely, that is to say, infinitely hard; which is not true. But if we suppose (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> doth) that Atomes are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and yet have small superficies of their own; then if two Bodies should be joyned together by many, or but one onely small superficies of either of them, then I say this argument of <hi>Lucretius</hi> would be a firme demonstration, that no two Bodies made up of Atomes (as he supposes) could ever possibly be pulled asunder by
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59147:170"/>
any force whatsoever. But this is repugnant to daily experience.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the arguments of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> Let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the arguments which are drawn from the experiments of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Writers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The first experiment is this, That if a hollow vessel be thrust into water with the bottom upwards, the water will ascend into it; which they say it could not do, unless the Aire within were thrust together into a narrower place; and that this were also impossible except there were little empty places in the Aire. Also that when the Aire is compressed to a certain degree, it can receive no further compression, its small particles not suffering themselves to be pent into less room. This reason, if the Aire could not pass through the Water as it ascends within the vessel, might seem va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. But it is sufficiently known, that Aire will penetrate Water by the application of a force equal to the gravity of the Water. If therefore the force by which the Vessel is thrust down, be greater, or equal to the endeavour by which the water naturally tendeth downwards, the Aire will go out that way where the resistance is made, namely, towards the edges of the Vessel. For, by how much the deeper is the water which is to be penetrated, so much greater must be the depressing force. But after the Vessel is quite under water, the force by which it is depressed, that is to say, the force by which the water riseth up, is no longer encreased. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an equilibration between them, as that the natural endeavour of the water downwards, is equal to the endeavour by which the same water is to be penetrated to the encreased depth.</p>
               <p>The second experiment is, That if a concave Cylinder of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length (made of Glass, that the experiment may be the better seen) having one end open, and the other close shut, be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Quicksilver, and the open end being stopped with ones finger, be together with the finger dipped into a dish or other ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in which also there is Quicksilver, and the Cylinder be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we shall, the finger being taken away (to make way for the descent of the Quicksilver) see it descend into the Vessel under it, till there be onely so much remayning within the Cylinder as may fill about 26 Inches of the same; and thus it will alwayes happen whatsoever be the Cylinder, provided that the length be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59147:171"/>
not less then 26 Inches. From whence they conclude that the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Cylinder above the Quicksilver remayns empty of all Body. But in this experiment I finde no necessity at all of <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For when the Quicksilver which is in the Cylinder descends, the Vessel under it must needs be filled to a greater height, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently so much of the contiguous Air must be thrust away as may make place for the Quicksilver which is descended. Now if it be asked whether that Aire goes, what can be answered but this, that it thrusteth away the next Aire, &amp; that the next, &amp; so successively, till there be a return to the place where the propulsion first began? and there, the last Aire thus thrust on will press the Quicksilver in the Vessel with the same force with which the first Aire was thrust away; and if the force with which the Quicksilver descends be great enough (which is greater or less, as it descends from a place of greater or less height) it will make the Aire penetrate the Quicksilver in the vessel, and go up into the Cylinder to fill the place which they thought was left empty. But because the Quicksilver hath not in every degree of height force enough to cause such penetration, therefore in descending it must of necessity stay somewhere, namely there, where its endeavour downwards, and the resistance of the same to the penetration of the Aire come to an <hi>aequilibrium.</hi> And by this experiment it is manifest, that this <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium</hi> will be at the height of 26 Inches, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>The third experiment is, That when a Vessel hath as much Air in it as it can naturally contain, there may nevertheless be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into it as much water as will fill three quarters of the same Vessel. And the experiment is made in this manner. Into the glass bottle, represented (in the 2d figure) by the Sphere F G, whose center is A, let the pipe B A C be so fitted, that it may precisely fill the mouth of the bottle; and let the end B, be so neer the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that there may be onely space enough left for the free passage of the water which is thrust in above. Let the upper end of this pipe have a Cover at D, with a spout at E, by which the water (when it ascends in the pipe) may run out. Also let H C be a Cock, for the opening or shutting of the passage of the water between B and D, as there shall be occasion. Let the Cover D E be taken off; and the Cock H C being opened, let a Syringe fall of water be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59147:171"/>
in; and before the Syringe be taken away, let the Cock be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hinder the going out of the Aire. And in this manner let the injection of water be repeated as often as it shall be requisite, till the water rise within the bottle, for example, to G F. Lastly, the Cover being fastened on again, and the Cock H C opened, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will run swiftly out at E, and sink by little and little from G F to the bottom of the pipe B.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> they argue for the necessity of <hi>Vacuum</hi> in this manner. The Bottle from the beginning was full of Aire; which Aire could neither go out by penetrating so great a length of water as was injected by the pipe, nor by any other way. Of necessity therefore all the water as high as F G, as also all the Aire that was in the bottle before the water was forced in, must now be in the same place, which at first was filled by the Aire alone; which were impossible, if all the space within the bottle were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly filled with Aire precisely, that is, without any <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, though some man perhaps may think the Air, being a thinne Body, may pass through the Body of the water contained in the pipe, yet from that other <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> (namely, that all the water which is in the space B F G, is cast out again by the spout at E, for which it seems impossible that any other reason can be given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the force by which the Aire frees it self from compression) it follows, that either there was in the bottle some space empty, or that many Bodies may be together in the same place. But this last is absurd; and therefore the former is true, namely, that there was <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument is infirm in two places. For first that is assumed which is not to be granted; and in the second place an experiment is brought, which I think is repugnant to <hi>Vacuum.</hi> That which is assumed is, that the Aire can have no passage out through the pipe. Nevertheless we see daily that Aire easily ascends from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the Superficies of a River (as is manifest by the bubbles that rise); nor doth it need any other cause to give it this motion, then the natural endeavour downwards of the Water. Why therefore may not the endeavour upwards of the same Water ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the injection (which endeavour upwards is greater then the natural endeavour of the water downwards) cause the aire in the bottle to penetrate in like manner the water that presseth
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59147:172"/>
it downwards; especially seeing the water as it riseth in the bottle, doth so press the Aire that is above it, as that it generateth in every part thereof an endeavour towards the external superficies of the pipe, and consequently maketh all the parts of the enclosed aire to tend directly towards the passage at B? I say this is no less manifest, then that he aire which riseth up from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a River should penetrate the water, how deep so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. Werefore I do not yet see any cause why the force by which the water is injected, should not at the same time eject the aire.</p>
               <p>And as for their arguing the necessity of <hi>Vacuum</hi> from the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the water; In the first place, supposing there is <hi>Vacuum,</hi> I demand by what principle of motion that ejection is made. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, seeing this motion is from within outwards, it must needs be caused by some Agent within the bottle; that is to say, by the aire it self. Now the motion of that aire, being caused by the rising of the water, begins at the bottom, and tends upwards; whereas the motion by which it ejecteth the water ought to begin above, and tend downwards. From whence therefore hath the enclosed aire this endeavour towards the bottom. To this question I know not what answer can be given, unless it be said, that the aire des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends of its own accord to expel the water. Which because it is absurd, and that the aire after the water is forced in, hath as much room as its magnitude requires, there will remain no cause at all why the water should be forced out. Wherefore the assertion of <hi>Vacuum</hi> is repugnant to the very experiment which is here brought to establish it,</p>
               <p>Many other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are usually brought for <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as those of <hi>Weather-glasses, Aeolipiles, Wind-guns,</hi> &amp;c. Which would all be very hard to be salved, unless water be penetrable by aire, without the intermixture of empty space. But now, seeing aire may with no great endeavour pass through, not onely water, but any other fluid Body, though never so stubborn, as Quicksilver, these <hi>Phaenomena</hi> prove nothing. Nevertheless, it might in reason be expected, that he that would take away <hi>Vacuum,</hi> should without <hi>Vacuum</hi> shew us such causes of these <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as should be at least of equal, if not greater probability. This therefore shall be done in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, when I come to speak of these <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in their
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59147:172"/>
proper places. But first the most general <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of natural Philosophy are to be premised.</p>
               <p>And seeing that Suppositions are put for the true Causes of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Effects, every Supposition, except such as be absurd, must of necessity consist of some supposed possible Motion (for Rest can never be the Essicient Cause of any thing), &amp; Motion supposeth Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Moveable; of which there are three kinds, <hi>Fluid, Consistent,</hi> and <hi>mixt of both. Fluid</hi> are those, whose parts may by very weak endeavonr be separated from one another; and <hi>Consistent</hi> those, for the separation of whose parts greater force is to be applyed. There are therefore degrees of Consistency; which degrees, by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with more or less Consistent, have the names of <hi>Hardness,</hi> or <hi>Softness.</hi> Wherefore a Fluid Body is alwayes divisible into Bodies equally Fluid, as Quantity into Quantities; and Soft Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of whatsoever degree of Softness, into Soft Bodies of the same degree. And though many men seem to conceive no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> but such as ariseth from the different magnitudes of the parts (in which Sense, Dust, though of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, may be called Fluid); Yet I understand by <hi>Fluidity,</hi> that which is made such by Nature equally in every part of the Fluid Body; not as Dust is Fluid, for so a House which is falling in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be called Fluid; but in such manner as Water seems Fluid, and to divide it self into parts perpetually Fluid. And this being well understood, I come to my Suppositions.</p>
               <p n="5">5 First, therefore I suppose, That the Immense Space which we call the World, is the Aggregate of all Bodies; which are either Consistent &amp; Visible, as the Earth and the Starres; or Invisible, as the small Atomes which are disseminated through the whole space between the Earth and the Stars; and lastly, that most Fluid <hi>Aether,</hi> which so fils all the rest of the Universe, as that it leaves in it no empty place at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I suppose with <hi>Copernicus,</hi> That the greater Bodies of the World, which are both consistent and permanent, have such order amongst themselves, as that the <hi>Sunne</hi> hath the first place, <hi>Mercury</hi> the second, <hi>Venus</hi> the third, <hi>The Earth</hi> (with the <hi>Moon</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it) the fourth, <hi>Mars</hi> the fifth, <hi>Jupiter</hi> (with his Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants) the sixth, <hi>Saturne</hi> the seventh, and after these the <hi>Fixed Starres</hi> have their several distances from the Sunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:59147:173"/>Thirdly, I suppose, That in the Sunne &amp; the rest of the Planets, there is and alwayes has been a Simple Circular Motion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I suppose, That in the Body of the Aire there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Bodies intermingled, which are not Fluid; but withal that they are so small, that they are not preceptible by Sense, and that these also have their proper Simple Motion; and are some of them more, some less hard or consistent.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I suppose with <hi>Kepler,</hi> That as the distance between the Sunne and the Earth, is to the distance between the Moon and the Earth; so the distance between the Moon and the Earth, is to the Semidiameter of the Earth.</p>
               <p>As for the Magnitude of the Circles, and the Times in which they are described by the Bodies which are in them, I will suppose them to be such as shall seem most agreeable to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in question,</p>
               <p n="6">6 The causes of the different Seasons of the Year, and of the several variations of Dayes and Nights in all the parts of the superficies of the Earth, have been demonstrated first by <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and since by <hi>Kepler, Galilaeus</hi> and others, from the supposition of the Earths diurnal revolution about its own Axis, together with its Annual motion about the Sunne, in the Ecliptick according to the order of the Signes; and thirdly, by the annual revolution of the same Earth about its own center contrary to the order of the Signs. I suppose with <hi>Copernicus,</hi> That the diurnal revolution is from the motion of the Earth, by which the Aequinoctial Circle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed about it. And as for the other two annual motions, they are the efficient cause of the Earths being carried about in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in such manner, as that its Axis is alwayes kept parallel to it self. Which parallelisme was for this reason introduced, lest by the Earths annual revolution, its Poles should seem to be necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried about the Sunne, contrary to experience. I have (in the 10th Artic. of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th Chap.) demonstrated from the supposition of Simple Circular Motion in the Sun, that the Earth is so carried about the Sunne, as that its Axis is thereby kept always parallel to it self. Wherefore, from these two supposed motions in the Sunne, the one Simple Circular Motion; the other Circular Motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its owns Center, it may be demonstrated, that the Year hath both the same variations of Dayes and Nights, as have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by <hi>Copernicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:59147:173"/>For if the Circle <hi>abcd</hi> (in the 3d Figure) be the Ecliptick, whose Center is <hi>e,</hi> and Diameter <hi>aec;</hi> and the Earth be placed in <hi>a,</hi> &amp; the Sunne be moved in the little Circle <hi>fghi,</hi> namely, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order <hi>f, g, h</hi> &amp; <hi>i,</hi> it hath been demonstrated, that a Body placed in <hi>a,</hi> will be moved in the same order through the points of the Ecliptick <hi>a, b, c</hi> &amp; <hi>d,</hi> and will alwayes keep its Axis parallel to its self.</p>
               <p>But if (as I have supposed) the Earth also be moved with Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Circular Motion in a plain that passeth through <hi>a,</hi> cutting the plain of the Ecliptick so, as that the common section of both the plains be in <hi>ac,</hi> thus also the Axis of the Earth will be kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes parallel to it self. For let the Center of the Earth be moved about in the Circumference of the Epicycle whose Diameter is <hi>lak,</hi> which is a part of the straight line <hi>lac.</hi> Therefore <hi>lak</hi> the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Epicycle, passing through the Center of the Earth, will be in the plain of the Ecliptick. Wherefore seeing that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Earths Simple Motion both in the Ecliptick and in its Epicycle, the straight line <hi>lak</hi> is kept alwayes parallel to it self, every other straight line also taken in the Body of the Earth, and consequently its Axis, will in like manner be kept alwayes parallel to it self; so that in what part soever of the Ecliptick the Center of the Epicycle be found, and in what part soever of the Epicycle the Center of the Earth be found at the same time, the Axis of the Earth will be parallel to the place where the same Axis would have been, if the Center of the Earth had never gone out of the Ecliptick.</p>
               <p>Now as I have demonstrated the simple annual motion of the Earth from the supposition of Simple Motion in the Sunne; so from the supposition of Simple Motion in the Earth may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the monethly Simple Motion of the Moon. For if the names be but changed the Demonstration will be the same, and therefore need not be repeated.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That which makes this supposition of the Sunnes Simple Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Epicycle <hi>fghi</hi> probable, is First, that the Periods of all the Planets are not onely described about the Sunne, but so descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as that they are al contained within the Zodiack, that is to say, within the latitude of about 16 degrees; for the cause of this
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59147:174"/>
seems to depend upon some power in the Sunne, especially in that part of the Sunne which respects the Zodiack. Secondly, that in the whole co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>passe of the heavens there appears no other Body, from which the cause of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> can in probability be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Besides, I could not imagine, that so many and such vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motions of the Planets should have no dependance at all upon one another. But by supposing motive power in the Sunne, we suppose motion also; for power to move, without motion, is no power at all. I have therefore supposed that there is in the Sunne for the governing of the primary Planets, and in the Earth for the governing of the Moon, such motion, as being received by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Planets and by the Moon, makes them necessarily appear to us in such manner as we see them; Whereas, that circular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is commonly attributed to them) about a fixed Axis, (which is called Conversion) being a motion of their parts onely, and not of their whole Bodies, is insufficient to salve their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. For seeing whatsoever is so moved, hath no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at all towards those parts which are without the circle, they have no power to propagate any endeavour to such Bodies as are placed without it. And as for them that suppose this may be done by Magnetical Virtue, or by incorporeall and immateriall Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they suppose no naturall cause; nay no cause at all. For there is no such thing as an Incorporeal Movent; and Magnetical Virtue is a thing altogether unknown; and whensoever it shall be known, it will be found to be a motion of Body. It remaines therefore, that if the primary Planets be carried about by the Sunne, and the Moon by the Earth, they have the simple circular motions of the Sunne and the Earth for the causes of their circulations. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if they be not carried about by the Sunne and the Earth, but that every Planet hath been moved as it is now moved ever since it was made, there will be of their motions no cause naturall. For either these motions were concreated with their Bodies, and their cause is supernatural; or they are coeternal with them, and so they have no cause at all. For whatsoever is Eternall was never generated.</p>
               <p>I may add besides, to confirme the probability of this simple motion, that allmost all learned men are now of the same opinion
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59147:174"/>
with <hi>Copernicus</hi> concerning the parallelisme of the Axis of the Earth, it seemed to me to be more agreeable to truth, or at least more handsome, that it should be caused by simple Circular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, than by two motions, one in the Ecliptick, and the other about the Earths own Axis the contrary way, neither of them Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor either of them such as might be produced by any motion of the Sunne. I thought best therefore to retain this Hypothesis of Simple Motion; and from it to derive the causes of as many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as I could, and to let such alone as I could not deduce frm thence.</p>
               <p>It will perhaps be objected, that although by this supposition the reason may be given of the Parallelisme of the Axis of the Earth, and of many other Appearances; nevertheless, seeing it is done by placing the Body of the Sunne in the Center of that Orbe which the Earth describes with its annual motion, the supposition it self is false, because this annual Orbe is excentrique to the Sunne. In the first place therefore let us examine what that Excentricity is, and whence it proceeds.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Let the annual Circle of the Earth <hi>abcd</hi> (in the same 3d fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) be divided into four equal parts by the straight lines <hi>ac</hi> &amp; <hi>bd,</hi> cutting one another in the Center <hi>e;</hi> and let <hi>a</hi> be the beginning of <hi>Libra, b</hi> of <hi>Capricorn, c</hi> of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>d</hi> of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and let the whole Orbe <hi>abcd</hi> be understood (according to <hi>Copernicus</hi>) to have every way so great distance from the Zodiack of the fixed Starres, that it be in comparison with it but as a point. Let the Earth be now supposed to be in the beginning of <hi>Libra</hi> at <hi>a.</hi> The Sunne therefore will appear in the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> at <hi>c.</hi> Wherefore if the Earth be moved from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>b,</hi> the apparent motion of the Sunne will be from <hi>c</hi> to the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> in <hi>d;</hi> and the Earth being moved forwards from <hi>b</hi> to <hi>c,</hi> the Sunne also will appear to be moved forwards to the beginning of <hi>Libra</hi> in <hi>a;</hi> Wherefore <hi>cda</hi> will be the Summer Arch, and the Winter Arch will be <hi>abc.</hi> Now in the time of the Suns apparent motion in the Summer Arch, there are numbred 186¾ dayes; and consequently the Earth makes in the same time the same number of diurnal conversions in the Arch <hi>abc;</hi> and therefore the Earth in its motion through the Arch <hi>cda</hi> will make onely 178½ diurnal conversions, Wherefore
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59147:175"/>
the Arch <hi>a b c</hi> ought to be greater then the Arch <hi>c d a</hi> by 8¼ dayes, that is to say, by almost so many degrees. Let the Arch <hi>a r,</hi> as also <hi>c s,</hi> be each of them an Arch of two degrees and 1/16. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arch <hi>r b s</hi> will be greater then the Semicircle <hi>a b c</hi> by 4 degrees and ⅛, and greater then the Arch <hi>s d r</hi> by 8 degrees and ¼. The Equinoxes therefore will be in the points <hi>r</hi> &amp; <hi>s;</hi> and therefore also when the Earth is in <hi>r,</hi> the Sunne will appear in <hi>s.</hi> Wherefore the true place of the Sunne will be in <hi>t,</hi> that is to say, without the Center of the Earths annual motion by the quantity of the Sine of the Arch <hi>a r,</hi> or the Sine of two degrees and 16 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. Now this Sine, putting 100000 for the Radius, will be neer 3580 parts thereof. And so munh is the Excentricity of the Earths annual motion, provided that that motion be in a perfect circle; and <hi>s</hi> &amp; <hi>r</hi> are the Equinoctial points; and the straight lines <hi>s r</hi> &amp; <hi>c a</hi> produced both wayes till they reach the Zodiack of the fixed Starres, wil fall stil upon the same fixed Starres, because the whole Orbe <hi>a b c d</hi> is supposed to have no magnitude at all in respect of the great distance of the fixed Starres.</p>
               <p>Supposing now the Sun to be in <hi>c,</hi> it remains that I shew the cause why the Earth is neerer to the Sunne, when in its annual motion it is found to be in <hi>d,</hi> then when it is in <hi>b.</hi> And I take the cause to be this. When the Earth is in the beginning of <hi>Capricorn</hi> at <hi>b,</hi> the Sunne appears in the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> at <hi>d;</hi> &amp; then is the midst of Summer. But in the midst of Summer, the Northern parts of the Earth are towards the Sunne, which is almost all dry land, containing all <hi>Europe,</hi> and much the greatest part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> But when the Earth is in the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> at <hi>d,</hi> it is the midst of Winter, and that part of the Earth is towards the Sunne, which contains those great Seas called the South Sea and the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sea, which are of farre greater extent then all the dry Land in that Hemisphere. Wherefore (by the last Article of the 21 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) when the Earth is in <hi>d,</hi> it will come neerer to its first Movent, that is, to the Sunne which is in <hi>t;</hi> that is to say, the Earth is neerer to the Sunne in the midst of Winter when it is in <hi>d,</hi> then in the midst of Summer when it is <hi>b;</hi> and therefore during the Winter the Sunne is in its <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> and in its <hi>Apogaeum</hi> during the Summer. And thus I have shewn a possible cause of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59147:175"/>
Excentricity of the Earth; which was to be done.</p>
               <p>I am therefore of <hi>Keplers</hi> opinion, in this, that he attributes the Excentricity of the Earth to the difference of the parts thereof, and supposes one part to be affected, and another disaffected to the Sunne. And I dissent from him in this, that he thinks it to be by Magnetick virtue, and that this Magnetick virtue, or attraction and thrusting back of the Earth is wrought by immateriate Species; which cannot be; because nothing can give motion, but a Body moved and contiguous. For if those Bodies be not moved which are contiguous to a Body unmoved, how this Body should begin to be moved is not imaginable; as has been demonstrated in the 7th Article of the 9th Chapter, and often inculcated in other places, to the end that Philosophers might at last abstain from the use of such unconceiveable connexions of words. I dissent also from him in this, that he says the similitude of Bodies is the cause of their mutual attraction, For if it were so, I see no reason why one Egg should not be attracted by another. If therefore one part of the Earth be more affected by the Sunne, then another part, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this, that one part hath more water, the other more dry land. And from hence it is, (as I shewed above) that the Earth comes neerer to the Sunne when it shines upon that part where there is more water, then when it shines upon that where there is more dry Land.</p>
               <p n="9">9 This Excentricity of the Earth is the cause why the way of its annual motion is not a perfect Circle, but either an Elliptical, or almost an Elliptical line; as also why the Axis of the Earth is not kept exactly parallel to it self in all places, but onely in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial points.</p>
               <p>Now seeing I have said that the Moon is carried about by the Earth, in the same manner that the Earth is by the Sunne; and that the Earth goeth about the Sunne in such manner as that it shews sometimes one Hemisphere, sometimes the other to the Sunne; it remains to be enquired, why the Moon has alwayes one and the same face turned towards the Earth.</p>
               <p>Suppose therefore the Sunne to be moved with Simple Motion in the little Circle <hi>f g h i,</hi> (in the fourth figure) whose Center is <hi>t;</hi> and let ♈ ♋ ♎ ♑ be the annuall Circle of the Earth; and <hi>a</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,

of <hi>Libra.</hi> About the point <hi>a</hi> let the little Circle <hi>l k</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; and in it let the Center of the Earth be understood to be moved with Simple motion; and both the Sunne &amp; the Earth to be moved according to the order of the Signes.

                  </gap> same <hi>q r</hi> will be turned so much as makes another quarter of its whole conversion. When therefore the Moon is in <hi>m, q r</hi> will be perpendicular to the straight line <hi>o m.</hi> By the same reason, when the Moon is in <hi>n, q r</hi> will be parallel to the straight line <hi>m o;</hi> and the Moon returning to <hi>o,</hi> the same <hi>q r</hi> will return to its first place; and the Body of the Moon will in one entire period make also one entire conversion upon her own Axis. In the making of which, it is manifest, that one and the same face of the Moon is always turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the Earth. And if any Diameter were taken in that little Circle, in which the Moon were supposed to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with simple motion, the same effect would follow; for if there were no action from the Sun, every Diameter of the Moon would be carried about always parallel to it self. Wherefore I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a possible cause, why one and the same face of the Moon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes turned towards the Earth.</p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, that when the Moon is without the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, we do not alwayes see the same face precisely. For we see one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that part which is illuminated. But when the Moon is without
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59147:176"/>
the Ecliptick, that part which is towards us, is not exactly the same with that which is illuminated.</p>
               <p n="10">10 To these three simple motions, one of the Sunne, another of the Moon, and the third of the Earth, in their own little Circles <hi>f g h i, l k,</hi> &amp; <hi>q r,</hi> together with the Diurnal conversion of the Earth (by which conversion all things that adhere to its superficies are necessarily carried about with it) may be referred the three <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> concerning the Tides of the Ocean. Whereof the first, is the alternate elevation and depression of the Water at the Shores, twice in the space of 24 houres and neer upon 52 minutes; for so it has constantly continued in all ages. The second, that at the New and Full Moons the elevations of the Water are greater, then at other times between. And the third, that when the Sunne is in the Equinoctial, they are yet greater then at any other time. For the salving of which <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we have already the foure above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Motions; to which I assume also this, that the part of the Earth which is called <hi>America,</hi> being higher then the Water, and extended almost the space of a whole Semicircle from North to South, gives a stop to the motion of the Water. This being granted,</p>
               <p>In the same 4th figure, where <hi>l b k c</hi> is supposed to be in the plain of the Moons monethly motion, let the little Circle <hi>l d k e</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed about the same Center <hi>a</hi> in the plain of the Equinoctial. This Circle therefore will decline from the Circle <hi>l b k c</hi> in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of almost 28 degrees and ½ (for the greatest declination of the Ecliptick is 23½, to which adding 5 for the greatest declination of the Moon from the Ecliptick, the summe wil be 28 degrees and ½). Seeing now the Waters which are under the Circle of the Moons course, are (by reason of the Earths Simple Motion in the plain of the same Circle) moved together with the Earth, (that is to say, together with their own bottoms) neither out-going nor out-gone; if we add the Diurnal motion, by which the other Waters which are under the Equinoctial are moved in the same order; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider withall that the Circles of the Moon and of the Equinoctial intersect one another; it will be manifest, that both those Waters, which are under the Circle of the Moon, and under the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, will runne together under the Equinoctial; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59147:177"/>
that their Motion will not onely be swifter then the ground that carries them; but also that the waters themselves will have greater elevation whensoever the Earth is in the Equinoctial. Wherefore, whatsoever the cause of the Tides may be, this may be the cause of their augmentation at that time.</p>
               <p>Againe, seeing I have supposed the Moon to be carried about by the simple motion of the Earth in the little circle <hi>lbkc;</hi> and demonstrated (at the 4 article of the 21 chapter) that whatsoever is moved by a Movent that hath simple motion, will be moved all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the same velocity; it follows, that the center of the Earth will be carried in the circumference <hi>lbkc</hi> with the same velocity, with which the Moon is carried in the circumference <hi>mnop.</hi> Wherefore the time in which the Moon is carried about in <hi>mnop,</hi> is to the time in which the Earth is carried about in <hi>lbkc,</hi> as one circumference to the other, that is, as <hi>ao</hi> to <hi>ak.</hi> But <hi>ao</hi> is observed to be to the Semidiameter of the Earth as 59 to 1; and therefore the Earth (if <hi>ak</hi> be put for its Semidiameter) will make 59 revolutions in <hi>lbkc,</hi> in the time that the Moon makes one monthly circuit in <hi>mnop.</hi> But the Moon makes her monthly circuit in little more then 29 dayes. Wherefore the Earth shal make its circuit in the circumference <hi>lbkc</hi> in 12 hours and a little more, namely about 26 minutes more; that is to say, it shall make two circuits in 24 hours and allmost 52 minutes; which is observed to be the time between the high water of one day and the high water of the day following. Now the course of the waters being hindered by the southern part of <hi>America,</hi> their motion will be interrupted there; and consequently, they will be elevated in those places, and sink down again by their own waight, twice in the space of 24 hours and 52 minutes. And thus I have given a possible cause of the diurnall reciprocation of the Ocean.</p>
               <p>Now from this swelling of the Ocean in those parts of the Earth, proceed the Flowings and Ebbings in the Atlantick, Spanish, Brittish and German Seas; which though they have their set times, yet upon severall Shores they happen at severall hours of the day; and they receive some augmentation from the North, by reason that the shores of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tartaria,</hi> hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59147:177"/>
the generall course of the waters, makes them swell there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and discharge themselves in part through the straight of <hi>Anian</hi> into the Northern Ocean, and so into the German Sea.</p>
               <p>As for the Spring Tides which happen at the time of the New &amp; Full Moons, they are caused by that simple motion which at the beginning I supposed to be allwayes in the Moone. For as, when I shewed the cause of the Excentricity of the Earth, I derived the elevation of the waters from the simple motion of the Sunne; so the same may here be derived from the simple motion of the Moon. For though from the generation of Clouds, there appeare in the Sunne a more manifest power of elevating the waters, then in the Moon; yet the power of encreasing moisture in Vegetables and living creatures appears more manifestly in the Moon then in the Sunne; which may perhaps proceed from this, that the Sunne raiseth up greater, and the Moon lesser drops of water. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, it is more likely, and more agreeable to common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that Raine is raised not only by the Sunne but also by the Moon; for allmost all men expect change of weather at the time of the Conjunctions of the Sunne and Moon with one another, and with the Earth, more then in the time of their Quarters.</p>
               <p>In the last place, the cause why the Spring Tides are greater at the time of the Aequinoxes, hath been already sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this Article, where I have demonstrated, that the two Motions of the Earth, namely, its Simple Motion in the little Circle <hi>lbkc,</hi> and its Diurnal motion in <hi>ldke,</hi> cause ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily a greater elevation of Waters when the Sunne is about the Aequinoxes, then when he is in other places. I have therefore given possible causes of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Flowing and Ebbing of the Ocean.</p>
               <p n="11">11 As for the explication of the yearly <hi>Praecession of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial points,</hi> we must remember, that (as I have already shewn) the annual motion of the Earth is not in the Circumference of a Circle, but of an Ellipsis, or a line not considerably different from that of an Ellipsis. In the first place therefore this Elliptical line is to be described.</p>
               <p>Let the Ecliptick ♎ ♑ ♈ ♋ (in the 5th figure) be divided into four equal parts by the two straight lines <hi>ab</hi> and ♑ ♋, cutting one
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59147:178"/>
another at right angles in the Center <hi>c;</hi> and taking the Arch <hi>bd</hi> of 2 degrees and 16 minutes, let the straight line <hi>de</hi> be drawn parallel to <hi>ab</hi> and cutting ♑ ♋ in <hi>f;</hi> which being done, the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity of the Earth will be <hi>cf.</hi> Seeing therefore the annual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth is in the Circumference of an Ellipsis, of which ♑ ♋ is the greater Axis, <hi>ab</hi> cannot be the lesser Axis; for <hi>ab</hi> and ♑ ♋ are equal. Wherefore the Earth passing through <hi>a</hi> &amp; <hi>b,</hi> will either pass above ♑, as through <hi>g,</hi> or passing through ♑, will fall between <hi>c</hi> and <hi>a;</hi> it is no matter which. Let it pass therefore through <hi>g;</hi> and let <hi>gl</hi> be taken equal to the straight line ♑ ♋; and dividing <hi>gl</hi> equally in <hi>i, gi</hi> will be equal to ♑ ♋, &amp; <hi>il</hi> equal to <hi>f</hi> ♋; and consequently the point <hi>i</hi> will cut the Excentricity <hi>cf</hi> into two equal parts; and taking <hi>ih</hi> equal to <hi>if, hi</hi> will be the whole Excentricity. If now a straight line (namely, the line ♎ <hi>i</hi> ♈) be drawn through <hi>i</hi> parallel to the straight lines <hi>ab</hi> and <hi>ed,</hi> the way of the Sunne in Summer (namely, the Arch ♎ <hi>g</hi> ♈) will be greater then his way in Winter by 8 degrees and ¼. Wherefore the true Aequinoxes wil be in the straight line ♎ <hi>i</hi> ♈; and therefore the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis of the Earths annual motion will not pass through <hi>a, g, b &amp; l;</hi> but through ♎, <hi>g,</hi> ♈ &amp; <hi>l.</hi> Wherfore the annual motion of the Earth is in the Ellipsis ♎ <hi>g</hi> ♈ <hi>l,</hi> and cannot be (the Excentricity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing salved) in any other line. And this perhaps is the reason, why <hi>Kepler,</hi> against the opinion of all the Astronomers of former time, thought fit to bisect the Excentricity of the Earth, or (according to the Ancients) of the Sunne, not by diminishing the quantity of the same Excentricity, because the true measure of that quantity, is the difference by which the Summer Arch exceeds the Winter Arch, but by taking for the Center of the Ecliptick of the great Orbe the point <hi>c</hi> neerer to <hi>f,</hi> &amp; so placing the whole great Orbe as much neerer to the Ecliptick of the fixed Stars towards ♋, as is the distance between <hi>c</hi> &amp; <hi>i.</hi> For seeing the whole great Orbe is but as a point in respect of the immense distance of the fixed Starres, the two straight lines ♎ ♈ and <hi>ab</hi> being produced both wayes to the beginnings of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> will fall upon the same points of the Sphere of the fixed Stars. Let therefore the Diameter of the Earth <hi>mn</hi> be in the plain of the Earths annual motion. If now the Earth be moved by the Sunnes simple motion in the Circumference of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59147:178"/>
the Ecliptick about the Center <hi>i,</hi> this Diameter will bee kept alwayes parallel to itself and to the straight line <hi>gl.</hi> But seeing the Earth is moved in the Circumference of an Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis without the Ecliptick, the point <hi>n,</hi> whilst it passeth through ♎ ♑ ♈ will go in a lesser Circumference then the point <hi>m;</hi> and consequently as soon as ever it begins to be moved, it will lose its parallelisme with the straight line ♑ ♋<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that <hi>mn</hi> produced will at last cut the straight line <hi>gl</hi> produced. And contrarily, as soon as <hi>mn</hi> is past ♈, (the Earth making its way in the internal Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall line ♈ <hi>l</hi> ♎) the same <hi>mn</hi> produced towards <hi>m,</hi> will cut <hi>lg</hi> produced. And when the Earth hath allmost finished its whole circumference, the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>mn</hi> shall againe make a right angle with a line drawn from the center <hi>i,</hi> a little short of the point from which the Earth began its motion. And there the next yeare shall be one of the Aequinoctial points, namely, neer the end of ♍; the other shall be opposite to it neer the end of ♓. And thus the points in which the Days and Nights are made equall, doe every year fall back; but with so slow a motion, that in a whole year, it makes but 51 first minutes. And this relapse being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the order of the Signes, is commonly called the <hi>Praecession of the Aequinoxes.</hi> Of which I have from my former Suppositions deduced a possible cause; which was to be done.</p>
               <p>According to what I have said concerning the cause of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricity of the Earth; and according to <hi>Kepler,</hi> who for the cause thereof supposeth one part of the Earth to be affected to the Sunne the other part to be disaffected, the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> &amp; <hi>Perigaeum</hi> of the Sunne should be moved every year in the same order, and with the same velocity, with which the Aequinoctiall points are moved; and their distance from them should allwayes be the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of a circle; which seems to be otherwise. For Astronomers say, that the Aequinoxes are now, the one about 28 degrees gone back from the first Star of <hi>Aries,</hi> the other as much from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Libra.</hi> So that the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Sunne, or the <hi>Aphelium</hi> of the Earth ought to be about the 28th degree of <hi>Cancer;</hi> but it is reckoned to be in the 7th degree. Seeing therefore we have not sufficient evidence of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>that so it is</hi>), it is in vaine to seek for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>why it is so</hi>). Wherefore, as long as the motion of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59147:179"/>
                  <hi>Apogaeum</hi> is not observable by reason of the slownesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and as long as it remaiues doubtful whether their distance from the Aequinoctiall points be more or lesse then a quadrant precisely; so long it may be lawfull for me to thinke they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both of them with equall velocity.</p>
               <p>Also, I doe not at all meddle with the causes of the Excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of <hi>Saturne, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> Neverthelesse, seeing the Excentricity of the Earth may (as I have shewne) be caused by the unlike constitution of the several parts of the Earth which are alternately turned towards the Sunne, it is credible also that like effects may be produced in these other Planets from their having their Superficies of unlike parts.</p>
               <p>And this is all I shall say concerning <hi>Sidereal Philosophy.</hi> And though the causes I have here supposed be not the true causes of these <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> yet I have demonstrated that they are sufficient to produce them, according to what I at first propounded.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides the Starres (of which I have spoken in the last Chapt.), whatsoever other Bodies there be in the World, they may be all comprehended under the name of <hi>Intersidereal</hi> Bodies. And these I have already supposed to be either the most fluid <hi>Aether,</hi> or such Bodies whose parts have some degree of cohaesion. Now these differ from one another in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Consistencies, Magnitudes, Motions</hi> and <hi>Figures.</hi> In Consistency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I suppose some Bodies to be Harder, others Softer through all the several degrees of <hi>Tenacity.</hi> In Magnitude, some to be Greater, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Less, and many unspeakably Little. For we must remember that by the Understanding, Quantity is divisible into divisibles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually. And therefore if a man could do as much with his hands as he can with his Understanding, he would be able to take from any given magnitude, a part which should be less then any other magnitude given. But the Omnipotent Creator of the World can actually from a part of any thing take another par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as farre as we
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59147:181"/>
by our Understanding can conceive the same to be divisible. Wherefore there is no impossible Smalness of Bodies. And what hinders but that we may think this likely? For we know there are some living Creatures so small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we can scarce see their whole Bodies. Yet even these have their young ones, their little Veins, and other Vessels, and their Eyes so smal, as that no <hi>Microscope</hi> can make them visible. So that we cannot suppose any magnitude so little, but that our very supposition is actually exceeded by Nature. Besides, there are now such <hi>Microscopes</hi> commonly made, that the things we see with them appear a hundred thousand times bigger, then they would do if we looked upon them with our bare Eyes. Nor is there any doubt but that by augmenting the power of these <hi>Microscopes</hi> (for it may be augmented as long as neither Matter nor the hands of Workmen are wanting) every one of those hundred thousandth parts might yet appear a hundred thousand times geater then they did before. Neither is the Smalness of some Bodies to be more admired, then the vast Greatness of others. For it belongs to the same infinite Power, as well to augment infinitely, as infinitely to diminish; To make the great Orbe, (namely, that whose Radius reacheth from the Earth to the Sunne) but as a point in respect of the distance between the Sunne and the fixed Starres; and on the contrary, to make a Body so little, as to be in the same proportion less then any other visible Body, proceeds equally from one and the same Authour of Nature. But this of the immense di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the fixed Starres (which for a long time was accounted an incredible thing) is now believed by almost all the Learned. Why then should not that other of the smalness of some Bodies, become credible at some time or other? For the Majesty of God appears no less in small things then in great; and as it exceedeth humane sense in the immense greatness of the Universe; so also it doth in the smalness of the parts thereof. Nor are the first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of Compositions, nor the first Beginnings of Actions, nor the first Moments of Times more credible, then that which is now believed of the vast distance of the fixed Starres.</p>
               <p>Some things are acknowledged by mortal men to be very Great, though Finite, as seeing them to be such. They acknowledge also, that some things which they do not see, may be of infinite mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59147:181"/>
But they are not presently, nor without great study per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that there is any Mean between Infinite &amp; the Greatest of those things which either they see or imagine. Nevertheless, when after meditation &amp; contemplation, many things which we wondred at before are now grown more familiar to us, we then believe them, and transferre our admiration from the Creatures to the Creator. But how little soever some Bodies may be; yet I will not suppose their quantity to be less, then is requisite for the salving of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</hi> And in like manner I shall suppose their motion, namely, their Velocity and Slowness, and the Variety of their Figures, to be onely such as the explication of their natural causes requires. And lastly, I suppose, that the parts of the pure <hi>Aether</hi> (as if it were the First Matter) have no motion at all, but what they receive from Bodies which float in them, and are not themselves fluid.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Having laid these Grounds, let us come to speake of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in the first place let us inquire what may be the cause of the Light of the Sunne. Seeing therefore the Body of the Sunne doth by its simple circular motion thrust away the ambient aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall substance sometimes one way sometimes another, so that those parts which are next the Sunne being moved by it, doe propagate that motion to the next remote parts, and these to the next, and so on continually; it must needs be, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any distance, the foremost part of the Eie will at last be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and by the pressure of that part, the motion will be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the innermost part of the Organ of Sight, namely to the Heart; and from the reaction of the Heart, there will proceed an endeavour back by the same way, ending in the endeavour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Coat of the Eie called the <hi>Retina.</hi> But this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour outwards (as has been defined in the 25 chapter) is the thing which is called Light, or the Phantasme of a Lucid Body. For it is by reason of this Phantasme that an Object is called Lucid. Wherefore we have a possible cause of the Light of the Sunne; which I undertook to find.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The generation of the Light of the Sunne is accompanied with the generation of Heat. Now every man knowes what Heat is in himselfe, by feeling it when he growes Hot; but what it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he knowes onely by ratiocination. For it is one thing to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59147:182"/>
grow Hot, and another thing to Heat, or make Hot. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though we perceive that the Fire or the Sunne Heateth, yet we doe not perceive that it is it selfe Hot. That other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whilest they make other things Hot, are Hot themselves, we inferre by reasoning from the like sense in our selves. But this is not a necessary inference. For though it may truly be said of living Creatures, that <hi>They Heat, therefore they are themselves Hot;</hi> yet it cannot from hence be truly inferred, that <hi>Fire Heateth, therefore it is it selfe Hot;</hi> no more then this, <hi>Fire causeth Pain, therefore it is it self in Pain.</hi> Wherefore that is onely and properly called Hot, which when we feel, we are necessarily Hot.</p>
               <p>Now when we grow Hot, we find that our Spirits and Blood, and whatsoever is fluid within us, is called out from the internall to the externall parts of our Bodies, more or lesse, according to the degree of the Heat; and that our Skin swelleth. He therefore that can give a possible cause of this Evocation and Swelling, and such as agreeth with the rest of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Heat; may be thought to have given the cause of the Heat of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>It hath been shewn (in the 5 article of the 21 chapter) that the fluid Medium which we call the Aire, is so moved by the simple circular motion of the Sunne, as that all its parts, even the least, do perpetually change places with one another; which change of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is that which there I called Fermentation. From this Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Aire, I have (in the 8 article of the last chapter) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that the water may be drawn up into the clouds.</p>
               <p>And I shall now shew, that the fluid parts may in like manner by the same Fermentation be drawn out from the internall to the externall parts of our Bodies. For seeing that wheresoever the fluid Medium is contiguous to the Body of any living creature, there the parts of that Medium are by perpetuall change of place separated from one another; the contiguous parts of the living creature must of necessity endeavour to enter into the spaces of the separated parts. For otherwise those parts (supposing there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi>) would have no place to go into. And therefore that which is most fluid and separable in the parts of the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which are contiguous to the Medium, will go first out; and into the place thereof will succeed such other parts as can most
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59147:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
easily transpire through the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es of the skin. And from hence it is necessary, that the rest of the parts which are not separated, must all together be moved outwards, for the keeping of all places full. But this motion outwards of all parts together must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity press those parts of the ambient Aire which are ready to leave their places; and therefore all the parts of the Body endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring at once that way, makes the Body swell. Wherefore a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible cause is given of Heat from the Sunne; which was to be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We have now seen how Light and Heat are generated; Heat by the simple motion of the Medium, making the parts perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change places with one another; and Light by this, that by the same simple motion Action is propagated in a straight line. But when a Body hath its parts so moved, that it sensibly both Heats and Shines at the same time, then it is, that we say Fire is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Now by Fire I do not understand a Body distinct from matter combustible or glowing, as Wood or Iron, but the matter it self, not simply and always, but then onely when it shineth and heateth. He therefore that renders a cause possible, and agreeable to the rest of the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> namely, whence and from what action both the <hi>Shining</hi> and <hi>Heating</hi> proceed, may be thought to have given a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause of the generation of <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let therefore ABC (in the first Figure) be a Sphere, or the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sphere, whose Center is D; and let it be transparent and homogeneous, as Cristal, Glass, or Water, and objected to the Sunne. Wherefore the foremost part ABC, will by the simple motion of the Sunne, by which it thrusts forwards the Medium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be wrought upon by the Sun-beams in the straight lines EA, FB and GC; which straight lines may in respect of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sunne be taken for parallels. And seeing the Medium within the Sphere is thicker then the Medium without it, those Beams will be refracted towards their perpendiculars. Let the straight lines EA and GC be produced till they cut the Sphere in H and I; and drawing the perpendiculars AD and CD, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted Beams EA and GC will of necessity fall, the one between AH and AD, the other between CI and CD. Let those refracted
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59147:183"/>
Beams be AK and CL. And again, let the lines DKM &amp; DLN be drawn per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>endicular to the Sphere; and let AK and CL be produced till they meet with the straight line BD produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in O. Seeing therefore the Medium within the Sphere is thicker then that without it, the refracted line AK will recede further from the perpendicular KM, then KO will recede from the same. Wherefore KO will fall between the refracted line and the perpendicular. Let therefore the refracted line be KP, cutting FO in P, and for the same reason the straight line LP will be the refracted line of the straight line CL. Wherfore, seeing the Beams are nothing else but the Wayes in which the motion is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the motion about P will be so much more vehement then the motion about ABC, by how much the base of the portion ABC is greater then the base of a like portion in the Sphere whose Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is P, and whose magnitude is equal to that of the little Circle about P, which comprehendeth all the Beams that are propagated from ABC; and this Sphere being much less then the Sphere ABC, the parts of the Medium, that is, of the Aire about P, will change places with one another with much greater celerity, then those about ABC. If therefore any matter Combustible, that is to say, such as may be easily dissipated, be placed in P, the parts of that matter (if the proportion be great enough between AC and a like portion of the little circle about P) wil be freed from their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cohaesion, and being separated will acquire simple motion. But vehement simple motion generates in the beholder a Phantasm of Lucid and Hot, as I have before de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onstrated of the simple moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunne; and therefore the combustible matter which is placed in P will be made Lucid and Hot, that is to say, will be Fire. Wherefore I have rendered a possible cause of Fire; which was to be done.</p>
               <p n="5">5 From the manner by which the Sunne generateth Fire, it is easy to explaine the manner by which Fire may be generated by the collision of two Flints. For by that Collision, some of those particles of which the stone is compacted, are violently separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and thrown off; and being withall swiftly turned round, the Eie is moved by them, as it is in the generation of Light by the Sunne. Wherefore they shine; and falling upon matter which
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59147:183"/>
is already halfe dissipated, such as is Tinder, they throughly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate the parts thereof, and make them turn round. From whence (as I have newly shewn) Light and Heat, that is to say, Fire is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The shining of Glow-worms, some kinds of Rotten Wood, and of a kinde of stone made at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> may have one common cause, namely the exposing of them to the hot Sunne. We finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the <hi>Bolonian</hi> stone shines not unless it be so exposed; and after it has been exposed it shines but for a little time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as long as it retains a certain degree of heat. And the cause may be, that the parts of which it is made, may together with heat have Simple Motion imprinted in them by the Sunne. Which if it be so, it is necessary, that it shine in the dark, as long as there is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient heat in it; but this ceasing, it will shine no longer. Also we find by experience, that in the Glow-worm there is a certain thick humour, like the Cristalline humour of the Eie; which if it be taken out, and held long enough in ones fingers, and then be carried into the dark, it will shine by reason of the warmth it received from the fingers; but as soon as it is cold, it will cease shining. From whence therefore can these creatures have their Light, but from lying all day in the Sun-shine, in the hottest time of Summer? In the same manner, Rotten Wood, except it grow rotten in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, or be afterwards long enough exposed to the Sunne, will not shine. That this doth not happen in every Worm, nor in all kinds of Rotten Wood, nor in all Calcined Stones, the cause may be, that the parts of which those Bodies are made, are different both in motion and figure from the parts of Bodies of other kinds.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Also the Sea-water shineth when it is either dashed with the strokes of Oares, or when a Ship in its course breaks strongly through it; but more or less according as the Winde blows from different points. The cause whereof may be this, that the particles of salt (though they never shine in the Salt-pits, where they are but slowly drawn up by the Sunne) being here beaten up into the aire in greater quantities, and with more force, are withall made to turn round, and consequently to shine, though weakly. I have therefore given a possible cause of this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 If such matter as is compounded of hard little Bodies, be set
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59147:184"/>
on fire, it must needs be, that as they flye out in greater or lesse quantities, the Flame which is made by them, will be greater or less. And if the aethereal or fluid part of that matter fly out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, their motion will be the Swifter, as it is in Wood, and other things which flame with a manifest mixture of Winde. When therefore these hard particles by their flying out, move the Eye strongly, they shine bright; and a great quantity of them flying out together, they make a great shining Body. For Flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but an aggregate of shining particles, the greater the aggregate is, the greater and more manifest will be the Flame. I have therefore shewn a possible cause of Flame. And from hence the cause appears evidently, why Glass is so easily and quickly melted by the small Flame of a candle blown, which will not be melted without blowing, but by a very strong Fire.</p>
               <p>Now if from the same matter, there be a part broken off (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a part as consisteth of many of the small particles), of this is made a Spark. For from the breaking off, it hath a violent turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round; and from hence it shines. But though from this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there fly neither Flame nor Sparks; yet some of the smallest parts of it may be carried out as farre as to the Superficies, and remain there, as Ashes; the parts whereof are so extremely small, that it cannot any longer be doubted how farre Nature may proceed in Dividing.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though by the application of fire to this matter, there fly little or nothing from it, yet there will be in the parts an endeavour to Simple motion; by which the whole Body will either be Melted, or (which is a degree of Melting) Softned. For all Motion has some effect upon all Matter whatsoever (as has been shewn at the 3d Article of the 16th Chapter). Now if it be softned to such a degree, as that the stubborness of the parts be exceeded by their gravity, then we say it is Melted; otherwise, Softned, and made Pliant and <hi>Ductile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the matter having in it some particles hard, others aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or watery, if by the application of fire these later be called out, the former will thereby come to a more full contact with one another; and consequently will not be so easily separated; that is to say, the whole Body will be made Harder. And this may
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59147:184"/>
be the cause why the same Fire makes some things Soft, others Hard.</p>
               <p n="9">9 It is known by experience, that if Hay be laid wet together in a heap, it will after a time begin to smoke, and then burn as it were of it self. The cause whereof seems to be this, that in the Aire which is enclosed within the Hay, there are those little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which (as I have supposed) are moved freely with simple Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this Motion being by degrees hindred more and more by the descending moisture, which at the last fils and stops all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, the thinner parts of the Aire ascend by penetrating the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and those hard little Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> being so thrust together that they touch and press one another, acquire stronger motion, till at last by the increased strength of this motion the watery parts are first driven outwards, from whence appears Vapour; and by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued increase of this motion, the smallest particles of the dryed Hay are forced out, and recovering their natural simple Motion, they grow Hot and Shine, that is to say, they are set on Fire.</p>
               <p>The same also may be the cause of Lightning; which happens in the hottest time of the yeare, when the water is raised up in greatest quantity, and carried highest. For after the first Clouds are raised, others after others follow them; and being congeled above, they happen (whilest some of them ascend and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend) to fall upon another in such manner, as that in some places all their parts are joyned together, in others they leave hollow Spaces between them; aud into these spaces (the aethereall parts being forced out by the compressure of the Clouds) many of the harder little Bodies are so pent together, as that they have not the liberty of such motion as is naturall to the Aire. Wherefore their endeavour growes more vehement, till at last they force their way through the Clouds, sometimes in one place, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another; and breaking through with great noise, they move the aire violently, &amp; striking our Eies generate Light, that is to say, they Shine. And this Shining is that we call Lightning.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The most common <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> proceeding from Fire, and yet the most admirable of all others, is the force of Gunpowder fired; which being compounded of Niter, Brimstone and Coles beaten small, hath from the Coles its first taking fire; from the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59147:185"/>
Brimstone its nourishment and flame, that is to say, Light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from the Niter the vehemence of both. Now if a piece of Niter, (before it is beaten) be laid upon a burning Cole, first it melts, and like water quencheth that part of the Cole it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Then Vapor or Aire flying out where the Cole and Niter joyne, bloweth the Cole with great swiftnesse and vehemence on all sides. And from hence it comes to passe, that by two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions (the one, of the particles which go out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cole, the other, of those of the aethereall and watery substance of the Niter) is generated that vehement Motion and Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And lastly, when there is no more action from the Niter (that is to say, when the volatile parts of the Niter are flown out) there is found about the sides a certain white substance, which being thrown again into the fire, will grow red hot again, but will not be dissipated, at least, unlesse the fire be augmented. If now a possible cause of this be found out, the same will also be a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause why a grain of Gunpowder set on fire doth expand it selfe with such vehement motion, and Shine. And it may be caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Let the particles of which Niter consisteth, be supposed to be some of them hard, others watery, and the rest aethereall. Also let the hard particles be supposed to be spherically hollow, like small bubbles, so that many of them growing together may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Body whose little cavernes are filled with a substance which is either watery, or aethereal, or both. As soon therefore as the hard particles are dissipated, the watery and aethereal particles will necessarily fly out; and as they fly, of necessity blow strongly the burning Coles and Brimstone which are mingled together; whereupon there will follow a great expansion of Light, with vehement flame, and a violent dissipation of the particles of the Niter, the Brimstone and the Coles. Wherefore I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a possible cause of the force of fired Gunpowder.</p>
               <p>It is manifest from hence, that for the rendering of the cause why a bullet of lead or iron shot from a peece of Ordnance flies with so great velocity, there is no necessity to introduce such Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as (by the common definition of it) makes the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have sometimes more, sometimes lesse Quantity; which is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59147:185"/>
unconceiveable. For every thing is said to be greater or lesse, as it hath more or lesse Quantity. The violence with which a bullet is thrust out of a Gun, proceeds from the swiftnesse of the small particles of the fired Powder; at least it may proceed from that cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the supposition of any Empty Space.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Besides, by the attrition or rubbing of one Body against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as of Wood against Wood, we find that not only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degree of Heat, but Fire it selfe is sometimes generated. For such motion, is the reciprocation of pressure, sometimes one way sometimes the other; and by this reciprocation, whatsoever is fluid in both the peeces of Wood, is forced hither and thither; and consequently, to an endeavour of getting out; and at last by breaking out makes Fire.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Now Light is distinguished into, First, Second, Third, and so on infinitely. And we call that First Light, which is in the first Lucid Bodie; as the Sunne, Fire, &amp;c. Second, that which is in such Bodies as being not transparent are illuminated by the Sunne; as the Moon, a Wall, &amp;c. and Third, that which is in Bodies not transparent but illuminated by Second Light, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Colour</hi> is Light, but troubled Light; namely, such as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by perturbed motion; as shall be made manifest by the Red, Yellow, Blew and Purple which are generated by the interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Diaphanous Prisma</hi> (whose opposite bases are triangular) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Light and that which is enlightened.</p>
               <p>For let there be a Prisma of Glasse, or of any other transparent matter which is of greater density then Aire; and let the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle ABC be the base of this <hi>Prisma.</hi> Also let the straight line DE be the diameter of the Sunnes Body, having oblique po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the straight line AB; and let the Sunne-beames passe in the lines DA and EBC. And lastly let the straight lines DA and EC be produced indefinitely to F and G. Seeing therefore the straight line DA, by reason of the density of the Glasse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted towards the perpendicular; let the line refracted at the point A be the straight line AH. And againe, seeing the Medium below AC is thinner then that above it, the other refraction which will be made there, will diverge from the perpendicular. Let therefore this second refracted line be AI. Also let the same
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59147:186"/>
be done at the point C, by making the first refracted line to be CK, and the second CL. Seeing therefore the cause of the refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the point A of the straight line of AB, is the excess of the resistance of the Medium in AB above the resistance of the Aire, there must of necessity be reaction from the point A towards the point B; and consequently the Medium at A within the triangle ABC, will have its motion troubled; that is to say, the straight motion in AF and AH, will be mixed with the transverse moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the same AF and AH, represented by the short transverse lines in the triangle AFH. Againe, seeing at the point A of the straight line AC, there is a second refraction from AH in AI, the motion of the Medium will againe be perturbed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the transverse reaction from A towards C, represented likewise by the short transverse lines in the triangle AHI. And in the same manner there is a double perturbation represented by the transverse lines in the triangles CGK and CKL. But as for the light between AI and CG, it will not be perturbed; because if there were in all the points of the straight lines AB and AC, the same action which is in the points A and C, then the plaine of the triangle CGK would be every where coincident with the plaine of the triangle AFH; by which meanes all would appear alike between A and C. Besides, it is to be observed, that all the reaction at A, tends towards the illuminated parts which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween A and C, and consequently perturbeth the First Light. And on the contrary, that all the reaction at C tends towards the parts without the triangle, or without the <hi>Prisma</hi> ABC, where there is none but Second Light; and that the triangle AFH shewes that perturbation of Light which is made in the Glasse it selfe; as the triangle AHI shewes that perturbation of Light which is made below the Glasse. In like manner, that CGK shewes the perturbation of Light within the Glasse; and CKL that which is below the Glasse. From whence there are four divers moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or four different illuminations or Colours; whose differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appear most manifestly to the Sense in a <hi>Prisma</hi> (whose base is an equilaterall triangle) when the Sunne-beames that passe through it are received upon a white paper. For the triangle AFH appears Red to the Sense; the triangle AHI Yellow; the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59147:186"/>
triangle CGK Green, and approaching to Blew; and lastly the triangle CKL appears Purple. It is therefore evident, that when weak but First Light passeth through a more resisting dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous Body, as Glasse, the beames which fall upon it tranversly, make Rednesse; and when the same First Light is stronger, as it is in the thinner Medium below the straight line AC, the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse beames make Yellownesse. Also when Second Light is strong, as it is in the triangle CGK (which is neerest to the First Light) the transverse beames make Greenesse; and when the same Second Light is weaker, as in the triangle CKL, they make a Purple colour.</p>
               <p n="14">14 From hence may be deduced a cause why the Moon and Starres appear bigger and redder neer the Horizon then in the Mid-heaven. For between the Eie and the apparent Horizon, there is more impure aire, such as is mingled with Watery and Earthy little Bodies, then is between the same Eie and the more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated part of Heaven. But Vision is made by Beames which constitute a Cone, whose base, if we look upon the Moon, is the Moons Face, and whose vertex is in the Eie; and therefore many beams from the Moon must needs fall upon little Bodies that are without the Visual Cone, and be by them reflected to the Eie. But these reflected beams tend all in lines which are transverse to the Visual Cone, and make at the Eie an angle which is greater then the angle of the Cone. Wherefore the Moon appeares greater in the Horizon, then when she is more elevated. And because those reflected beames go transversely, there will be generated (by the last article) Rednesse. A possible cause therefore is shewne, why the Moon, as also the Starres appear Greater and Redder in the Horizon, then in the midst of heaven. The same also may be the cause why the Sunne appears in the Horizon, Greater, and of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour more degenerating to Yellow, then when he is higher ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. For the reflection from the little Bodies between, and the transverse motion of the Medium are still the same. But the Light of the Sunne is much stronger then that of the Moon; and therefore (by the last article) his Splendor must needs by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation degenerate into Yellownesse.</p>
               <p>But for the generation of these four colours, it is not necessary
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59147:187"/>
that the figure of the Glass be a <hi>Prisma;</hi> for if it were Spherical it would doe the same. For in a Sphere the Sunne-beames are twice refracted and twice reflected. And this being observed by <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> and with all that a Rainebow never appeares but when it rains; as also, that the drops of raine have their figures almost Spherical; he hath shewne from thence the cause of the colours in the Rainbow; which therefore need not be repeated.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Whiteness</hi> is Light; but Light perturbed by the reflexions of many beams of Light comming to the Eye together within a little space. For if Glass, or any other <hi>Diaphanous</hi> Body be reduced to very small parts by contusion or concussion; every one of those parts (if the Beams of a lucid Body be from any one point of the same reflected to the Eye) will represent to the beholder an Idea or Image of the whole lucid Body, that is to say, a Phantasme of White. For the strongest Light is the most White; and therefore many such parts will make many such Images. Wherefore if those parts lie thick and close together, those many Images will appear confusedly, and will by reason of the confused Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a White Colour. So that from hence may be deduced a possible cause, why Glass beaten, that is, reduced to powder, looks White. Also why Water and Snow are White; they being nothing but a heap of very small <hi>Diaphanous</hi> Bodies, namely, of little Bubbles, from whose several convex Superficies, there are by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion made several confused Phantasmes of the whole lucid Body; that is to say, <hi>Whiteness.</hi> For the same reason, Salt and Nitre are White; as consisting of small Bubbles which contain within them Water and Aire; as is manifest in Nitre, from this, that being thrown into the fire, it violently blowes the same; which Salt also doth, but with less violence. But if a White Body be exposed, not to the Light of the Day, but to that of the Fire, or of a Candle, it will not at the first sight be easily judged whether it be White or Yellow; the cause whereof may be this, that the light of those things which burn and flame, is almost of a middle Colour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Whiteness and Yellowness.</p>
               <p n="16">16 As Whiteness is Light, so <hi>Blackness</hi> is the privation of Light, or Darkness. And from hence it is; First, that all Holes, from which no light can be reflected to the Eie, appear Black.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59147:187"/>
Secondly, that when a Body hath little eminent particles erected straight up from the Superficies (so that the Beams of Light which fall upon them are reflected, not to the Eie, but to the Body it self) that Superficies appears Black, in the same manner as the Sea appears Black, when ruffled by the Wind. Thirdly, that any combustible matter is by the fire made to look Black before it shines. For the endeavour of the fire being to dissipate the smallest parts of such Bodies as are thrown into it, it must first raise and erect those parts, before it can work their dissipation. If therefore the fire be put out before the parts be totally dissipated, the Cole will appear Black; for the parts being onely erected, the Beams of Light falling upon them will not be reflected to the Eie, but to the Cole it self. Fourthly, that Burning Glasses do more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily burn Black things then White. For in a White Superficies, the eminent parts are convex, like little bubbles; and therefore the Beams of Light which fall upon them are reflected every way from the reflecting Body. But in a Black Superficies, where the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent particles are more erected, the Beams of Light falling upon them, are all necessarily reflected towards the Body it self; and therefore Bodies that are Black are more easily set on fire by the Sun-beams, then those that are White. Fifthly, that all Colours that are made of the mixture of White and Black, proceed from the different position of the particles that rise above the Superficies, and their different forms of asperity. For according to these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, more or fewer Beams of Light are reflected from several Bodies to the Eie. But in regard those differences are innumerable, and the Bodies themselves so small, that we cannot perceive them, the explication and precise determination of the Causes of all Colours is a thing of so great difficulty, that I dare not undertake it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S, when the motion of the ambient aethereal substance makes the Spirits and fluid parts of our Bodies tend outwards, we acknowledge Heat; so, by the endeavour inwards of the same spirits and humours, we feel Cold. So that to <hi>Cool,</hi> is to make the exterior parts of the Body endeavour inwards, by a motion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of <hi>Calefaction,</hi> by which the internal parts are called out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59147:189"/>
He therefore that would know the cause of Cold must find by what motion or motions, the exterior parts of any Body endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to retire inwards. To begin with those <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which are the most familiar; There is almost no man but knows, that breath blown strongly, and which comes from the mouth with violence, that is to say, the passage being straight, will Cool the hand; and that the same breath blown gently, that is to say, through a greater aperture, wil warm the same The cause of which <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> may be this. The breath going out, hath two motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; the one, of the whole and direct, by which the formost parts of the hand are driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the other, simple motion of the small particles of the same breath, which (as I have shewn in the 3d Article of the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) causeth Heat. According therefore as either of these Motions is predominant, so there is the sense sometimes of Cold, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Heat. Wherefore, when the breath is softly breathed out at a large passage, that simple Motion which causeth Heat prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and consequently Heat is felt; and when by compressing the lips the breath is more strongly blown out, then is the direct moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevalent, which makes us feel Cold. For the direct motion of the breath or aire, is Wind; and all Wind Cools, or diminisheth former heat.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And seeing not onely great Wind, but almost any Ventilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and stirring of the Aire, doth refrigerate; the reason of many experiments concerning Cold cannot well be given, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first what are the causes of Wind. Now Wind is nothing else but the direct motion of the Aire thrust forwards; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, when many Winds concurre may be circular, or otherwise indirect, as it is in Whirle-winds. Wherefore in the first place we are to enquire into the Causes of Winds. <hi>Wind</hi> is Aire moved in a considerable quantity, and that either in the manner of Waves, which is both forwards &amp; also up &amp; down; or else forwards onely.</p>
               <p>Supposing therefore the Aire both cleer and calm, for any time how little soever; yet the greater Bodies of the World, being so disposed and ordered as has been said, it will be necessary that a Wind presently arise some where. For seeing that motion of the parts of the Aire which is made by the Simple Motion of the Sunne in his own Epicycle, causeth an exhalation of the particles
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59147:189"/>
of water from the Seas and all other moist Bodies, and those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles make Clouds; it must needs follow, that whilest the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of water pass upwards, the particles of Aire (for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Spaces full) be justled out on every side, and urge the next particles, and these the next, till having made their circuit, there comes continually so much Aire to the hinder parts of the Earth, as there went water from before it. Wherefore the ascending Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours move the Aire towards the sides every way; and all direct motion of the Aire being Wind, they make a Wind. And if this Wind meet often with other Vapours which arise in other places, it is manifest that the force thereof will be augmented, &amp; the way or course of it changed. Besides, according as the Earth by its diurnal motion turns sometimes the drier, sometimes the moister part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sunne, so sometimes a greater, sometimes a less quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Vapours will be raised, that is to say, sometimes there will be a less, sometimes a greater Wind. Wherefore I have rendred a possible cause of such Winds, as are generated by Vapours; and also of their Inconstancy.</p>
               <p>From hence it follows, that these Winds cannot be made in any place which is higher then that to which Vapours may ascend. Nor is that incredible which is reported of the highest Mountains, as the <hi>Pique of Tenariffe</hi> and the <hi>Andes of Peru,</hi> namely, that they are not at all troubled with these inconstant Winds. And if it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that neither Rain nor Snow were ever seen in the highest tops of those Mountains, it could not be doubted but that they are higher then any place to which Vapours use to ascend.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Nevertheless, there may be Wind there, though not that which is made by the ascent of Vapours, yet a less &amp; more constant Wind (like the continued blast of a pair of bellows) blowing from the East. And this may have a double cause; the one, the diurnal mo tion of the Earth; the other, its simple motion in its own Epicycle. For these Mountains being (by reason of their height) more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then all the rest of the parts of the Earth, do by both these Motions drive the Aire from the West Eastwards. To which though the diurnal Motion contribute but little; yet seeing I have supposed that the simple Motion of the Earth in its own Epicycle, makes two revolutions in the same time in which the diurnal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59147:190"/>
makes but one; and that the Semidiameter of the Epicycle is double to the Semidiameter of the diurnal Conversion, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every point of the Earth in its own Epicycle will have its velocity quadruple to that of the diurnal Motion; so that by both these Motions together, the tops of those Hils will sensibly be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the Aire; and consequently a Wind will be felt. For whether the Air strike the Sentient, or the Sentient the Air, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Motion will be the same. But this Wind, seeing it is not caused by the ascent of Vapours, must necessarily be very Constant.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When one Cloud is already ascended into the Aire, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cloud ascend towards it, that part of the Aire which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted between them both, must of necessity be pressed out every way. Also when both of them, whilest the one ascends, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either stayes, or descends, come to be joyned in such manner as that the aethereal substance be shut within them on every side, it will by this compression also go out by penetrating the Water. But in the mean time, the hard particles which are mingled with the Aire, and are agitated (as I have supposed) with Simple Motion, wil not pass through the water of the clouds, but be more straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compressed within their cavities. And this I have demonstrated at the 4th and 5th Articles of the 22th Chapter. Besides, seeing the Globe of the Earth floateth in the Aire which is agitated by the Sunnes Motion, the parts of the Aire resisted by the Earth, will spread themselves every way upon the Earths Superficies; as I have shewn at the 8th Article of the 21th Chapter.</p>
               <p n="5">5 We perceive a Body to be Hard, from this, that when touching it we would thrust forwards that part of the same which we touch, we cannot do it otherwise then by thrusting forwards the whole Body. We may indeed easily and sensibly thrust forwards any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Aire or Water which we touch, whilst yet the rest of its parts remain (to sense) unmoved. But we cannot do so to any part of a stone. Wherfore I define a <hi>Hard</hi> Body to be that, whereof no part can be sensibly moved, unless the whole be moved. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore is Soft or Fluid, the same can never be made Hard but by such motion, as makes many of the parts together stop the motion of some one part, by resisting the same.</p>
               <p n="6">6 These things premised, I shall shew a possible cause why there
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59147:190"/>
is greater Cold neer the Poles of the Earth, then further from them. The motion of the Sunne between the Tropicks, driving the Aire towards that part of the Earths Superficies which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly under it, makes it spread it self every way; and the velocity of this expansion of the Aire grows greater and greater, as the Superficies of the Earth comes to be more and more straightned, that is to say, as the Circles which are parallel to the Aequator come to be less and less. Wherefore this expansive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Aire, drives before it the parts of the Aire which are in its way continually towards the Poles more and more strongly, as its force comes to be more and more united, that is to say, as the Circles which are parallel to the Aequator are less and less; that is, so much the more, by how much they are neerer to the Poles of the Earth. In those places therefore which are neerer to the Poles, there is greater Cold, then in those which are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from them. Now this expansion of the Aire upon the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth from East to West, doth by reason of the Sunnes perpetual accession to the places which are successively under it, make it Cold at the time of the Sunnes Rising and Setting; but as the Sunne comes to be continually more and more perpendicular to those cooled places, so by the Heat which is generated by the supervening Simple Motion of the Sunn, that Cold is again remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and can never be great, because the action by the which it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, is not permanent. Wherefore I have rendred a possible cause of Cold in those places that are neer the Poles, or where the obliquity of the Sunne is great.</p>
               <p n="7">7 How Water may be congeled by Cold, may be explained in this manner. Let A (in the first figure) represent the Sunne, and B the Earth. A will therefore be much greater then B. Let EF be in the plain of the Equinoctial; to which let GH, IK and LC be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. Lastly, let C and D be the Poles of the Earth. The Aire therefore by its action in those parallels will rake the Superficies of the Earth; and that with motion so much the stronger, by how much the parallel Circles towards the Poles grow less and less. From whence must arise a Wind, which will force together the uppermost parts of the water, and withal raise them a little, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their endeavour towards the Center of the Earth. And from
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59147:191"/>
their endeavour towards the center of the Earth, joyned with the endeavour of the said Wind, the uppermost parts of the water will be pressed together, and coagulated, that is to say, the top of the water will be skinned over and hardned. And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Water next the top will be hardned in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till at length the Ice be thick. And this Ice being now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of little hard Bodies, must also containe many particles of ayre received into it.</p>
               <p>As Rivers and Seas, so also in the same manner may the Clouds be frozen. For when by the ascending and descending of severall Clouds at the same time, the Air intercepted between them is by compression forced out, it rakes, &amp; by little &amp; little hardens them. And though those smal drops (which usually make Clouds) be not yet united into greater Bodies, yet the same Wind will be made; &amp; by it, as water is congeled into Ice, so will Vapours in the same manner be congeled into Snow. From the same cause it is that Ice may be made by art, and that not farre from the fire. For it is done by the mingling of Snow and Salt together, and by burying in it a small vessell full of Water. Now while the Snow and Salt (which have in them a great deale of aire) are melting, the aire which is pressed out every way in Wind, rakes the sides of the Vessel; and as the Wind by its motion rakes the Vessell, so the Vessell by the same motion and action congeles the Water within it.</p>
               <p>We find by experience, that Cold is allwayes more Remisse in places where it raynes, or where the weather is cloudy (things being alike in all other respects) then where the aire is cleare. And this agreeth very well with what I have sayd before. For in cleare weather, the course of the Wind which (as I sayd even now) rakes the Superficies of the Earth, as it is free from all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, so also it is very strong. But when small drops of water are either rising or falling, that Wind is repelled, broken and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by them; and the lesse the Wind is, the lesse is the Cold.</p>
               <p>We find also by experience, that in deep Wells the Water freezeth not so much, as it doth upon the Superficies of the Earth. For the Wind by which Ice is made, entring into the Earth (by reason of the laxity of its parts) more or lesse, loseth some of its
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59147:191"/>
force, though not much. So that if the Well be not deep, it will freeze; whereas if it be so deep, as that the Wind which causeth cold cannot reach it, it will not freeze.</p>
               <p>We find moreover by experience, that Ice is lighter then Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The cause whereof is manifest from that which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn, namely, that Aire is received in and mingled with the particles of the Water whilest it is in congeling.</p>
               <p n="8">8 We have seen one way of making things Hard, namely, by Congelation. Another way is thus. Having already supposed, that innumerable Atomes, some harder then others, and that have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral simple motions of their own, are intermingled with the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal substance; it follows necessarily from hence, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fermentation of the whole Aire (of which I have spoken in the 21 Chap.) some of those Atomes meeting with others, will cleave together, by applying themselvs to one another in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is agreeable to their motions and mutual contacts; and (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi>) cannot be pulled asunder, but by so much force as is sufficient to overcome their Hardness.</p>
               <p>Now there are innumerable degrees of Hardness. As (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) there is a degree of it in Water, as is manifest from this, that upon a plain it may be drawn any way at pleasure by ones finger. There is a greater degree of it in clammy liquors; which when they are poured out, doe in falling downwards dispose themselves into one continued thred; which thred before it be broken will by little and little diminish its thickness, till at last it be so small, as that it seems to break onely in a point; and in their separation the external parts break first from one another, and then the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts successively one after another. In Wax there is yet a greater degree of Hardness. For when we would pull one part of it from another, we first make the whole mass slenderer, before we can pull it asunder. And how much the harder anything is which we would break, so much the more force we must apply to it. Wherefore, if we go on to harder things, as Ropes, Wood, Metals, Stones, &amp;c. reason prompteth us to believe that the same (though not alwayes sensibly) will necessarily happen; and that even the hardest things are broken asunder in the same manner, namely, by Solution of their continuity, begun in the outermost Superficies,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59147:192"/>
and proceeding successively to the innermost parts. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when the parts of Bodies are to be separated, not by pulling them asunder, but by breaking them, the first separation will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be in the convex Superficies of the bowed part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and afterwards in the concave Superficies. For in all bowing, there is in the convex Superficies an endeavour in the parts to go one from another, and in the concave Superficies to penetrate one another.</p>
               <p>This being well understood, a reason may be given, how two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are contiguous in one common Superficies, may by force be separated without the introduction of <hi>Vacuum;</hi> though <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> thought otherwise, believing that such separation was a strong establishment of <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For a Marble Pillar being made to hang by one of its bases, if it be long enough it will by its own weight be broken asunder, and yet it will not necessarily follow that there should be <hi>Vacuum,</hi> seeing the solution of its continuity may begin in the Circumference, and proceed successively to the midst thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Wine is not so easily congeled as Water, because in Wine there are particles which being not fluid, are moved very swiftly, and by their motion congelation is retarded; but if the Cold prevail against this motion, then the outermost parts of the Wine will be first frozen, and afterwards the inner parts; whereof this is a signe, that the Wine which remains unfrozen in the midst will be very strong.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Another cause of Hardness in some things may be in this manner. If a soft Body consist of many hard particles, which by the intermixture of many other fluid particles cohaere but loosely together, those fluid parts (as hath been shewn in the last Article of the 21 Chapter) will be exhaled; by which means each hard particle will apply it self to the next to it according to a greater Superficies; and consequently they will cohaere more closely to one another; that is to say, the whole mass will be made Harder.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Again, in some things Hardness may be made to a certain degree, in this manner. When any fluid substance hath in it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very small Bodies intermingled, which being moved with simple motion of their own, contribute like motion to the parts of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59147:192"/>
fluid substance, and this be done in a small enclosed space (as in the hollow of a little Sphere, or a very slender Pipe) if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be vehement, and there be a great number of these small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed Bodies, two things will happen; the one, that the fluid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will have an endeavour of dilating it self at once every way; the other, that if those smal Bodies can no where get out, then from their reflexion it will follow, that the motion of the parts of the enclosed fluid substance, which was vehement before, will now be much more vehement. Wherefore if any one particle of that fluid substance should be touched &amp; pressed by some external Movent, it could not yeild but by the application of very sensible force. Wherefore the fluid substance which is enclosed, and so moved, hath some degree of Hardness. Now greater and less degree of Hardness depends upon the quantity and velocity of those small Bodies and upon the narrowness of the place both together.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Such things as are made Hard by sudden heat, namely, such as are hardned by fire, are commonly reduced to their former soft form by Maceration. For fire hardens by Evaporation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the evaporated moisture be restored again, the former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and form is restored together with it. And such things as are frozen with Cold, if the Wind by which they were frozen change into the opposite quarter, they will be unfrozen again (unless they have gotten a habit of new motion or endeavour by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that hardness). Nor is it enough to cause thawing, that there be a cessation of the freezing Wind (for the taking away of the Cause doth not destroy a produced effect); but the thawing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must have its proper cause, namely, a contrary Wind, or at least a Wind opposite in some degree. And this we finde to be true by experience. For if Ice be laid in a place so well enclosed that the motion of the Aire cannot get to it, that Ice will remain unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though the place be not sensibly cold.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Of Hard Bodies, some may manifestly be bowed; others not, but are broken in the very first moment of their bending. And of such Bodies as may manifestly be bended, some being bent, do as soon as ever they are set at liberty, Restore themselves to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer posture, others remain still bent. Now if the cause of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution be asked, I say it may be in this manner; namely, that the particles of the bended Body, whilest it is held bent, do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59147:193"/>
retain their motion; and by this motion they restore it as soon as the force is removed by which it was bent. For when any thing is bent (as a plate of steel), and as soon as the force is removed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores it self again, it is evident that the cause of its restitution cannot be referred to the ambient aire; nor can it be referred to the removal of the force by which it was bent; for in things that are at rest, the taking away of impediments, is not a sufficient cause of their future Motion; there being no other cause of Motion, but Motion. The cause therefore of such Restitution is in the parts of the Steel it self. Wherefore whilest it remains bent, there is in the parts of which it consisteth, some motion, though invisible, that is to say, some endeavour at least that way by which the restitution is to be made; and therefore this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all the parts together is the first beginning of Restitution; so that the impediment being removed, that is to say, the force by which it was held bent, it will be restored again. Now the motion of the parts by which this is done, is that which I called Simple Motion, or Motion returning into it self. When therefore in the bending of a plate, the ends are drawn together, there is on one side a mutual compression of the parts; which compression is one endeavour opposite to another endeavour; and on the other side a divulsion of the parts. The endeavour therefore of the parts on one side tends to the restitution of the plate from the middle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ends; and on the other side, from the ends towards the middle. Wherefore the impediment being taken away, this endeavour (which is the beginning of restitution) will restore the plate to its former posture. And thus I have given a possible cause why some Bodies when they are bent Restore themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; which was to be done.</p>
               <p>As for Stones, seeing they are made by the accretion of many very hard particles within the Earth; which particles have no great coherence, that is to say, touch one another in small latitude, and consequently admit many particles of aire, it must needs be that in bending of them, their internal parts will not easily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by reason of their hardness. And because their coherence is not firm, as soon as the external hard particles are disjoyned, the aethereal parts will necessarily break out, and so the Body will sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be broken.</p>

                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:59147:193"/>13 Those Bodies are called <hi>Diaphanous,</hi> upon which whilest the Beams of a lucid Body do work, the action of every one of those Beams is propagated in them in such manner as that they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the same order amongst themselves, or the inversion of that order; and therefore Bodies which are perfectly Diaphanous, are also perfectly homogeneous. On the contrary, an <hi>Opacous</hi> Body is that, which by reason of its heterogeneous nature, doth by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable reflexions and refractions in particles of different figures and unequal hardness, weaken the Beams that fall upon it before they reach the Eie. And of Diaphanous Bodies, some are made such by Nature from the beginning; as the substance of the Aire, and of the Water, and perhaps also some parts of Stones, unless these also be Water that has been long congeled. Others are made so by the power of Heat, which congregates homogeneons Bodies. But such as are made Diaphanous in this manner, consist of parts which were formerly Diaphanous.</p>
               <p n="14">14 In what manner Clouds are made by the motion of the Sunne, elevating the particles of Water from the Sea and other moist places, hath been explained in the 26th Chapter. Also how Clouds come to be frozen, hath been shewn above at the 7th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Now from this, that Aire may be enclosed, as it were in Caverns, and pent together more and more by the meeting of ascending and descending Clouds, may be deduced a possible Cause of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightening.</hi> For seeing the Aire consists of two parts, the one Aethereal, which has no proper motion of its own, as being a thing divisible into the least parts; the other Hard, namely, consisting of many hard Atomes which have every one of them a very swift simple motion of its own; whilest the Clouds by their meeting do more and more straighten such Cavities as they intercept, the Aethereal parts will penetrate and pass through their watry substance; but the hard parts will in the mean time be the more thrust together, and press one another; and consequently (by reason of their vehement motions) they will have an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rebound from each other. Whensoever therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is great enough, and the concave parts of the Clouds are (for the cause I have already given) congeled into Ice, the Cloud wil necessarily be broken; &amp; this breaking of the Cloud produceth
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59147:194"/>
the first clap of Thunder. Afterwards, the Aire which was pent in, having now broken through, makes a concussion of the Aire without; and from hence proceeds the roaring and murmur which follows; and both the first Clap and the Murmur that follows it, make that noise which is called <hi>Thunder.</hi> Also from the same Aire breaking through the Clouds, and with concussion falling upon the Eie, proceeds that action upon our Eie, which causeth in us a perception of that Light which we call <hi>Lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Wherefore I have given a possible cause of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 But if the Vapours which are raised into Clouds, do run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again into Water, or be congeled into Ice, from whence is it (seeing both Ice and Water are heavy) that they are sustained in the Aire? Or rather, what may the cause be, that being once elevated, they fall down again? For there is no doubt but the same force which could carry up that Water, could also sustain it there. Why therefore being once carried up, doth it fall again? I say it proceeds from the same Simple Motion of the Sunne, both that Vapours are forced to ascend, and that Water gathered into Clouds is forced to descend. For in the 21th Chapter and 11th Article I have shewn how Vapours are elevated; and in the same Chapter and 5th Article I have also shewn how by the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Homogeneous Bodies are congregated, &amp; Heterogeneous dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated; that is to say, how such things as have a like nature to that of the Earth, are driven towards the Earth; that is to say, what is the cause of the descent of Heavy Bodies. Now if the action of the Sun be hindered in the raising of vapours, and be not at all hindered in the casting of them down, the Water will descend. But a Cloud cannot hinder the action of the Sunne in making things of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature descend to the Earth, though it may hinder it in making Vapours ascend For the lower part of a thick Cloud is so covered by its upper part, as that it cannot receive that action of the Sunne by which Vapours are carried up, because Vapours are raised by the perpetual fermentation of the Aire, or by the separating of its smallest parts from one another, which is much weaker when a thick Cloud is interposed, then when the Skie is cleere. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whensoever a Cloud is made thick enough, the water which
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59147:194"/>
would not descend before, will then descend, unless it be kept up by the agitation of the Winde. Wherefore I have rendred a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause, both why the Clouds may be sustained in the Aire, and also why they may fall down again to the Earth; which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be done.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Granting that the Clouds may be frozen, it is no wonder if the Moon have been seen eclipsed at such time as she hath been almost two degrees above the Horizon, the Sunne at the same time appearing in the Horizon; for such an Eclipse was observed by <hi>Mestline</hi> at <hi>Tubing</hi> in the year 1590. For it might happen that a frozen Cloud was then interposed between the Sunne and the Eie of the Observer. And if it were so, the Sunne which was then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two Degrees below the Horizon, might appear to be in it, by reason of the passing of his Beams through the Ice. And it is to be noted, that those that attribute such refractions to the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> cannot attribute to it so great a refraction as this. Wherefore not the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> but either Water in a continued Body, or else Ice must be the cause of that refraction.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Again, granting that there may be Ice in the Clouds, it will be no longer a wonder that many Sunnes have sometimes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once. For Looking-glasses may be so placed, as by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to shew the same object in many places. And may not so many frozen Clouds serve for so many Looking-glasses? and may they not be fitly disposed for that purpose? Besides, the number of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances may be encreased by refractions also; and therefore it would be a greater wonder to me, if such <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as these should never happen.</p>
               <p>And were it not for that one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the new Starre which was seen in <hi>Cassiopaea,</hi> I should think <hi>Comets</hi> were made in the same manner, namely, by Vapours drawn not onely from the Earth, but from the rest of the Planets also, and congeled into one continued Body. For I could very well from hence give a reason both of their Haire, and of their motions. But seeing that Starre remained sixteen whole moneths in the same place amongst the fixed Starres, I cannot believe the matter of it was Ice. Wherefore I leave to others, the disquisition of the cause of Comets; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, nothing that hath hitherto been published, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

the bare Histories of them) is worth considering.</p>
               <p n="18">18 The Heads of Rivers may be deduced from Rain-water, or from melted Snowes, very easily; but from other causes, very hardly, or not at all. For both Rain-water, and melted Snowes run down the descents of Mountains; and if they descend onely by the outward Superficies, the Showres or Snowes themselves may be accounted the Springs or Fountains; but if they enter the Earth &amp; descend within it, then wheresoever they break out, there are their Springs. And as these Spings make small streams, so, many small streams running together make Rivers. Now there was never any Spring fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but where the Water w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> flowed to it, was either fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at least as farre from the center of the Earth, as the Spring it self. And whereas it has bin objected by a great Philosopher, that in the top of <hi>Mount-Cenis</hi> (which parts Savoy from Piemont) there Springs a River which runs down by <hi>Susa;</hi> it is not true. For there are above that River, for two miles length, very high hils on both sides, which are almost perpetually covered with Snow; from which, innumerable little streams running down do manifestly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that River with water sufficient for its magnitude.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OUND <hi>is Sense generated by the action of the Medium, when its motion reacheth the Eare and the rest of the Organs of Sense.</hi> Now the motion of the Medium is not the Sound it self, but the cause of it. For the Phantasme which is made in us, that is to say, the Reaction of the Organ is properly that which we call <hi>Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal distinctions of Sounds are these; First, that one Sound is stronger, another Weaker. Secondly, that one is more Grave, another more Acute. Thirdly, that one is Clear, another Hoarse. Fourthly, that one is Primary, another Derivative. Fifthly, that one is Uniform, another not. Sixthly, that one is more Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, another less Durable. Of all which distinctions the members may be subdistinguished into parts distinguishable almost infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the variety of Sounds seems to be not much less then that of Colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:59147:197"/>As Vision, so Hearing is generated by the motion of the Medium, but not in the same manner. For Sight is from Pressure, that is, from an Endeavour; in which there is no perceptible progression of any of the parts of the Medium; but one part urging or thrusting on an other, propagateth that action successively to any distance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; whereas the motion of the Medium by which Sound is made, is a Stroke. For when we Hear, the Drumme of the Eare (which is the first Organ of Hearing) is stricken; and the Drumme being stricken, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is also shaken, and with it the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are inserted into it; by which the action being propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the Heart it self, by the reaction of the Heart a Phantasm is made which we call Sound; and (because the reaction tendeth outwards) we think it is without.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And seeing the effects produced by Motion, are greater or lesse, not onely when the Velocity is greater or less, but also when the Body hath greater or less Magnitude though the Velocity be the same; a Sound may be greater or lesse both these wayes. And because neither the greatest nor the least Magnitude or Velocity can be given, it may happen, that either the motion may be of so small velocity, or the Body it self of so small magnitude, as to produce no Sound at all; or either of them may be so great, as to take away the Faculty of Sense by hurting the Organ.</p>
               <p>From hence may be deduced possible causes of the strength and weakness of Sounds in the following <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first whereof is this, That if a man speak through a Trunk which hath on end applyed to the mouth of the Speaker, and the other to the eare of the Hearer, the Sound will come stronger then it would do through the open Aire. And the cause (not onley the possible, but the certain and manifest cause) is this, that the Aire which is moved by the first breath, and carried forwards in the Trunk, is not diffused, as it would be in the open Aire, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently brought to the eare almost with the same velocity with which it was first breathed out; Whereas in the open Aire, the first motion diffuseth it self every way into Circles, such as are made by the throwing of a Stone into a standing water, where the velocity grows less and less as the Undulation proceeds further and further from the beginning of its motion.</p>
               <p>The second is this, That if the Trunk be short, and the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59147:197"/>
end which is applyed to the mouth be wider then that which is applyed to the eare, thus also the Sound will be stronger then if it were made in the open aire. And the cause is the same, namely, that by how much the wider end of the Trunk is less distant from the beginning of the Sound, by so much the less is the diffusion.</p>
               <p>The third, That it is easier for one that is within a Chamber, to heare what is spoken without, then for him that stands without, to hear what is spoken within. For the Windows and other inlets of the moved Aire, are as the wide end of the Trunk. And for this reason some creatures seem to hear the better, because Nature has bestowed upon them wide and capacious Ears.</p>
               <p>The fourth is this, That though he which standeth upon the Sea shore, cannot heare the Collision of the two neerest waves, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthess he hears the roaring of the whole Sea. And the cause seems to be this, that though the several collisions move the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, yet they are not severally great enough to cause Sense; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nothing hinders but that all of them together may make Sound.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That Bodies when they are stricken do yeild some a more Grave, others a more Acute Sound, the cause may consist in the difference of the times in which the parts stricken and forced out of their places, return to the same places again. For in some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the restitution of the moved parts is quick, in others slow. And this also may be the cause why the parts of the Organ which are moved by the Medium, return to their rest again, sometimes sooner, sometimes later. Now by how much the Vibrations, or the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motions of the parts are more frequent, by so much doth the whole Sound made (at the same time) by one stroke, consist of more, and consequently of smaller parts. For what is Acute in Sound, the same is Subtle in Matter; and both of them, namely, Acute Sound, and Subtle Matter consist of very small parts, that of Time, and this of the Matter it self.</p>
               <p>The third distinction of Sounds cannot be conceived clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by the names I have used of <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Hoarse,</hi> nor by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I know; and therefore it is needful to explain them by examples. When I say <hi>Hoarse,</hi> I understand Whispering and His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and whatsoever is like to these, by what appellation soever it be expressed. And Sounds of this kind seem to be made by the force of some strong Wind, raking rather then striking such hard
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59147:198"/>
Bodies, as it falls upon. On the contrary, when I use the word <hi>Clear,</hi> I do not understand such a Sound as may be easily and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly heard, for so Whispers would be Clear, but such as is made by somewhat that is Broken; and such as is Clamor, Tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Sound of a Trumpet, &amp;c. and (to express it significantly in one word), Noise. And seeing no Sound is made but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of two Bodies at the least, by which concourse it is necessary that there be as well Reaction as Action, that is to say, one motion opposite to another; it follows, that according as the proportion between those two opposite motions is diversified, so the Sounds which are made will be different from one another. And whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the proportion between them is so great, as that the motion of one of the Bodies be insensible if compared with the motion of the other, then the Sound will not be of the same kind; as when the Wind falls very obliquely upon a hard Body, or when a hard Body is carried swiftly through the Aire; for then there is made that Sound which I call a Hoarse Sound, in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Therefore the breath blown with violence from the mouth makes a Hissing, because in going out it rakes the Superficies of the Lips, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action against the force of the breath is not Sensible. And this is the cause why the Winds have that Hoarse Sound. Also if two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies how hard soever, be rubbed together with no great pressure, they make a Hoarse Sound. And this Hoarse Sound when it is made (as I have said) by the Aire raking the Superficies of a hard Body, seemeth to be nothing but the dividing of the Aire into innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and very small Files. For the asperity of the Superficies doth by the eminencies of its innumerable parts divide or cut in pieces the Aire that slides upon it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Noise,</hi> or that which I call Clear Sound, is made two wayes; one, by two Hoarse Sounds, made by opposite motions; the other, by Collision, or by the suddain pulling asunder of two Bodies, whereby their small particles are put into commotion, or being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in commotion, suddenly restore themselves again; which motion making impression upon the Medium, is propagated to the Organ of Hearing. And seeing there is in this Collision, or divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, an endeavour in the particles of one Body, opposite to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the particles of the other Body, there will also be made in the Organ of Hearing a like opposition of endeavours, that is to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59147:198"/>
say, of motions; and consequently the Sound arising from thence, will be made by two opposite motions, that is to say, by two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Hoarse Sounds in one and the same part of the Organ. For (as I have already said) a Hoarse Sound supposeth the sensible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of but one of the Bodies. And this opposition of motions in the Organ is the cause why two Bodies make a Noyse, when they are either suddenly stricken against one another, or suddenly broken asunder.</p>
               <p n="5">5 This being granted; and seeing withall, that Thunder is made by the vehement eruption of the Aire out of the cavities of congeled Clouds; the cause of the great Noyse or Clap, may be the suddain breaking asunder of the Ice. For in this action it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that there be not onely a great concussion of the small parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the broken parts, but also that this Concussion (by being communicated to the Aire) be carried to the Organ of Hearing, &amp; make impression upon it. And then, from the first reaction of the Organ proceeds that first and greatest Sound, which is made by the collision of the parts whilst they restore themselves. And seeing there is in all Concussion a reciprocation of Motion forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the parts stricken, (for opposite motions cannot extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish one another in an instant, as I have shewn in the 11th Art. of the 8th Chap.) it follows necessarily, that the Sound will both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and grow weaker and weaker, till at last the action of the reciprocating aire grow so weak, as to be unperceptible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a possible cause is given both of the first fierce Noyse of the Thunder; and also of the Murmur that follows it.</p>
               <p>The cause of the great Sound from a discharged piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is like that of a Clap of Thunder. For the Gunpowder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fired, doth in its endeavour to go out, attempt every way the sides of the metal in such manner, as that it enlargeth the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference all along, and withall shortneth the axis; so that whilest the peece of Ordnance is in discharging, it is made both wider and shorter then it was before; and therefore also presently after it is discharged its wideness will be diminished, and its length encreased again by the restitution of all the particles of the matter of which it consisteth to their former position. And this is done with such motion of the parts, as are not onely very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, but also opposite to one another; which motions
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59147:199"/>
being communicated to the Aire, make impression upon the Organ, and by the reaction of the Organ create a Sound; which lasteth for some time, as I have already shewn in this Article.</p>
               <p>I note by the way (as not belonging to this place) that the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause why a Gun recoyles when it is shot off, may be this; That being first swoln by the force of the fire, and afterwards restoring it self; from this restitution there proceeds an endeavour from all the sides towards the cavity; and consequently this endeavour is in those parts which are next the breech; which being not hollow, but solid, the effect of the restitution is by it hindered and diverted into the length; and by this means both the breech and the whole Gun is thrust backwards; and the more forcibly by how much the force is greater by which the part next the breech is restored to its former posture; that is to say, by how much the thiner is that part. The cause therefore why Gunnes recoyle, some more, some less, is the difference of their thickness towards the breech; &amp; the greater that thickness is, the less they recoyl; and contrarily.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Also the cause why the Sound of a Pipe, which is made by blowing into it, is nevertheless Clear, is the same with that of the Sound which is made by collision. For if the breath when it is blown into a Pipe doe onely rake its concave Superficies, or fall upon it with a very sharp angle of incidence, the Sound will not be Clear, but Hoarse. But if the angle be great enough, the percussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is made against one of the hollow sides, will be reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the opposite side; and so successive repercussions will be made from side to side, till at last the whole concave Superficies of the Pipe be put into motion; which motion will be reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it is in Collision; and this reciprocation being propagated to the Organ, from the reaction of the Organ will arise a Cleare Sound, such as is made by Collision, or by breaking asunder of hard Bodies.</p>
               <p>In the same manner it is with the Sound of a Mans voice. For when the breath passeth out, without interruption, and doth but lightly touch the cavities through which it is sent, the Sound it maketh is a Hoarse Sound. But if in going out it strike strongly upon the <hi>Larinx,</hi> then a Clear Sound is made, as in a Pipe. And the same breath, as it comes in divers manners to the Palate, the Tongue, the Lips, the Teeth, and other Organs of Speech, so the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59147:199"/>
Sounds into which it is articulated become different from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p n="7">7 I call that <hi>Primary Sound,</hi> which is generated by motion from the sounding Body to the Organ in a straight line without reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I call that <hi>Reflected Sound,</hi> which is generated by one or more reflexions; being the same with that we call <hi>Echo;</hi> and is ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as often as there are reflexions made from the Object to the Eare. And these reflexions are made by Hils, Wals, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Bodies, so placed, as that they make more or fewer reflexions of the motion, according as they are themselves more or fewer in number; and they make them more or less frequently, according as they are more or less distant from one another. Now the cause of both these things is to be sought for in the situation of the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Bodies, as is usually done in Sight. For the Lawes of Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are the same in both, namely, that the Angles of Incidence and Reflexion be equal to one another. If therefore in a hollow Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Body whose inside is well polished, or in two right Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Solids which are joyned together by one common base, there be placed a Sounding Body in one of the Burning Points, &amp; the Ear in the other, there will be heard a Sound by many degrees greater then in the open Aire; and both this, and the burning of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible things, as being put in the same places are set on fire by the Sun-beams, are effects of one and the same cause. But as when the visible Object is placed in one of the Burning Points, it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly seen in the other, because every part of the Object being seen in every line which is reflected from the Concave Superficies to the Eie, makes a confusion in the Sight; so neither is Sound heard articulately and distinctly when it comes to the Eare in all those reflected lines. And this may be the reason, why in Churches which have arched rooffs, though they be neither Elliptical nor Parabolical; yet because their figure is not much different from these, the voice from the Pulpit will not be heard so articulately as it would be if there were no vaulting at all.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Concerning the <hi>Uniformity</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of Sounds, both which have one common cause, we may observe, that such Bodies as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stricken yeild an unequal or harsh Sound, are very heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is to say, they consist of parts which are very unlike both in figure and hardness, such as are Wood, Stones, and others not a
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59147:200"/>
few. When these are stricken, there follows a concussion of their internal particles, and a restitution of them again. But they are neither moved alike, nor have they the same action upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; some of them recoyling from the stroke whilest others which have already finished their recoylings are now returning; by which means they hinder and stop on another. And from hence it is that their motions are not only unequal and harsh, but also that their reciprocations come to be quickly extinguished. Whensoever therfore this motion is propagated to the Eare, the Sound it makes is Unequal and of small Duration. On the contrary, if a Body that is stricken, be not onely sufficiently hard, but have also the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of which it consisteth like to one another both in hardness and figure, (such as are the particles of Glass and Metals, which being first melted do afterwards settle and harden) the Sound it yeildeth, will (because the motions of its parts and their recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are like and Uniform) be Uniform and pleasant, and be more or less Lasting according as the Body stricken hath gteater or less magnitude. The possible cause therefore of Sounds Uniform, and Harsh, and of their longer or shorter Duration, may be one and the same likeness and unlikeness of the internal parts of the Sounding Body, in respect both of their figure and hardness.</p>
               <p>Besides, if two plain Bodies of the same matter, and of equal thickness, do both yeild an Uniform Sound, the Sound of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which hath the greatest extent of length will be the longest heard. For the motion which in both of them hath its beginning from the point of percussion, is to be propagated in the greater Body through a greater Space, and consequently that propagation will require more time; and therefore also the parts which are moved will require more time for their return. Wherefore all the reciprocations cannot be finished but in longer time; and being carried to the Eare, will make the Sound last the longer. And from hence it is manifest, that of hard Bodies which yeild an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Sound, the Sound lasteth longer which comes from those that are round and hollow, then from those that are plain, if they be like in all other respects. For in circular lines the action which begins at any point, hath not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the figure any end of its propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the line in which it is propagated returns again to its beginning; so that the figure hinders not but that the motion may
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59147:200"/>
have infinite progression; whereas in a plain, every line hath its magnitude finite, beyond which the action cannot proceed. If therefore the matter be the same, the motion of the parts of that Body whose figure is round and hollow, wil last longer, then of that which is plain.</p>
               <p>Also, if a string which is stretched, be fastned at both ends to a hollow Body, and be stricken, the Sound will last longer then if it were not so fastned; because the trembling or reciprocation which it receives from the stroke, is by reason of the connexion commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the hollow Body; and this trembling, if the hollow Body be great, will last the longer by reason of that greatness. Wherefore also (for the reason above mentioned) the Sound will last the longer.</p>
               <p n="9">9 In Hearing, it happens (otherwise then in Seeing) that the action of the Medium is made stronger by the Wind when it blows the same way, and weaker when it blows the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way. The cause whereof cannot proceed from any thing but the different generation of Sound and Light. For in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Light, none of the parts of the Medium between the object and the Eie are moved from their own places to other places sensibly distant; but the action is propagated in spaces im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible; so that no contrary Wind can diminish, nor favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Winde encrease the Light, unless it be so strong as to remove the Object further off, or bring it nearer to the Eie. For the Wind, that is to say, the aire moved, doth not by its interposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the object and the eie, worke otherwise then it would doe if it were stil and calme. For where the pressure is perpetuall, one part of the aire is no sooner carried away, but another by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it receives the same impression which the part carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way had received before. But in the generation of Sound, the first collision or breaking asunder, beateth away &amp; driveth out of its place the nearest part of the aire, and that to a considerable distance, and with considerable velocity; and as the circles grow (by their remotenesse) wider and wider, so the aire being more &amp; more dissipated, hath also its motion more &amp; more weakned. Whensoever therfore the air is so stricken as to cause Sound, if the Wind fall upon it, it will move it all, neerer to the Eare if it blow that way, and further from it if it blow the contrary way; so that according
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59147:201"/>
as it blowes from or towards the Object, so the Sound which is heard will seeme to come from a neerer or remoter place; and the action by reason of the unequall distances be strengthened or debilitated.</p>
               <p>From hence may be understood the reason, why the voice of such as are said to speake in their bellies, though it be uttered neer hand, is neverthelesse heard by those that suspect nothing, as if it were a great way off. For having no former thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny determined place from which the voice should proceed, and judging according to the greatesse, if it be weake they thinke it a great way off, if strong neer. These <hi>Ventriloqui</hi> therefore by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their voice, not (as others) by the emission of their breath, but by drawing it inwards, doe make the same appear small and weake; which weaknesse of the voice deceives those that neither suspect the artifice, nor observe the endeavour which they use in speaking; and so instead of thinking it weake they thinke it farre off.</p>
               <p n="10">10 As for the Medium which conveighs Sound, it is not Aire onely. For Water, or any other Body how hard soever may be that Medium. For the Motion may be propagated perpetually in any hard continuous Body; but by reason of the difficulty with which the parts of hard Bodies are moved, the motion in going out of hard matter makes but a weak impression upon the Aire. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless if one end of a very long and hard beam be stricken, &amp; the eare be applyed at the same time to the other end, so that when the action goeth out of the beam, the aire which it striketh may immediately be received by the eare, and be carried to the <hi>Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the Sound will be considerably strong.</p>
               <p>In like manner, if in the night (when all other noyse, which may hinder Sound, ceaseth) a man lay his eare to the ground, he will hear the Sound of the steps of Passengers, though at a great distance; because the motion which by their treading they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the earth, is propagated to the eare by the uppermost parts of the earth which receiveth it from their feet.</p>
               <p n="11">11 I have shewn above, that the difference between Grave and Acute Sounds consisteth in this, that by how much the shorter the time is, in which the reciprocations of the parts of a Body stricken are made, by so much the more Acute will be the Sound.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59147:201"/>
Now by how much a Body of the same bigness, is either more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or less stretched, by so much the longer will the reciprocations last; and therefore heavier, and less stretched Bodies (if they be like in all other respects) will yeild a Graver Sound then such as be lighter and more stretched.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Concent</hi> of Sounds, it is to be considered, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation or Vibration of the Aire (by which Sound is made) after it hath reached the Drumme of the eare, imprinteth a like Vibration upon the air that is enclosed within it; by which means the sides of the Drumme within, are stricken alternately. Now the Concent of two Sounds consists in this, that the <hi>Tympanum</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its stroke from both the Sounding Bodies in equal, &amp; equally freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t spaces of time; So that when two strings make their Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the same times, the Concent they produce, is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite of all other. For the sides of the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> (that is to say, of the Organ of Hearing) will be stricken by both those Vibrations together at once, on one side or other. For example, if the two equal strings A B and C D be stricken together, and the latitudes of their Vibrations E F and G H be also equal, and the points E, G, F &amp; H be in the concave superficies of the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> so that it receive strokes from both the strings together in E and G, and again toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in F and H, the Sound which is made by the Vibrations of each string, will be so like, that it may be taken for the same Sound, and is called <hi>Unison;</hi> which is the greatest Concord. Again, the string A B retaining still its former Vibration E F, let the string C D be stretched, till its Vibration have double the swiftness it had before, and let E F be divided equally in I. In what time therefore the string C D makes one part of its Vibration from G to H, in the same time the string A B will make one part of its Vibration from E to I; and in what time the string C D hath made the other part of its Vibration back from
<figure/>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:59147:202"/>
H to G, in the same time another part of the Vibration of the string A B will be made from I to F. But the points F and G are both in the sides of the Organ, and therefore they will strike the Organ both together, not at every stroke, but at every other storke. And this is the neerest Concord to Unison, and makes that Sound which is called an <hi>Eighth.</hi> Again, the Vibration of the string A B remayning still the same it was, let C D be stretched till its Vibration be swifter then that of the string A B, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of 3 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and let E F be divided into three equal parts in K and L. In what time therefore the string C D makes one third part of its Vibration, which third part is from G to H, the string A B will make one third part of its Vibration, that is to say, two thirds of E F, namely, E L. And in what time the string C D makes another third part of its Vibration, namely H G, the string A B will make another third part of its Vibration, namely, from L to F, and back again from F to L. Lastly, whilest the string C D makes the last third part of its Vibration, that is, from G to H, the string A B will make the last third part of its Vibration from L to E. But the points E and H are both in the sides of the Organ. Wherefore at every third time the Organ will be stricken by the Vibration of both the strings together, and make that Concord which is called a <hi>Fifth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 For the finding out of the cause of <hi>Smels,</hi> I shall make use of the evidence of these following <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> First, that Smelling is hindred by Cold, and helped by Heat. Secondly, that when the Wind bloweth from the Object, the Smel is the stronger; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily when it bloweth from the Sentient towards the Object, the weaker; both which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are by experience manifestly found to be true in Doggs which follow the track of Beasts by the Sent. Thirdly, that such Bodies as are less pervious to the fluid Medium, yeild less Smell then such as are more pervious; as may be seen in Stones and Metals, which compared with Plants and Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their Parts, Fruits and Excretions, have very little or no Smell at all. Fourthly, that such Bodies as are of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Odorous, become yet more Odorous when they are bruised. Fifthly, that when the breath is stopped (at least in Men) nothing can be Smelt. Sixthly, that the sense of Smelling is also taken
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59147:202"/>
away by the stopping of the Nostrils, though the mouth be left open.</p>
               <p n="13">13 By the fourth and fifth <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> it is manifest, that the first and immediate Organ of Smelling is the innermost cuticle of the Nostrils, and that part of it which is below the passage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Nostrils and the Palate. For when we draw breath by the Nostrils, we draw it into the Lungs. That breath therefore which conveighs Smels, is in the way which passeth to the Lungs, that is to say, in that part of the Nostrils which is below the passage through which the breath goeth. For nothing is Smelt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beyond the passage of the breath within, nor at all without the Nostrils.</p>
               <p>And seeing that from different Smels there must necessarily proceed some mutation in the Organ, and all mutation is motion; it is therefore also necessary that in Smelling, the parts of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, that is to say, of that internal cuticle, and the nerves that are inserted into it, must be diversly moved by different Smels. And seeing also that it hath been demonstrated, that nothing can be moved but by a Body that is already moved and contiguous; and that there is no other Body contiguous to the internal membrane of the nostrils, but breath, that is to say, attracted aire, and such little solid invisible Bodies (if there be any such) as are interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the aire; it follows necessarily, that the cause of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is either the motion of that pure aire or aethereal Substance, or the motion of those small Bodies. But this motion is an effect proceding from the Object of Smell, and therefore either the whole Object it self, or its several parts must necessarily be moved. Now we know, that Odorous Bodies make Odour though their whole bulk be not moved. Wherefore the cause of Odour is the motion of the invisible parts of the Odorous Body. And these invisible parts do either go out of the Object, or else retaining their former situation with the rest of the parts, are moved together with them, that is to say, they have simple and invisible motion. They that say there goes something out of the Odorous Body, call it an <hi>Effluvium;</hi> which <hi>Effluvium</hi> is either of the aethereal substance, or of the small Bodies, that are intermingled with it. But that all variety of Odours should proceed from the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59147:203"/>
                  <hi>Effluviums</hi> of those small Bodies that are intermingled with the aethereal substance, is altogether incredible, for these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; First, that certain Unguents, though very little in quantity, do nevertheless send forth very strong Odours, not onely to a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place, but also to a great continuance of time, and are to be Smelt in every point both of that place and time; so that the parts issued out are sufficient to fil ten thousand times more space, then the whole Odorous Body is able to fill; which is impossible. Secondly, that whether that issuing out be with straight or with crooked motion, if the same quantity should flow from any other Odorous Body with the same motion, it would follow, that all Odorous Bodies would yeild the same Smell. Thirdly, that seeing those <hi>Effluviums</hi> have great Velocity of motion (as is manifest from this, that noysome Odours proceeding from caverns are presently Smelt at a great distance) it would follow, that by reason there is nothing to hinder the passage of those <hi>Effluviums</hi> to the Organ, such motion alone were sufficient to cause Smelling. Which is not so; for we cannot Smell at all unless we draw in our breath through our Nostrils. Smelling therefore is not caused by the <hi>Effluvium</hi> of Atomes; nor, for the same reason is it caused by the <hi>Effluvium</hi> of aethereal substance; for so also we should Smell without the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of our breath. Besides the aethereal substance being the same in all Odorous Bodies, they would always affect the Organ in the same manner, and consequently the Odours of all things would be like.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that the cause of Smelling must consist in the Simple motion of the parts of Odorous Bodies, without any efflux or diminution of their whole substance. And by this motion, there is propagated to the Organ by the intermediate aire, the like motion, but not strong enough to excite Sense of it self without the attraction of aire by respiration. And this is a possible cause of Smelling.</p>
               <p n="14">14 The cause why Smelling is hindred by Cold, and helped by Heat, may be this, that Heat (as hath been shewn in the 21 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) generateth Simple motion; and therefore also wheresoever it is already, there it will encrease it; and the cause of Smelling being encreased the Smell it self will also be encreased. As for the cause
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59147:203"/>
why the Wind blowing from the Object makes the Smell the stronger, it is all one with that for which the attraction of aire in respiration doth the same. For he that draws in the aire next to him, draws with it by succession that aire in which is the Object. Now this motion of the aire is Wind, and when another Wind bloweth from the Object, will be encreased by it.</p>
               <p n="15">15 That Bodies which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain the least quantity of air, as Stones and Metals, yeild less Smell then Plants and Living Creatures, the cause may be, that the motion which causeth Smelling, is a motion of the fluid parts onely; which parts, if they have any motion from the hard parts in which they are contained, they communicate the same to the open aire, by which it is propagated to the Organ. Where therefore there are no fluid parts, as in Metals; or where the fluid parts receive no motion from the hard parts, as in Stones, which are made hard by accretion, there can be no Smell. And therefore also the Water, whose parts have little or no motion, yeildeth no Smell. But if the same Water, by Seeds, and the heat of the Sunne, be together with particles of Earth raised into a Plant, and be afterwards pressed out again, it will be Odorous, as Wine from the Vine. And as Water passing through plants is by the motion of the parts of those plants made an Odorous liquour; so also of aire passing through the same plants whilest they are growing, are made Odorous aires. And thus also it is with the Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Spirits which are bred in Living Creatures.</p>
               <p n="16">16 That Odorous Bodies may be made more Odorous by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, proceeds from this, that being broken into many parts which are all Odorous, the aire which by respiration is drawn from the Object towards the Organ, doth in its passage touch upon all those parts, and receives their motion. Now the aire toucheth the superficies onely; and a Body having less superficies whilest it is whole, then all its parts together have after it is reduced to powder, it follows that the same Odorous Body yeildeth less Smell whilest it is whole, then it will do after it is broken into smaller parts. And thus much of Smels.</p>
               <p n="17">17 The <hi>Tast</hi> follows; whose generation hath this difference from that of the Sight, Hearing and Smelling, that by these we have Sense of remote Objects; whereas we Tast nothing but what is contiguous, and doth immediately touch either the Tongue or
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59147:204"/>
Palate, or both. From whence it is evident, that the cuticles of the Tongue and Palate, and the Nerves inserted into them are the first Organ of Tast; and (because from the concussion of the parts of these, there followeth necessarily a concussion of the <hi>Pia Mater</hi>) that the action communicated to these, is propagated to the Brain, and from thence to the farthest Organ, namely, the Heart; in whose reaction consisteth the nature of Sense.</p>
               <p>Now that Savours (as well as Odours) doe not onely move the Brain, but the Stomack also, as is manifest by the loathings that are caused by them both, they that consider the Organ of both these Senses will not wonder at all; seeing the Tongue, the Palate &amp; the Nostrils have one and the same continued cuticle, derived from the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that <hi>Effluviums</hi> have nothing to doe in the Sense of Tasting, is manifest from this, that there is no Tast where the Organ and the Object are not contiguous.</p>
               <p>By what variety of motions the different kinds of Tasts (which are innumerable) may be distinguished, I know not. I might (with others) derive them from the divers figures of those Atomes, of which whatsoever may be Tasted consisteth; or from the diverse motions which I might (by way of Supposition) attribute to those Atomes; conjecturing (not without some likelyhood of truth) that such things as tast Sweet, have their particles moved with slow circular motion, and their figures Spherical, which makes them smooth and pleasing to the Organ; that Bitter things have circular motion, but vehement, and their figures full of Angles, by which they trouble the Organ; and that Sowre things have straight and reciprocal motion, and their figures long and small, so that they cut and wound the Organ. And in like manner I might assigne for the causes of other Tasts such several motions and figures of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as might in probability seem to be the true causes. But this would be to revolt from Philosophy to Divination.</p>
               <p n="18">18 By the <hi>Touch,</hi> we feel what Bodies are Cold or Hot, though they be distant from us. Others, as Hard, Soft, Rough and Smooth, we cannot feel, unless they be contiguous. The Organ of Touch, is every one of those membranes, which being continued from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> are so diffused throughout the whole Body, as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59147:204"/>
that no part of it can be pressed, but the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is pressed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it. Whatsoever therefore presseth it, is felt as Hard or Soft, that is to say, as more or less Hard. And as for the Sense of Rough, it is nothing else but innumerable perceptions of Hard and Hard succeeding one another by short intervals both of time and place. For we take notice of Rough and Smooth, as also of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and Figure, not onely by the Touch, but also by Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For though some things are touched in one Point; yet Rough and Smooth, like Quantity and Figure, are not perceived but by the Flux of a Point, that is to say, we have no Sense of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Time; and we can have no Sense of Time, without Memory.</p>

Nor is there in a Thick Rank a greater quantity of Body, but a greater number of Souldiers, then in a Thinne. Wherefore the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; paucity of the parts contained within the same space, do constitute <hi>Density</hi> and <hi>Rarity,</hi> whether those parts be separated by <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or by Aire. But the consideration of this is not of any great moment in Philosophy; and therefore I let it alone, and pass on to the search of the causes of <hi>Gravity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Now we call those Bodies <hi>Heavy,</hi> which (unless they be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by some force) are carried towards the center of the Earth, and that by their own accord, for ought we can by Sense perceive to the contrary. Some Philosophers therefore have been of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Descent of Heavy Bodies proceeded from some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Appetite, by which when they were cast upwards, they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended again, as moved by themselves, to such place as was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their nature. Others thought they were attracted by the Earth. To the former I cannot assent, because I think I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy clearly enough demonstrated, that there can be no beginning of motion, but from an external &amp; moved Body; and consequently, that whatsoever hath motion or endeavour towards any place, will alwayes move or endeavour towards that same place, unless it be hindered by the reaction of some external Body. Heavy Bodies therefore being once cast upwards, cannot be cast down again but by external motion. Besides, seeing inanimate Bodies have no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite at all, it is ridiculous to think that by their own innate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite they should to preserve themselves (not understanding what preserves them) forsake the place they are in, and transferre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to another place; whereas Man (who hath both Appetite and understanding) cannot for the preservation of his own life, raise himselfe by leaping above three or four feet from the ground. Lastly, to attribute to created Bodies the power to move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, what is it else then to say that there be creatures which have no dependance upon the Creator? To the later, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the Descent of Heavy Bodies to the attraction of the Earth, I assent. But by what motion this is done, hath not as yet been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by any man. I shall therefore in this place say somewhat
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59147:206"/>
of the manner, and of the way by which the Earth by its action attracteth Heavy Bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That by the supposition of simple motion in the Sunne, homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Bodies are congregated, and heterogeneous dissipated, has already been demonstrated in the 5th Article of the 21 Chapter. I have also supposed, that there are intermingled with the pure Air, certain little Bodies, or (as others call them) Atomes, which by reason of their extreme smalness are invisible, and differing from one another in <hi>Consistence, Figure, Motion &amp; Magnitude;</hi> from whence it comes to pass, that some of them are congregated to the Earth, others to other Planets, and others are carried up and down in the spaces between. And seeing those which are carried to the Earth, differ from one another in Figure, Motion and Magnitude, they will fall upon the Earth, some with greater, others with less <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> And seeing also that we compute the several degrees of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity no otherwise then by this their falling upon the Earth with greater or less <hi>Impetus;</hi> it follows, that we conclude those to be the more Heavy that have the greater <hi>Impetus,</hi> and those to be less Heavy that have the less <hi>Impetus.</hi> Our enquiry therefore must be, by what means it may come to pass, that of Bodies which descend from above to the Earth, some are carried with greater, others with less <hi>Impetus;</hi> that is to say, some are more Heavy then others. We must also enquire, by what means such Bodies as settle upon the Earth, may by the Earth it self be forced to ascend.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let the Circle made upon the center C (in the 2d figure) be a great Circle in the Superficies of the Earth, passing through the points A and B. Also let any Heavy Body, as the stone A D be placed any where in the plain of the Aequator; and let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be cast up from A D perpendicularly, or to be carried in any other line to E, and supposed to rest there. Therefore how much space soever the stone took up in A D, so much space it takes up now in E. And because all place is supposed to be full, the space A D will be filled by the aire which flows into it first from the neerest places of the Earth, and afterwards successively from more remote places. Upon the center C let a Circle be understood to be drawn through E; and let the plain space which is between the Superficies of the Earth and that Circle, be divided into plain Orbs equal and concentrique; of which, let that be the first which is
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59147:206"/>
contained by the two perimeters that pass through A &amp; D. Whilst therefore the aire which is in the first Orbe, filleth the place A D, the Orbe it self is made so much less, and consequently its latitude is less then the straight line A D. Wherefore there will necessarily descend so much aire from the Orbe next abvoe. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the same cause, there will also be a descent of aire from the Orbe next above that; and so by Succession from the Orbe in which the Stone is at rest in E. Either therefore the Stone it self, or so much aire will descend. And seeing aire is by the diurnal revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth more easily thrust away, then the Stone, the aire which is in the Orbe that contains the Stone will be forced further upwards then the Stone. But this, without the admission of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> cannot be, unless so much aire descend to E from the place next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; which being done, the Stone will be thrust downwards. By this means therefore the Stone now receives the beginning of its Descent, that is to say, of its Gravity. Furthermore, whatsoever is once moved, will be moved continually (as hath been shewn in the 19th Article of the 8th Chapter) in the same way, and with the same celerity, except it be retarded or accelerated by some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Movent. Now the aire (which is the onely Body that is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed between the Earth A and the stone above it E) will have the same action in every point of the straight line E A, which it hath in E. But it depressed the stone in E; and therefore also it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it equally in every point of the straight line E A. Wherefore the stone will descend from E to A with accelerated motion. The possible cause therefore of the Descent of Heavy Bodies under the Aequator, is the Diurnal motion of the Earth. And the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration will serve, if the stone be placed in the plain of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circle parallel to the Aequator. But because this motion hath by reason of its greater slowness, less force to thrust off the aire in the parallel Circles then in the Aequator, and no force at all at the Poles, it may well be thought (for it is a certain consequent) that Heavy Bodies descend with less and less velocity, as they are more &amp; more remote from the Aequator; &amp; that at the Poles themselves they wil either not descend at all, or not descend by the Axis; which whether it be true or false, Experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must determine. But it is hard to make the experiment, both because the times of their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59147:207"/>
cannot be easily measured with sufficient exactness, and also because the places neer the Poles are inaccessible. Nevertheless, this we know, that by how much the neerer we come to the Poles, by so much the greater are the Flakes of the Snow that falls; and by how much the more swiftly such Bodies descend as are fluid and dissipable, by so much the smaller are the particles into which they are dissipated.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Supposing therefore this to be the cause of the Descent of Heavy Bodies; it will follow, that their motion will be accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in such manner, as that the spaces which are transmitted by them in the several times, will have to one another the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the odd numbers have in succession from Unity. For if the straight line EA be divided into any number of equal parts, the Heavy Body descending, will (by reason of the perpetual acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diurnal motion) receive from the aire in every one of those times, in every several point of the streight line EA, a several new and equal impulsion; and therefore also in every one of those times it will acquire a several and equal degree of celerity. And from hence it follows, by that which <hi>Galilaeus</hi> hath in his Dialogues of Motion demonstrated, that Heavy Bodies descend in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times with such differences of transmitted spaces as are equal to the differences of the square numbers that succeed one another from Unity; which square numbers being 1, 4, 9, 16, &amp;c. their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are 3, 5, 7,  that is to say, the odd numbers which succeed another from Unity. Against this cause of Gravity which I have given, it will perhaps be objected, that if a Heavy Body be placed in the bottom of some hollow Cylinder of Iron or Adamant, and the bottom be turned upwards, the Body will descend, though the aire above cannot depress it, much less accelerate its motion. But it is to be considered, that there can be no Cylinder or Cavern, but such as is supported by the Earth, and being so supported, is toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Earth carried about by its diurnal Motion. For by this means the bottom of the Cylinder will be as the Superficies of the Earth; and by thrusting off the next and lowest aire, will make the uppermost aire depress the Heavy Body which is at the top of the Cylinder, in such manner as is above explicated.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The Gravity of Water being so great as by experience wee find it is, the reason is demanded by many, why those that Dive,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59147:207"/>
how deep soever they go under water, do not at all feel the weight of the water which lyes upon them. And the cause seems to be this, that all Bodies by how much the Heavier they are, by so much the greater is the endeavour by which they tend downwards. But the Body of a Man is Heavier then so much water as is equal to it in magnitude, and therefore the endeavour downwards of a Mans Body is greater then that of water. And seeing all endeavour is motion, the Body also of a Man will be carried towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with greater Velocity then so much water. Wherefore there is greater Reaction from the bottom; and the Endeavour upwards is equal to the endeavour downwards, whether the water be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by water, or by another Body which is Heavier then water. And therefore by these two opposite equal endeavours, the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both ways in the water is taken away; and consequently, those that Dive are not at all pressed by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> From hence also it is manifest, that water in water hath no Waight at all, because all the parts of water (both the parts above, and the parts that are directly under) tend towards the bottom with equal endeavour and in the same straight lines.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If a Body float upon the water, the waight of that Body is equal to the waight of so much water as would fill the place which the immersed part of the Body takes up within the water.</p>
               <p>Let EF (in the 3d figure) be a Body floating in the water ABCD; and let the part E be above, and the other part F under the water. I say the waight of the whole Body EF is equal to the waight of so much water as the Space F will receive. For seeing the waight of the Body EF forceth the water out of the space F, and placeth it upon the Superficies AB, where it presseth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; it follows, that from the resistance of the bottom there will also be an endeavour upwards. And seeing again that by this endeavour of the water upwards, the Body EF is lifted up; it follows, that if the endeavour of the Body downwards be not equal to the endeavour of the water upwards, either the whole Body EF will (by reason of that inequality of their endeavours or moments) be raised out of the water, or else it will descend to the bottom. But it is supposed to stand so, as neither to ascend nor descend. Wherefore there is an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> between the two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; that is to say, the waight of the Body EF is equal to the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59147:208"/>
waight of so much water as the Space F will receive; Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="8">8 From hence it follows, that any Body of how great magnitude soever, provided it consist of matter less Heavy then water, may nevertheless float upon any quantity of water how little soever.</p>
               <p>Let ABCD (in the 4th figure) be a vessel; and in it let EFGH be a Body consisting of matter which is less Heavy then water; and let the space AGCF be filled with water. I say the Body EFGH will not sink to the bottom DC. For seeing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Body EFGH is less Heavy then Water, if the whole space without ABCD were full of Water, yet some part of the Body EFGH, as EFIK would be above the Water; and the waight of so much water as would fill the space IGHK would be equal to the waight of the whole Body EFGH; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently GH would not touch the bottom DC. As for the sides of the vessel, it is no matter whether they be hard, or fluid; for they serve onely to terminate the Water; which may be done as well by water as by any other matter how hard soever; and the water without the Vessel is terminated somewhere, so as that it can spread no further. The part therefore EFIG will be extant above the water AGCF which is contained in the vessel. Wherefore the Body EFGH will also float upon the water AGCF, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle soever that water be; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="9">9 In the 4th Article of the 26th Chapter, there is brought for the proving of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> the experiment of water enclosed in a vessel; which water, the Orifice above being opened, is ejected upwards by the impulsion of the aire. It is therefore demanded (seeing water is Heavier then aire) how that can be done. Let the 2d. figure of the same 26th Chap. be considered, where the water is with great force injected by a Syringe into the space FGB. In that injection, the aire (but pure aire) goeth with the same force out of the vessel through the injected water. But as for those small Bodies which formerly I supposed to be intermingled with aire, &amp; to be moved with simple motion, they can not together with the oure air penetrate the water; but remayning behind are necessarily thrust together into a narrower place, namely into the space which is above the water FG. The motions therefore of those small Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will be less and less free, by how much the quantity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59147:208"/>
water is greater and greater; so that by their motions falling upon one another the same small Bodies will mutually compress each other, and have a perpetual endeavour of regayning their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and of depressing the water that hinders them. Wherefore, as soone as the orifice above is opened, the water which is next it will have an endeavour to ascend; and will therefore necessarily go out. But it cannot go out, unless at the same time there enter in as much aire; and therefore both the water will go out, and the aire enter in, till those small Bodies which were left within the vessel have recovered their former liberty of motion; that is to say, till the vessel be again filled with aire, and no water be left of sufficient height to stop the passage at B. Wherefore I have shewn a possible cause of this <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> namely, the same with that of Thunder. For as in the generation of Thunder, the small Bodies enclosed within the Clouds by being too closely pent together, do by their motion break the Clouds, and restore themselves to their natural liberty; so here also the small Bodies enclosed within the space which is above the straight line FG, do by their own moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expel the water as soon as the passage is opened above. And if the passage be kept stopped, and these small Bodies be more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently compressed by the perpetual forcing in of more water, they will at last break the vessel it self with great noise.</p>
               <p n="10">10 If Aire be blown into a hollow Cylinder, or into a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it will encrease the waight of either of them a little, as many have found by experience, who with great accurateness have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same. And it is no wonder, seeing (as I have supposed) there are intermingled with the common aire a great number of small hard Bodies which are Heavier then the pure aire. For the aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real substance, being on all sides equally agitated by the motion of the Sunne, hath an equal endeavour towards all the parts of the Universe; and therefore it hath no Gravity at all.</p>
               <p n="11">11 We find also by experience, that by the force of air enclosed in a hollow Canon, a bullet of lead may with considerable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be shot out of a Gunne of late invention, called the <hi>Wind-Gun.</hi> In the end of this Canon there are two holes with their Valves on the inside, to shut them close; one of them serving for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of aire, and the other for the letting of it out. Also to that
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59147:209"/>
end which serves for the receiving in of aire, there is joyned another Canon of the same metal and bigness, in which there is fitted a Rammer, which is perforated, and hath also a Valve opening towards the former Canon. By the help of this Valve the Rammer is easily drawn back, and letteth in aire from without; and being often drawn back and returned again with violent strokes, it forceth some part of that aire into the former Canon, so long, till at last the resistance of the enclosed aire is greater then the force of the stroke. And by this means men think there is now a greater quantity of aire in the Canon then there was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, though it were full before. Also the aire thus forced in, how much soever it be, is hindered from getting out again by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Valves, which the very endeavour of the aire to get out doth necessarily shut. Lastly, that Valve being opened which was made for the letting out of the aire, it presently breaketh out with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; driveth the bullet before it with great force and velocity.</p>
               <p>As for the cause of this, I could easily attribute it (as most men do) to Condensation, and think that the aire, which had at the first but its ordinary degree of Rarity, was afterwards by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in of more aire condensed, and last of all rarified again by being let out and restored to its natural liberty. But I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how the same place can be alwayes full, and nevertheless contain sometimes a greater, sometimes a less quantity of matter; that is to say, that it can be fuller then full. Nor can I conceive, how Fulness can of it self be an efficient cause of motion. For both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese are impossible. Wherefore we must seek out some other possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause of this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> Whilst therefore the Valve w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> serves for the letting in of aire is opened by the first stroke of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the aire within doth with equal force resist the entering of the aire from without; so that the endeavours between the internal and external aire are opposite, that is, there are two opposite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whilest the one goeth in and the other cometh out; but no augmentation at all of aire within the Canon. For there is driven out by the stroke as much pure aire which passeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Rammer and the sides of the Canon, as there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in of aire impure by the same stroke. And thus by many forcible strokes the quantity of small hard Bodies will be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59147:209"/>
within the Canon, and their motions also will grow stronger and stronger as long as the matter of the Canon is able to endure their force; by which if it be not broken, it will at least be urged every way by their endeavour to free themselves; and as soon as the Valve which serves to let them out is opened, they will fly out with violent motion, and carry with them the bullet which is in their way. Wherefore I have given a possible cause of this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Water, contrary to the custome of Heavy Bodies, ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Weather-glasse; but it doth it when the aire is cold; for when it is warme it descendeth againe. And this Organ is called a <hi>Thermometer,</hi> or <hi>Thermoscope,</hi> because the degrees of Heat and Cold are measured and marked by it. It is made in this manner. Let A B C D (in the 5th figure) be a vessel full of water, and E F G a hollow Cylinder of glasse, closed at E, and open at G. Let it be heated, and set upright within the water to F; and let the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen end reach to G. This being done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the aire by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grows colder, the water will ascend slowly within the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from F towards E; till at last the externall and internall aire coming to be both of the same temper, it will neither ascend high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor descend lower, till the temper of the aire be changed. Suppose it therefore to be setled any where, as at H. If now the heat of the aire be augmented, the water will descend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low H; and if the heat be diminished, it will ascend above it. Which though it be certainely known to be true by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the cause neverthelesse hath not as yet been discovered.</p>
               <p>In the 6 and 7 articles of the 27th chapter (where I consider the cause of Cold) I have shewne, that fluid Bodies are made colder by the pressure of the aire, that is to say, by a constant Wind that presseth them. For the same cause it is, that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the water is pressed at F; and having no place to which it may retire from this pressure besides the cavity of the Cylinder between H and E, it is therefore necessarily forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Cold, and consequently it ascendeth more or lesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Cold is more or lesse encreased. And againe, as the Heat is more intense, or the Cold more remisse, the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be depressed more or lesse by its own Gravity, that is to say, by the cause of Gravity above explicated.</p>

                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:59147:210"/>13 Also Living creatures, though they be Heavy, can by Leaping, Swimming &amp; Flying raise themselvs to a certain degree of height. But they cannot do this except they be supported by some resisting Body, as the Earth, the Water and the Aire. For these motions have their beginning from the contraction (by the helpe of the Muscles) of the Body animate. For to this contraction there suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth a distension of their whole Bodies; by which distensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Earth, the Water or the Aire which supporteth them, is pressed; and from hence, by the reaction of those pressed Bodies, Living Creatures acquire an endeavour upwards, but such, as by reason of the Gravity of their Bodies is presently lost againe. By this endeavour therefore it is, that Living creatures rayse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues up a little way by Leaping, but to no great purpose; but by Swimming &amp; Flying they raise themselves to a greater height; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause before the effect of their endeavour is quite extinguished by the Gravity of their bodies, they can renew the same endeavour againe.</p>
               <p>That by the power of the Soule, without any antecedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Muscles, or the helpe of something to support him, any man can be able to raise his Body upwards, is a childish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt. For if it were true, a man might raise himselfe to what height he pleased.</p>
               <p n="14">14 The diaphanous Medium which surrounds the Eie on all fides, is invisible; Nor is Aire to be seen in Aire, nor Water in Water, nor any thing but that which is more opacous. But in the confines of two diaphanous Bodies, one of them may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the other. It is not therefore a thing so very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous for ordinary people to think all that Space empty, in which we say is Aire; it being the worke of Reason to make us conceive that the Aire is any thing. For by which of our Senses is it, that we take notice of the Aire, seeing we neither See, nor Hear, nor Tast, nor Smell, nor Feel it to be any thing? When we feel Heat, we do not impute it to the Air, but to the Fire; nor do we say the aire is Cold, but we our selves are Cold; and when we feel the Wind, we rather think something is comming, then that any thing is already come. Also we do not at al feel the waight of water in water, much less of air in air. That we come to know that to be a Body which we call Aire, it is by Reasoning; but it is from one
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59147:210"/>
Reason onely, namely, because it is impossible for remote Bodies to work upon our Organs of Sense but by the help of Bodies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, without which we could have no sense of them, till they came to be contiguous. Wherefore, from the Senses alone, without reasoning from effects, we cannot have sufficient evidence of the nature of Bodies.</p>
               <p>For there is under-ground in some Mines of Coles, a certain matter of a middle nature between Water and Aire, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless cannot by Sense be distinguished from aire; for it is as Diaphanous as the purest aire; and as farre as Sense can judge, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually penetrable. But if we look upon the effect, it is like that of water. For when that matter breaks out of the Earth into one of those Pits, it fils the same either totally, or to some degree; and if a Man, or Fire be then let down into it, it extinguishes them in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as little time as water would do. But for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I shall describe the 6th figure. In which, let A B represent the pit of the Mine; and let part thereof, namely, C B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be supposed to be filled with that matter. If now a lighted Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle be let down into it below C, it wil as suddenly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, as if it were thrust into water. Also if a grate filled with coles throughly kindled and burning never so brightly, be let down; as soon as ever it is below C, the fire will begin to grow pale, and shortly after (losing its light) be extinguished, no otherwise then if it were quenched in water. But if the grate be drawn up again presently, whilest the coles are still very hot, the fire will by little and little be kindled again, and shine as before. There is indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this matter &amp; water this considerable difference, that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wetteth, nor sticketh to such things as are put down into it, as water doth; which by the moisture it leaveth, hindereth the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling again of the matter once extinguished. In like manner, if a Man be let down below C, he will presently fall into a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, and immediately after into a swoun, and die, unless he be suddenly drawn up again. They therefore that go down into these pits, have this custome, that as soon as ever they feel themselves sick, they shake the rope by which they were let down, to signifie they are not well, and to the end that they may speedily be pulled up again. For if a man be drawn out too late,

void of sense and motion, they digg up a Turff, and put his face and mouth into the fresh earth; by which means (unless he be quite dead) he comes to himself again by little and little, and recovers life by the breathing out (as it were) of that suffocating matter which he had sucked in whilest he was in the pit; almost in the same manner as they that are drowned come to themselves again by vomiting up the water. But this doth not happen in all Mines, but in some onely; and in those not alwayes, but often. In such Pits as are subject to it, they use this remedy. They dig another pit, as DE, close by it, of equal depth; and joyning them both together with one common channel EF, they make a Fire in the bottom E, which carries out at D the aire contained in the pit DE; and this draws with it the aire contained in the channel EF; which in like manner is followed by the noxious matter contained in CB; &amp; by this means the pit is for that time made healthful. Out of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story (which I write onely to such as have had experience of the truth of it, without any designe to support my Philosophy with Stories of doubtful credit) may be collected the following possible cause of this <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> namely, that there is a certain matter, fluid, &amp; most transparent, and not much lighter then water; which breaking out of the Earth fills the Pit to C; and that in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in water, both Fire and Living creatures are extinguished.</p>
               <p n="15">15 About the nature of Heavy Bodies, the greatest difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from the contemplation of those things which make other Heavy Bodies ascend to them; such are <hi>Jet, Amber,</hi> and the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> But that which troubles men most is the Loadstone, which is also called <hi>Lapis Herculeus;</hi> a stone, though otherwise despicable, yet of so great power, that it taketh up Iron from the Earth, and holds it suspended in the aire, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did <hi>Antaeus.</hi> Nevertheless, we wonder at it somewhat the less, because we see Jet draw up Straws, which are Heavy Bodies, though not so Heavy as Iron. But as for Jet, it must first be excited by rubbing, that is to say, by motion to and fro; whereas the Loadstone hath sufficient excitation from its own nature, that is to say, from some internal principle of motion peculiar to it self. Now whatsoever is moved, is moved by some contiguous and moved Body, as hath been formerly demonstrated. And from hence it follows evidently, that the first endeavour
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59147:211"/>
which Iron hath towards the Loadstone, is caused by the motion of that aire which is contiguous to the Iron. Also that this motion is generated by the motion of the next aire, and so on successively, till by this succession we find that the motion of all the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate air taketh its beginning from some motion which is in the Loadstone it self; which motion (because the Loadstone seems to be at rest) is invisible. It is therefore certain, that the attractive power of the Loadstone is nothing else but some motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest particles thereof. Supposing therefore that those small Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of which the Loadstone is (in the bowels of the Earth) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, have by nature such motion or endeavour as was above attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Jet, namely a reciprocal motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a line too short to be seen, both those stones wil have one &amp; the same cause of attraction. Now in what manner, and in what order of working this cause produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the effect of attraction, is the thing to be enquired. And first we know, that when the string of a Lute or Viol is stricken, the Vibration, that is, the reciprocal motion of that string in the same straight Line, causeth like Vibration in another string which has like tension. We know also, that the dregs or small sands which sink to the bottom of a Vessel, will be raised up from the bottom by any strong and reciprocal agitation of the water stirred with the hand or with a staff. Why therefore should not reciprocal motion of the parts of the Loadstone contribute as much towards the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Iron? For if in the Loadstone there be supposed such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal motion, or motion of the parts forwards and backwards, it will follow, that the like motion will be propagated by the aire to the Iron, and consequently that there will be in all the parts of the Iron the same reciprocations or motions forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And from hence also it will follow, that the intermediate aire between the Stone and the Iron will by little and little be thrust away; and the aire being thrust away, the Bodies of the Loadstone and the Iron will necessarily come together. The possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause therefore why the Loadstone and Jet draw to them, the one Iron, the other Strawes, may be this, that those attracting Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have reciprocal motion either in a straight line, or in an Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical line, when there is nothing in the nature of the attracted Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which is repugnant to such a motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:59147:212"/>But why the Loadstone (if with the help of Cork it float at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon the top of the water) should from any position whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever so place it self in the plain of the Meridian, as that the same points which at one time of its being at rest respect the Poles of the Earth, should at all other times respect the same Poles, the cause may be this, That the reciprocal motion which I supposed to be in the parts of the Stone, is made in a line parallel to the Axis of the Earth, and has been in those parts ever since the Stone was generated. Seeing therefore the Stone whilest it remains in the Mine, and is carried about together with the Earth by its diurnal motion, doth by length of time get a habit of being moved in a line which is perpendicular to the line of its reciprocal motion, it will afterwards, though its axis be removed from the parallel situation it had with the axis of the Earth, retain its endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of returning to that situation again; and all endeavour being the beginning of motion, and nothing intervening that may hinder the same, the Loadstone will therefore return to its former situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For any piece of Iron that has for a long time rested in the plain of the Meridian, whensoever it is forced from that situation, and afterwards left to its own liberty again, will of it self return to lie in the Meridian again; which return is caused by the endeavour it acquired from the diurnal motion of the Earth in the parallel cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are perpendicular to the Meridians.</p>
               <p>If Iron be rubbed by the Loadstone drawn from one Pole to the other, two things will happen; one, that the Iron will acquire the same direction with the Loadstone, that is to say, that it will lie in the Meridian, and have its Axis and Poles in the same position with those of the Stone; the other, that the like Poles of the Stone and of the Iron will avoid one another, and the unlike Poles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one another. And the cause of the former may be this, that Iron being touched by motion which is not reciprocal, but drawn the same way from Pole to Pole, there will be imprinted in the Iron also an endeavour from the same Pole to the same Pole. For seeing the Loadstone differs from Iron no otherwise then as Ore from Metal, there will be no repugnance at all in the Iron to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same motion which is in the Stone. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that seeing they are both affected alike by the diurnal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59147:212"/>
of the Earth, they will both equally return to their situation in the Meridian whensoever they are put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Also of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this may be the cause, that as the Loadstone in touching the Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth by its action imprint in the Iron an endeavour towards one of the Poles, suppose towards the North Pole; so reciprocally, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron by its action upon the Loadstone doth imprint in it an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards the other Pole, namely towards the South Pole. It happens therefore in these reciprocations or motions forwards and backwards of the particles of the Stone and of the Iron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the North &amp; the South, that whilest in one of them the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from North to South, and the return from South to North, in the other the motion wil be from South to North, &amp; the return fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> North to South; which motions being opposite to one another, and communicated to the Air, the North Pole of the Iron (whilest the attraction is working) will be depressed towards the South Pole of the Loadstone; or contrarily the North Pole of the Loadstone will be depressed towards the South Pole of the Iron; and the Axes both of the Loadstone and of the Iron will be situate in the same straight line. The truth whereof is taught us by experience.</p>
               <p>As for the propagation of this Magnetical vertue, not onely through the Aire, but through any other Bodies how hard so ever, it is not to be wondred at, seeing no motion can be so weak, but that it may be propagated infinitely through a space filled with Body of any hardness whatsoever. For in a full Medium, there can be no motion which doth not make the next part yeild, and that the next, and so successively without end; so that there is no effect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever but to the production thereof something is necessarily contributed by the several motions of all the several things that are in the World.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the nature of Body in general; with which I conclude this my first Section of the Elements of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy. In the first, second and third Parts, where the Principles of Ratiocination consist in our own Understanding, that is to say, in the legitimate use of such Words as we our selves constitute, all the Theoremes (if I be not deceived) are rightly demonstrated. The fourth Part depends upon <hi>Hypotheses;</hi> which unless we know them to be true, it is impossible for us to demonstrate that those
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59147:213"/>
Causes which I have there explicated, are the true Causes of the things whose productions I have derived from them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, seeing I have assumed no <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which is not both possible and easie to be comprehended; and seeing also that I have reasoned aright from those Assumptions, I have withall suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonstrated that they may be the true Causes; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the end of Physical Contemplation. If any other man from other <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses</hi> shall demonstrate the same, or greater things, there wil be greater praise and thanks due to him then I demand for my self, provided his <hi>Hypotheses</hi> be such as are conceivable. For as for those that say any thing may be moved or produced by <hi>it Self,</hi> by <hi>Species,</hi> by <hi>its own Power,</hi> by <hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> by <hi>Incorporeal Substances,</hi> by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi> by <hi>Anteperistasis,</hi> by <hi>Antipathy, Sympathy, Occult Quality,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther empty words of Schoolmen, their saying so is to no purpose.</p>
               <p>And now I proceed to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Mans Body; Where I shall speak of the <hi>Opticks,</hi> and of the <hi>Dispositions, Affections, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of Men (if it shall please God to give me life), and shew their Causes.</p>
