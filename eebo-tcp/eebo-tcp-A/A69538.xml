         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE perſon whoſe Death did occaſion this
Diſcourſe, was one that about five years ago
removed from her antient habitation (at <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pley</hi>
in <hi>Shropſhire</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> where ſhe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under my Paſtoral care till I was come up to
<hi>London:</hi> and before ſhe had lived there a twelve-month
(for thither ſhe removed) ſhe died of the
Fever, then very common in the City. She lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us an example of Prudence, Gravity, Sobriety,
Righteouſneſs, Piety, Charity and Self-denyal: and
was truly what I have deſcribed her to be, and much
more: For I uſe not to flatter the living, much leſs,
the dead. And though I had perſonal acquaintance
with her for no longer a time than I have mentioned,
yet I think it worthy the mentioning, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by comparing her laſt years with what is ſaid of
her former time, by thoſe that were then neareſt to her,
and ſo were at her Death, that whereas (as I have
ſaid) ſudden Paſſion was the ſin that ſhe was wont
much to complain of, ſhe had not contented her ſelf with
meer complainings, but ſo effectually reſiſted them, and
applyed Gods remedies for the healing of her nature,
<pb facs="tcp:45240:4"/>
that the ſucceſs was very much obſerved by thoſe about
her, and the change and cure ſo great herein, as was
a comfort to her neareſt Relations, that had the benefit
of her converſe: Which I mention as a thing that ſhews
us, 1. That even the Infirmities that are founded in
nature and temperature of body, are curable ſo far as
they fall under the dominion of a ſanctified will. 2.
That even in age, when ſuch Paſſions uſually get
ground, and infirmities of mind increaſe with
infirmities of body, yet Grace can effectually do
its work. 3. That to attend God in his Means,
for the ſubduing any corruption, is not in vain. 4.
That as God hath promiſed growth of Grace, and
flouriſhing in old age, ſo in his way we may expect the
fulfilling of his promiſe. 5. That as Grace increaſeth,
infirmities and corruptions of the Soul will vaniſlh.</p>
            <p>This makes me call to mind that ſhe was once ſo
much taken with a Sermon which I preached, at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of a holy aged woman<note n="*" place="margin">Good old Mris. <hi>Doughty,</hi> ſometime of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> who had long walked with God, and longed to be with him; and was among us an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example of holineſs, blameleſneſs, contempt of the world, conſtancy, patience, humility, and (which makes it ſtrange) a great and conſtant deſire to die, though ſhe was ſtill complaining of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and weakneſs of aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note>
and ſo ſenſibly oft recited the
Text it ſelf as much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, (2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4. 16,
17. <hi>For which cauſe
we faint not; but tho
our outward man periſh,
yet the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed
day by day,</hi> &amp;c.)
that I am perſwaded both
the Text it ſelf, and the
example opened (and well
known) to her did her
much good,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45240:4"/>
Her work is done: Her enemies are conquered;
(except the remaining fruits of Death upon
a corrupting Body, which the Reſurrection
muſt conquer). Her danger, and temptations,
and troubles, and fears, are at an end:
She ſhall no more be diſcomfited with evil tidings;
nor no more partake with a militant Church in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of her diſeaſes or diſtreſſes: We are left within
the reach of Satans aſſaults and malice; and of the rage
and violence which pride, and faction, and <hi>Cainiſh</hi>
envy, and enmity to ſerious holineſs, do ordinarily
raiſe againſt Chriſts followers in the world: We are
left among the lying tongues of ſlanderous malicious
men; and dwell in a Wilderneſs among Scorpions;
where the <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> like <hi>Nabal,</hi> are <hi>ſuch that
a man cannot ſpeak to them.</hi> 1 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25. 17. <hi>The
beſt of them is as a briar; the moſt upright ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than a thorn hedge:</hi> Mic. 7. 4. (<hi>But the Sons
of</hi> Belial <hi>ſhall be all of them as thorns thruſt away,
becauſe they cannot be taken with hands, but the
man that ſhall touch them muſt be fenced with
iron, and the ſtaff of a ſpear, and they ſhall be
utterly burnt with fire in the place,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.
6, 7.) We are left among our weak, diſtempered,
ſinful, afflicted, lamenting friends; the ſight of whoſe
calamities, and participation of their ſufferings, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us feel the ſtroaks that fall upon ſo great a number,
that we are never like to be free from pain. But ſhe
is entred into the Land of Peace, where <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>Faction</hi> are ſhut out; where Serpentine enmity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and fury never come: where there is no <hi>Cain</hi> to
envy and deſtroy us; no Sodomtes to rage againſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:45240:5"/>
and in their blindneſs to aſſault our doors: No <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitophels</hi>
to plot our ruin: No <hi>Judas</hi> to betray us:
No falſe-witneſſes to accuſe us: No <hi>Tertullus</hi> to paint
us out as peſtilent fellows and movers of ſedition
among the people: No <hi>Rehum, Shimſhai,</hi> or their
ſociety, to perſwade the Rulers that the ſervants of
the God of heaven are hurtful unto Kings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their intereſt and honour, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 9, 12,
13, 14, 22. and 5. 11.): No rabble to cry away
with them, it is not fit that they ſhould live: No
<hi>Demas</hi> that will forſake us for the love of preſent
things: No ſuch contentious cenſorious friends as <hi>Jobs</hi>
to afflict us, by adding to our affliction: No curſed
<hi>Cham</hi> to diſhonour parents: No ambitious rebellious
<hi>Abſolom</hi> to moleſt us, or to lament: No ſinful, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or impatient friends to be our grief: And which
is more than all, no earthly, ſinful inclinations in
our ſelves; no paſſions or infirmities; no languiſhings
of ſoul, no deadneſs, dulneſs, hard heartedneſs, or
we akneſſes of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no backwardneſs to God, or eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs
from him, nor fears or doubtings of his love,
nor frowns of his diſpleaſure: None of theſe do enter
into that ſerene and holy region, nor ever interrupt the
joy of Saints.</p>
            <p>The great work is yet upon our hands, to fight out
the good fight, to finiſh our courſe, to run with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the remainder of the race that is before us: And
as we muſt look to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of
our faith, as our great exemplar, ſo muſt we look to
his Saints and Martyrs as our encouraging examples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him. Put the caſe you were now dying, (and O
how near is it, and how ſure!) What would you need
<pb facs="tcp:45240:5"/>
moſt if the day were come? That is it that you need
moſt now: Look after it ſpeedily while you have time!
Look after it ſeriouſly, if you have the hearts of men,
and ſin have not turned you into Ideots or blocks. What
a diſgrace is it to mankind, to hear men commonly at
death cry out, O for a little more time, and O for the
opportunities of grace again! and O how ſhall I enter
upon eternity thus unprepared!] As if they had never
heard or known that they muſt die till now! Had you
not a lifes time to put theſe queſtions? and ſhould you not
long ago have got them ſatisfactorily reſolved? And juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth God give over ſome to that greater ſhame of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, as not to be called to their wits even by
the approach of death it ſelf, but as they contemned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Life in their health, God juſtly leaveth them
to be ſo ſottiſh, as to venture preſumptuouſly with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
ſouls upon death, and the conceit that they are of
the right Church, or party, or opinion; or that the Prieſt
hath abſolved them, doth paſs with them for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
preparation; and well were it for them, if theſe
would paſs them currantly into heaven: But O what
heart can now conceive, how terrible it is, for a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

to be ſhut up in flames and deſperation, before they

            <p>Reader, I beſeech thee, as ever thou believeſt that thou
muſt ſhortly die, retire from the crowd and noiſe of
worldly vanity and vexation: O bethink thee how little
a while thou muſt be here, and have uſe for honour,
and favour, and wealth; and what it is for a ſoul to
paſs into heaven or hell, and to dwell among Angels
or Devils for ever; And how men ſhould live, and

watch, and pray, that are near to ſuch a change as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Should I care what men call me (by tongue or pen)?
Should I care whether I Live at liberty or in priſon,
when I am <hi>ready to die,</hi> and have matters of infinite
moment before me, to take me up? Honour or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
liberty or priſon, are words of no ſound or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
ſcarce to be heard or taken notice of, to one of
us that are juſt paſſing to God and to everlaſting life!
The Lord have mercy upon the diſtracted world!
how ſtrangely doth the Devil befool them in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and make them needleſly trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
many things, when one thing is needful; and
Heaven is talk'd of (and that but heartleſly and ſeldom)
while fleſhly proviſion only is the prize, the pleaſure, the
buſineſs of their lives! Some are diverted from their ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preparation for death, by the leaſtly avocations of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wdineſs, and meats, and drinks, and
childiſh ſports: and ſome by the buſineſſes of ambition
and covetouſneſs, contriving how to feather their neſts,
and exerciſe their <hi>Wills</hi> over others in the world! and
ſome that will ſeem to be doing the work, are diverted
as dangerouſly as others, by contending about forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Ceremonies, and deſtroying Charity and Peace,
rending the Church, and ſtrengthening factions, and
carrying on Intereſts hypocritically under the name of
Religion, till the <hi>Zeal</hi> that Saint <hi>James</hi> deſcribeth,
(<hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) having conſumed all that
was tike to the <hi>Zeal of Love and Holineſs</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
proceed to conſume the Servants and intereſt of
Chriſt about them and to bite and devoure, till their
Lord come and find them in a day that they locked not
for him, ſmiting their fellow-ſervants, and eating
<pb facs="tcp:45240:6"/>
and drinking with the drunken, and cut them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and appoint them their portion with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,

<hi>Matth,</hi> 24. 49, 50, 51.</p>
            <p>O ſtudy, and preach, and hear, and pray, and
live, and uſe your brethren that differ from you in
ſome opinions, as you would do if you were going to
receive your doom, and as will then be moſt acceptable
to your Lord! The guilt of ſenſuality, worldineſs, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
of uncharitableneſs, cruelty and injuſtice, of
loſing time, and betraying your ſouls by negligence,
or perfidiouſneſs and wilful ſin, will lie heavyer upon
a departing Soul, then now in the drunkenneſs of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
you can think: Chriſt will never receive ſuch Souls
in their extremity, unleſs upon repentance by faith in
his blood, they are waſhed from this pollution. It
is unſpeakably terrible to die, without a confidence that
Chriſt will receive us: And little knows the graceleſs
world what ſincerity and ſimplicity in holineſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the ſoundneſs of ſuch a confidence.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that know not that they muſt die, or
know of no life hereafter, hold on their chaſe of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till they find what they loſt their lives, and
Souls, and labour for: But if thou be a Chriſtian, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what is thy work! Thou wilt net need the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of man, nor worldly wealth to prevail with Chriſt
to Receive thy ſpirit: O learn thy <hi>Laſt Work,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art put upon the doing of it. The world of
ſpirits to which we are paſſing, doth better know than
<pb facs="tcp:45240:7"/>
this world of fleſhly darkened ſinners, the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Death of a Heavenly Believer,
and of an earthly ſenſualiſt. Believe, it is a thing
poſſible to get that apprehenſion of the Love of Chriſt,
that confidence of his Receiving us, and ſuch famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
pleaſant thoughts of our entertainment by him, as
ſhall much overcome the fears of Death, and make
it a welcome day to us when we ſhall be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Celeſtial ſociety. And the difference between
one mans Death and anothers, dependeth on the difference
between Heart and Heart, Life and Life, Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Vnpreparedneſs.</p>
            <p>It you ask me, How may ſo happy a Preparation be
made? I have told you in this following Diſcourſe,
and more fully elſe where formerly. I ſhall add now
theſe few Directions following.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Follow the flattering world no further:</hi>
Come off from all expectation of felicity below: <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
nothing under the Sun;</hi> but only uſe it in
order to your enjoyment of the real ſure delight:
Take heed of being <hi>too much pleaſed</hi> in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Have you houſes, and lands, and offices, and
honours, and friends that are very pleaſing to you?
Take heed; for that is the killing ſnare! Shut
your eyes, and wink them all into nothing; and
caſt by your contrivances, and cares, and fears,
and remember you have another work to do.</p>
            <p>2. Live in Communion with a ſuffering Chriſt:
<pb facs="tcp:45240:7"/>
ſtudy well the whole life and nature of his ſufferings;
and the reaſon of them; and think how deſirable
it is to be conformed to him: Thus look to Jeſus,
that for the joy that was ſet before him, deſpiſed
the ſhame, and endured the Croſs, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of ſinners againſt himſelf. Dwell upon
this example that the image of a humbled ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt being deeply imprinted on thy mind,
may draw thy heart into a juſter reliſh of a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſtate: Sure he is no good Chriſtian that thinks
it not better to live as Chriſt did (in holy poverty
and ſufferings in the world) then as <hi>Croeſus</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
or any ſuch worldling and ſelf-pleaſure lived. <hi>Die daily,</hi>
by following Jeſus with your <hi>Croſs,</hi> and when you
<hi>have a while ſuffered with him,</hi> he will <hi>make
you perfect, and receive your ſpirits,</hi> and you
<hi>ſhall reign with him:</hi> It wonderfully prepareth for
a comfortable Death, to live in the <hi>fellowſhip of
the ſufferings of Chriſt:</hi> He is moſt likely to die
quietly, patiently and joyfully, that can firſt be poor,
be neglected, be ſcorned, be wronged, be ſlandered,
be impriſoned, quietly, patiently and joyfully. If
you were but at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> you would with ſome
love and pleaſure go up <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> and think,
<hi>[Chriſt went this very way]</hi> You would
Love to ſee the place where he was born, the
way which he went when he carryed his Croſs,
the holy grave where he was buried, (where there
in a Temple which Pilgrims uſe to viſit, from
whence they uſe to bring the <hi>mark</hi> as a pleaſing
badge of honour.) But how much <hi>More of Chriſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45240:8"/>
is there in <hi>our ſuffering for his Cauſe and Truth?</hi>
and in following him in a mortified ſelf-denying life,
then in following him in the path that he hath trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon earth? His enemies ſaw his Croſs, his
Grave, his Mother, his perſon: This did not heal
their ſinful Souls and make them happy. But the
Croſs that he calleth us to bear, is, <hi>a life of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> in which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>be exceeding glad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Reward is great in Heaven,</hi> though
<hi>all manner of evil be ſpoken of us falſly</hi> by men
on earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. This is called a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pertakers of Chriſts ſufferings,</hi> in which we
are commanded <hi>to rejoyce; that when this glory
ſhall be revealed, we may be glad with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
joy,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 13. And as <hi>the
ſufferings of Chriſt abound towards us, ſo will
our Conſolation abound by Chriſt;</hi> 1 Cor.
1. 5. Till we come up to a life of willing <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi>
and <hi>pleaſed contented ſuffering with
Chriſt,</hi> we are in the <hi>lower form</hi> of his School,
and as <hi>Children,</hi> ſhall tremble at that which ſhould
not cauſe our terrour, and through miſapprehenſions of
the caſe of a <hi>departing ſoul,</hi> ſhall be <hi>afraid</hi> of that which
ſhould be our <hi>joy.</hi> I am not <hi>ſuch</hi> an enemy to the
eſteem of <hi>relicks,</hi> but if one could ſhew me the very
<hi>ſtock</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſate in when they ſung
<hi>Pſalms</hi> in their impriſonment, <hi>Acts 16.</hi> I could be
contented to be put (for the like cauſe) into the ſame
ſtocks, with a ſpecial willingneſs and pleaſure: How
much more ſhould we be willing to be <hi>conformed
<pb facs="tcp:45240:8"/>
to our ſuffering Lord,</hi> in a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of true
<hi>mortification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Hold Communion alſo with his ſuffering Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<hi>Deſire not to dwell in the</hi> tents of wickedneſs,
<hi>nor to be planted among them that</hi> flouriſh for a time,
that they may be deſtroyed for ever, Pſal. 92. 6,
7. <hi>I had rather have</hi> Bradford's heart <hi>and</hi> faggot,
<hi>than</hi> Bonners Biſhoprick. <hi>It was</hi> holy Stephen,
<hi>and not thoſe that</hi> ſtoned him, <hi>that</hi> ſaw Heaven opened,
<hi>and the</hi> Son of Man ſitting at the right hand of God,
Acts 7. 56. <hi>and that could joyfully ſay,</hi> Lord Jeſus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my Spirit. <hi>He</hi> liveth not <hi>by</hi> Faith <hi>(though he
may be a hanger on that keepeth up ſome profeſſion for fear
of being damned) who</hi> chooſeth <hi>not</hi> rather to ſuffer
affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy
the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, and eſteemeth not
the very reproach of Chriſt greater riches than
the treaſures of the world, as having reſpect to
the recompence of reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. 26.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Live as if Heaven were open to your ſight:</hi>
and then dote upon the delights of worldlings if you
can: Then love a life of fleſhly caſe and honour better
than to be with Chriſt, if yon can. But of this I
have ſpoken at large in other writings.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, make it the ſtudy and buſineſs of thy Life,
to learn to do thy <hi>Laſt Work</hi> well; that <hi>Work</hi>
which muſt be done but <hi>once;</hi> that ſo <hi>Death</hi>
which tranſmits <hi>unholy Souls</hi> into utter darkneſs
and deſpair, may deliver thy <hi>Spirit</hi> into thy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers
<pb facs="tcp:45240:9"/>
deemers hands</hi> to be <hi>Received to his Glory;</hi>
according to that bleſſed promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 12. 26.
And while I am in the fleſh, beg the ſame mercy

            <p>THE <hi>Birth</hi> of Nature, and the <hi>New
Birth</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> in their meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the <hi>Death of Saints,</hi> which
is the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi> It is a bitter-ſweet
day, a day that is mixt of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and joy, when Nature muſt quit its familiar
Gueſt, and yield to any of theſe Changes. Our
<hi>Natural Birth</hi> is not without the throws and
pain, and groanings of the Mother, though it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Child into a more large, and lightſom, and
deſirable Habitation: Our <hi>Spiritual Birth</hi> is not
without its humbling and heart-piercing ſorrows:
and when we are <hi>brought out of darkneſs into the
marvellous light,</hi> we leave our old Companions,
in diſpleaſure, whom we forſake, and our Fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45240:10"/>
at the loſs of its ſenſual delights: And our
<hi>paſſage into Glory</hi> is not without thoſe pangs and
fears which muſt needs be the attendants of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Body, ready to be diſſolved, and a Soul that is
going through ſo ſtrait a door, into a ſtrange
though a moſt bleſſed place; And it leaveth our
lamenting Friends behind, that feel their loſs, and
would longer have enjoyed our Company, and <hi>ſee
not</hi>(though they <hi>believe</hi>) the Glory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Soul. And this is our caſe, that are brought
hither this day, by an act of Providence ſad to us,
though joyous to our departed Friend; by a Voice
that hath called her into Glory, and called us into
this Mourning plight: Even us that rejoyce in the
thoughts of her Felicity, and are not ſo cruel as to
wiſh her again into this corruptible Fleſh and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
World, from the glorious preſence of the
Lord; and yet ſhould have kept her longer from
it, for our own and others ſakes, if our Wiſdom
had been fit to rule, or our Wills to be fulfilled, or
if our Prayers muſt have been anſwered, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the meaſure of our ſailing Apprehenſions,
or precipitant Deſires. But Folly muſt ſubmit to
the Incomprehenſible Wiſdom; and the Deſire of
the Creature muſt ſtoop to the Will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
The <hi>Intereſt of Chriſt</hi> muſt be <hi>preferred,</hi> when
he calleth for his own; and <hi>our</hi> temporary Intereſt
muſt give place: Fleſh muſt be ſilent, and not
contend; and Duſt muſt not dare to queſtion
God: He knoweth beſt when his Fruit is ripe;
and though he will allow our moderate Sorrows,
he will not ſo much damnifie his Saints, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45240:10"/>
them with us from their Joyful Reſt, till <hi>we</hi>
are content to let them go.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo did Bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi> depart from Glory
to Glory; from a <hi>diſtant ſight</hi> of the Glory of
God, and of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtanding at his right hand, into
the <hi>immediate preſence</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of that Glory:
But yet he muſt paſs the <hi>narrow Port;</hi> enraged
Malice muſt ſtone him till he die; and he muſt
undergo the Pains of Martyrdom, before he reach
to the Glory which he had ſeen: And when he was
arrived in ſafety, he leaveth his Brethren ſcattered
in the Storm, and <hi>Devout men make great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at his burial. Acts</hi> 9. 2. Though it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the ordinary acceptation of the Word
[<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] that they were not <hi>profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
but <hi>devout Proſelytes,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Corneliuſ</hi> and
the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch were) that buried and thus
lamented <hi>Stephen,</hi> as knowing him to be an <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſon,</hi> cruelly murdered by the raging <hi>Jews;</hi>
yet <hi>their Example,</hi> in a Caſe not culpable, but
commendable, may be imitated by <hi>Believers;</hi>
upon condition that, with our ſenſe of the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Perſons,</hi> and of <hi>our loſs</hi> by their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
we exceed them that had but a darker Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in our <hi>joyful ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>felicity</hi> of the <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of the Death of this Holy Man,
was partly that he <hi>ſurpaſſed others,</hi> as being <hi>full of
Faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and partly, that he
<hi>plainly rebuked</hi> the blind and furious <hi>perſecuting
Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and bore a moſt reſolute Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Chriſt. It is an <hi>ill time</hi> when Men muſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45240:11"/>
               <hi>ſuffer</hi> becauſe they are <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>deſerve not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but <hi>reward:</hi> And they are an unhappy People
that have no more Grace or Wit, but to fight againſt
Heaven, and ſet themſelves under the Stroaks of
God's ſevereſt Juſtice, by perſecuting them that
are dear to Chriſt, and faithfully perform their
Duty. It is no ſtrange thing for the ZEAL
and INTEREST of a FACTION to
make Men <hi>mad;</hi> ſo mad, as implacably to rage
againſt the Off ſpring of Heaven, and to hate
Men becauſe they are <hi>faithful</hi> to their <hi>great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and becauſe they are againſt <hi>their Faction;</hi> ſo
mad, as to think that the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of their <hi>Cauſe
requireth</hi> them to deſtroy the <hi>beſt</hi> with the <hi>greateſt
malice,</hi> becauſe they ſtand moſt in their way; and
to forget that Chriſt, the Revenger of his Elect,
doth take all as done to <hi>him</hi> that is done to <hi>them;</hi>
ſo mad, as to forget all the terrible Threatnings of
God, and terrible Inſtances of his avenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
againſt the Enemies of his Servants, whom
he taketh as his own; and to ruine their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
by ſeeking to defame the Upright, whoſe
Names God is engaged to honour, and whoſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun, when fooliſh
Malignity hath done its worſt. When Chriſt had
pleaded his Cauſe effectually with <hi>Saul,</hi> that was
one of the Perſecutors of <hi>Stephen,</hi> he maketh him
confeſs that he was [<gap reason="foreign">

Rage to Heaven: By <hi>killing</hi> him they make him

Life, in imitation of his ſuffering Lord, with a
two-fold Requeſt to Heaven; the one for <hi>himſelf,</hi>
that his <hi>Spirit may be received;</hi> the other for his
<hi>Perſecutors,</hi> that <hi>this ſin may not be laid to their
charge, Acts</hi> 7. 59, 60. For ſo you may find Chriſt
did before him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34, 46. <hi>Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do:</hi>] and, [<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

<hi>Chriſt</hi> directeth <hi>his</hi> Prayer <hi>immediately</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and <hi>Stephen</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as being one that had a
<hi>Mediator,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> had <hi>none,</hi> as <hi>needing none;</hi>
and being now bearing witneſs, by his ſuffering, to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore it was ſeaſonable to direct his
Prayer to him; but eſpecially becauſe it was an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Mediation</hi> that he petitioneth for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
directeth his Petition to the <hi>Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This firſt Requeſt of this dying Saint, which I
have choſen to handle, as ſuitable and ſeaſonable
for our Inſtruction at this time, in a few Words
containeth not a few exceeding uſeful wholeſom
Truths.</p>
            <p>As, 1. It is here plainly intimated, that [<hi>Jeſus
Chriſt is exalted in Glory,</hi>] in that he hath power
to receive departed Souls.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That Chriſt is to be prayed to,</hi>] and that it is
not our Duty to direct all our Prayers <hi>only</hi> to the
<hi>Father.</hi> Eſpecially thoſe things that belong to the
Office of the Mediator, as interceding for us in
the Heavens, muſt be requeſted of the Mediator:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45240:12"/>
And thoſe things which belong to the Father to
give for the ſake of the Mediator, muſt be asked
of the Father for his ſake. I cannot now ſtay to
tell you in particular what belongeth to the one,
and what unto the other.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That Man hath a Spirit, as well as a Body:</hi> of
which, more anon.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That this Spirit dieth not with the Body</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you will call a meer ſeparation a <hi>dying.</hi>)</p>
            <p>5. That Chriſt doth receive the Spirits of his
Saints, when they are ſeparated from the Body.</p>
            <p>6. That a dying Chriſtian may confidently and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
commend his Spirit to Chriſt, to be received
of him.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>That Prayer in general, and this Prayer in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi>
That Chriſt will receive our departing Souls,
<hi>is a moſt ſuitable Concluſion of all the Actions of a
Chriſtian's Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> of theſe Doctrines, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

            <p>The <hi>third</hi> is not queſtioned by any that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf to be a Man: But that we may <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>

whether thou <hi>now</hi> feel it to thy comfort or not,
thou ſhalt <hi>then</hi> feel it to the raviſhing of thy Soul,
that thou didſt not fly to Chriſt in vain, nor truſt
him in vain to be thy Saviour: Satan ſhall be for

<hi>your Son,</hi> or <hi>Husband,</hi> the next day after ſome
bloody Fight, where he had eſcaped with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?
Or your <hi>Child,</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> that arrived ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after a long and a dangerous Voyage? Would
you not run and meet him, and with joy embrace
him, if he had been many years abſent, and were
now come home? I tell thee, poor Soul, thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hath a <hi>larger heart,</hi> and another <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Love</hi>
than thou, and other Reaſons of greater force to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45240:18"/>
move him to bid dice Welcome into his Preſence.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt's <hi>Receiving the departed Soul</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the <hi>State of Bleſſedneſs</hi> into which he doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
it. If you ask, <hi>What that is?</hi> I anſwer, It
is <hi>unto himſelf, to be with him where he is:</hi> And that
in <hi>general</hi> is full of comfort, if there were no
more: For we know that Chriſt is in no ill place;
He is glorified at the <hi>right hand of the Majeſty on
high, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And that the Souls of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and at laſt their Bodies, are <hi>received to himſelf,</hi>
he often telleth us: <hi>John</hi> 12. 26. <hi>If any man ſerve
me, let him follow me; and where I am, there ſhall
alſo my ſervant be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] John</hi> 14. 2, 3. <hi>And if I go to
prepare a place for you, I will come again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there you
may be alſo.</hi>] And in the mean time, when we
once are <hi>abſent from the body, we are preſent with the
Lord, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and that is in [<hi>the building of
God, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</hi> V. 1.
<hi>Paul</hi> therefore deſired <hi>to depart and be with Chriſt,
as being far better,] Phil.</hi> 1. 23. And Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
the converted Thief, <hi>[This day ſhalt thou
be with me in Paradiſe,] Luke</hi> 23. 43. And our
State after the Reſurrection hath the ſame deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>[And ſo ſhall we ever be with
the Lord:</hi>] And what it ſhall be, he declareth
himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they whom
thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they
may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> The
Soul of <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. was <hi>received into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
boſom,</hi> where he is ſaid <hi>to be comforted. The
heavens receive Chriſt,</hi> Acts 3. 21. and therefore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45240:18"/>
                  <hi>the heavens receive the ſpirits that go to him:</hi> even
the <hi>ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12. 23.
that is, that are crowned with Chriſt in Glory, and
freed from the Imperfections and Evils of this
Life. And ſo that 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 10. is plain, though
ſome would pervert it, <hi>[That whether we wake or
ſleep, we may live together with him]:</hi> Not [Whether
we wake to righteouſneſs, or ſleep in ſin]; for
ſuch Sleepers live not with him: Nor [whether
we wake by ſollicitude, or ſleep in ſecurity]: Nor
[Whether we naturally wake or ſleep] only: But
whether we live, or die, and ſo our Bodies ſleep in
death, yet we live together with him. In a word,
Chriſt will receive us unto a <hi>participation of his
Joy and Glory;</hi> into a <hi>Joy</hi> as great as our Nature
ſhall be capable of, and more than we can now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and that the largeſt Heart on Earth can juſtly
conceive of or comprehend. And becauſe all this
tells you but to the <hi>ear,</hi> ſtay yet but a little
while, and <hi>experimental ſight nnd feeling</hi> ſhall tell
you, What this <hi>Receiving</hi> is; even when we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the kingdom that cannot be moved, Heb.</hi> 12. 28.
and when we <hi>receive the end of our faith, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Poor ſinner, What <hi>thoughts</hi> haſt thou of thy <hi>dying
hour,</hi> and of thy <hi>departing Soul!</hi> I wonder at thee,
what thoughts thou haſt of them, that thou canſt
ſin ſo boldly, and live ſo careleſly and talk or hear
of the life to come ſo ſenſeleſly as thou doſt! Thou
mighteſt well think I wronged thee, if I took
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45240:19"/>
thee to be ſuch a <hi>brute</hi> as not to know that thou
<hi>muſt die!</hi> Thy <hi>Soul</hi> that brought thy <hi>body hither,</hi>
that cauſeth it <hi>now</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>underſtand,</hi> that
carryeth it up and down the world, muſt very
ſhortly be <hi>required of thee,</hi> and muſt ſeek another
habitation. What thoughts haſt thou of <hi>thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
Soul!</hi> Will <hi>Chriſt receive it?</hi> Haſt thou
made <hi>ſure</hi> of that? Or haſt thou made it thy
<hi>principal care</hi> and <hi>buſineſs</hi> to make ſure! O what
doth intoxicate the brains of ſenſual worldly men,
that they drown themſelves in the Cares of this
Life, and ride and run for tranſitory Riches, and
live upon the Smoak of Honour and Applauſe, and
never ſoberly and ſeriouſly bethink them, whether
Chriſt will <hi>receive</hi> their <hi>departed Souls!</hi> That they
can fill their <hi>minds</hi> with <hi>other thoughts,</hi> and fill their
<hi>mouthes</hi> with <hi>other talk,</hi> and conſume their <hi>time</hi> in
<hi>other</hi> inconſiderable <hi>employments;</hi> and take no more
care, and ſpend no more thoughts, and words, and
time, about the <hi>entertainment</hi> of their <hi>departing Souls!</hi>
When they are <hi>even ready</hi> to be gone, and
ſtand as it were on tip-toes; when <hi>Fevers,</hi> and
<hi>Conſumptions,</hi> and many hundred Diſeaſes are all
abroad ſo buſily diſtributing their Summons; and
when the Gates of Death have ſo many Paſſengers
<hi>crowding</hi> in, and <hi>Souls</hi> are making ſuch <hi>haſte away,</hi>
will you not conſider what ſhall become of <hi>yours?</hi>
Will you ſay, that you <hi>hope well,</hi> and you <hi>muſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
If God had appointed you <hi>nothing to do,</hi> to
<hi>prepare</hi> for your ſafe paſſage and entertainment

and unrenewed and unjuſtified ſtate, it is <hi>paſt</hi> all
<hi>ventures;</hi> for it is <hi>certain</hi> that Chriſt will <hi>not receive</hi>
you: You may talk of <hi>hoping,</hi> dut it is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to <hi>be hoped</hi> for. <hi>Hope</hi> that God will make good
every <hi>word of his Promiſe,</hi> and ſpare not: But there
is no more <hi>Hope</hi> that Chriſt will <hi>Receive</hi> the <hi>ſouls</hi>
of <hi>any</hi> but of <hi>his members,</hi> than there is that he will
<hi>prove a lyar.</hi> He never <hi>promiſed</hi> to ſave <hi>any others:</hi>
and that is not all; but he hath declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
frequently that <hi>he will not.</hi> And you are no
<hi>Believers</hi> if you will not <hi>believe him:</hi> And if you
<hi>believe him,</hi> you muſt believe that the <hi>unbelievers,</hi>
the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> the <hi>unholy</hi> and the <hi>workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
ſhall not be received into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
For he hath profeſſed it, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 36. <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt would <hi>Receive</hi> the ſouls of <hi>all,</hi> your
<hi>venture</hi> then had <hi>reaſon</hi> for it: Or if he had left it
as a thing that depended only on his <hi>unrevealed
will,</hi> and not on any <hi>preparations</hi> of <hi>our own,</hi> we
might then have <hi>quit our ſelves</hi> of the care, and caſt
it all <hi>on him,</hi> as being <hi>his part,</hi> and <hi>none of ours:</hi>
But it is <hi>not ſo:</hi> I hope I need not <hi>tell you</hi> that, <hi>it
is not ſo:</hi> Believe it, the Queſtion muſt be <hi>Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi>
and <hi>reſolved by your ſelves, whether Chriſt
ſhall Receive your departed ſouls,</hi> or <hi>caſt them off</hi>
as <hi>firebrands for Hell?</hi> He hath <hi>made</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and
ſet down the <hi>terms already</hi> to which he will unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably
ſtand, and which we muſt truſt to. <hi>It is
now that you muſt labour to be accepted of him: For
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45240:21"/>
we muſt all appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt,
that every one may receive the things done in his body,
according to that he hath done, whether it be good or
bad,]</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 9, 10. O Sirs, this is the reaſon of
our <hi>importunity</hi> with you: <hi>Knowing the terrors of
the Lord, we perſuade men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in the
next words, <hi>verſ. 11.</hi> We know that the <hi>ſentence</hi>
will be <hi>juſt,</hi> and that it <hi>is now in your own hands
what judgment then ſhall paſs upon you!</hi> And if <hi>juſt
now</hi> your ſouls were <hi>paſſing hence,</hi> before you went
from the place you ſit in, would you think any
care could be too great, to make ſure that they
ſhould go to happineſs! O that you would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how much it is <hi>your own work,</hi> and how much
it reſteth on <hi>your ſelves</hi> what Chriſt ſhall then do
with you! <hi>Then</hi> you will cry to <hi>him</hi> for mercy, <hi>[O
caſt not away a miſerable ſoul! Lord, receive me into
thy Kingdom.]</hi> But <hi>now</hi> he muſt intreat <hi>you</hi> to be ſaved,
and to <hi>be</hi> the people that he <hi>may then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
and you will not hear him: And if <hi>you will
not hear him,</hi> when he calleth on you, and beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you to <hi>Repent</hi> and to <hi>prepare;</hi> as ſure as Chriſt
is Chriſt, <hi>he will not hear you</hi> when you cry and call
for mercy too late in your extremity. Read <hi>Prov.</hi>
1. and you will ſee this is true. It is <hi>you</hi> that are
to be <hi>entreated</hi> that <hi>Chriſt may receive</hi> you; for the
<hi>unwillingneſs</hi> and <hi>backwardneſs</hi> is on <hi>your part: You</hi>
are now poyſoning your ſouls by ſin, and when we
cannot intreat you either to <hi>forbear</hi> or to take the
<hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Repentance:</hi> yet when you are gaſping
and dying of your own willful ſelf-murder, you will
then cry to Chriſt, and think <hi>he muſt receive you</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45240:22"/>
upon terms inconſiſtent with his juſtice, holineſs
and truth. But flatter not your ſelves; it will not
be: <hi>This is the accepted time: behold now is the day
of ſalvation:</hi> refuſe it now, and it is loſt for ever.
O Sirs, if <hi>this were the hour,</hi> and you were <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to be <hi>received</hi> or <hi>refuſed,</hi> would you blame me
to cry and call to you with all the fervour of my
ſoul, if I knew that it were in your <hi>own choice,</hi>
whether you would go to Heaven or Hell? Why,
<hi>now it is in your choice!</hi> Life and Death are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you. <hi>Chriſt will receive you</hi> if you will but
come within the capacity of his acceptation. If you
<hi>will not,</hi> there will <hi>then</hi> be no remedy: It is a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing to obſerve how Satan doth bewitch poor
ſinners! That when time is gone, and the door of
mercy is ſhut againſt them, they would think no
cries too loud for mercy, and no importunity too
great: for Chriſt telleth us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 10, 11. that
they they will cry [<hi>Lord, Lord, open to us:</hi>] And
yet now when the door ſtands open, no <hi>arguments,</hi>
no <hi>earneſtneſs,</hi> no <hi>tears</hi> can <hi>intreat</hi> them to enter
in; <hi>Then</hi> there is not the moſt ſenſeleſs ſinner of
you all, but would cry more ſtrongly than <hi>Eſau</hi>
for the bleſſing, (when his <hi>tears</hi> could <hi>find no place
for repentance,</hi> Heb. 12. 16, 17.) [<hi>Lord receive a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſoul! O whither ſhall I go, if thou receive me
not! I muſt elſe be tormented in thoſe ſcorching flames:</hi>]
And yet <hi>now</hi> you will <hi>ſell your birthright for one
morſel;</hi> for a little of <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Gehezi</hi>'s gain, for
the applauſe of worms, for the pleaſing of your
fleſh that is turning to corruption; for the delights
of gluttony, drunkenneſs, ſports or luſt. There
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45240:22"/>
is not a man of you but would <hi>then pray more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly</hi>
than thoſe that you now <hi>deride</hi> for <hi>earneſt
praying,</hi> as if they <hi>whined</hi> and were <hi>ridiculous:</hi> And
yet <hi>now</hi> you will neither be <hi>ſerious in prayer,</hi> nor
hear Chriſt or his meſſengers, when he maketh it
his <hi>earneſt requeſt</hi> to <hi>you</hi> to come in to him, that
you may have life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Then</hi> you will knock
when the door is ſhut, and cry [<hi>Lord open to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſinner:</hi>] and yet <hi>now</hi> you <hi>will not open</hi> unto
<hi>him,</hi> when by his word and ſpirit, her mercies and
afflictions, he ſtandeth at the door of your ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
hearts, and calleth on you to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>turn
to God;</hi> Now our <hi>intreaties</hi> cannot ſo much as
bring you on <hi>your knees,</hi> or bring you to <hi>one hours
ſerious thoughts,</hi> about the ſtate of thoſe ſouls that
are ſo near their doom. O Sirs, for your ſouls
ſake, lay by your obſtinacy: Pity thoſe ſouls
that then you will beg of Chriſt to pity. Do not
<hi>you damn</hi> them by your ſloth and ſin, in the day of
your viſitation, and then cry in vain to <hi>Chriſt to
ſave them,</hi> when it is too late. <hi>Yet</hi> the door of
grace is open: But how ſpeedily will it be ſhut?
One ſtroak of an Apoplexy, a Conſumption, a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
can quickly ſhut it; and then you may tear
your hearts with crying [<hi>Lord open to us</hi>] and all in
vain. O did you but <hi>ſee departed ſouls,</hi> as you ſee
the <hi>corps</hi> that is left behind! Did <hi>you ſee</hi> how they
are <hi>treated</hi> at their removal from the fleſh? how
<hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>others left!</hi> how <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to Chriſt, and <hi>others</hi> are <hi>abhorred,</hi> and turned
over to the tormenter, and <hi>thruſt out</hi> with impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
indignation and diſdain (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 28. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45240:23"/>
24, 26, 27.) ſure you would enter into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
this day, <hi>What it is that makes this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi>
and <hi>why Chriſt ſo uſeth the one and the other;
and what muſt be done now, by the ſoul that would be
received then?</hi> Alas, men will do <hi>any thing,</hi> but that
which they <hi>ſhould do!</hi> Among the ſuperſtitious
Papiſts, the conceit of a deliverance from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
makes them bequeath their Lands and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
to Prieſts and Friars to pray for them when
they are dead, and to have other men cry to Chriſt
to <hi>receive them, and open to them,</hi> when time is paſt:
And yet <hi>now in the accepted time,</hi> now when it is
at <hi>your choice,</hi> and the <hi>door is open,</hi> men live as if
they were <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and cared not what became
of them at the laſt, and would not be beholden to
Chriſt to <hi>receive</hi> them, when the deceitful world
hath caſt them off.</p>
               <p>And now, Beloved Hearers all, I would make
it my moſt earneſt requeſt to you, as one that
knoweth we are all paſſing hence, and foreſeeth
the caſe of a departed ſoul, that you would now
without any more delay, prepare and make ſure
that you may be <hi>received</hi> into the everlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations:
And to this end, I ſhall more diſtinctly,
though briefly tell you, 1. <hi>What ſouls they are that
Chriſt will receive, and what he will not:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
<hi>what you muſt do to be received. 2. What
conſiderations ſhould ſtir you up to this preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. Nothing is more ſure than that Chriſt will
<hi>not receive,</hi> 1. Any <hi>unregenerate, unconverted ſoul,</hi>
John 3. 3, 5. Matth. 18. 3. that is <hi>not renewed</hi> and
<hi>ſanctified by his ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Heb. 12. 14. Acts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45240:23"/>
26. 18. They muſt have the <hi>new</hi> and <hi>heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
that will ever come to Heaven: Without this
you are morally uncapable of it. <hi>Heaven</hi> is the
proper <hi>inheritance of Saints,</hi> Col. 1. 12. This hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
nature, and ſpirit, is <hi>your earneſt:</hi> If you have
this, you are <hi>ſealed up unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 22.
Epheſ. 1. 13. &amp; 4. 30.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt will <hi>receive none</hi> but thoſe that make
it <hi>now</hi> their <hi>work</hi> to <hi>lay up a treaſure in heaven,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than upon the earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20, 21. and that
<hi>ſeek it in the firſt place,</hi> Mat. 6. 33. and can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to part with all to purchaſe it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44,
46. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 33. &amp; 18. 22. An earthly-minded
worldling is uncapable of heaven, in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 13. You muſt take
it for your portion, and ſet your hearts on it, if
ever you will come thither; <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt will <hi>Receive</hi> no ſoul at laſt, but ſuch
as ſincerely received him as their Lord and Saviour
now, and gave up themſelves to him, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Word, and yield obedience to it, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Spirit, and were cleanſed by him from their
iniquities, <hi>John</hi> 1. 11, 12, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 27. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10,
12. [<hi>That all they might be damned that believed not
the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>] (They
are God's own words: be not offended at them,
but believe and fear.) <hi>He hateth all the workers of
iniquity,</hi> and will ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me, I
know you not,</hi> Pſal. 5. 5. Matth. 7. 23.</p>
               <p>4. He will <hi>receive</hi> none but thoſe that loved his
ſervants, that bore his holy image, and <hi>received</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45240:24"/>
them according to their abilities, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40,
41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if he will ſay to thoſe that did not
entertain them [<hi>Depart form me ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
fire,</hi>] what will he ſay to thoſe that <hi>hate and
perſecute them?</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. &amp; 5. 2.</p>
               <p>5. He will <hi>receive none</hi> but thoſe that <hi>live to him</hi>
in the body, and uſe his gifts and talents to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and make it their chief buſineſs to ſerve, and
honour, and pleaſe him in the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.
21, 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. and <hi>live not to
the pleaſing of the fleſh,</hi> but have <hi>crucified it and its
luſts,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 13. Gal. 5. 24.</p>
               <p>Examine all theſe Texts of Scripture (for the
matter is worthy of your ſtudy) and you will ſee
what ſouls they are that Chriſt will <hi>then Receive,</hi>
and what he will reject. You may ſee alſo what
you muſt <hi>now be</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> if you will be <hi>then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
If you are <hi>not regenerate</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> (though you may be Sacramentally regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in Baptiſm;) If you are not <hi>juſtified by Chriſt,</hi>
(though you may be abſolved by a Miniſter;) If
If you ſeek not Heaven with higher eſtimation
and reſolutions that any felicity on earth, and take
not God for your ſatisfying portion; (though you
be never ſo Religious in ſubſerviency to a fleſhly
worldly happineſs;) If you <hi>Receive not Chriſt</hi> as
your only Saviour, and ſet him not in the Throne
and Government of your hearts and lives (though
you may go with men for currant Chriſtians;) If
you hate not ſin, if you love not the holy image,
and children of God, and uſe them not according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
If you crucifie not the fleſh, and die not to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45240:24"/>
world, and deny not your ſelves, and live not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, as making it your chief buſineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to pleaſe him: I ſay, if this be not your
caſe, as ſure as you are men, if you died this hour
in this condition, Chriſt will not own you, but
turn you off with a [<hi>Depart ye curſed:</hi>] You may
as well think of reconciling <hi>light and darkneſs,</hi> or
perſuade a <hi>man</hi> to live on the <hi>food of beaſts,</hi> or the
<hi>ſtomach</hi> to welcome <hi>deadly poyſon,</hi> as to think that
Chriſt will receive an ungodly, earthly, guilty ſoul.</p>
               <p>Deceive not your ſelves ſinners: If God could
have entertained the ungodly, and Heaven could
hold unholy ſouls, anſwer me then theſe two or
three Queſtions.</p>
               <p>1. What need Chriſt then to have ſhed his blood,
or become a ſacrifice for ſin? if he <hi>could</hi> have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ungodly,</hi> he might have done it upon
cheaper rates. This feigneth him to have died to
no purpoſe; but to bring the unſanctified to heaven,
that might have been as well entertained there
without his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>2. To what uſe doth Chriſt ſend the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi>
to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> his Elect? Or ſend his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
to promote it, if they may come to heaven
<hi>unſanctified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the ungodly go to Heaven, what uſe is <hi>Hell</hi>
for? There is no Hell if this be true! But you will
quickly find that to be too good news to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
to be true.</p>
               <p>II. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Chriſt teacheth us our duty by
the parable of the Steward, that asketh himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
<hi>What he ſhall do when he muſt be no longer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45240:25"/>
Steward?</hi> and contriveth it ſo that others may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him</hi> when he is caſt off: And he applieth it to
us hat muſt now ſo provide, that <hi>when we fail, we
may be received into the everlaſting habitations.</hi> This
is the work that we have all to mind! We always
knew that this world would fail us: O how uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is your tenure of the dwellings that you now
poſſeſs! Are you <hi>provided, certainly provided whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go, and who ſhall Receive you</hi> when your
Stewardſhip is ended, and you muſt needs go hence?
O think of theſe conſiderations that ſhould move
you preſently to provide.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Your Cottages of earth are ready to drop down;</hi>
and it is a ſtormy time, there are many ſickneſſes
abroad: One blaſt may quickly lay them in the
duſt; and them the fleſh that had ſo much care, and
was thought worthy to be preferred before the ſoul,
muſt be laid and left to rot in darkneſs, to avoid
the annoyance of the living: And when you may
juſtly look every hour when you are turned
out of theſe dwellings that you are in, is it not
time to be provided of ſome other?</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, <hi>if Chriſt</hi> ſhould not <hi>receive thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
how unſpeakably deplorable thy caſe will be?</hi> I
think there is no man in all this Aſſembly ſo mad,
that would take all the <hi>world now,</hi> to have his ſoul
<hi>refuſed then</hi> by Chriſt; that would profeſſedly make
and ſubſcribe ſuch a bargain: And yet alas, how
many are they that will be hired for a ſmaller
price, even for the pleaſure of a ſin, to do that
which Chirſt himſelf hath told them, will <hi>cauſe</hi> him
to <hi>Refuſe</hi> them? O Sirs, for ought you know, before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45240:25"/>
to morrow, or within this week, you may be put
to <hi>know theſe things by tryal,</hi> and <hi>your Souls</hi> may be
<hi>refuſed</hi> or <hi>received:</hi> And wo to you that ever you
were Men, if Chriſt receive you not.</p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>If Chirſt receive thee not, thou haſt
no Friend left then to receive thee.</hi> Thy Houſe,
and Land, an Riches, and Reputation, are all left
behind; none of them will go with thee; or if
they did, they could afford thee no relief. Thy
Boſom-friends, thy powerful Defenders, are all left
behind; or if they go before or with thee, they
can do nothing there, that could do ſo much for
thee here. No Miniſter ſo holy, no Friend ſo kind,
no Patron ſo powerful, that can give thee any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
if Chriſt refuſe to entertain thee.
Look to the right hand or the left, there will be
none to help thee, or care for thy forſaken Soul.
Then thou wilt find, that one Chriſt had been a
better Friend, than all the Great ones upon Earth.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If Chriſt then receive not thy departed Soul,
the Devils will receive it.</hi> I am loth to ſpeak ſo
terrible a word, but that it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſpoken, if you
will be awaked to prevent it. He that deceived
thee, will then plead Conqueſt, and claim thee as
his due, that he may torment thee. And if the
Devil ſay, <hi>This Soul is mine;</hi> and Chriſt do not
reſcue and juſtifie thee, but ſay ſo too, no heart is
able to conceive the horrour that will then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
thee: Doth not the reading of the Sentence
make thee tremble, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. <hi>[Depart from me
ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his Angels]?</hi> This is that dreadful <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45240:26"/>
up to Satan,</hi> when the Soul is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the City of God. O therefore if thou
be yet unreconciled to God, <hi>agree with him quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
while thou art here in the way, leſt he deliver thee
to</hi> this terrible Jaylor and Executioner, and <hi>thou
be caſt into the priſon of the bottomleſs pit: Verily
I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt by no means come out
thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing,</hi>
Mat. 5. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The greatneſs of the change will increaſe the
amazement and miſery of thy Spirit, if Chriſt receive
it not.</hi> To leave a World that thou waſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, a World that pleaſed thee and entertained
thee, a World where thou hadſt long thy buſineſs
and delight, and where (wretched man!) thou
hadſt made thy chief provision, and laid up thy
treaſure; this will be a ſad part of the Change.
To enter into a World where thou art a ſtranger,
and much worſe, and ſee the company and the
things that before thou never ſaweſt, and to find
things go there ſo contrary to thy expectation;
to be turned with <hi>Dives</hi> from thy ſumptuous
Dwelling, Attendance, and Fare, into a place of
eaſeleſs torment; this will be a ſadder part of thy
Change. <hi>Here</hi> the Rich would have received thee,
the Poor would have ſerved and flattered thee, thy
Friends would have comforted thee, thy Play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
would have been merry with thee: But <hi>there,</hi>
alas, how the caſe is altered! All theſe have done;
the Table is withdrawn, the Game is ended, the
Mirth is ceaſed; and now ſucceedeth, [<hi>Son, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45240:26"/>
things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things: but now he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and thou art tormented,] Luke</hi> 16. 25. O
dreadful Change to thoſe that made the World
their home, and little dreamed (or did but dream)
of ſuch a day! Never to ſee this World again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by ſuch reviews as will torment them! never
to have ſport or pleaſure more; and for theſe to
have ſuch Company, ſuch Thoughts, ſuch Work
and Uſage, as God hath told us is in Hell!</p>
               <p>4. <hi>If Chriſt receive thee not, the burden of thy
ſins will overwhelm thee, and conſcience will have no
relief.</hi> Sin will not then appear in ſo harmleſs a
ſhape as now; it will then ſeem a more odious or
frightful thing. O to remember theſe days of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of careleſs, ſluggiſh, obſtinate folly, of ſottiſh
negligence, and contempt of Grace, will be a more
tormenting thing than you will now believe. If
ſuch Sermons and Diſcourſes as foretel it are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to thee, what then will that ſad Experience
be?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The wrath of an offended God will overwhelm
thee.</hi> This will be thy Hell. He that was ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
in the time of Mercy, will be moſt terrible
and implacable when that time is paſt, and make
men know that Chriſt and Mercy are not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
refuſed, and abuſed at ſo cheap a rate, as they
would needs imagine in the time of their delira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>It will overwhelm the Soul, if Chriſt receive it
not, to ſee that then art entring upon Eternity, even
into an everlaſting ſtate of Woe.</hi> Then thou wilt
think, O whither am I going? What muſt I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45240:27"/>
And how long! How long! When ſhall
my miſery have an end! and When ſhall I come
back! and How ſhall I ever be delivered! O now
what thoughts wilt thou have of the wonderful
Deſign of God in Man's Redemption! Now thou
wilt better underſtand what a Saviour was worth,
and how he ſhould have been believed in, and how
his Goſpel and his ſaving Grace ſhould have been
entertained.</p>
               <p>O that the Lord would now open your hearts
to entertain it, that you may not then value it to
your vexation, that would not value it now to
your relief! Poor ſinner, for the Lord's ſake, and
for thy Souls ſake, I beg now of thee, as if it were
on my knees, that thou wouldſt caſt away thy
ſinful Cares and Pleaſures, and open thy Heart,
and now receive thy Saviour and his ſaving Grace,
as ever thou wouldſt have him then <hi>receive</hi> thy
trembling departed Soul! Turn to him now, that
he may not turn thee from him then: Forſake him
not for a flattering World, a little tranſitory vain
Delight, as ever thou wouldſt not then have thy
departed Soul forſaken by him! O delay not, Man;
but <hi>now,</hi> even <hi>now receive him,</hi> that thou maiſt
avoid ſo terrible a danger, and put ſo great a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſently out of doubt, and be able comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to ſay, [<hi>I have received Chriſt, and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me; if I die this night, he will receive me.</hi>]
Then thou maiſt ſleep quietly, and live merrily,
without any diſparagement to thy Reaſon. O
yield to this Requeſt, Sinner, of one that deſireth
thy Salvation. If thou wert now departing, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45240:27"/>
I would not pray earneſtly to <hi>Chriſt to receive thy
Soul,</hi> thou wouldſt think I were uncharitable:
Alas! it will be one of theſe days: and it is <hi>thee</hi>
that I muſt <hi>entreat,</hi> and thy <hi>ſelf</hi> that muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with, or there is no hope: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſendeth me
to <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>he is willing to receive
thee, if now thou wilt receive him, and be ſanctified
and ruled by him:</hi> The matter ſtops at <hi>thy own</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
wilful heart. What ſayſt thou? <hi>Wilt thou
receive Chriſt now, or not?</hi> Wilt thou be <hi>a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and live to God, by the Principle of his Spirit,
and the Rule of his Word, to pleaſe him here, that
thou maiſt live with him for ever?</hi> Wilt thou take
up this <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and make this <hi>Covenant</hi> with
God this day? O give me a word of comfort, and
ſay, Thou art <hi>reſolved,</hi> and wilt deliver up thy ſelf
to Chriſt. That which is <hi>my comfort now</hi> on thy
behalf, will be ten thouſand-fold more <hi>thy comfort
then,</hi> when thou partakeſt of the Benefit: And if
thou <hi>grieve us now,</hi> by denying thy Soul to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
it will be at <hi>laſt</hi> ten thouſand-fold more <hi>thy grief.</hi>
Refuſe not <hi>our requeſts</hi> and <hi>Chriſts requeſts now,</hi> as
ever thou wouldſt not have him refuſe <hi>thee then,</hi>
and <hi>thy requeſts.</hi> It is <hi>mens turning away</hi> now from
Chriſt, that will cauſe Chriſt then to turn from
them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 31. 32. <hi>The turning away of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſlayeth them,</hi> and they then <hi>eat but the fruit of
their own way, and are filled with their own devices.]
See then that ye now refuſe not him that ſpeaketh:</hi>
for there is no eſcaping <hi>if you turn away from him
that ſpeaketh from heaven,] Heb.</hi> 12. 25.</p>
               <p>What would you ſay your ſelves to the man that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45240:28"/>
would not be diſſuaded from <hi>ſetting his Houſe on
fire,</hi> and then would <hi>pray</hi> and cry importunately
to <hi>God</hi> that he would keep it from being burnt?
Or of the man that will not be diſſuaded from
taking Poyſon; and then when it gripeth him,
will cry to God to ſave his life: Or of the man
that will go to Sea in a leaking broken veſſel, yea
himſelf will make thoſe breaches in it, that ſhall let
the Water in, and when it is ſinking, will cry to
God to ſave him from being drowned? And will
you do this about ſo great a matter as the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtate of your immortal Souls? Will you now
be wordlings, and ſenſualiſts, and ungodly, and
undo your ſelves, and then cry [<hi>Lord Jeſus receive
my Spirit</hi>] at the laſt? What! receive an <hi>unholy
Spirit?</hi> Will you not knock till the door is ſhut?
when he telleth you, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21. That <hi>it is not
every one that will cry Lord, Lord, that ſhall enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of
his Father which is in Heaven.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Laſtly, conſider with what unſpeakable joy it
will fill thy Soul, to be then <hi>received</hi> by the Lord.
O what a joyful word will it be, when thou ſhalt
hear, [<hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you.</hi>] If thou wilt not have
this to be thy caſe, thou ſhalt <hi>ſee thoſe received</hi> to
the increaſe of thy grief, whom thou <hi>refuſedſt</hi> here
to imitate: <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of
Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God,</hi> and thoſe
that <hi>from Eaſt, Weſt, North and South ſhall ſit there
with them,</hi> and <hi>thou thruſt out,] Luke</hi> 13. 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45240:28"/>
I have been long in this part of my application,
having to do with Souls that are ready to depart,
and are in ſo ſad an unprepared ſtate, as is not to
be thought on but with great compaſſion: I am
next to come to that part of the application, which
I chiefly intended; to thoſe that are the Heirs of
Life.</p>
               <p>II. O You that are members of Jeſus Chriſt,
receive this Cordial which may corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
your hearts againſt all inordinate fears of
Death: Let it come when it will, you may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend your departing Souls into the hands
of Chriſt. Let it be by a lingring diſeaſe, or by
an acute, by a natural or a violent death, at the
fulneſs of your age, or in the flower of your youth,
death can but ſeparate the Soul from Fleſh, but
not from Chriſt, Whether you die poor or rich,
at liberty or in priſon, in your native Country or
a forein Land, whether you be buried in the
Earth or caſt into the Sea; death ſhall but ſend
your Souls to Chriſt. Though you die under the
reproach and ſlanders of the world, and your names
be caſt out among men, as evil doers, yet Chriſt
will take your Spirits to himſelf. Though your
Souls depart in fear and trembling, though they
want the ſenſe of the Love of God, and doubt of
pardon and peace with him, yet Chriſt will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them.</p>
               <p>I know thou wilt be ready to ſay, that thou
art <hi>unworthy, [Will he receive ſo unworthy a Soul as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45240:29"/>
mine?</hi>] But if thou be a member of Chriſt, thou
art <hi>worthy in him</hi> to be accepted. <hi>Thou</hi> haſt a <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs</hi>
of <hi>Aptitude,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a <hi>worthineſs</hi> of
<hi>merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day that cometh upon ſuch <hi>at unawares</hi>
that have their <hi>hearts over-charged with ſurfeiting,
drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life,</hi> and <hi>as a ſnare</hi>
ſurprizeth the <hi>inhabitants of the earth,</hi> ſhall be the
day of thy great deliverance: <hi>Watch therefore and
pray alwayes that you way be accounted worthy to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
all thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to
ſtand before the ſon of man;</hi> Luke. 21. 34, 35, 36.
<hi>They that are accounted worthy to obtain that world,
can die no more; for they are equal to the Angels, and
are the children of God,</hi> Luke 20. 35, 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> O but my ſins are great and many; and
will Chriſt ever receive ſo ignorant, ſo earthly and
impure a Soul as mine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he have freed thee from the <hi>reign</hi> of ſin,
by giving thee a <hi>Will that would fain be fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it,</hi> and given thee a <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy,</hi> he will finiſh the work that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
and will not bring thee <hi>defiled</hi> into Heaven,
but will <hi>waſh</hi> thee in his <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſeparate all
the remnant of corruption from thy Soul, when
he ſeparateth thy Soul from fleſh: There needs
no <hi>purgatory</hi> but his <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the inſtant
of death ſhall deliver thee, that he may preſent
thee <hi>ſpotleſs</hi> to the Father.</p>
               <p>O fear not then to <hi>truſt thy Soul</hi> with him that
will <hi>Receive</hi> it: And fear not <hi>death,</hi> that can do
thee no more harm. And when once thou haſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45240:29"/>
overcome the <hi>fears</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> thou wilt be the
more <hi>reſolute</hi> in thy <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to Chriſt,
and above the power of <hi>moſt temptations,</hi> and wilt
not fear the face of <hi>man,</hi> when <hi>Death</hi> is the <hi>worſt</hi>
that <hi>man</hi> can bring thee to. It is true, <hi>Death</hi> is
<hi>dreadful:</hi> but it is as true that the <hi>arms of Chriſt</hi>
are <hi>joyful.</hi> It is an unpleaſing thing to leave the
<hi>Bodies</hi> of our <hi>friends</hi> in the <hi>earth:</hi> but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
pleaſure to <hi>their Souls,</hi> to be <hi>Received</hi>
into the <hi>Heavenly ſociety</hi> by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And how <hi>confidently, quietly,</hi> and <hi>comfortably</hi>
you may commend your <hi>departing Spirits</hi> to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Chriſt,</hi> be informed by theſe conſiderations
following.</p>
               <p>1, Your <hi>Spirits are Chriſts own:</hi> And may you
not <hi>truſt</hi> him with <hi>his own?</hi> As they are <hi>his</hi> by the
title of <hi>creation, (All Souls are mine, ſaith the Lord
Ezek.</hi> 18. 4.) So alſo by the title of <hi>redemption: We are
not our own, we are bought with a price, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 19.</p>
               <p>Say therefore to him, [<hi>Lord I am</hi> thine <hi>much
more than my</hi> own; Receive thine own; <hi>Take care
of</hi> thine own! <hi>Thou dreweſt me to</hi> conſent <hi>to thy
gracious Covenant, and I reſigned my ſelf and all I had
to</hi> thee! <hi>and thou</hi> ſwareſt <hi>to me, and I became</hi> thine,
(Ezek. 16. 8.): <hi>and I ſtand to the Covenant that I
made, though I have offended thee! I am ſinful, but I
am</hi> thine, <hi>and would not forſake thee! and change my
Lord and Maſter for a world: O know</hi> thine own, <hi>and</hi>
own <hi>my Soul that hath</hi> owned <hi>thee, though it hath
ſinned againſt thee: Thy ſheep know thy voice, and follow
not a ſtranger: Now know thy poor ſheep, and leave them
not to the devourer: Thy Lambs have been preſerved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45240:30"/>
by thee among Wolves in the world: Preſerve me
now from the enemy of ſouls. I</hi> am thine, <hi>O ſave
me,</hi> (Pſalm 119. 94.) <hi>and loſe not that which is
thine own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Conſider that <hi>thou art his upon ſo dear a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace,
as that he is the more engaged to receive thee.</hi>
Hath he bought thee by the price of his moſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood,</hi> and will he caſt thee off: Hath he <hi>come
down</hi> on earth to <hi>ſeek and ſave thee,</hi> and will he
now <hi>forſake</hi> thee? Hath he lived in fleſh a life of
poverty, and ſuffered reproach, and ſcorn, and
buffetings, and been nailed to the Croſs, and put
to cry out, [<hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken
me!</hi>] And will he now <hi>forget</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and <hi>himſelf forſake thee</hi> after this? Did he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on the Croſs, <hi>commend his ſpirit into his Father's
hands,</hi> and will he not <hi>receive thy ſpirit</hi> when thou
at death <hi>commendeſt</hi> it to <hi>him?</hi> He hath known
<hi>himſelf</hi> what it is to have a <hi>humane ſoul ſeparated
from the body,</hi> and the <hi>body buried in a grave,</hi> and
there lamented by ſurviving friends: And why
did he this, but that he might be fit to receive and
relieve thee in the like condition? O who would
not be encouraged to encounter <hi>death,</hi> and lie
down in a <hi>grave,</hi> that believeth that <hi>Chriſt did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him,</hi> and conſidereth <hi>why</hi> he went that way,
and what a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> he hath made.</p>
               <p>I know an Argument from the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi>
will not prove his love to the ſouls of the ungodly,
ſo as to infer that he wil <hi>receive them:</hi> but it will
prove his <hi>Reception</hi> of <hi>Believers ſouls: [He that
ſpared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45240:30"/>
how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all
things!] Rom.</hi> 8. 32. is an infallible argument as
to <hi>Believers,</hi> but not as to thoſe that do reject
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say therefore to him,</hi> [O my Lord! Can it be
that thou couldſt come down in fleſh, and be abuſed,
and ſpit upon, and ſlandred, and crucified! that thou
couldſt bleed, and die, and be buried for me, and now
be unwilling to receive me! that thou ſhoulds pay ſo
dear for ſouls, and now refuſe to entertain them! that
thou ſhouldſt die to ſave them from the devil, and
now wilt leave them to his cruelty: that thou haſt
<hi>conquered</hi> him, and yet wilt ſuffer him at laſt to have
the <hi>prey!</hi> To whom can a departing ſoul fly for refuge
and for entertainment, if not to thee that diedſt for
ſouls, and ſufferedſt thine to be ſeparated from the fleſh,
that we might have all aſſurance of thy compaſſion unto
ours!] <q>Thou didſt openly declare upon the Croſs,
that the reaſon of thy dying was to Receive departed
ſouls, when thou didſt thus encourage the ſoul of a
penitent Malefactor, by telling him, [<hi>This day ſhalt
thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>] O give the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
or entertainment to this ſinful ſoul that
flyeth unto thee, and truſteth in thy death and merits,
and is coming to receive thy doom.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. Conſider that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is full of Love, and
tender compaſſion to ſouls:</hi> What his tears over <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
compelled the Jews to ſay, <hi>John</hi> 11. 36. [<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how he loved him!</hi>] the ſame his incarnation,
life and death ſhould much more ſtir us up to ſay,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45240:31"/>
with greater admiration, [Behold how he loved
us!] The foregoing words, though the ſhorteſt
verſe in all the Bible, [verſ. 35. <hi>Jeſus wept,</hi>] are
long enough to prove his love to <hi>Lazarus:</hi> and
the Holy Ghoſt would not have the <hi>tears of Chriſt</hi>
to be <hi>unknown</hi> to us, that his <hi>love</hi> may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known. But we have a far larger demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his love: <hi>He loved us, and gave himſelf for
us,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. And by what gift could he better te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his love? <hi>He loved us, and waſhed us in his blood,</hi>
Rev. 1. 5. <hi>He loveth us as the Father loveth him,</hi> John
15. 9. And may we not comfortably go to him
that <hi>loveth us?</hi> will <hi>Love refuſe us</hi> when we fly
unto him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say then to Chriſt</hi> [O thou that haſt <hi>loved</hi> my
ſoul, Receive it! I commend it not unto an enemy:
Can that Love reject me and caſt me into hell, that ſo
oft embraced me on earth, and hath declared it ſelf by
ſuch ample teſtimonies?]</p>
               <p>O had we but more <hi>love to Chriſt,</hi> we ſhould be
more ſenſible of <hi>his love to us,</hi> and then we ſhould
truſt him, and <hi>love</hi> would make us haſten to him,
and with confidence caſt our ſelves upon him.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Conſider that</hi> it is the Office of Chriſt to ſave
ſouls, and to receive them, <hi>and therefore we may
boldly recommend them to his hands. The</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent him to be the Saviour of the world, 1 <hi>John</hi>
4. 14. <hi>And he is</hi> effectively <hi>the Saviour</hi> of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Eph. 5. 23. <hi>And may we not truſt him in his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45240:31"/>
undertaken office, that would truſt a Phyſician or
any other in his office, if we judge him faithful?
Yea, he is engaged by</hi> Covenant <hi>to</hi> Receive us:
<hi>When we gave up our ſelves to him, he alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ours; and we did it on this condition,</hi> that
he ſhould receive and ſave us: <hi>And it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his</hi> own undertaking: He <hi>drew the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
himſelf, and tendred it firſt to us, and</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his own Conditions, <hi>as he</hi> impoſed ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say then to him,</hi> [My Lord, I expect but the

               <p>5. <hi>Conſider</hi> how able Chriſt is to anſwer thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations:
All power is given him in Heaven and
Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>and</hi> All things are given by
the Father into his hands, <hi>John</hi> 13. 3. All Judgment
is committed to him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. <hi>It is fully in his</hi>
power <hi>to</hi> receive <hi>and</hi> ſave <hi>thee: And Satan cannot
touch thee but by his conſent:</hi> [Fear not <hi>then,</hi> he

                  <hi>Say then,</hi> If thou <hi>wilt</hi> Lord, thou <hi>canſt</hi> ſave this

Lay but thy rebuke upon the deſtroyer, and he ſhall be
reſtrained: When my Lord and deareſt Saviour hath
the Keys, how can I be kept out of thy Kingdom? or
caſt into the burning lake? Were it a matter of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
unto thee, my ſoul might fear leſt Heaven would

the hindrances: and it is as <hi>eaſie</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> me as to
<hi>Love</hi> me.]</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Conſider</hi> how perfectly thy Saviour is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the place that thou art going to, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and employment which thou muſt there have:
<hi>and therefore as there is nothing</hi> ſtrange to him, <hi>ſo
the</hi> ignorance <hi>and</hi> ſtrangeneſs <hi>in</hi> thy ſelf <hi>ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45240:33"/>
therefore make thee fly</hi> to him, <hi>and truſt him, and
recommend thy ſoul to him, and ſay,</hi> [Lord, it
would be terrible to my departing ſoul, to go into a
world that I never ſaw, and into a place ſo ſtrange,
and unto company ſo far above me; but that I know
there is nothing <hi>ſtrange</hi> to <hi>thee,</hi> and thou knoweſt it

me: The eyes muſt ſee for all the body, and not

knowledg</hi> be <hi>my truſt.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Conſider, That <hi>Chriſt hath provided a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
receptacle for faithful Souls;</hi> and it cannot be
imagined that he will <hi>loſe his preparations,</hi> or be
fruſtrate of his end. All that he did and ſuffered
on earth, was for this end. He therefore became
the <hi>Captain of our ſalvation,</hi> and was <hi>made perfect
through ſufferings, that he might bring many ſons to
glory,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. He hath taken poſſeſſion in our
Nature, and is himſelf interceding for us in the
Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. And for <hi>whom</hi> doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
this Heavenly Building not made with hands,
but for <hi>Believers?</hi> If therefore any inordinate
fear ſurprize thee, remember what he hath ſaid,
<hi>John</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. [<hi>Let not your hearts be troubled;
ye believe in God, believe alſo in me: In my Fathers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45240:34"/>
houſe are many manſions; if it were nor ſo, I would
have told you: I go to prepare a place for you: And
if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again

it cannot be that thou wilt ſhut them out. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

foundation of the world.</hi>]</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Conſider,</hi> That Chriſt hath received thy Soul
unto Grace, and therefore he will receive it unto
Glory. <hi>He hath quickned us who were dead in
treſpaſſes and ſins, wherein in time paſt we wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
&amp;c. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his
great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were
dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, quickned us together with
Chriſt, and raiſed us up together, and made us ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, Epheſ. 2. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>The State of Grace is the</hi> kingdom of
heaven, <hi>as well as the State of Glory,</hi> Matth. 3. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi>
10. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 11, 24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47. <hi>By

Grace thou haſt the</hi> heavenly birth <hi>and</hi> nature: <hi>We
are</hi> firſt born <hi>to</hi> trouble and ſorow <hi>in the World;
but we are</hi> new born <hi>to</hi> everlaſting joy and pleaſure.
Grace <hi>maketh us</hi> Heirs, <hi>and giveth us</hi> Title; <hi>and
therefore at</hi> death <hi>we ſhall have poſſeſſion.</hi> The
Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according to his
abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and
that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us,
1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>The great work was done in the
day of thy Renovation: Then thou waſt entred
into</hi> the houſhold of God, <hi>and made a</hi> fellow Citizen
with the Sants, <hi>and receivedſt the</hi> Spirit of adoption,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>He gave thee</hi> life eternal <hi>when
he gave the</hi> knowledge of himſelf <hi>and of</hi> his Son,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 3. <hi>And will he now take from thee the
Kingdom which he hath given thee? Thou waſt
once his</hi> Enemy, <hi>and he hath Received thee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into his favour, and</hi> reconciled <hi>thee to himſelf:
and will he not then receive thee to his Glory?
Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10, 11. God commendeth his Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed
for us: Much more then being now juſtified by his blood,
we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when
we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son; much more being reconciled we ſhall
be ſaved by his life: And not only ſo, but we alſo joy
in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom
we have now received the attonement.] <hi>And when
we have</hi> peace with God, being juſtifiied by faith,
(<hi>Rom. 5. 1.) why ſhould we doubt whether he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45240:35"/>
will receive us? The great impediments and cauſe
of fear are now removed: Unpardoned ſin is taken
away: Our debt is diſcharged. We have a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Anſwer againſt all that can be alledged to
the prejudice of our Souls; yea, it is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that anſwereth for us,</hi> It is he that juſtifieth, Who
then ſhall condemn us? <hi>Will he not juſtifie thoſe
at laſt, whom he hath here juſtified? Or will he</hi>
juſtifie us, <hi>and yet</hi> not receive us? <hi>That were both
to</hi> juſtifie <hi>and</hi> condemn us.</p>
               <p>Depart then in peace, O fearful Soul: Thou
falleſt into his hands that hath juſtified thee by
his Blood; will he deny thee the Inheritance of
which he himſelf hath made thee Heir? yea, a
Joynt-heir with himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
thee of thy Birth-right, who himſelf begot
thee of the incorruptible Seed? If he would not
have received thee to Glory, he would not have
drawn thee to himſelf, and have blotted out thine
Iniquities, and received thee by reconciling Grace.
Many a time he hath received the ſecret Petitions,
Complaints, and Groans which thou haſt poured
out before him, and hath given thee acceſs with
boldneſs to his Throne of Grace, when thou
couldſt not have acceſs to Man; and he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thee up, when Man hath caſt thee off. Surely
he that received thee ſo readily in thy diſtreſs,
will not now at laſt repent him of his love.
As <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Wife ſaid, <hi>Judges 13. 23. If the Lord
were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>9, Conſider, <hi>How nearly thou art related to him in

he not the bowels of a <hi>Father?</hi> when thou didſt

and will he give thee <hi>Hell,</hi> when thou <hi>askeſt</hi> but
the entertainment in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which he hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi>
thee? Thou art his <hi>friend, John</hi> 15. 14. 15.
and will he not receive his <hi>friends?</hi> Thou art his

<hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>weak:</hi> We have forſaken all to cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, that we might with thee be <hi>one fleſh and ſpirit,
Epheſ. 5. 31. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. O cut not off and caſt
not out thy members that are engrafted into thee! Thou
haſt <hi>dwelt in me</hi> here by <hi>faith;</hi> and ſhall I not now
<hi>dwell with thee? (Epheſ. 3. 17.)</hi> Then haſt prayed
to the Father, that <hi>we may be one in thee, and
may be with thee to behold thy Glory, (John
17. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.)</hi> And wilt thou deny to
receive me to that glory, who pray but for what thou
haſt prayed to thy Father? Death maketh no ſeparation
between thee and the members: It diſſolveth not the <hi>union</hi>
of <hi>ſouls with thee,</hi> though it ſeparate them from the fleſh:
And ſhall a part of thy ſelf be rejected and condemned?</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Conſider, That</hi> Chriſt hath ſealed thee up unto
ſalvation, and given thee the earneſt of his Spirit; <hi>and
therfore will certainly receive thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 22.
<hi>and</hi> 5. 5 Eph. 1. 13, 14. <hi>and</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Say therefore
to him,</hi> [Behold Lord, thy mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy feal, thine earneſt:
Fleſh and blood did not illuminate, and renew me:
Thy ſpirit which thou haſt given me, is my witneſs that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45240:37"/>
I am thine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16 And wilt thou diſown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the ſoul that thou haſt ſealed?]</p>
               <p>11. Conſider, That <hi>he that hath given thee a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
mind, will certainly</hi> Receive <hi>thee into heaven:</hi>
If thy treaſure were not there, thy heart would
never have been there, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. Thy weak
deſires do ſhew what he intends thee he for, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not thoſe deſires in vain. Thy Love to
him (though too ſmall) is a certain proof that
he intends not to reject thee: It cannot be that God
can damn, or Chriſt refuſe a Soul that doth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
Love him: He that Loveth, dwelleth in
God, and God in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 15, 16.
And ſhall he not then dwell with God for
ever? God fitteth the nature of every creature to
its <hi>uſe,</hi> and agreeably to the element in which
they dwell: And therefore when he gave thee
the heavenly nature, (though but in weak begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings)
it ſhewed his will to make thee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say therefore to him,</hi> [O Lord, I had never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thee if thou hadſt not begun and loved me firſt:
I had not not minded thee, or deſired after thee, if
thou hadſt not kindled theſe deſires: It cannot be that
thy Grace it ſelf ſhould be a deceit and miſery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but to Tantalizeus; and that thou haſt ſet thy
Servants Souls on longing for that which thou wilt
never give them. Thou wouldſt not have given me
the wedding garment, when thou didſt invite me, if
thou hadſt meant to keep me out: Even the grain of
muſtard-ſeed which thou ſowedſt in my heart, was a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45240:37"/>
kind of Promiſe of the Happineſs to which it tendeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
indeed I have loved thee ſo little, that I am aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of my ſelf, and confeſs my cold indifferency deſerves
thy wrath: But that I <hi>Love</hi> thee and <hi>deſire</hi> thee is
thy gift, which ſignifieth the higher ſatisfying gift:
Though I am cold and dull, my eyes are towards thee;
It is thee that I mean when I can but groan: It is
long ſince I have bid this world away; It ſhall not be
my home or portion: O perfect what thou haſt begun:
This is not the time or place of my perfection: And though
my life be now hid with thee in God, when then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt,
let me appear with thee in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. and
in the mean time let this ſoul enjoy its part, that appeareth
before thee: Give me what thou haſt cauſed me to Love,
and then I ſhall more perfectly love thee, when my thirſt
is ſatisfied, and the water which thou haſt given me,
ſhall ſpring up to everlaſting life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>12. Conſider alſo, That <hi>he that hath engaged thee to
ſeek firſt his Kingdom, is engaged to give it them that
do ſincerely ſeek it.</hi> He called thee off the purſuit of
vanity, when thou waſt following the pleaſures and
profits of the world; and he called thee to labour
for the food that periſheth not, but endureth to
everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. Since then it hath been
thy care and buſineſs, (notwithſtanding all thine
imperfections) to ſeek and ſerve him, to pleaſe and
honour him, and ſo to run that thou mighteſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say then,</hi> [Though my ſins deſerve thy wrath, and
nothing that I have done deſerve thy favour, yet Godlineſs
hath thy Promiſe of the Life to come; and thou haſt
ſaid, that he that ſeeks ſhall find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. 8. O
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45240:38"/>
now let me find the Kingdom that I have ſought, and
ſought by thy encouragement and help: It cannot be
that any ſhould have cauſe to repent of ſerving thee, or
ſuffer diſappointment that truſts upon thee: My labour
for the World was loſt and vain; but thou didſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
me to be <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> and <hi>abound in thy work,</hi> on
this account that my <hi>labour ſhould not be in vain,
1 Cor.</hi> 15. 58. Now give the full and final anſwer
unto all my Prayers: Now that I have done the fight,
and finiſhed my courſe, let me find the Crown of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs
which thy mercy hath laid up, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.
O Crown thy graces, and with thy greateſt mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
and perfect thy preparatory mercies, and let
me be <hi>Received</hi> to thy glory, who have been guided
by thy counſel, (<hi>Pſalm. 73. 24.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. Conſider, That <hi>Chriſt hath already received
millions of Souls, and never was unfaithful unto any,</hi>
There are now with him the ſpirits of the juſt
made perfect, that in this life were imperfect as
well as you. Why then ſhould you not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
truſt him with your Souls? and ſay, [<hi>Lord
thou art the Common Salvation and refuge of thy
Saints: Both ſtrong and weak, even all that
are given thee by the Father ſhall come to thee; and
thoſe that come thou wilt in no wiſe caſt out: Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
have been entertained by thee, that were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in themſelves as well as I: It is few of thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that are now on earth, in compariſon of thoſe
that are with thee in Heaven: Admit me Lord into
the new</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>Thou wilt have thy houſe to be
filled: O take my Spirit into the number of those
belſſed ones, that ſhall come from Eaſt, Weſt, North
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45240:38"/>
and South, and ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi>
Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom, that we may together with
eternal joyes, give thanks and praiſe to thee that haſt
redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. <hi>Conſider, That</hi> it is the will of the Father
himſelf that we ſhould be glorified: <hi>He therefore</hi>
gave us <hi>to</hi> his Son; <hi>and</hi> gave his Son for us, <hi>to
be our Saviour, that</hi> whoever believeth in him,
ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life: <hi>All our
Salvation is the product of his Love,</hi> Joh. 3. 16,
17. Eph. 2. 4. Joh. 6. 37. Joh. 16. 26, 27. I ſay
not that I will pray the Father for you; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me,
<hi>&amp;c.] John</hi> 14. He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of
my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt
my ſelf to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say therefore with our dying Lord,</hi> [Father,
into thy hands I commend my Spirit: By thy Son
who is the way, the truth and the life, I come to thee,
(<hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6.) Fulneſs of joy is in thy preſence, and
everlaſting pleaſures at thy right hand (<hi>Pſalm. 16.
11.</hi>) Thy love redeemed me, renewed and preſerved
me: O now receive me to the fulneſs of thy Love: This
was thy <hi>will</hi> in ſending thy Son, that of all that thou
gaveſt him he ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up
at the laſt day. O let not now this Soul be loſt that is
paſſing to thee through the ſtraits of death! I had <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come unto thy Son,</hi> if thou hadſt <hi>not drawn
me;</hi> and if I had <hi>not heard and learnt</hi> of thee,
<hi>John</hi> 6, 44, 45. I thank thee O Father, Lord of
Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt revealed to me
a babe, an ideot, the bleſſed myſteries of thy Kingdom:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45240:39"/>
(<hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 4 13.) O now as the vail of
fleſh muſt be withdrawn, and my ſoul be parted from
this body, withdraw the vail of thy diſpleaſure, and
ſhew thy ſervant the glory of thy preſence: that he that
hath ſeen thee but as in a glaſs, may ſee thee now
with open face: and when my earthly houſe of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
is diſſolved, let me inhabit thy building not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>15. <hi>Laſtly conſider, That</hi> God hath deſigned the
everlaſting glory of his name, and the pleaſing of his
bleſsed will, in our ſalvation: <hi>And the Son muſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in the perfection of his conqueſt of Sin and
Satan, and in the perfecting of our Redemption.
And doubtleſs he will not loſe his Fathers glory
and his own: Say then with confidence,</hi> [I reſign
my ſoul to thee O Lord who haſt called and choſen me,
that thou mighteſt make known the riches of thy glory
on me, as a veſſel of mercy prepared unto glory, (<hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 23.) Thou haſt predeſtinated me to the adoption of
thy child by Chriſt unto thy ſelf, to the praiſe of the
glory of thy grace, wherein thou haſt made me accepted
in thy beloved, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 11, 12) Receive me now
to the glory which thou haſt prepared for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
34.) The hour is at hand, Lord glorifie thy poor adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
child, that he may for ever glorify thee (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 1.)
It is thy Promiſe to glorify thoſe whom thou doſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,
(Rom. 8. 30.) As therere is no condemnation to
them that are in Chriſt, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.) ſo now let him
preſent me faultleſs before the preſence of the glory with
exceeding joy, And to thee the only wiſe God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
be the glory, Majeſty Dominion and Power for
evermore, Amen.: <hi>Jude</hi> v. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:45240:39"/>
WHat now remaineth, but that we all ſet
our ſelves to learn this ſweet and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
task, that we may joyfully perform it in
the hour of our extremity, even to <hi>recommend our
departing Souls to Chriſt, with confidence that he will
receive them!</hi> It is a leſſon not eaſie to be learnt:
For Faith is weak, and doubts, and fears will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ariſe; and nature will be loth to think of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and we that have ſo much offended Chriſt,
and lived ſo ſtrangely to him, and been entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in too much familiarity with the World, ſhall
be apt to ſhrink when we ſhould joyfully truſt him
with our departing Souls. O therefore now ſet
your ſelves to overcome theſe difficulties in time!
You know we are all ready to depart: It is time
this laſt important work were throughly learned,
that our death may be both ſafe and comfortable.</p>
               <p>There are divers other Uſes of this Doctrine
that I ſhould have urged upon you, had there
been time. As, 1. If Chriſt will Receive your
departing Souls, then fear not death, but long
for this Heavenly entertainment.</p>
               <p>2. Then do not ſin for fear of them that can but
kill the body, and ſend the Soul to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. Then think not the righteous unhappy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are caſt off by the world; neither be
too much troubled at it your ſelves, when it comes
to be your caſe: but remember that Chriſt will not
forſake you, and that none can hinder him from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45240:40"/>
the Receiving of your Souls: No malice nor
ſlanders can follow you ſo far as by defamation to
make your juſtifyer condemn you.</p>
               <p>4. If you may truſt him with your Souls, then
truſt him with your friends, your Children that
you muſt leave behind, with all your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and affairs; and truſt him with his Goſpel
and his Church; for they are all his own, and he
will prevail to the accompliſhment of his bleſſed
pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But, 5. I ſhall only add that Uſe which the
ſad occaſion of our meeting doth beſpeak. What
cauſe have we now to mix our ſorrows for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
friend, with the joyes of faith for her felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
we have left the body to the earth, and that
is our lawful ſorrow; for it is the fruit of ſin: But
her ſpirit is Received by Jeſus Chriſt: and that
muſt be our joy, if we will behave our ſelves
as true Believers. If we can ſuffer with her,
ſhould we not rejoyce alſo with her? And if the
joy be far greater to the Soul with Chriſt, than the
ruined ſtate of the body can be lamentable; it is
but reaſon that our joy ſhould be greater for her
joy, than our ſorrow for the diſſolution of the
fleſh. we that ſhould not much lament the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of a friend beyond the Seas, if it were to be
advanced to a Kingdom, ſhould leſs lament the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of a Soul to Chriſt, if it were not for the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of our woful unbelief.</p>
               <p>She is arrived at the everlaſting Reſt, where the
burden of corruption, the contradictions of the
fleſh, the moleſtations of the Tempter, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45240:40"/>
of the world, and the injuries of malicious
men, are all kept out, and ſhall never more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
her peace. She hath left us in theſe ſtorms,
who have more cauſe to weep for our ſelves and
for our Children that have yet ſo much to do and
ſuffer, and ſo many dangers to paſs through,
than for the Souls that are at Reſt with Chriſt.
We are capable of no higher hopes than to attain
that ſtate of bleſſedneſs which her Soul poſſeſſeth:
And ſhall we make that the matter of our lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as to her, which we make the matter
of our hopes as to our ſelves? Do we labour
earneſtly to come thither, and yet lament that
ſhe is there? You will ſay, It is not becauſe ſhe is
cloathed upon with the houſe from Heaven, but
that ſhe is uncloathed of the fleſh: But is
there any other paſſage than Death unto
immortality? Muſt we not be uncloathed, before
the garments of Glory can be put on? She
bemoaneth not her own diſſolved Body: The
glorified Soul can eaſily bear the corruption of the
fleſh: And if you ſaw but what the Soul enjoyeth,
you would be like minded, and be moderate in
your griefs. Love not your ſelves ſo as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
and unmerciful in your deſires to your friends!
Let Satan deſire to keep them out of Heaven, but
do not you deſire it. You may deſire your own
good, but not ſo as to deprive your friends of theirs;
yea of a greater good, that you may have a leſſer
by it. And if it be their company that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in reaſon you ſhould be glad that they are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45240:41"/>
gone to dwell where you muſt dwell for ever, and
therefore may for ever have their company: Had they
ſtayed on earth, you would have had their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but a little while, becauſe you muſt make ſo
ſhort a ſtay your ſelves. Let them therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their journy before you, and grudge not that
they are firſt at home, as long as you expect to
find them there. In the mean time, he that called
them from you, hath not left you comfortleſs: He
is with you himſelf, who is better than a Mother,
or than ten thouſand friends: When grief or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
hindereth you from obſerving him, yet
he is with you, and holdeth you up, and tenderly
provideth for you: Though turbulent paſſions
injuriouſly queſtion all his Love, and cauſe you
to give him unmannerly and unthankful words;
yet ſtill he beareth with you, and forgiveth all,
and doth not forſake you for your peeviſhneſs and
weakneſs, becauſe you are his Children, and he
knoweth that you mean not to forſake him: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
your paſſions, and calm your minds; Reclaim
your thoughts, and caſt away the bitterneſs of
ſuſpicious quarrelſome unbelief; and then you
may perceive the preſence of your deareſt friend
and Lord, who is enough for you, though you
had no other friend. Without him all the friends
on earth would be but ſilly comforters, and leave
you as at the gates of Hell: Without him all the
Angels and Saints in Heaven would never make
it a Heaven to you. Grieve not too much that
one of your Candles is put out, while you have
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45240:41"/>
the Sun: Or if indeed it be not day with any of
you, or the Sun be clouded or ecclipſed, let that
rather be the matter of your grief: Find out the
cauſe, and preſently ſubmit, and ſeek reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Or if you are deprived of this Light, becauſe
you are yet aſleep in ſin, hearken to his call, and
rub your eyes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee
light.</hi> Rom. 13. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Knowing that it
is now high time to awake out of ſleep, our ſalvation
being nearer than when we firſt believed: the night is
far ſpent, the day of eternal light is even at hand: caſt
off therefore the works of darkneſs, and put on all the
armour of light: walk honeſtly and decently as in the
day.</hi> And whatever you do, make ſure of the
friend that never dyeth, and never ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from you, and when you die, will certainly
Receive the ſouls which you commend unto
him.</p>
               <p>And here, though contrary to my cuſtom, I
ſhall make ſome more particular mention of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
friend, on ſeveral accounts. 1. In proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Uſe that now we are upon, that you
may ſee in the evidences of her happineſs, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cauſe you have to indulge extraordinary grief
on her account, and how much cauſe to moderate
your ſenſe of our loſs with the ſenſe of her felicity.
2. That you many have the benefit of her example
for your imitation, eſpecially her Children that are
bound to obſerve the holy <hi>actions</hi> as well as <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of a Mother. 3. For the honour of Chriſt,
and his Grace, and his Servant: For as God hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45240:42"/>
promiſed to honour thoſe that honour him, 1 <hi>Sam</hi>
2. 30. and Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>If any man ſerve me, him
will My Father honour, John</hi> 12. 26. So I know
Chriſt will not take it ill to be honoured in his
members, and to have his Miniſters ſubſerve him in
ſo excellent a work: It is a very conſiderable part
of the love or hatred, honour or diſhonour that
Chriſt hath in the world, which he receiveth as
he appeareth in his followers. He that will not
ſee a cup of cold water given to one of them go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded,
and will tell thoſe at the laſt day that did
or did not viſit and relieve them, that they did or
did it not to him, will now expect it from me as my
duty, to give him the honour of his Graces in his
deceaſed ſervant, and I doubt not will accordingly
accept it, when it is no other indeed than his own
honour that is my End, and nothing but the words
of Truth and Soberneſs ſhall be the means.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall make ſo great a transition as
ſhall retain my diſcourſe in the narrow compaſs of
the Time in which ſhe lived near me and under my
care, and in my familiar acquaintance, omitting
all the reſt of her life, that none may ſay I ſpeak
but by hear-ſay of things which I am uncertain of:
and I will confine it alſo to thoſe ſpecial gifts and
graces in which ſhe was eminent, that I may not
take you up with a deſcription of a Chriſtian as ſuch,
and tell you only of that good which ſhe held but
in common with all other Chriſtians. And if any
thing that I ſhall ſay were unknown to any Reader
that knew her, let them know that it is becauſe they
knew her but diſtantly, imperfectly, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45240:42"/>
and that my advantage of near acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
did give me a juſt aſſurance of what I ſay.</p>
               <p>The Graces. which I diſcerned to be eminent in
her, were theſe. 1. She was eminent in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Pride, and Pomp, and Pleaſure, and
Vanity of the World, and in her great averſeneſs
to all theſe. She had an honeſt impatiency of the
life which is common among the rich and vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the world: Voluptuouſneſs and Senſuality,
Exceſs of Drinking, Cards and Dice, ſhe could not
endure, what ever names of good houſe-keeping
or ſeemly deportment they borrowed for a mask:
In her Apparel ſhe went below the garb of others
of her rank; indeed in ſuch plainneſs as did not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
her degree: but yet in ſuch a grave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
habit, as notified her Sobriety and humility:
She was a Stranger to Paſtimes, and no Companion
for Time-waſters, as knowing, that Perſons ſo near
eternity, that have ſo ſhort a life and ſo great a
work, have no time to ſpare. Accordingly in
her latter dayes, ſhe did (as thoſe that grow wiſe
by experience of the vanity of the world) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from it, and caſt it off before it caſt off her:
She betook her ſelf to the ſociety of a people that
were low in the world, of humble, ſerious, upright
lives, though ſuch as had been wholly ſtrangers to her:
And among theſe poor inferiour ſtrangers ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in contentent and quietneſs; deſiring rather to
converſe with thoſe that would help her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
the time, in prayer and edifying conference,
than with thoſe that would grieve her by conſuming
it on their luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45240:43"/>
2. She was very prudent in her converſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
(allowing for the paſſion of her ſex and age);
and ſo eſcaped much of the inconveniences that
elſe in ſo great and manifold buſineſſes would have
overwhelmed her: As a good man will guide his
affairs with diſcretion, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112. 5. ſo diſcretion
will preſerve him, and underſtanding will keep him,
to deliver him from the way of the evil man, who
leaveth the paths of uprightneſs to walk in the way
of darkneſs, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>3. She was ſeriouſly Religious, without partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or any taint of ſiding or faction, or holding
the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
I never heard ſpeak againſt men, or for men,
as they differed in ſome ſmall and tolerable things:
She impartially heard any Miniſter that was able,
and godly, and ſound in the main, and could bear
with the weakneſſes Miniſters when they were
faithful: Inſtead of owning the names or opinions
of Prelatical, Presbyterian, Independent, or ſuch
like, ſhe took up with the name and profeſſion of
a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and loved a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian,
without much reſpect to ſuch different tolerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
Inſtead of troubling her ſelf with need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſcruples, and making up a Religion of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſingularities, ſhe ſtudied Faith and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and lived upon the common certain truths,
and well-known duties, which have been the old
and beaten way, by which the univerſal Church of
Chriſt hath gone to heaven in former Ages.</p>
               <p>4. She was very impartial in her judgment about
particular caſes: being the ſame in judging of the caſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45240:43"/>
of a child and a ſtranger: and no intereſt of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or other relations, could make her ſwerve
from an equal judgment:</p>
               <p>5. She very much preferred the ſpiritual welfare
of her children before their temporal; looking on
the former as the true felicity, and on the later with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, but as a pleaſant voluntary miſery.</p>
               <p>6. Since I was acquainted with her, I alwayes
found her very ready to good works, according to
her power. And when ſhe hath ſeen a poor man
come to me, that ſhe conjectured ſolicited me for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
ſhe hath reprehended me for keeping the caſe
to my ſelf, and not inviting her to contribute: And
I could never deſcern that ſhe thought any thing ſo
well beſtowed, as that which relieved the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the poor that were honeſt and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>7. She had the wonderful mercy of a man-like
Chriſtian patient ſpirit, under all afflictions that did
befal her, and under the multitude of troubleſome
buſineſſes, that would have even diſtracted an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
mind. Though ſudden anger was the ſin
that ſhe much confeſt her ſelf, and therefore thought
ſhe wanted patience, yet I have oft wondered to ſee
her bear up with the ſame alacrity and quietneſs,
when <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers have brought her the tidings
that would have overwhelmed an impatient ſoul.
When Law-ſuits and the great afflictions of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have aſſaulted her like ſucceſſive Waves, which
I feared would have born her into the deep, if not
devoured all her peace; ſhe ſuſtained all, as if no
great conſiderable change had been made againſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45240:44"/>
her, having the ſame God, and the ſame Chriſt, and
promiſes, and hope, from which ſhe fetcht ſuch
real comfort and ſupport, as ſhewed a real ſerious
faith.</p>
               <p>8. She was alwayes apt to put a good interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon Gods providences; like a right Believer,
that having the ſpirit of Adoption, perceiveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
love in all: She would not eaſily be
perſwaded that God meant her any harm: She was
not apt to hearken to the enemy that accuſeth God
and his wayes to man, as he accuſeth man and his
actions to God: She was none of thoſe that are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
of God, and are ſtill concluding death and
ruine from all that he doth to them, and are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath from miſ-interpreted expreſſions of his
love: who weep becauſe of the ſmoak, before they
can be warmed by the fire. <hi>Yet God is good to</hi> Iſrael;
<hi>aud it ſhall go well with them that fear before him,</hi> (<hi>Pſa.</hi>
73. 1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 12, 13.) were her concluſions from
the ſharpeſt providences: She expected the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the darkeſt night: and judged not of the
end by the beginning; but was alwayes confident, if
ſhe could but entitle God in the caſe, that the iſſue
would be good. She was not a murmurer againſt
God, nor one that contended with her Maker; nor
one that created calamity to her ſelf by a ſelf-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
unquiet mind: She patiently bore what God
laid upon her, and made it not heavier by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of uncomfortable prognoſticks, and miſgiving
or repining thoughts. She had a great confidence
in God, that he was doing good to her and hers in
all; and where at preſent ſhe ſaw any matter of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45240:44"/>
grief, ſhe much ſupported her ſoul with a belief
that God would remove and overcome it in due
time.</p>
               <p>9. She was not troubled (that ever I diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
with doubtings about her intereſt in Chriſt,
and about her own Juſtification and Salvation:
but whether ſhe reached to aſſurance or not, ſhe
had confident apprehenſions of the Love of God,
and quietly repoſed her ſoul upon his grace. Yet
not ſecure through preſumption or ſelf eſteem; but
comforting her ſelf in the Lord her God: By this
means ſhe ſpent thoſe hours in a chearful perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of her duty, which many ſpend in fruitleſs
ſelf-vexation for the failings of their duty, or in meer
enquiries, Whether they have Grace or not? and
others ſpend in wrangling perplexed Controverſies
about the manner or circumſtances of duty: And
I believe that ſhe had more comfort from God by
way of reward upon her ſincere obedience, while
ſhe referred her ſoul to him, and reſted on him, than
many have that more anxiouſly perplexed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
about the diſcerning of their holineſs, when
they ſhould be ſtudying to be more holy, that it
might diſcover it ſelf. And by this means ſhe was
ſit for praiſes and thankſgiving, and ſpent not her
life in lamentations and complaints: and made not
Religion ſeem terrible to the ignorant, that judge
of it by the faces and carriage of profeſſors: She
did not repreſent it to the world, as a moroſe
and melancholy temper: but as the rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
cheerful obedience to his maker, actuated by
the ſenſe of the wonderful Love that is manifeſted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45240:45"/>
in the Redeemer, and by the hopes of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
and promiſed felicity in the bleſſed ſight and
fruition of God. And I conjecture that her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
diſpoſitiou to think well of God and
of his providences, together with her long and
manifold experience; (the great advantage of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
tryed Chriſtians) did much conduce to
free her from doubtings and diſquieting fears, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her own ſincerity and Salvation. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
if her life had not been anſwerable to her
peace and confidence, I ſhould not have thought
the better, but the worſe of her condition; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being more lamentable than to make haſt
to Hell, through a wilful confidence that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is paſt, and that they are in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as well as the moſt ſanctified.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, I eſteemed it the height of her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
that ſhe never diſcovered any inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
fears of death; but a chearful readineſs, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
and deſire, to be diſſolved and be with
Chriſt. This was her conſtant temper both in
health and ſickneſs, as far as I was able to obſerve:
She would be frequently expreſſing how little
reaſon ſhe had to be deſirous of longer life, and
how much reaſon to be willing to depart. Divers
times in dangerous ſickneſſes I have been with
her, and never diſcerned any conſiderable averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
dejectedneſs or fear. Many a time I have
thought how great a mercy I ſhould eſteem it, if
I had attained that meaſure of fearleſs willingneſs
to lay down this fleſh, as ſhe had attained. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a one that can make light of wants, or threats,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45240:45"/>
or ſcorns, or any ordinary troubles, cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſo quietly and willingly to death: Many a
one that can go through the labours of Religion,
and contemn oppoſition, and eaſily give all they
have to the poor, and bear impriſonments, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or contempt, can never overcome the fears
of Death: ſo far even the Father of lies ſpake
truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Skin for Skin: yea all that a man
hath will he give for his Life.</hi> I took it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for a high attainment, and extraordinary
mercy to our deceaſed friend, that the <hi>King of
Terrours</hi> was not terrible to her: Though I doubt
not but ſomewhat of averſneſs and fear is ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
in natures ſelf-preſerving principle, as
that it is almoſt inſeparable; yet in her I never
diſcerned any troubleſome appearances of it.
When I firſt came to her in the beginning of her
laſt ſickneſs, ſhe ſuddenly paſſed the ſentence of
death upon her ſelf, without any ſhew of fear or
trouble; when to us the diſeaſe appeared not to
be great: But when the diſeaſe encreaſed, her
pains were ſo little, and the effect of the Fever
was ſo much in her head, that after this ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to eſteem it mortal, being not ſenſible of
her caſe and danger: And ſo as ſhe lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fears of death, ſhe ſeemed to us to die
without them: God by the nature of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
removing death as out of her ſight, when
fhe came to that weakneſs, in which elſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
was like to have been ſharper than ever
it was before. And thus in one of the weaker
ſex, God hath ſhewed us that it is poſſible to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45240:46"/>
live in holy confidence, and peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind, without diſtreſſing griefs or fears,
even in the midſt of a troubleſom world, and
of vexatious buſineſſes, and with the afflictions
of her deareſt Relations almoſt continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her: And that our quiet or diſquiet, our
peace or trouble dependeth more upon our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtrength and temper, then upon our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtate, occaſions, or provocations: And that
it is more in our hands, than of any or all our
friends and enemies, whether we ſhall have a
comfortable, or uncomfortable life.</p>
               <p>What remaineth now, but that all we that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
eſpecially you that are her Children, do
follow her as ſhe followed Chriſt? Though the
Word of God be your ſufficient Rule; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Chriſt be your perfect pattern; yet as
the <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> ſo the <hi>Example</hi> of a parent
muſt be a weighty motive, to quicken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to your duty; and will elſe be a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of your ſin: A holy Child of unholy
parents, doth no more than his neceſſary duty;
becauſe whatever parents are, he hath an holy
God: But an unholy Child of holy parents, is
unexcuſable in ſin, and deplorably miſerable; as
forſaking the Doctrine and pattern both of their
Creator and their Progenitors, whom Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
them to obſerve: And it will be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of their deſerved miſery, to have their
Parents witneſs againſt them, that they taught
them, and they would not learn, and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

moſt ſuitable concluſion of all the action of Chriſtians
life.</p>
               <p>Prayer is the breath of a Chriſtians life: it is
his work and higheſt converſe, and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to be the concluding action of his life; that
it may reach the end at which he aimed: We have
need of Prayer all our lives, becauſe we have
need of God, and need of his manifold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Grace: But in our laſt extreamity we have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45240:47"/>
a <hi>ſpecial</hi> need: Though ſloath is apt to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, while proſperity hindreth the ſenſe of our
neceſſities, and health perſwadeth us that Time is
not near its journies end; yet it is high time to
pray with doubled fervour and importunity, when
we ſee that we are near our laſt: when we find
that we have no more time to pray, but muſt now
ſpeak our laſt for our immortal Souls, and muſt at
once ſay all that we have to ſay and ſhall never
have a hearing more; O then to be <hi>unable</hi> to pray,
or to be <hi>faithleſs,</hi> and <hi>heartleſs,</hi> and <hi>hopeleſs</hi> in our
prayers, would be a calamity beyond expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Yet I know (for ordinary obſervation tells it us)
that many truly gracious perſons may <hi>accidentally</hi>
be <hi>undiſpoſed</hi> and <hi>diſabled</hi> to pray, when they are
near to death: If the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> be ſuch as doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
the Brain, or take them up with violence of
pain, or overwhelm the mind by perturbation of
the paſſions, or abuſe the imagination, or notably
waſte and debilitate the ſpirits it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that a body thus diſabled ſhould ſerve the Soul,
in this or any other duty. But ſtill the <hi>praying
Habit</hi> doth remain, though a diſtempered body do
forbid the <hi>exerciſe:</hi> The <hi>Habitual deſires</hi> of the Soul
are there: and it is thoſe that are the ſoul of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>But this ſhould move us, to pray while we have
time, and while our Bodies have ſtrength, and our
ſpirits have vigour and alacrity to ſerve us, ſeeing
we are ſo uncertain of bodily diſpoſition and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
ſo near our end: O pray, and pray with
all your hearts, before any Fever or Deliration

overthrow your underſtandings or your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories;
before your thoughts are all command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to attend your pains; and before your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
ſpirits fail you, and deny their neceſſary
ſervice to your ſuits; and before the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of your ſpeedy approach to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the moſt Holy God, and your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon an endleſs ſtate, do amaze, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and overwhelm your Souls with fear and
perturbation. O Chriſtians, what folly, what ſin
and ſhame is it to us, that now while we have
time to pray, and leave to pray, and helps to
pray, and have no ſuch diſturbing hindrances,
we ſhould yet want hearts; and have no mind,
no life and fervour for ſo great a work! O pray
now, leſt you are unable to pray then: And if
you are then hindred but by ſuch bodily undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs,
God will underſtand your habitual
deſires, and your groans, and take it as if you
had actually prayed; Pray now, that ſo you
may be acquainted with the God that then you
muſt fly unto for mercy, and may not be
ſtrangers to him or unto Prayer; and that he
may not find then that your prayers are but the
expreſſions of your fears, and not of your Love,
and are conſtrained and not voluntary motions
unto God: Pray now in preparation to your
dying prayers. O what a terrible thing it is to
be to learn to pray in that hour of extreamity;
and to have then no principle to pray by but
natural ſelf-love which every Thief hath at the
gallows! To be then without the Spirit of prayer,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45240:48"/>
when without it there cannot an acceptable word
or groan be uttered, and when the rejection of our
ſuits and perſon, will be the prologue to the
final judicial rejection, and will be a diſtreſs ſo
grievous as preſumptuous Souls will not believe,
till ſad experience become their Tutor: Can you
imagine that you ſhall then at laſt, be taught the
art of <hi>acceptable Prayer,</hi> meerly by horrour, and
the natural ſenſe of pain and danger, as Sea-men
in a ſtorm, or a Malefactor by the rack, when
in your health and leaſure you will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to the daily uſe of ſerious Prayer, but

               <p>Indeed there are many prayers muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or elſe this Prayer [<hi>Lord Jeſus receive my

to find it ſo. You muſt firſt pray for renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sanctifying grace, for the death of ſin, and
the Pardon of ſin, for a holy life and a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

               <p>How ſad is it to obſerve that thoſe that have

there is time and room for prayer! Their judge
is willing now to hear them, and now they

have nothing but hypocritical lifeleſs words to

which they thus deſpiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24. Of all men
in the world, it ill becomes one in ſo deep neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and dangers to be prayerleſs.</p>
               <p>But for you Chriſtians, that are daily exerciſed
in this holy converſe with your Maker, hold on,
and grow not ſtrange to heaven, and let not your
holy deſires be extinguiſhed for want of excitation:
Prayer is your aſcent to heaven; your departure
from a vexatious world, to treat with God for
your Salvation: your retirement from a World of
dangers into the impregnable fortreſs where you
are ſafe; and from vanity unto felicity; and from
troubles unto Reſt: Which though you cannot
come ſo near, nor enjoy ſo fully and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as hereafter you ſhall do, yet <hi>thus</hi> do
you make your <hi>approaches</hi> to it, and <hi>thus</hi> do
you ſecure your future full fruition of it. And let
them all ſcoff at <hi>hearty fervent Prayer</hi> as long as
they will, yet <hi>Prayer</hi> ſhall do that with God <hi>for you,</hi>
which health, and wealth, and dignity, and honor,
and carnal pleaſures, and all the World ſhall never
do for one of them. And though they neglect and
villifie it now, yet the hour is near, when they
will be fain to ſcamble and bungle at it themſelves;
and the face of death will better teach them the uſe
of prayer, than our doctrine and example now can
do. A departing Soul will not eaſily be prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45240:51"/>
nor eaſily be content with ſleepy prayers:
But alas! it is not every Prayer that hath <hi>ſome fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency</hi>
from the power of fear, that ſhall ſucceed:
Many a thouſand may periſh for ever that have
prayed [<hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit</hi>] But the Soul
that breatheth after Chriſt, and is weary of ſinning,
and hath long been preſſing toward the mark, may
receive incouragement for his laſt petitions, from
the bent and ſucceſs of all the foregoing prayers
of his life: Believe it Chriſtians, your cannot be
ſo ready to beg of Chriſt to Receive your ſouls,
as he is ready and willing to receive them. As you
<hi>came praying</hi> therefore into the <hi>world of Grace, go
praying out</hi> of it into the <hi>world of Glory.</hi> It is not
a work that you were never uſed to (though you
have had lamented backwarneſs, and coldneſs, and
omiſſions): It is not to a God that you were never
with before: As you know whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
ſo you may know to whom you pray: It is
indeed a moſt important ſuit to beg for the <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a departing ſoul:</hi> but it is put up <hi>to him</hi> to
whom it <hi>properly</hi> doth <hi>belong;</hi> and <hi>to him</hi> that hath
encouraged you by anſwering many a former pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with that mercy which was the earneſt of this;
and it is to him that loveth ſouls much better than
any ſoul can love it ſelf. O live in prayer, and
die in prayer: And do not as the graceleſs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
world, deſpiſe prayer while they live, and
then think a <hi>Lord have mercy on me,</hi> ſhall prove
enough to paſs them into heaven: Mark their
Statutes and Monuments in the Churches, whether
they be not made kneeling and lifting up the hands,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45240:51"/>
to tell you that all will be forced to <hi>pray,</hi> or to
<hi>approve of prayer</hi> at their <hi>death,</hi> whatever they
ſay againſt it in their life. O pray and wait but a
little longer, and all your danger will be paſt,
and you are ſafe for ever! Keep up your hands
a litte longer, till you ſhall end your conflict
with the laſt enemy, and ſhall paſs from <hi>Prayer</hi>
to <hi>everlaſting Praiſe.</hi>
