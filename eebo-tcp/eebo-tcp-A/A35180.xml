            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Following Paper was Deliver'd to my hand by the Reverend Author of it, with a Charge to Communicate it to the Mayor, and Other Worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the City of <hi>Bristol:</hi> But being Prevented by some Earnest Bus'ness in <hi>London,</hi> So that I could not Acquit my self of my Trust so soon as I intended, I found the Memory of This Reverend Good Man, so Coursly, and so Injuriously Treated by Divers Ill Tongues; that instead of Doing him Right by some Few Written Copies to his Particular Acquaintances and Friends, I rather made Choice of Committing the Original to the Press, as a more Publique Way of Iustice and Vindication.</p>
            <p>It was This Gentlemans Lot, among some Others of his very Loyal, and Orthodox Neighbours, to fall under the Lash and Scandal of Several Reproches: Wherein He was so Sollicitous to Clear Himself, that next to the Great Work of making his Peace with God, The Thing in the World, that lay nearest his Heart, was the Leaving of a Good Name behind him: Which he thought could not better be Secur'd then by the Solemnity of This Following <hi>Declaration.</hi> It was his Own Proper Act; Sign'd by his Own Hand; And in Delivering it over to the World in the very Syllables that I reccived it, I reckon that I have done my Duty.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worshipfull Sir <hi>William Clutterbuck,</hi> Mayor, with the Worshipfull, and others my very Good Friends, and Neighbours, the Citizens of <hi>Bristol.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving had my Lot cast by Divine Providence for Sixteen years amongst you; and having now through great indisposition of body received the Sentence of death, I am desirous (though with brokenness of words, through extremity of pain) yet to take my last leave of you and the World; with that sincere nakedness of heart, and truth, wherewith I expect to appear before my Judge and Saviour.</p>
            <p>I rejoice and am humbly thankfull to God, that I (though a wretched Sinfull man) may now dy in the Communion of the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> as established by Law. And as a peaceable Subject under my most gracious Prince, to whom I and all his Leige-people do owe a most chearfull and ready obedience: not only for Conscience Sake, he being Gods Vicegerent over us; But even as the fruit of just gratitude for his most admired conduct of the Government for our Common good, while we have been so formidably involved in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive and almost inextricable dangers.</p>
            <p>I do rejoice with you in those signall expresses, you and your <hi>City</hi> have shewn, both of Loyalty toward your Prince, and of Love to the Church of God: And do beseech Almighty God that you may yet encrease therein more and more. But for asmuch as the seeds of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall great Evills, and very Pernicious both to Church, and State, have grown up here (as the envious mans Tares, where better Seed had been sown) I do pray you, that I may, by these few lines, leave this as my last sense, to them who have been thus drawn aside into the snare of the evill one: It is now no time either to flatter with Softness, or to chide with Passion (<hi>Moses</hi> himself might not speak unadvisedly with his lips, how froward soever the People were at the waters of Strife) I do pity them with all my heart, and do wish as well to their Persons and Souls as I do to my self and my own everlasting concerns. But poor men, I fear they have scarce throughly considered the sad rise, and History of their present dissents from this Church. With what indecent virulencies these Feudes began at <hi>Frankfort;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41490:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the open offence of the Magistracy there, as a sad <hi>Omen</hi> of what would, and did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards so fatally ensue. With what bitter contempt of their Sovereign, and Christian authority they proceeded Secretly to undermine, and openly to threaten the Government in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and K. <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign. With what male contentedness (as the Leprosy that Cleaved of old to the walls of the house) they had leavened the body of the People in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles the First</hi> of blessed memory: till they had inforced their high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Religion to bring forth that bloody Monster of Rebellion. I do pray them for the love of God, and as ever they tender the true wellfare of this Church and State: that they would no longer continue fighters against God, but return to the Bishop and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heerd of their Souls.</p>
            <p>I Intreat them to consider, there is no key of knowledge unkindly taken from them. No mutilated Sacraments obtruded upon them. No Divine Administrations in an unknown tongue; but all pious methods for Gods Glory, and their edification, laid (by the great care &amp; Wisdom of their Successive Princes) before them. If there be any Shadow of good things to come in the Old Testament: If any thing of greater Glory revealed in the New, themselves cannot but acknowledge the principall things of both to be illustriously set forth in a most religious Order, commemorated and preserved in this Church, to the Joy of all good Christians. If there be any thing of Primitive Devotion (which we all seem so affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately to pant and long after) 'tis here tenderly cherished, and truly defecate from the innovations which corrupt and later times had unhappily introduced: that we might drink of these holy waters as they run clear and crystall at the Spring-head. And if the fruit of righteousness be sown in peace, of them that make peace; I hope they will then for ever abandon these fierce and Joyless contentions. Welcome! Welcome! that serene Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the State, Welcome! those mild Administrations in the Church, which breed such peaceable Subjects to the Throne of <hi>David;</hi> such peaceable Sons and Daughters to the House of God. Oh <hi>Pray for the Peace of Ierusalem, they shall prosper that love thee.</hi> There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</p>
            <p>Faintness denies me to proceed any further. God Almighty bless our most Gracious King, his lawfull Heirs, and Successors, and whatever bold insolencies have been lately ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by some, to the Affronting the true line of the Succession, I hope shall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth quietly end in that Propheticall Prediction, <hi>They shall afterward return, and serve God, and</hi> David <hi>their King for ever: and no more meddle with them that are given to Change.</hi> And now Brethren I commend you to God, and the word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
