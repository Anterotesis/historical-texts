            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE to all true friendly READERS.</head>
            <p>LEt the <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> wrought <hi>in,</hi> and ſpoken <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through his holy Servants,</hi> be of everlaſting <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to all Ages and Generations to come, that the Lord God which formed all Mankind, may have glory in all the Works of his Hands, even for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Surely Friends, for ſundry righteous <hi>Cauſes,</hi> my Spirit could deſire a <hi>Recordance</hi> of the <hi>enſuing Writings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One, in that they are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Labours</hi> of a <hi>Valiant Souldier,</hi> yet <hi>Meek Follower of the Lamb</hi> of God; who through <hi>Travels, Trials,</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> in divers manners, in <hi>Faithfulneſs, Boldneſs, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Undantedneſs,</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Power of God, Kept the Faith to the End, and Finiſhed his Courſe in that which the Lord Almighty accepts of, and now Reſts in Glory with the Lamb and his Troops of Angels, which I ſignifie unto you as is ſealed unto me by the Spirit of Life and Immortality.</p>
            <p>Another is, in that the <hi>Work it ſelf</hi> (to euery true underſtanding Heart) may plainly appear to be of God. In one reſpect by his <hi>Propheſies,</hi> certain of which became fulfilled, whilſt yet he bore the Body about him; in another reſpect, by his <hi>plain, pure, clear, candid, and righteous dealing</hi> with all ſorts, without reſpect of perſons, to whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb facs="tcp:98246:3"/>
his Sayings, <hi>viz. Thunders to the Rocks and Mountains, and Streams of ſweet milk, wine and honey, to the Bleſſed Living Babes of the Bleſſed living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet not by this do I appear before any clear Eye, as a perſon promoting a perſon in the ſeat of the hearts of People; for alas the duſt is already returned to earth again, and the Spirit to God who gave it: but though the Creature is fallen, flatted and converted to its proper center, I cannot but in remembrance of that Spirit which once bore it as its Tabernacle, in that Veſſel, to walk and wade through many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, afflictions and ſorrows, for the ſeeds ſake of its own Father, ſince its now entred into the Boſom of the Father, as a Life lept out of a lump of clay. I ſay, I cannot but in a <hi>Recordance</hi> of it, and in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance</hi> with it, even in the ſelf ſame ſubſtance ſay, <hi>though the Name of the Wicked ſhall rot,</hi> yet <hi>let the Memory of the Righteous live, let his day be as a bleſſedneſs in every eye, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Life a rejoycing in the hearts of the upright.</hi> Surely I need not ſtudy a <hi>Motto,</hi> nor dive into Invention to fetch up an <hi>Inſcription</hi> to be engraven on the Tombe, ſince <hi>the Names of the Faithful are in the Book of God, and their glory is in him for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this I may ſay to the livers, and (as yet) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainers in the Power of the ſame teſtimony, which he with others have held as a Pattern and Example (to thoſe which follow after) to the end. He that hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb facs="tcp:98246:3"/>
his Courſe in faithfulneſs, hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him that yet remaineth and hath his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to finiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> In that he is redeemed from all cauſualties which might happen by temptation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yea and from all poſſibilities of loſing the Crown of immortal Life, and Reward of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of everlaſting Glory and Joy, being already poſſeſſed of the unchangable Inheritance, even where cauſualties and temptations reach not; the which cauſualties and temptations are incident in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other, to the pure, upright and faithful, whilſt yet in the body of fleſh or tabernacle of clay, where it can be felt and ſenced.</p>
            <p>And therefore to all ſuch I ſay, fear and dread the living God, to the end of your days, that in the ſame life you may all finiſh a teſtimony for God, as he that is gone before you. Yea again I ſay, fear the ſame God whilſt yet you bear a Teſtimony for him, leſt by any means you ſhould fall from the Life of the Teſtimony, and the laſt of your day become the leaſt glorious unto you.</p>
            <p>And I in the fear of my Father, do live in the love to you, which often breatheth forth my heart in the Spirit of ſupplication and prayer, conſtraining me to put up requeſts to the Throne for you, the which (as the Spirit breaths) is deſired may alſo by you be done in the behalf of your Brother in the innocency of the Lamb,</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98246:19"/>
God had begotten in you (which cannot be ſatisfied without his preſence) that began to be ſorely oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in you, by the ſin (which ſeparates from Gods preſence) which got up more and more in you, through your turning from the Power which ye once felt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and working in you againſt ſin: And then a grievous weight or burden came upon the Righteous Seed in you; and then it began to groan and cry to God from under the burden and weight of iniquity that was upon it, and then the <hi>Light</hi> appeared more brighter in you again, (for the Seeds ſake which ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you) and ſhewed you that you were wrong; then the <hi>Light</hi> judged you for the wrong, and then trouble came upon you, and encreaſed in your minds; and then the Serpent, the Subtilty, the Devil (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in the Truth) he appeared likewiſe in you, and begot a hurrying and a confuſed noiſe in your minds, and then preſented many things unto you, and ſtirred you up to do them, that ſo he might draw ye from hearkening unto the <hi>Light</hi> (wherein you ſhould have waited to have heard and known God's Voice and Counſel, and to have ſeen and heard what God had required at your hands) and thus the Subtilty, which is the Devil, who was a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and abode not in the Truth, ſought to draw you from the <hi>Light</hi> (which is the Truth) that ſo he might murder the Righteous Seed, which God had begotten in you, (unto which Seed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are) Now your minds being drawn from the <hi>Light,</hi> which convinced you of ſin, you entred further into ſin, and then you could not find any power for to reſiſt ſin, becauſe you went from the Light which ſhewed you your ſin, wherein ye ſhould have waited to have received power againſt ſin, and then the Seed ſuffered in you, by the ſin which ye were entred into
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98246:19"/>
exceedingly; and trouble increaſed more and more in your minds, (this hath been the condition of ſome of you) and then the Subtilty drew you into reaſonings and conſultings what to do, that ſo the burden which you felt, and the trouble in your minds might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: So ye hearkning unto the Subtilty, he then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſeveral things unto you to be done, ſome of which once were commanded by God to be done by them unto whom the Command came; and ſo the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty perſwaded you, that you muſt do thoſe things likewiſe, before ye could have peace, and witneſs the burden and trouble removed, which ye felt; So he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn you out of the ſenſibleneſs and feeling of the <hi>Light</hi> and Power of God, your underſtandings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wholly darkned, as unto the Counſel of God, and then theſe things which the ſubtil enemy preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, exceedingly pleaſed the affectionate part in you, and ſome of you he perſwaded to act ſuch things as God never commanded any to act; and ſo ye going from the <hi>Light</hi> (which never changeth) and hearkning unto the Subtilty (which leads into changeableneſs) here ye began to run into <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> and <hi>Heaps,</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi>; yea, here is the ground and riſe, and beginning of all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> in the world, peoples going from the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, which leads into the Subſtance, and into one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, and hearkning unto the Subtilty, which leads but into the likewiſe of <hi>Truth,</hi> and into <hi>ſelf-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>changeableneſs</hi> of mind; and when the <hi>Serpent</hi> had drawn you into ſeveral Opinions and Practices in your VVorſhip, then he fed you with knowledge, that ſo each of you might be able to plead and contend for your Opinions and Practices; and then he begot a ſtrong, hot, haſty will in you (which hath been called Zeal for God, whereby he drew you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98246:20"/>
into hot contentions one with another, and ſo by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little he raiſed up a ſecret envy and prejudice in you, one againſt each other, till at length ſome of you brake forth into rage, and ſcorn, giving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcornful Names.</p>
            <p>And thus the Myſterie of Iniquity wrought in many of you, until the Seed grew weak in you, (as to your feeling) and became as a dead thing unto you, being thus ſtrangled in you, by your going from the Power, into thoſe things that the Power of God never moved, or drew you to act, (but the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which abode not in the Power) So then you were not ſenſible of ſuch a burden indeed, as ye were once ſenſible of, when the Seed which God had begotten in you, was more quick and lively, and then the Subtilty perſwaded you, that now you were right, becauſe you felt not ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and trouble in your minds as you once did; and then a joy ſprung in you for a time, and then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty perſwaded you, that you were now entred into the VVork, and Service, and VVorſhip of <hi>God</hi>; and that he had given you ſome reward, becauſe you were not ſenſible of ſuch a burden, &amp; trouble in your minds as ye were before you acted thoſe things in your VVorſhip; and thus the Subtility beguiled ſome of you: But this condition continued not long with you, for God's eternal VVitneſs (which ye had as it were ſlain, and made merry over it) that aroſe and appeared in you again, for the Seeds ſake, and diſturbed and broke that falſe peace, and joy, and perſwaſion, that you were got into, (through tranſgreſſing [<hi>and going from</hi>] that which is pure of God in you, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things in the Tranſgreſſion, which God never required at your hands) and then with God's witneſs, the <hi>Light,</hi> you ſaw your ſelves wrong again, and the <hi>Light</hi> judged you for your forwardneſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98246:20"/>
and then you begun to loath thoſe Practices in your worſhip, which before you delighted in, and then ſomething you came to feel ſtirring in you again, which was not ſatisfied, but breathed, and groaned, and cryed unto the Lord; and then you were in a fine tender condition again; But then the Subtilty ſoon appeared in you again, and preſented ſome other new things unto you, and called thoſe which he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led you into, old, empty, weak and beggerly things, and thus he wrought in the ſubtilty, to draw you from hearkning unto that which made manifeſt your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition unto you; and thus he hath drawn ſome of you into moſt of the Sects and Opinions that be in the World, and through them, and thus in the ſubtilty hath he wrought in you to ſave his head, (or life) for he knew that if you had hearkned unto the truth of <hi>God</hi> as it appeared in you, and had obeyed it, that then <hi>God's</hi> Power would mightily have been made manifeſt in you, whereas the Seed immortal would have been raiſed up in you, which would have bruiſed his head.</p>
            <p>So take notice how the Lord's love, the Light, hath followed you, and checked, and reproved you for your haſtineſs and forwardneſs, and hath ſhewed unto you the emptineſs and deadneſs of all the profeſſion and worſhip that ever you have run into.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes when you have been brought into lowlineſs and tenderneſs; by the Power of the Lord which hath ſmitten you, then the Lord hath opened mighty things in you unto his Seed, which breathed and thirſted after his Righteouſneſs, and could not be ſatisfied without it, and then the Serpent hath wrought in you again in the ſubtilty, to lead you from that which opened, and from the pure, and ſo lead you up in the boaſting Nature, to hold forth thoſe things in the fleſhly Principle which the Lord opened unto his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98246:21"/>
own Seed; and thus he hath kept you out of the Life and Power of Truth, and he hath filled ſome of you with ſtrange imagimations, and expectations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Chriſt, and his appearance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; and ſo all along he hath ſtrove to keep you from minding Gods appearance within you, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your minds into the viſible changeable things, and yet the Lord in love to his own Seed hath ſpared you; ſo mind the Lords long patience, and forbearance which hath been great towards you, for his Seeds ſake in you, which breathes and thirſts after his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and cannot be ſatisfied without his life and preſence.</p>
            <p>And truly friends my love is exceeding tender and large towards you in whom there is ſuch a pure tender Seed ſtirring, and my deſire is (who have ſeen the emptineſs of all Profeſſion without the life) that you might come to witneſs the Seed ſatisfied in you (with the Pure Power, and Life, and Virtue of the Living God) which hath ſuffered long in you, and hath not been ſatisfied by reaſon of your diſobedience unto the Light.</p>
            <p>Therefore in Tender Bowels of Love and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto you, I do freely declare unto you all, The New and Living way which hath been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which is <hi>CHRIST JESUS,</hi> the <hi>true Light <hi>which lighteth every one which cometh into the World</hi>,</hi> whereby every one of you believing in the Light, may come to receive a particular ſatisfaction from Chriſt, from whence the Light doth come.</p>
            <p>Friends, <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall,</hi> but you have tranſgreſſed and gone from the manifeſtation of Gods Spirit in your own particulars, and ſo it is impoſſible for you ever to profit in the things of God, or come to receive
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98246:21"/>
a particular ſatisfaction, until you come to own that, and believe in that, which you have tranſgreſſed and gone from, which was given you to profit withall, and to lead you into the ſubſtance, which giveth ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Now the manifeſtation of the Spirit doth ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you your runings, and willings, and actings, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings that ye have been in, whereby ye could never obtain ſatisfaction unto that in you which breathes to do the Will of God; now you muſt mind that which makes manifeſt theſe things unto you, and as you take notice of that (which is the Light) and wait in it, you will come to feel it drawing you into ſtilneſs, and coolneſs, and quietneſs of ſpirit; and then with the Light you will come to diſcern the ſubtilty, and the motions thereof, which have oft beguiled you, by drawing you from quietneſs and ſtilneſs, into the Airy imaginations, whereby he hath toſſed and unſetled your minds; and as you waite in that which doth make manifeſt, (which is the Light) and believe in it, you will come to feel ſomething ariſing in you, in Power to Judge and condemn the ſubtilty, as that ſtirs in you to draw you from waiting upon God, and then you will come to know and feel, the ſpirit of Judgement and burning, placed in you to purge you, and as you wait in the Judgement in patience and ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you will come to hear the ſtill voice that is ſpoken of in the Scriptures, ſaying, <hi>This is the way</hi> (and ſhewing it unto you) and when you ſee the way, as you wait in that which ſhewes it unto you, then you will come to hear the Command in Power, ſaying unto you, <hi>walk in it,</hi> and then you will come to know your Teacher which cannot be removed into a corner; and ſo here the path of the juſt ye will all come to know and witneſs in your ſelves, which is the ſhining Light
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98246:22"/>
which ſhineth more and more, until the perfect day; for as you all wait in that which calls for ſtilneſs and ſilence to the fleſh and the motions thereof, ye will come then to ſee more Light, and ſo ye will come to witneſs what <hi>David</hi> ſpoke to be true, who ſaid to God, <hi>In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light,</hi> and then the juſt (which hath been long oppreſſed and burthened in you) will begin to ſpring, and as you believe and wait in the Light, your minds being ſtaid in it, you will come to feel God's Living Power working and opperating in you, condemning and removing that in you, which hath oppreſſed and burthened the juſt, and ſo by God's pure Power, (as you wait and continue in it,) you will come to feel and witneſs the juſt holy Seed raiſed up in you, from under that which did oppreſs and burthen it; and here you will feel the captive come out of captivity by the Goſpel, which is the Power of God, and the Priſon door ſet open, and the Priſoners ſet at Liberty; And then as you wait in the Light you will come to feel God's pure Powerful Preſence, and Life and Virtue runing through you, which will refreſh the Seed, which is tender, and give ſatisfaction unto it; and ſo as you all wait low in the fear of God, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Light, that nothing may get up in you to boaſt and glory which is not of God, you will then feel your love exceedingly encreaſed towards the <hi>Pure Living Truth of God,</hi> and your whole delight will be to walk in the Truth, in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs, (without which no man ſhall ſee the Living God)</hi> and as you all walk in the <hi>Light</hi> obeying it, you will come into the Pure Fellowſhip, and Communion and Unity of the Saints, and then you will feel the Life, which is the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> cleanſing you, purging and purifying you from all Sin: and ſo as every one of you abide in the Faith, feeling it, and ſtanding in the Power
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98246:22"/>
of God that will purifie your hearts, and give you victory over the World, and then you will come to receive a particular ſatisfaction from Chriſt the Power, which is the Author and ground of the Saints Faith, and you will feel God's Spirit, and Power, and Life as you dwell in it, drawing and leading you into whatſoever he requireth you to do; and as you all wait and are ſtill in that which doth diſcern the thoughts and the intents of your hearts, and makes them mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto you, you will clearly come to diſcern the Subtilty and the motions thereof, which would draw you to act ſuch things as the Lord doth not require you to act.</p>
            <p>So all take heed to that <hi>which diſcerns the thoughts and intents of your hearts</hi>; for this is a meaſure of the Word of Life, which is quick and powerful, and as you all wait in it, you will feel it to be ſo: for you will feel it dividing the precious in you from the vile; and this is the <hi>Ingrafted Word</hi> which is able to ſave your Souls.</p>
            <p>So this is not written to feed the carnal mind in any; but it is written for your ſakes, who are truely breathing and thirſting after God's Righteouſneſs, and cannot be ſatisfied without it; that ſo you may all come into the true Light wherewith you are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that you with it may come to ſee how you have been toſſed and tumbled up and down by the Subtilty of the Serpent, in thoſe things which could never give you true peace nor ſatisfaction; and that now through believing in the Truth and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit, you may all come to witneſs a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſatisfaction, and that you may come to feel the pure Image of the Holy God reſtored in you, even his everlaſting Righteouſneſs, his Power, his Wiſdom, his Life and Glory raiſed up in you, to have Dominion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98246:23"/>
and to rule over all the earth, and to ſubdue it; that ſo the pure God of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> might be glorified in your mortal Bodies, and that you might all come to feel and witneſs an everlaſting habitation of <hi>Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in him; who is worthy of all Honour, and Praiſe, and Thankſgiving, and Dominion for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſome of you who have been antient Profeſſors, will ſay to us, <hi>If we ſhould joyn to you, we muſt lay down all then that ever we have profeſſed; and what, have we been Profeſſors ſo many years, and yet have to begin all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again?

               <hi>To this I anſwer,</hi> Friends, if you come to joyn to the <hi>Truth,</hi> you muſt then lay down, and leave, and forſake all that, which you have held up and practiſed in your own wills, which you were never led or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hold up or practice by the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi>; but I do know and own, that there was a pure living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of God, oft ſtirring in you, in your Profeſſions; by which Principle of God, you oft ſaw that you were wrong, and that you did that which was not <hi>well-pleaſing</hi> the ſight of God in your Profeſſion; for that <hi>Principle of God</hi> in you, the <hi>Light,</hi> judged and condemned you for many of your actions which you acted; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Lord's Witneſs</hi> brought you into a tender low condition; and then opened things unto the <hi>Seed</hi> in you, but you not taking heed to the <hi>Light,</hi> to be the guide and ſtay of your minds, you continued not long in that condition, but you conſulted with the Subtilty (which drew you from <hi>God's Witneſs</hi>) what you ſhould do, and ſo waited not in that, which brought you into tenderneſs to receive <hi>God's Counſel</hi> in that; but you took <hi>Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and your own <hi>Hearts,</hi> and ſo ran into things which God never required at your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98246:23"/>
hands, and therefore God had no <hi>regard</hi> unto your <hi>Worſhip,</hi> becauſe it was not <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>in the Truth,</hi> you not being guided therein by <hi>the Spirit of Truth</hi>; So unto that which was in <hi>the Beginning</hi> you muſt all <hi>come,</hi> which is Chriſt <hi>the true Light,</hi> who hath <hi>enlightned you</hi>; and you muſt learn of <hi>Him,</hi> who is <hi>the Light of Life, the VVord,</hi> and <hi>the Power,</hi> by which all things were <hi>made,</hi> and are <hi>upheld,</hi> and you muſt be <hi>ſubject</hi> unto the meaſure of <hi>Him</hi> in <hi>you</hi>; and this his <hi>Meaſure,</hi> if you ſubmit to <hi>it,</hi> that will bring you to ceaſe from your <hi>own wills</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> and to wait in <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> to ſee and feel Chriſt <hi>the Power of God,</hi> to work all your <hi>works in you,</hi> and <hi>for you</hi>; and if you own <hi>the Light,</hi> that will plainly ſhew unto you how God formerly <hi>appeared</hi> unto you, and how you went from his <hi>appearance</hi>; ſo <hi>the Light</hi> will own that which God opened unto you at any <hi>time,</hi> but it will deny and condemn your <hi>own imaginations,</hi> which you mixed with that which God <hi>opened</hi> unto you; and ſo unto <hi>this Witneſs</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> you muſt <hi>all come,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and wait in that, which will ſeparate the <hi>precious</hi> from the <hi>vile,</hi> before that can be ſatisfied in you which <hi>breaths</hi> after God.</p>
            <p>So my tender <hi>love</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> is unto that in you which is not yet <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> but doth truly <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> after the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power of Truth</hi>; and my <hi>Soul</hi> doth <hi>travel</hi> for freedom and ſatisfaction of <hi>that Seed,</hi> and I <hi>ſuffer</hi> with <hi>it,</hi> and bear many things for <hi>its ſake,</hi> for I have true <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with that in you, and I know <hi>it,</hi> and am known of <hi>it</hi>; but I cannot have <hi>Unity</hi> with many of your <hi>Practices,</hi> which ye have been <hi>in,</hi> becauſe they have cauſed the <hi>Seed</hi> in you, (with which I have <hi>Unity</hi>) exceedingly to <hi>ſuffer</hi>; you not being guided and led into them by the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi>; and ſo againſt all ſuch <hi>Practices</hi> I do bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98246:24"/>
in the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> and I labour in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love,</hi> to turn Peoples minds unto the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> which is given to every man wherewith to <hi>profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So all People, feel that, and mind that, and hearken unto that which oft riſeth in your hearts, againſt <hi>Luſt,</hi> againſt <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> againſt <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>needleſs words</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and againſt <hi>all evil</hi> in its appearance; and as you all mind this Principle which moves and ſtirs in you, againſt <hi>all evil,</hi> you will feel it divide your <hi>good words</hi> from your <hi>bad words,</hi> and <hi>good thoughts</hi> from <hi>bad thoughts,</hi> and <hi>good deeds</hi> from <hi>bad deeds</hi>; and that which divides betwixt theſe, and ſhews you the difference of them, this is the <hi>Word</hi> which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wrote of, <hi>which is nigh in the mouth, and in the heart</hi>; Yea, this is the <hi>Word of Reconciliation,</hi> which reconciles to God; this is the <hi>ingrafted Word,</hi> which is able to ſave the Soul.</p>
            <p>Now you being turned to <hi>this Word,</hi> even to that <hi>which diſcerns the thoughts and intents of your hearts,</hi> as ye wait in this, let the <hi>Subtilty</hi> appear never ſo ſubtilly to draw your hearts after any thing, or into any <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which the Lord requireth not of you, then <hi>this Word,</hi> which is <hi>the Power,</hi> it will make it manifeſt unto you, and it will ſtop you from entring into any ſuch <hi>Practices,</hi> if you wilfully reſiſt it not; and <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>waiting</hi> in <hi>this Word,</hi> it will not ſuffer you to ſpeak any haſty <hi>unſavoury words,</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> and then ye will come to be truly ſenſible of a <hi>bridle</hi> to the <hi>tongue,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>vain</hi>; and <hi>this Word,</hi> ye taking it to be your <hi>guide,</hi> it will bring you into ſavoury <hi>ſound words,</hi> ſeaſoned with the <hi>Grace of God</hi>; and ſo as your <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>lives,</hi> come to be ordered by <hi>this Word</hi> (Chriſt the <hi>Power of God</hi>) they will reach unto the <hi>Witneſs of God</hi> in every one where ye come; and if ye
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98246:24"/>
will hear <hi>this Word,</hi> and regard <hi>it,</hi> and not reſiſt <hi>it,</hi> it will work <hi>true Faith</hi> in you, by which you will feel your hearts purified from <hi>ſin,</hi> and ye will feel it giving you <hi>Victory</hi> over the World, <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi>; and if ye keep in <hi>this Faith,</hi> ye will not make haſte, for ye will feel the <hi>Eternal Light</hi> (which is the Life of the <hi>Word</hi>) calling and drawing you out of the <hi>hasty nature,</hi> into <hi>ſoberneſs, ſtilneſs,</hi> and <hi>quietneſs,</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo ye will feel your ſtrength renewed in the Lord, as ye all wait upon him in his <hi>Light</hi>; and all believing in the <hi>Light,</hi> ye will not come into <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>; and as ye all wait in that which <hi>diſcerns</hi> and <hi>reveals</hi> the thoughts and the <hi>intents</hi> of your <hi>hearts</hi> (which is the <hi>Word of Power</hi>) this alſo will divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your <hi>good thoughts</hi> and your <hi>bad thoughts,</hi> and the <hi>good motions</hi> and the <hi>bad motions,</hi> which you will ſee ſtirring in your <hi>minds</hi>; and if you hold faſt the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> it will preſerve and keep you out of the <hi>bad thoughts</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> and it will joyn you unto the <hi>good,</hi> and ye will come to feel the <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God in you, to ſhake, and overturn, and work out that ground (which hath been in you) from whence the <hi>bad words,</hi> and <hi>bad thoughts,</hi> and <hi>bad motions</hi> have aroſe, which have burdened the oppreſſed and <hi>tender Seed</hi> in you, which you never could witneſs <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with all that ever you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but as ye all <hi>believe,</hi> and wait in this <hi>unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſure</hi> of God, you will come to feel the <hi>burden</hi> taken off the <hi>Seed</hi>; and ye will come to feel and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more true <hi>durable peace</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in one hours waiting upon God, than ever you felt and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in all the words that ever you have heard from any man or woman in all your lives, or in all your Practices, that ever you have practiſed (before you were brought to wait upon God in <hi>his Gifts,</hi> which he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98246:25"/>
hath given you to profit withal) although in thoſe things which we have <hi>practiſed,</hi> I know ye have had a great joy appearing in you for a <hi>time,</hi> but it was not <hi>durable</hi> nor <hi>laſting</hi>; for when God's <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful Witneſs,</hi> (the <hi>Light</hi>) appeared and ſhewed you how that God never <hi>required</hi> thoſe things at your <hi>hands,</hi> which you had practiſed, then your <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> withered and came to an <hi>end,</hi> which you appeared ſometime to have in thoſe <hi>Practices</hi>; and if at any time ye came to feel ſome little <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>refreſhment,</hi> through what God opened to the <hi>Seed</hi> in you, when by his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> ye were brought into ſome <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> ye ſoon loſt this alſo, by going from that which brought you into the <hi>tenderneſs</hi>; But as you all come into the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and abide in it, this will bring you into the <hi>ſeaſoned Life,</hi> and then ye will come to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> pure <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>refreſhment,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> which will <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> for ever with you, if ye <hi>abide</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and then ye will be made willing to lay down and deny all that which ye have been <hi>acting,</hi> which ye never were led and guided to <hi>act</hi> by God's <hi>Pure Holy Spirit</hi>; and to deny all ſuch alſo, as would draw you to <hi>act</hi> that which God requireth not at your hands.</p>
            <p>So take heed of ſuch as <hi>daub</hi> with <hi>untempered morter,</hi> and <hi>heal deceitfully,</hi> who will <hi>ſpeak peace,</hi> when there is no <hi>true peace,</hi> (but the <hi>pure Witneſs</hi> of God <hi>condemns</hi>) for ſuch, with <hi>good words</hi> and <hi>fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> keeping them <hi>ever learning,</hi> but <hi>never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth</hi>; and theſe <hi>through covetouſneſs and feigned words, make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of poor People,</hi> for they have a <hi>Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but they deny and reſiſt <hi>the Power,</hi> and therefore <hi>from ſuch turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all mind that, and feel that, and be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98246:25"/>
that, which for ſin condemns <hi>ſin in the fleſh,</hi> and then you will feel the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> through which the <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,</hi> which <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God; So all wait in the <hi>meek, lowly, quiet Spirit,</hi> that ye may come to witneſs this <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> which delights to do the <hi>Will of God,</hi> (by the power and <hi>Life of God</hi>) raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in you, ſatisfied, and brought forth out of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
            <p>And look not out, nor ſtrive after great and high things beyond <hi>your meaſures</hi> (for that <hi>puffs up,</hi> and leads into <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>dark imaginations</hi>) but all wait and be ſtill in the meaſure of <hi>God's Light</hi> manifeſted in you, that ſo you may come to feel him revealing his <hi>ſecrets</hi> and <hi>myſteries</hi> unto the <hi>Babes,</hi> which cannot live or be ſatisfied without him.</p>
            <p>God is making known that, and ſtirring that in the hearts of People (throughout the World) which doth and ſhall confound and overturn all the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> and the ſubtilty of the <hi>Serpent</hi> (from whence all the <hi>Worlds Wiſdom</hi> aroſe) and therefore the hand of the Lord will be <hi>terrible</hi> and <hi>heavy</hi> upon the <hi>diſobedient,</hi> who <hi>diſobey</hi> and <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> that which he hath put into their <hi>Hearts,</hi> (whereby he is opening a <hi>mighty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> in the People) But the <hi>everlaſting Bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord over all ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and reſt upon all thoſe that joyn to, and believe in, and obey <hi>that Word</hi> which is nigh, in the mouth, and in the heart.</p>

            <p>HEarken, O ye Nations! and give ear ye Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth: Thus ſaith the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, whoſe Name is the Light, I am the Lord, and there is no other that can ſave; I the Light Created all things, and formed and made you all of the duſt, and I breathed into you my Light, my Life, that ye with it ſhould have been guided, and led in my Wiſdom, to have ordered all things which I have Created, and to have ruled over them all, that I in you might have been honoured and exalted over all the works of my hands, which I the Light Created; But from me the Light ye have departed, and ye have hearkned unto the Subtil Serpent, which is the Devil, (who abode not in me the Light, the Life, the Truth, which Created all things)

whom I have curſed above all the Beaſts of the Earth, who is the Seed of Enmity; and ye hearkening unto him, he hath begotten you into Enmity againſt me the Light; and ſo hath begotten and led you into the Curſe, and ſo he is become your Father and Leader, whom I have curſed, and all that ye bring forth and act in him.

            <p>And all you who are <hi>ſcoffers</hi> and <hi>ſcorners,</hi> who <hi>ſcoff</hi> and <hi>ſcorn</hi> at my children, who in this the day of my Power, have trembled at my Word: Mark, i'le make you aſſuredly <hi>to tremble</hi> and <hi>quake</hi>; yea, you who have deſpiſed me, the Light, and have ſcoffed at my workings in my People, I the Light in you will make you to drink the cup of <hi>Trembling,</hi> and ye ſhall not be able to reſiſt it, and then ye ſhall know that I the Light am he that will <hi>work,</hi> and none ſhall be able to ſtop me, yea, I the everlaſting light will <hi>wound,</hi> &amp; none be able <hi>to heal</hi>; I will <hi>kill,</hi> and none ſhall be able to make <hi>alive:</hi> Therefore conſider what I ſay, before the day of your viſitation be wholly paſt, and return unto me, the light in you, and repent, leſt my long patience come to an end, and ſo I deſtroy you utterly.</p>
            <p>Now all people, in whom there are any true tender deſires after Truth and Righteouſneſs, I the true Light in you did beget them, and if ye will hearken unto me, the Light in you, I will let you ſee all that which doth oppreſs thoſe deſires in you; and I will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew you that which doth oppreſs thoſe deſires in

you, but I the Light (if ye will receive me, and learn of me) will teach you to deny, and to reſiſt all that which is contrary unto me, which doth oppreſſe that which I have begotten in you; and if ye will believe, and wait in me, the Light, I will give you Power to reſiſt all that which is contrary unto me, and I will deſtroy all the works of the Serpent in you, and bruiſe his head, and I will purge out all your iniquities, and forgive all your treſpaſſes, &amp; I will change your nature, and I will make you new Creatures, if ye will hearken unto me, and obey me the Light in you; and I will make you partakers of my Divine Nature; and I will judge, and condemn, and conſume all that in you, which is contrary to my Nature, if ye will abide in the Light; and I will take away all Darkneſs, and earthly-mindedneſs; and I will reveal my ſecrets and myſteries unto my Seed in you, and I will cauſe you to delight alone in me the Light of Life, and I will feed you with the Bread of Life, and ye ſhall drink of my Life, and ye ſhall be ſatisfied; and I will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my Power more and more in you; and if ye will be faithful unto me, and obey my voice, and wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, the Light, then I will make the crooked wayes ſtrait before you, and the rough wayes ſmooth, and I will deſtroy the Power of Darkneſs within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; and if ye will follow me, I will lead you out of the World, and Worldly cares, into patience, into meekneſs, and into ſtilneſs and quietneſs of ſpirit, and whatſoever you ſuffer for my Names ſake, I will be your exceeding great reward, and I will be your dread, and ye ſhall be the dread of Nations, &amp; I will be your Glory, and ye ſhall be the Glory of Nations, and I will reign over you, and ye ſhall reign over all the World, in my Light, and Life, and Power; and if ye continue in me the Light, I will give you Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

            <p>Now if any ſhould ſay, that here is nothing ſpoken of Chriſt, in what I have here written; I anſwer, what I have here written, is the words which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is one with Chriſt the Son, gave unto me to write, in which words the true Chriſt is owned, and a Teſtimony given of him, and no other.</p>
            <p>But further, in the Fear and Wiſdom of God, for the ſatisfaction of the ſimple, I do declare in plain words; <hi>That I do believe in the true Chriſt, the Lord of Life, who was glorified with the Father before the World began; and I do believe that he was in due time made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in that body of fleſh, who was called</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and that in him the fulneſs of the</hi> Godhead <hi>dwelt bodily, who was ſuppoſed to be the</hi> Carpenter's Son, <hi>whom the</hi> Jews <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified without the gates of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins through his blood, who is the Lord of Life, and he was buried, but he is riſen, and Aſcended, and ſits
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98246:33"/>
on the right hand of the Majeſty on high:</hi> This is the Chriſt I own, who alſo was, and is Crucified in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the rebellious; yea, he is Crucified afreſh, and put to open ſhame now, by thoſe that tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the blood of the Covenant, the Light of Life under their feet, and count it an unholy or a natural thing, and ſuch act deſpightfully againſt the Spirit of Grace; and ſuch Murther the Seed which keeps the commands of God; and ſuch will God the Light overthrow and burn to aſhes, as he did <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>; but all that love and obey the true Light (which is the fire) ſhall be ſaved and preſerved by it, and ſhall remain unhurt; but all that hate and diſobey the Light in them, that is their condemnation, the Light.</p>
            <p>Theſe are faithful and true ſayings, and things alſo that muſt ſhortly come to paſs, and he witneſſed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And likewiſe, let there be <hi>no Law</hi> to <hi>compel</hi> any one to <hi>maintain</hi> any <hi>Teacher,</hi> neither let there be any <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>reſtrain</hi> any one from <hi>giving</hi> any thing to their <hi>Teacher,</hi> (for this is but equal) ſo let the People have <hi>Liberty</hi> herein, that ſo <hi>this oppreſsion</hi> about the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Teachers</hi> may <hi>ceaſe</hi>; And then it will ſoon <hi>appear</hi> whether theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> be <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and whether <hi>their Goſpel</hi> will <hi>maintain them</hi>; yea, or nay.</p>
            <p>But many of the Rulers have ſaid, <hi>If we ſhould not provide Maintenance for our Miniſters, then Preaching would ſoon fall, and then many People would become Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, He that is a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Power of God,</hi> which is the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel, a neceſſity</hi> is laid upon him to <hi>Preach the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>wo</hi> be unto him <hi>if he Preach not the Goſpel:</hi> And he that is ſent forth by Chriſt, is not to take thought what he <hi>ſhall eat,</hi> or what he <hi>ſhall drink,</hi> or wherewithal he <hi>ſhall be cloathed</hi>; for his heavenly <hi>Father</hi> knoweth that he hath need of <hi>all theſe things,</hi> and provides them for thoſe that he <hi>ſends forth,</hi> (without an outward Law to compel it) that ſo they lack not any thing.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which the forcing an <hi>outward
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98246:48"/>
Maintenance</hi> for it, will cauſe it to ceaſe, [mark] this <hi>Miniſtry</hi> never did any good or <hi>ſervice</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> nor ever can (that is God's Truth unto you) at the <hi>furtheſt</hi>; this <hi>Miniſtry</hi> hath but brought People <hi>to draw near unto God with</hi> their <hi>mouths,</hi> and to appear to honour him <hi>with their lips,</hi> when <hi>their hearts</hi> have been <hi>afar off,</hi> but this <hi>Miniſtry</hi> could never bring any into the <hi>true knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath ſent and <hi>freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for <hi>a Covenant of Light</hi>; and without this <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> all People upon the Earth are without the <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> and ſo are <hi>Heathens,</hi> whatever they profeſs <hi>in words,</hi> though they may make <hi>long Prayers,</hi> and think to be heard in their <hi>much ſpeaking,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> did, whom Chriſt call'd <hi>Heathens</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider what a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> you have <hi>upheld,</hi> and do <hi>uphold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So let that <hi>Miniſtry fall</hi> which cannot <hi>ſtand</hi> without an <hi>outward Law</hi> for to <hi>compel</hi> an <hi>outward Maintenance for it</hi>; for the Lord regards it not, but his hand is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and againſt that which would uphold it, and <hi>both</hi> muſt <hi>fall together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So what is here declared concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Maintenance of Teachers,</hi> and the like, it is in the <hi>Equal Royal Law</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is, <hi>To love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, and to do unto all as we would be done unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo if <hi>the ſpirit</hi> which we are led and guided by (who are called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers</hi>) be not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> over <hi>that</hi> which we <hi>oppoſe</hi> in <hi>others</hi> as <hi>Error,</hi> then let us <hi>be manifeſted to be in the Error,</hi> and let <hi>us fall</hi>; onely let there be a <hi>fair Tryal,</hi> and let there not be ſuch <hi>beating,</hi> and <hi>haling,</hi> and <hi>tearing,</hi> and <hi>mangling,</hi> and <hi>ſtocking,</hi> and <hi>impriſoning</hi> of the <hi>Creatures</hi> as hath <hi>been</hi>; for where ſuch things <hi>have been acted,</hi> many have been <hi>ſtopped</hi> at <hi>that time</hi> for <hi>ſpeaking</hi> the Truth, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98246:49"/>
the <hi>Truth</hi> hath <hi>prevailed</hi> over all, and ſhall <hi>prevail.</hi> And if that can be proved againſt us truly, that we <hi>plot</hi> at our <hi>Meetings,</hi> or at any other <hi>time</hi> againſt the <hi>outward Governours,</hi> to <hi>overturn them</hi> by an <hi>outward power</hi> or <hi>force</hi>; then let us alſo ſuffer (as I ſaid before) by a <hi>juſt Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if he that ſends us forth, will not <hi>provide Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment</hi> for us, then let us <hi>want</hi>; and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>live</hi> of our <hi>Goſpel</hi> which we Preach, without an <hi>outward Law</hi> to compel us an <hi>outward Maintenance</hi>; and if our <hi>Miniſtry</hi> will not ſtand without it, then let us <hi>want</hi> whereon <hi>to live,</hi> and let our <hi>Miniſtry fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let none be <hi>compelled</hi> to uphold another's <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place</hi> (concerning their Worſhip) for that is <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>; but let every one <hi>uphold</hi> their <hi>own</hi>; and that ſort of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> that will not uphold the <hi>Place</hi> where they <hi>meet</hi> to Worſhip, let their <hi>Houſe fall,</hi> and then it will appear where the <hi>earthly Spirit</hi> lodgeth; for they that <hi>compel others</hi> to uphold <hi>another's place of</hi> Worſhip, do but <hi>cover</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the <hi>earthly Spirit</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let there not be ſuch <hi>havock</hi> made of <hi>Peoples Goods,</hi> as hath been of late upon many, who could not give to the upholding another's <hi>Meeting-houſe</hi>; for that is out of the equality, in the <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So come into <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>equal,</hi> and keep in <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> will bring you to act that which is <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> unto all, and to break all <hi>outward Laws</hi> that are not <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> but tend to <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi>; and truly there are many <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> in this <hi>Nation,</hi> whereby the Innocent are <hi>oppreſt</hi>; ſo wait to feel the Power of God, that ye may <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Govern</hi> in that, (for the Lord;) and <hi>feeling</hi> the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and keeping to that, it will bring you out of all <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> in the <hi>particular,</hi> and ſo to ſtand over
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98246:49"/>
all <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> and it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bring you to <hi>judge righteouſly,</hi> without <hi>reſpect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>; and this will <hi>reach</hi> to the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of God <hi>in all Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So wait to feel the <hi>higher Power</hi> to rule over the <hi>evil doer</hi> in the <hi>particular,</hi> and to know and feel the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of God <hi>there,</hi> and then ye will come to rule <hi>over all evil doers</hi> in the <hi>higher Power,</hi> even in the Authority of God, and then that of God <hi>in all Conſciences</hi> where ye come to Rule, ſhall anſwer to your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But if ye give way to the <hi>evil doer</hi> in the <hi>particular,</hi> and let him have <hi>the Liberty</hi> there, [mark that] then that will cauſe the <hi>Juſt</hi> to <hi>ſuffer</hi> in the <hi>particular,</hi> and then the ſame will give <hi>way</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>evil doers</hi> without, whereby the <hi>Juſt</hi> without will come to ſuffer alſo.</p>
            <p>Therefore keep to the <hi>Power of the Lord</hi> in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, (you who have felt it) and that will bring ye to do <hi>Juſtice</hi> unto all, without <hi>partiality</hi>; and this will make you <hi>honourable</hi> in the <hi>hearts</hi> of the People, and then ſhall <hi>Righteouſneſs, Truth, Equity, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> proſper over all, and be <hi>exalted</hi>; and all <hi>deceit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>unrighteous wayes</hi> ſhall be confounded.

grew <hi>stiff-necked</hi> againſt the Lord and his People, and ſuffered many of them to be <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> and their <hi>Goods ſpoyled,</hi> and ſome of them to be <hi>Impriſoned</hi> unto <hi>death in their Names</hi>: And thus they <hi>Rebelled</hi> againſt the Lord more and more, and <hi>boaſted</hi> of their <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> and ſo <hi>forgot</hi> how that it was <hi>the Lord</hi> that <hi>raiſed</hi> them up from a <hi>low degree,</hi> and gave them Power over their Enemies: And thus they wrought <hi>grievous provocations</hi> in his ſight, ſo that then the <hi>anger</hi> of the Lord was <hi>kindled</hi> againſt them; and as they <hi>forſook him,</hi> ſo he <hi>forſook them</hi>; and at length he gave them up to the <hi>Counſels of their own Hearts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had <hi>rejected his Counſel:</hi> And then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>ſplit</hi> amongſt themſelves, and to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> one another for <hi>ſelf-ends</hi>; and their <hi>courage</hi> began to <hi>fail,</hi> and <hi>faintneſs</hi> and <hi>deadneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> ſeized upon them; And having plunged themſelves ſo far in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Luſts,</hi> the Cloud of Error grew ſo thick upon them, that they could not ſee <hi>the Cauſe</hi> that they once were ſo <hi>zealous</hi> for: And when <hi>Confuſion</hi> fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they groped like <hi>blind men,</hi> and knew not at what they ſtumbled; neither knew <hi>they</hi> for <hi>whom,</hi> nor for <hi>what</hi> to <hi>ſtand</hi>; but ſometimes <hi>cryed up,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> for <hi>one Thing,</hi> and ſhortly after <hi>cryed againſt it,</hi> and threw it <hi>down</hi> again; and ſome of them <hi>cryed</hi> for one <hi>thing,</hi> and others brought forth <hi>another thing</hi>; and ſo like <hi>Babel's</hi> builders (whom God determined to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) they <hi>acted</hi>; and their <hi>Eye</hi> being blinded, they wrought their own <hi>Destruction</hi>; and few of them <hi>ſaw it</hi> until <hi>it</hi> was come upon them; and them that did, were as men <hi>amazed,</hi> and knew not how to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

               <p>NOw <hi>obſerve <hi>the hand of the Lord</hi> in thy coming ſo far into Power again,</hi> and thoſe who took <hi>part</hi> with thy <hi>Father</hi> &amp; <hi>Thee.</hi> Firſt, conſider <hi>the cauſe of it</hi> (in the fear of the Lord) and thou wilt find that it is becauſe <hi>they</hi> unto whom God gave <hi>ſuch Power</hi> over you, were not <hi>faithful</hi> unto God, as hath been ſaid before, but <hi>grieved the Spirit of the Lord</hi> with their <hi>hypocriſie</hi> from <hi>day to day,</hi> talking <hi>for Liberty,</hi> but behold they brought forth <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and ſo became <hi>worſer</hi> than you that went before them, who did not <hi>Profeſs</hi> ſo much for <hi>Liberty</hi> in words: And this I know, that if <hi>they</hi> had been <hi>faithful</hi> unto the Lord, <hi>thou</hi> and thoſe called <hi>thy Friends,</hi> could not have come <hi>over them</hi> thus as ye have <hi>done</hi>; Therefore let no man <hi>deceive</hi> thee, by perſwading thee that <hi>theſe things</hi> are thus brought to paſs, becauſe the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was thy own <hi>proper right,</hi> and <hi>becauſe</hi> it was <hi>with-held</hi> from thee contrary to <hi>all right</hi>; or, becauſe that thoſe called <hi>Royalliſts</hi> are much more <hi>righteous</hi> than <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>are</hi> now <hi>fallen under thee</hi>; For I plainly declare unto thee, <hi>that <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> and all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the Earth, are properly the

Lords, and that he may and doth give them unto whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſeth; and whenſoever he pleaſe, he may take them away again, and give them unto others; and when he doth thus, it is not contrary to right:</hi> And this <hi>know,</hi> that it was the <hi>juſt hand of God</hi> in taking away the <hi>Kingdom</hi> from thy <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> and giving <hi>it</hi> unto <hi>others</hi>; and that alſo, it is now the <hi>juſt hand of the Lord</hi> to take it <hi>again</hi> from them, and bring them under <hi>Thee</hi>; though I ſhall not ſay, but that ſome of them went beyond their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> againſt thy <hi>Father,</hi> when they were brought as a rod over you, and <hi>well</hi> will it be for <hi>thee,</hi> if thou <hi>becom'ſt</hi> not guilty of the <hi>ſame tranſgreſſion</hi> now thou art brought over them; and this <hi>conſider,</hi> that thoſe who are call'd <hi>thy Friends,</hi> who were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,</hi> have <hi>humbled</hi> themſelves <hi>but little</hi> under the hand of the Lord, but are ſtill <hi>found</hi> to be in <hi>great tranſgreſſions</hi>; and alſo <hi>conſider</hi> the manner <hi>how</hi> this thing hath been <hi>wrought,</hi> and <hi>carryed on,</hi> concerning the bringing <hi>in</hi> of <hi>thee</hi> again, that ſo there may be no <hi>fleſhly boaſting</hi>; for the thing is plainly diſcerned by them whoſe eye is ſingle, and I ſhall declare it unto thee: Mark; The <hi>Army</hi> having acted ſo <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> the <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>gain</hi> of the world blinded their eye, and they having ſo far provoked the Lord, untill his <hi>Decree</hi> was ſealed againſt them, and he had determined that they ſhould be broken; after they had <hi>ſplit</hi> among themſelves, and <hi>turned</hi> from one thing to another, and knew not where to reſt, and the Lord ſuffered ſome of them <hi>to riſe up</hi> from among themſelves to <hi>deceive</hi> the reſt, and ſo they through <hi>diſſimulation</hi> (in profeſſing to ſtand for thoſe who had ſo eminently ſtood againſt thy <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi>) got Power to <hi>weaken</hi> and <hi>turn out</hi> thoſe that were really againſt thee, (as <hi>diſturbers</hi> of the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> as they termed it) and ſo by <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little ſtrengthened</hi> thoſe that ſtood for <hi>thee</hi>; and thus
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98246:62"/>
the <hi>deceived blind men</hi> provided a <hi>Rod</hi> for themſelves, and ſo by <hi>little</hi> &amp; <hi>little</hi> wrought themſelves <hi>under it,</hi> and it is <hi>juſt</hi> upon them; <hi>For the rod is for the fools back.</hi> So let this be <hi>conſidered,</hi> that this was not carryed on by the <hi>ſtoutneſs</hi> of thoſe that <hi>ſtood</hi> for thee, nor yet by a viſible <hi>plain down-right dealing,</hi> but rather through the <hi>hidden myſtery of deceit,</hi> which was <hi>ſuffered</hi> to work againſt <hi>thoſe</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> had <hi>determined</hi> ſhould be <hi>broken,</hi> that ſo by the <hi>ſame way</hi> whereby they had <hi>deceived</hi> others, which was by <hi>pretending</hi> to ſtand <hi>for that</hi> which they did not <hi>intend:</hi> I ſay, even <hi>by the ſame way,</hi> they in the <hi>end</hi> ſhould be <hi>deceived</hi> themſelves: So let <hi>none glory</hi> in what is done concerning <hi>this thing,</hi> as if it were done by <hi>their Valour</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> though I can truly ſay, the hand of the Lord hath <hi>permitteed theſe things,</hi> and that for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> before mentioned, and he will be <hi>glorified</hi> in all theſe <hi>Overturnings.</hi>

for the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God</hi>; And ſo, <hi>many</hi> in the Nations are waxed <hi>worſe</hi> and <hi>worſe</hi>; And when the Lord hath <hi>ſmitten ſome,</hi> they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi>; and when he hath raiſed up <hi>others,</hi> and given them <hi>proſperity,</hi> they have then <hi>fed themſelves</hi> without <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>forgot the Lord,</hi> and waxed wanton <hi>againſt him.</hi> Therefore ſeeing people will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the Lord, nor <hi>regard</hi> the Light of his Son in <hi>their Conſciences,</hi> which <hi>checks</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> for <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in ſecret, nor <hi>turn</hi> to the Lord when he <hi>ſmites them,</hi> nor <hi>regard his Truth</hi> when they have <hi>proſperity,</hi> the Lord will <hi>leave ſtriving</hi> with ſuch a People, and bring <hi>ſudden deſtruction</hi> upon <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his choſen as he did juſt</hi> Lot.

               <p>And now O <hi>King,</hi> as thou expects the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Preſence of the Lord</hi> with Thee in thy <hi>Government, Fear</hi>

            <p>Qu. 1.

And where was any of the <hi>true Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> called <hi>Lord-Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Arch-Biſhops?</hi> Or where was there any <hi>King</hi> in their time, called <hi>the Supream Head of the Church next unto Chriſt?</hi> Or where did they propheſie that it ſhould afterwards be ſo among the Saints?

And who was the firſt <hi>Inventer</hi> of <hi>Surplices</hi> and <hi>Tippits</hi> (as they are called) did the <hi>true Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſe any of them in their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>?

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3.

Did the <hi>true Apoſtles</hi> Practiſe theſe things? Or are they not come up in the night of <hi>Apoſtacy?</hi> And why do you <hi>call thoſe</hi> that name the Children, <hi>God-Fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers?</hi> Hath <hi>God</hi> any <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Mothers?</hi> Anſwer to every particular <hi>in plain Engliſh</hi> according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that poor People may ſee <hi>your Ground,</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> for all theſe things; And do you believe that any can be free from ſin in this life, and keep <hi>Gods's holy Will</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi>? If not, then how dare you <hi>enjoyn thoſe that you call God-Fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers,</hi> to Promiſe and Vow theſe things in the Childs name, (mark) <hi>that it ſhall forſake the Devil and all his works,</hi> (mark that) <hi>the pomps and vanities of this World,</hi> and <hi>all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>that it ſhould keep God's holy Will</hi> and <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>

now if you ſay, they may forſake <hi>all theſe things,</hi> and keep <hi>God's Holy Will</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi>; then will it not <hi>overthrow</hi> what you <hi>Teach</hi> your ſelves <hi>at other times?</hi> and if People <hi>do not</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> forſake the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>all his works, the pomps,</hi> and <hi>vanities</hi> of this <hi>wicked World,</hi> and the <hi>ſinful luſts of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>keep God's Holy Will</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi>; then do you not <hi>cauſe them</hi> you call <hi>God-Fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> to <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Vow</hi> lies and <hi>impoſſibilities</hi> in <hi>Childrens Names?</hi>

            <p>Again, it is <hi>God's</hi> proper <hi>Right</hi> to give <hi>Laws</hi> unto <hi>man, Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>For there is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy, Jam.</hi> 4.12.

               <hi>Righteous</hi> have been <hi>Puniſhed</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſed.</hi> Now in this particular, <hi>man</hi> hath exceedingly corrupted his wayes; for which cauſe <hi>God's Controverſie</hi> is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great; And until <hi>man ſubmit</hi> to the <hi>one Law-giver</hi> in this particular alſo, <hi>(who is able, both to ſave and to deſtroy) God's Controverſie</hi> cannot <hi>ceaſe</hi>; for the <hi>Law</hi> which God gives, is not againſt the <hi>Righteous,</hi> but againſt the <hi>unrighteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how are the <hi>Laws</hi> of theſe <hi>Nations</hi> like to be ſuch, (let the <hi>witneſs of God</hi> in all you anſwer) ſeeing by <hi>man</hi> it is given into the hands of <hi>man</hi> in ſuch a manner as it is to make <hi>Laws</hi>? (Mark) Have you not read in the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> that the <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Chriſt is a little Flock, Luke</hi> 12.32. And that, <hi>though Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaved, Iſa.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27.

Now mark and conſider theſe things, ſeeing that the <hi>Righteous</hi> are fewer in number then the <hi>unrighteous,</hi> and that the <hi>Law-makers</hi> are choſen by the <hi>moſt voyces</hi>; (and that of the richeſt People outwardly) how are the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> like to be preſerved in outward freedom by the <hi>Laws</hi> that are ſo made? <hi>Doth not the World love his own, John</hi> 15.19. And will it not provide for its own Life and Liberty? And is the life and Liberty of the <hi>Righteous</hi> one with the world, (<hi>Read Wiſdom,</hi> the 2. Chap.) Will not that which is for the freedom of the one, be for the bondage of the other? Oh! the Lord hath beheld this abomination, and his Soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors it, and his <hi>Controverſie</hi> is with the <hi>Nations,</hi> becauſe of the grievous <hi>Oppreſſion, Oaths,</hi> &amp; <hi>Violence,</hi> which fills the Earth partly by this means; Oh! how do the rich

And though ſeveral overturnings have been, yet is iniquity ſtill at a great height, and increaſeth exceedingly; And what will it advantage a Child to flee from a Bear and joyn to a Lyon? Verily the day is come, wherein there is no hiding place of ſafety for the <hi>Righteous,</hi> but purely in the Name of the Lord, and bleſſed are they that alone truſt therein. For the help of the meek ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Name of the Lord, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.8. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9.) And happy are they that abide in it, <hi>for the day will be terrible and dreadful unto all that have not a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Name of the Lord the King of Saints</hi>; For <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> ſhall come to the full, and then ſhall the Lord Roar out of his Habitation, and he ſhall ſtrike the Inhabitants of the Earth with <hi>Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Faintneſs,</hi> and <hi>Deadneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſhall ſeize upon the mighty men, and weakneſs and fear upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Be wiſe therefore O <hi>ye <hi>Kings</hi>,</hi> and learn Wiſdom ye <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Earth, Return unto the Lord and ſerve him with fear, Tremble before the Glory of his Preſence, <hi>and Kiſſe the Son, leſt he be angry and you periſh by the way</hi>; For his wroth ſhall ſuddenly burn, &amp; then, <hi>bleſſed are all they that truſt in Him,</hi> (Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.) Therefore ſtrive not with the Lord any longer, by withholding his <hi>Right</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi> but give unto him his due, and reſign up to him and <hi>his anointed</hi> the things that he doth require, <hi>for the Lamb muſt get

And he will conſtrain People with his love (which is better than outward force) to give his Miniſters <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment</hi> when they have need thereof, and they will be <hi>contented</hi> there-withal, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. Therefore med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with <hi>theſe things</hi> any more, I warn and exhort you in the Love of God: For it belongs not unto you, but unto <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who are one, and let Chriſt only be acknowledged to be the <hi>defender of the Faith,</hi> who is able to perform that Office to the full, <hi>which man is not.</hi>

            <p>And let the one <hi>Law-giver</hi> be minded and <hi>owned in man,</hi> to give forth <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>puniſh Tranſgreſſors,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Judgement</hi> may be the <hi>Lord's</hi> and not <hi>man's,</hi> for ſo it ought to be; and he that <hi>Ruleth</hi> over <hi>men,</hi> muſt be <hi>Juſt, ruling in the Fear of God,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3.)

How have ſome of you cryed out and ſaid, <hi>you had rather ceaſe to live, than not ceaſe to Sin?</hi> Oh <hi>Friends</hi>! This was a good beginning, and ſome of you came further than others in the way that was <hi>good</hi>; yea ſurely a good ſweet Preſence of <hi>God</hi> was among many of you in the day when you were low and tender, and ſeveral of you were ſenſible of his <hi>love</hi> in that day, while ſincerity and ſimplicity abode in your hearts. Oh! How did the <hi>Lord</hi> hear your cryes in that day, when many of you cryed unto him for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? Oh! How did he overturn your <hi>Enemies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you which oppreſſed your <hi>conſciences?</hi> And how did he give you outward reſt, and peace, and Liberty to worſhip him, according as he had made himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto you.</p>
            <p>But Oh <hi>Friends</hi>! there hath been a ſad day of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> among many of you, and many of your <hi>Teachers</hi> have cauſed you to err; for as they went from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and <hi>Tender Life</hi> in <hi>themſelves,</hi> that once had ſtirred in ſome of them againſt the worſhip of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> they then ran into many words, out of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> that had ſtirred in <hi>them,</hi> and ſo loſt the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and true zeal they once had for <hi>God.</hi> And then they alſo drew you from that <hi>Tender Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> that had viſited you, into many words of other <hi>men's</hi> Conditions, and ſo the true ſimplicity that had been in you ſoon decayed. And as you were drawn from the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in your ſelves, the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98246:89"/>
ſubtilty within and without drew your minds after the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> and as you reached forth to that, and <hi>received</hi> and <hi>fed</hi> of that, you <hi>dyed</hi> as to God, and became <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> alive unto <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>grew rich</hi> in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and that puffed many of you <hi>up,</hi> and ſo <hi>poorneſs in Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>hungerings</hi> and <hi>thirſtings</hi> after the <hi>Life of God,</hi> which ſometimes in you had <hi>been felt,</hi> you <hi>lost.</hi> And ſuch of you were oft ſent <hi>empty away</hi> from your <hi>Worſhips</hi>; mark, empty of the <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> which the Lord fills ſuch with, as are <hi>poor</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> in <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> after his <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> But others among you, I know, went oft from your <hi>Worſhip</hi> full, though it were but of the <hi>declaration</hi> of others <hi>conditions,</hi> and their <hi>own conceivings,</hi> and a <hi>falſe joy.</hi> And ſeveral of you who had ſeen the Lords <hi>mighty hand,</hi> and had been <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of <hi>his Power,</hi> both <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> when you got into outward <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> you ſoon forgot <hi>his goodneſs</hi>; and ſome of you growing <hi>great in the Earth,</hi> were lifted up in <hi>your minds,</hi> you then <hi>turned back,</hi> and <hi>licked up</hi> that which you had formerly <hi>vomited out,</hi> and then <hi>hardneſs</hi> and <hi>dryneſs</hi> came upon many of you; and then that which the Lord had <hi>wounded</hi> in many of you, (to wit, the luſtful <hi>nature</hi> which ſhould have been <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi> by the <hi>immortal Power</hi>) revived and became heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again: And then a falſe <hi>liberty</hi> you run into, and ſo into <hi>exceſs,</hi> and then ſeveral of you become <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> and <hi>Deſpiſers,</hi> even of ſuch as the Lord by his <hi>mighty Power</hi> had <hi>gathered</hi> from your <hi>dead Forms</hi> and <hi>Wayes:</hi> And many of you provoked the Lord unto <hi>anger</hi> ſeveral wayes, for which cauſe he hath now ſent <hi>a rod</hi> to ſcourge the <hi>back-ſliders</hi>; and them that were more <hi>faithful,</hi> muſt alſo be proved by the ſame. Oh friends! much might truly be ſaid unto many of you, concerning your <hi>great Apoſtacy,</hi> and your bringing of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98246:89"/>
this <hi>Day of Tryal,</hi> or cauſing it to be brought upon you: But although I may <hi>hint</hi> ſomething unto you <hi>concerning</hi> thoſe <hi>things,</hi> yet that is not <hi>the thing</hi> which is <hi>chiefly</hi> upon me at <hi>this time:</hi> But this is that which lay much <hi>upon me</hi>; to wit, to bring to your <hi>remembrance</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>former loving kindneſs</hi> of the Lord <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> and to <hi>exhort</hi> you who have <hi>back-ſlided,</hi> to <hi>return</hi> to the <hi>firſt love</hi> that was <hi>begotten in you</hi> towards the Lord, and to keep to that <hi>Principle of Life,</hi> which did begin a <hi>good work</hi> in you, &amp; to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> you to go on in the <hi>work of the Lord.</hi> For as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>your Apoſtacy,</hi> I hope many of you are <hi>convinced</hi> of that in a <hi>great meaſure,</hi> by the <hi>witneſs of God</hi> in your <hi>own Conſciences</hi>; and it is not my <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>upbraid</hi> you with that, which I hope in ſome <hi>meaſure</hi> is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>loathſom</hi> unto your <hi>ſelves</hi>; neither would I add to your <hi>ſufferings</hi> (in whom there is now a true <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> towards the Lord) in this the <hi>Day of Tryal</hi>; for I <hi>believe</hi> many of you <hi>have,</hi> or will <hi>have,</hi> as much of them as you can <hi>well bear</hi>; but my <hi>tender deſire</hi> is, that you may be brought to <hi>feel</hi> ſo much of the <hi>Power of God</hi> in your ſelves as may <hi>ſupport</hi> you, (and keep you in <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>) in all your <hi>Tryals,</hi> until ſuch <hi>time</hi> as the Lord ſhall <hi>make</hi> you fit for <hi>deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I do <hi>believe,</hi> that ſome of you have <hi>retained</hi> a greater <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> in your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and have not ſo <hi>deeply Apoſtatized</hi> from that which God made known unto you of <hi>himſelf,</hi> as others have <hi>done</hi>; and ſome of you I know have long been <hi>burdened</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> that others among you have <hi>fallen into.</hi> And I know ſeveral of you alſo, have long gone under a <hi>burden,</hi> even concerning your own <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, barrenneſs,</hi> and <hi>unprofitableneſs,</hi> you being made ſenſible thereof by the <hi>VVitneſs of God</hi> in your <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi> And when ye have heard others <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98246:90"/>
               <hi>telling</hi> forth their <hi>experiences,</hi> as they called them, (which was much of it the <hi>Saints experiences</hi> of old, which theſe had not attained unto, any otherwiſe but by gathering <hi>their words</hi> out of the <hi>Letter,</hi> or from <hi>man</hi>) then hath <hi>ſorrow, doubtings,</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> filled your <hi>hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as there are ſeveral <hi>conditions</hi> among you, ſo alſo here are ſeveral things ſpoken unto each <hi>condition</hi>; therefore you muſt mind the <hi>VVitneſs of God</hi> in your ſelves, which makes <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto you your ſeveral <hi>conditions,</hi> and that will let you ſee what of <hi>theſe things</hi> that are here <hi>written,</hi> properly belongeth to each of you, which is my <hi>deſire</hi> that you may <hi>receive</hi>; for my <hi>tender love</hi> in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is unto all your <hi>ſouls,</hi> who truly <hi>breath</hi> after the Lord, <hi>deſiring</hi> your <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good</hi>; and that you may be brought into the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>that Life,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Preſence,</hi> which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can give <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> unto your <hi>immortal Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as you tender the <hi>good</hi> of your own <hi>ſouls,</hi> &amp; <hi>eternal Peace, Ceaſe hunting abroad</hi> (in your imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>and leave off wandring from Mountain to Hill, and from Hill to Mountain,</hi> (where ſeveral of you have even wearied your ſelves for very vanity, &amp; have not found a reſting place) <hi>and return Home.</hi> Retire your minds <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> unto that which oft <hi>ſpringeth</hi> in you, giving you the ſenſible <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of your particular conditions, and putting you in <hi>remembrance</hi> of the <hi>dealings</hi> of God with you <hi>in times paſt</hi>; for that which thus <hi>ſpringeth</hi> in you, is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> which is given you to <hi>profit withal.</hi> Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> turn not from this <hi>Gift in your ſelves,</hi> as you have done; for by your turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this <hi>pure Life,</hi> when it hath viſited you (by its oft putting you in <hi>remembrance</hi> wherein you went <hi>wrong</hi>) you have come to looſe the <hi>ſenſibleneſs</hi> of your <hi>condition,</hi> and the enemy of your <hi>Souls</hi> thereby hath gotten great advantage againſt you, and then you have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98246:90"/>
been <hi>drawn</hi> and <hi>led</hi> by him into that which could not <hi>profit</hi> you: Therefore all mind that <hi>Gift of God in your ſelves,</hi> which maketh you <hi>ſenſible</hi> of your <hi>preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and which oft begetteth <hi>true deſires</hi> in you, to do the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and which hath brought ſome of you into <hi>lowlineſs of mind,</hi> and to walk <hi>humbly</hi> with the Lord, in his <hi>pure Fear,</hi> for ſome time. For if ever you come to <hi>witneſs</hi> the true <hi>deſires</hi> of your <hi>ſouls ſatisfied,</hi> and you eſtabliſhed in <hi>true Peace,</hi> you muſt receive the <hi>living Principle of God in your own particular Veſſels</hi>; which <hi>Principle,</hi> I call <hi>the Light,</hi> it being a proper <hi>name</hi> for it; becauſe it maketh <hi>manifeſt</hi> all things that are juſtly <hi>reproved,</hi> and whatſoever doth make manifeſt, the ſame is <hi>Light.</hi> But I ſhall not deſire to tye up any of you to give this <hi>Principle of Truth</hi> only the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Light</hi>; for if you come to believe in <hi>it,</hi> and receive <hi>it</hi> in the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> and walk in <hi>obedience</hi> to its <hi>drawings, leadings,</hi> and <hi>requirings,</hi> I ſhall not matter if you call it <hi>the Truth,</hi> or <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> or <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit of God,</hi> or <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> or <hi>the ingrafted Word,</hi> or <hi>the manifeſtation of God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Eternal Being,</hi> or <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> or <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or any other <hi>name</hi> which may truly be given unto <hi>it.</hi> But this is that which I <hi>deſire,</hi> That you all may receive the <hi>thing</hi> it <hi>ſelf,</hi> which hath ſo oft made <hi>manifeſt</hi> your <hi>conditions</hi> unto you, and ſometimes brought you into <hi>brokenneſs of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, <hi>When we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made manifeſt unto us, and when we have been brought into brokenneſs of ſpirit, and have had tender de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires begotten in us towards God, to do his VVill, it hath oft been, either when we have been reading the Scriptures, or hearing them Preached, or read by others; and therefore we believe the Scriptures have done theſe things to us, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any thing within us.</hi>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98246:91"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Friends, I ſhall not deny but that your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> have been made <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto you, and that you have been brought into <hi>brokenneſs of Spirit,</hi> and have had true <hi>deſires</hi> begotten in you, to do the <hi>Will of God,</hi> ſometimes when you have <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>heard</hi> the <hi>Scriptures read,</hi> or <hi>Preached</hi> unto you: But this I ſay unto you, It was not the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that did theſe things, but it was the <hi>Gift of God</hi> in your own <hi>hearts</hi> at that <hi>time</hi>; as I ſhall <hi>plainly declare</hi> unto you. (Mark) Thus it was; when you have <hi>read,</hi> or heard others <hi>read</hi> or <hi>ſpeak</hi> ſuch words of the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> as were ſuitable to that <hi>condition</hi> you were then in, or which did <hi>declare</hi> againſt ſuch things as you were <hi>guilty</hi> of, (mark) then hath the <hi>Witneſs of God</hi> aroſe in you (ſometimes) and plainly ſpoke to your <hi>underſtanding part,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced you that you were <hi>guilty</hi> of ſuch things as were <hi>ſpoken againſt,</hi> in ſuch a Scripture as you <hi>read</hi> or <hi>heard</hi>; yea, it was the meaſure of God's Truth <hi>in your own Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> that hath ſo made <hi>manifeſt</hi> your <hi>particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> unto you, and hath perſwaded and overpowered you, and made you <hi>believe,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>confeſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</hi> that thou wert <hi>the man,</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> or <hi>child,</hi> that was <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>that,</hi> or hadſt need of <hi>that</hi> which thou then didſt <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear,</hi> that the Scripture declared <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi> or <hi>of.</hi> And when the <hi>Power of God</hi> hath thus wrought in you at that <hi>time,</hi> when you have <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>read</hi> the Scriptures, you have ſometimes indeed been brought into <hi>brokenneſs of Spirit,</hi> and <hi>render deſires</hi> have been begotten in you towards the Lord: And the Lord hath alſo appeared unto ſome of you, ſometimes in the <hi>Night ſeaſon,</hi> or as you have been about your labour, or otherwiſe; and ſome of you have felt his <hi>pure Power</hi> working in you, whereby your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſome meaſure have been <hi>opened,</hi> and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions plainly made <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto you, and much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98246:91"/>
hath been begotten in you, even when you have neither <hi>heard</hi> nor <hi>read</hi> any thing outwardly, but the pure operation of the Spirit and Power of Truth in ſome of you hath done theſe things, and wrought your minds into lowlineſs, meekneſs, and quietneſs. And then hath the pure love of God been felt (in ſome meaſure) whereby your ſouls have been refreſhed.</p>
            <p>So Friends, the <hi>Holy One</hi> is neither by you to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited <hi>to the Scriptures,</hi> nor yet <hi>from the Scriptures,</hi> in any wiſe, as to his appearance to his Creatures; but you are to learn to wait in the meaſure of his Grace, which hath appeared unto you, and you are to watch in the <hi>Light</hi> for his further appearance unto you: And as you come to wait upon the Lord in his <hi>pure Fear</hi> and <hi>Dread,</hi> you will feel your minds wrought into ſtilneſs, and ſo you will come to hear the pure Voice of God and Chriſt (who are one) and become acquainted therewithal; and his love you will feel ariſing in you, whereby you will be conſtrained to obey it, when or where-ever you come to hear it; and then you will ſee the Lord is not to be limited, either to time, or place, or means outward; but you will ſee that he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to his Creatures, even when, and where, and howſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>Friends,</hi> As concerning theſe things which the Lord hath ſuffered to come to paſs of late, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding righteous and juſt with him to ſuffer thoſe things to be effected; for truly (as you know) he was much provoked thereunto, and his patience towards many of you was very great; yea, he ſpared you long, and yet many of you (whom I now hope are brought to ſee your brck-ſlidings) regarded not his goodneſs, but walked very careleſly, and ſome of you wantonly before him; yea, many of your minds ran into the earth, and its pomps and vanities again (after a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98246:92"/>
had been begotten in you towards the <hi>Lord,</hi> and a loathing of ſuch things) and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> encreaſed among you, and ſo <hi>luſts,</hi> and <hi>fulneſs,</hi> and eaſe was then delighted in, <hi>and the honour of this World ſought,</hi> and received one of another (<hi>and not that which cometh of God onely</hi>) and thoſe that could not give you that honour that periſheth, ſuch by ſome of you were hated and mocked at, <hi>and yet you profeſſed much of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in words.</hi> But alas! the hearts of many of you were removed far from the <hi>Life of Truth,</hi> in which the <hi>Lord is worſhipped,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> which once appeared in ſome of you for <hi>God,</hi> and the love which had ſprung in you to him, and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in the day when you were low and tender) grew cold and died in you, <hi>as you departed from the meaſure of the Life of God. And thus the Lord became grieved, and preſſed with your back-ſlidings,</hi> and his Soul loathed your <hi>Sacrifices</hi>; and he then ſaw that a day of <hi>Tryal</hi> would be better for you than a day of <hi>Proſperity. So in Righteouſneſs as from the Lord,</hi> is this day brought upon you, and alſo in <hi>love</hi> to your <hi>Souls,</hi> and ſo it ſhall prove unto you, <hi>if ye will now turn unto the Lord with all your hearts, and humble your ſelves under his Mighty Hand.</hi> Yea ſome of you who lately have had the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of great <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and outward <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Companions,</hi> and have now loſt them, or part of them, I do believe that you will be made to confeſſe (<hi>to the Glory of God</hi>) that it is his love to you in ſuffering them to be taken from you; yea ſome of you will come to ſee that the <hi>Lord is juſt and merciful unto you</hi> in ſuffering your <hi>Idols</hi> to be ſtript off, &amp; taken away. For you will ſee how ſome of you have Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized <hi>men,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and its honour and glory, and Forms without the <hi>Power</hi> of an endleſs <hi>Life.</hi> Oh <hi>Friends</hi>! I have a ſecret hope for a Remnant of you,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98246:92"/>
               <hi>that the Lord by this kind of dealing with you, will bring you near unto himſelf,</hi> and that a day ſhall come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall be made to ſay, that <hi>It was good for us that we were Afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Friends,</hi> you that come this to <hi>witneſs,</hi> you muſt mind the free <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that bringeth <hi>Salvation,</hi> which to all <hi>men</hi> hath appeared; yea, ye muſt own and receive it in its pure <hi>Teachings,</hi> and wait in the <hi>Virtue</hi> of it, to receive <hi>Power</hi> to deny and forſake the <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Worldly luſts,</hi> (which it will make <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt</hi> unto you) that you have been addicted unto; and muſt wait to feel it drawing you into <hi>Godlineſs, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Soberneſs,</hi> and into <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs</hi> with the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is a precious thing. Truly they they that do not wait to come into, and to be kept in <hi>Patience</hi> in this day of <hi>Tryal,</hi> their <hi>ſufferings</hi> will be great. And if the fretting impatient, murmuring <hi>Nature</hi> be given way and leaned unto, that will aggravate the <hi>Sufferings</hi> exceedingly, and beget <hi>Torment</hi> in the mind.</p>
            <p>Therefore you who deſire to come into, and to be kept in <hi>true Obedience</hi> unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> in this the day of <hi>Tryal,</hi> be watchful in the <hi>Light,</hi> and abide in the <hi>pure Fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which is the beginning of <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; and take heed of the ſubtilry of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> who will ſeek more and more to beguile you, and to lead you aſide from the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Verily <hi>Friends,</hi> if you do not retire your minds inwards, unto the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (which is the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>men</hi>) you will be deceived, yea if you do not receive the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to be your <hi>guide,</hi> and <hi>Leader,</hi> and obey the ſame, you will ſtill run into thoſe things which cannot profit you, and the renewed deſires in you towards the <hi>Lord</hi> will be ſtrangled.</p>
            <p>Now I know ſome of you have formerly found the Lord's <hi>Leadings</hi> and <hi>Teachings,</hi> in ſome <hi>meaſure,</hi> in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98246:93"/>
the day when he drew you out of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (ſo called) and raiſed up a zeal in you againſt the <hi>Lording ſpirits</hi> in the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and againſt the dark way of their imaginary <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and if you had kept low in the <hi>pure Fear</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> I know he would have further appeared unto you. But here was the loſs of many of thoſe that the <hi>Lord,</hi> had appeared unto, <hi>(Mark)</hi> they did not abide in his <hi>Tender Fear,</hi> neither did they continue waiting upon him (for <hi>Teaching</hi>) in the <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> in which he had appeared unto them; but many of them going from his <hi>Witneſs</hi> in <hi>themſelves,</hi> they ſoon began to imagin another Form of <hi>Worſhip</hi> which is called <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery,</hi> and many ſate down and ſetled in that, and did not mind the <hi>Leadings</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> which had appeared, and in ſome <hi>meaſure</hi> quickened them; and ſo much <hi>Deadneſs</hi> and <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> came upon ſuch as would not be ſubject to the drawings of the pure <hi>Life</hi> of God. But thoſe that kept their <hi>integrity</hi> in any <hi>meaſure,</hi> and waited upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> the pure <hi>Life</hi> opened things further unto them, as they were able to bear; and they were drawn a little further, and a fine <hi>Freſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> appeared in them for a time: But ſo ſoon as they had ſettled themſelves in another Form, which is called <hi>Independency,</hi> then many of them not willing to follow the <hi>Leadings</hi> of the <hi>Life,</hi> any further then the Articles which they had drawn up, and agreed upon, would admit of, whereby the <hi>freſhneſs</hi> that had appeared in ſome of them, began to wither. Yet ſome who ſtill deſired to go on, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Leadings</hi> of the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> opened things further unto them, and they left the other; but they not continuing in the true waiting upon the <hi>Lord</hi> to be led by him, ſeveral of them alſo ran into another Form, called <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> wherein many began to ſettle.

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes of God,</hi> there hath been much <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>talk</hi> of thoſe things <hi>amongſt you</hi>: But now the day is <hi>appearing</hi> which will try all <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> and every one's <hi>work</hi> muſt come to <hi>Tryal.</hi> Therefore conſider your <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Ground, Author,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of it: For there is a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> and a <hi>living Faith,</hi> and a <hi>ground</hi> for both; Now the <hi>living Faith</hi> hath Jeſus for its <hi>Author,</hi> and the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God</hi> for its <hi>Ground</hi>; and its <hi>effects</hi> declare it to be the <hi>living Faith,</hi> for it <hi>works</hi> in them that have it by <hi>love,</hi> unto the <hi>purifying</hi> of their <hi>hearts,</hi> and it is their <hi>victory</hi> over the <hi>world.</hi> Theſe were the effects of the <hi>living Faith</hi> in the Saints of old, and it hath the ſame <hi>now,</hi> as they can <hi>witneſs</hi> who have <hi>received it.</hi> Now there is a <hi>Faith</hi> which ſtands but in <hi>Words,</hi> not in the <hi>Power,</hi> and this is a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> it cannot <hi>work,</hi> it <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> not the <hi>heart,</hi> it gives not <hi>victory</hi> over the <hi>world,</hi> nor <hi>acceſs to God,</hi> as the <hi>living Faith</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Friends! Labour</hi> not to <hi>content</hi> your ſelves with a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> but wait that you may hear the <hi>leaving Word</hi> by which the <hi>living Faith</hi> comes. Now a man may <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> of the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> as the Scriptures <hi>do,</hi> and many may <hi>believe</hi> the words to be <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>profeſs</hi> the ſame; and yet if they receive not the <hi>living Word,</hi> or <hi>VVitneſs</hi> in their own <hi>hearts,</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> will prove but a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> and they will have but words for its ground; but they that hear the <hi>VVords of Truth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, or read them, and then feel the <hi>living VVord</hi> ariſing <hi>in themſelves,</hi> witneſſing to the words that they have read or heard, that they are <hi>true,</hi> over-powering
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98246:95"/>
them to <hi>believe</hi> the ſame; or if the <hi>VVord of Life</hi> ſpeaketh to any ones <hi>underſtanding,</hi> when words out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are not <hi>ſpoken,</hi> and they be over-powered by the <hi>Word</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> the ſame, ſuch come indeed to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>know</hi> how the <hi>living Faith</hi> cometh, and is wrought.</p>
            <p>And they come alſo to ſee that <hi>this Faith</hi> ſtands in the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and not in <hi>words,</hi> and that Jeſus (who <hi>ſaveth</hi> from ſin) is the <hi>Author</hi> of it. And all that come into this <hi>ſtate,</hi> if they wilfully turn not from the <hi>Power,</hi> they will feel their <hi>Faith</hi> increaſed in and by the <hi>Power,</hi> and the effects of it will daily come to be <hi>manifeſt,</hi> which will be an <hi>evidence</hi> unto them to prove that it is the <hi>living Faith,</hi> for they will feel it giving them <hi>acceſs to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh ye <hi>Profeſſors!</hi> I ſpeak what I <hi>know</hi> and <hi>witneſs,</hi> and without <hi>this Faith</hi> you cannot <hi>pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And concerning the <hi>Promiſes of God,</hi> this know:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Promiſes</hi> are unto the <hi>Seed, Not unto Seeds as of many, but unto the Seed, which is One, which is Chriſt.</hi> So all that come to have right unto the <hi>Promiſes of God,</hi> they muſt come to be of the <hi>Seed</hi> unto which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> are. Now it is the <hi>Word of Life</hi> which begetteth unto God, and brings to be of the <hi>Seed</hi> which is the <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Promiſes of God.</hi> Therefore wait in the <hi>appearance</hi> of the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> that by it you may be <hi>begotten</hi> into the nature of the <hi>incorruptible Seed,</hi> and become born of it, that ſo you may be made <hi>meet</hi> to be partakers of the precious <hi>Promiſes.</hi> Oh that ye would hearken <hi>diligently</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> and your <hi>Souls</hi> ſhould <hi>live.</hi> The Lord's hand of <hi>tender love</hi> and <hi>pitty</hi> is ſtretched forth towards you. Oh! be not rebellious any longer, leſt he ceaſe ſtriving with you. Truly many of you have <hi>mightily provoked</hi> the Lord unto <hi>anger,</hi> and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>Spirit</hi> in this <hi>particular, (Mark</hi>) in your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as you have termed it; for many of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98246:95"/>
you have ſtollen the words which declare of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> which are to the <hi>Seed of Life,</hi> and you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them unto the wrong <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Birth</hi>; yea, you have gathered the <hi>good words</hi> (out of the Scriptures) that were written unto them who were <hi>born again</hi> of the <hi>incorruptible Seed,</hi> and you have applyed them unto your ſelves, in the <hi>corruptible unregenerate ſtate</hi>; and when you have done thus, the <hi>Witneſs of God</hi> in your <hi>own Conſciences</hi> hath oft aroſe and <hi>condemned you,</hi> and broke the <hi>falſe peace</hi> &amp; <hi>joy</hi> which you had created to your ſelves, by ſtealing the <hi>Saints conditions</hi> and <hi>experiences,</hi> and applying them to your ſelves, calling them yours, and ſaying, it was ſo with you, when it was not; yea, many of you have ſaid, <hi>your ſins were waſhed away in the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and that you were <hi>freely juſtified</hi> in the ſight of God <hi>by his Grace,</hi> and your <hi>Teachers</hi> alſo have told you it was ſo; yea, they have <hi>Preached peace</hi> unto you (becauſe you put into their <hi>mouths</hi>) even while you lived in your ſins: But the <hi>pure Grace of God</hi> hath appeared in your hearts and <hi>condemned you.</hi> And when you have been thus judged by the <hi>Witneſs of God,</hi> your <hi>falſe peace</hi> hath been <hi>broken,</hi> and then ſome of you have run to your Teachers (who had cryed <hi>peace</hi> unto you, and daubed you up with <hi>untempered Morter</hi>) and told them your <hi>conditions,</hi> how you were <hi>condemned</hi> in your ſelves, and how you had loſt the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> that you formerly had, and how judgement was felt in the <hi>room</hi> of it. Then ſome of your <hi>blind Guides</hi> have told you, that that was the Devil that <hi>condemned you,</hi> and brake your <hi>Peace,</hi> (and thus they have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Wo, <hi>Putting Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs</hi>) and then they have told you, you muſt apply the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and act <hi>Faith</hi> (as they call it) upon the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the Scriptures, and keep unto them. And thus they have ſought to <hi>daub</hi> you up again,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98246:96"/>
and to draw you from the <hi>pure Spirit of Judgement</hi>; and ſome of you who have received their <hi>words,</hi> have then ſtrove againſt the <hi>pure Witneſs</hi> (which condemned you) and counted it the <hi>Tempter,</hi> and have laboured in your <hi>wills</hi> to get from under its <hi>pure Judgement,</hi> and to force your ſelves into a <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>perſwaſion</hi> again, that thoſe things, to wit, the <hi>Promiſes</hi> belonged unto you. And thus have you fought againſt the <hi>Witneſs of God,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied its <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>ſtrangled</hi> it, and ſo got into a <hi>falſe peace</hi> again; but others of you have been kept more <hi>ſenſible</hi> of its <hi>judgement,</hi> and have not dared to deny it, becauſe you have ſeen that ye were not fit for the <hi>Promiſes</hi>; for you have ſeen with the <hi>Light,</hi> that you were out of the <hi>condition</hi> which is required of ſuch as come to be partakers of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi> Now it hath been a great ſaying among many of you, <hi>That you muſt act Faith upon a bare Promiſe in the Scriptures,</hi> as your <hi>Teachers</hi> have taught you; and they have told you, That <hi>Abraham believed God upon a bare Promiſe,</hi> and ſo muſt you. Oh conſider this well! The Word of the Lord came unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying unto him, <hi>Fear not</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> And again the Lord ſpake unto him, ſaying, <hi>I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great, and thou ſhalt be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>; and <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God in theſe <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and others, and he obeyed him: So <hi>Abraham's Faith</hi> was reckoned unto him for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and he was called the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> becauſe he <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>obeyed him.</hi> Now if you were come to hear the Lord ſpeak unto you as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, then you ought to believe whatever the Lord promiſed unto you, that he would <hi>perform</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi>; But if you only get theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> or others, out of the Scriptures, and then <hi>apply them</hi> unto your ſelves, and ſay you <hi>believe</hi> it is, or ſhall be ſo with you, as it is expreſſed in <hi>thoſe Promiſes,</hi> and yet
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98246:96"/>
you never heard the Lord ſay any ſuch thing unto you, (Mark) you do but <hi>deceive</hi> your ſelves; for ſuch a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> (or acting of Faith upon the <hi>Promiſes</hi> as you call it) will never be accounted unto you for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>; Neither will you come to find ſuch <hi>Promiſes</hi> ſo gotten fulfilled unto you by the Lord. And you are alſo to <hi>conſider this,</hi> That many of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were given forth upon <hi>Conditions,</hi> and except you come to <hi>witneſs</hi> the <hi>conditions</hi> fulfilled in you by <hi>the Power,</hi> you are not like to <hi>witneſs</hi> ſuch <hi>Promiſes</hi> made good unto you. And alſo there are ſome <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpoken of in the Scriptures, which naturally belong to the <hi>Immortal Seed,</hi> that were by the Lord given forth unto it, without expreſſing any <hi>conditions,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Seed</hi> is free, and doth the <hi>Will of God naturally</hi>: Now all that come to have right to ſuch <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and to <hi>witneſs</hi> them fulfilled unto them by the Lord, they firſt muſt be <hi>converted</hi> into the nature of the <hi>Seed,</hi> by the working of the <hi>Immortal Word</hi> in them. Therefore you that have <hi>true deſires</hi> after the Lord, wait to feel the work of the <hi>Word of Life</hi> in your own hearts, that ſo by it you may be made meet (as I ſaid before) to be partakers of <hi>the Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily <hi>Friends</hi>! Many of you have much to <hi>paſs through,</hi> before you can come to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>witneſs</hi> the Lord miniſtring his precious <hi>Promiſes of Life</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> freely unto you. Oh! He waiteth to be <hi>gracious</hi> unto you; yea, he hath long <hi>waited.</hi> Oh! That you would now turn unto him in the drawings of his <hi>Power and Life,</hi> and ceaſe <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>running,</hi> and <hi>ſtriving</hi> in your own <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>wayes,</hi> and wait to be guided and led by <hi>his Spirit,</hi> into thoſe things which he requireth at <hi>your hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> It is the <hi>inſide,</hi> it is the <hi>inſide</hi> that muſt be <hi>cleanſed</hi>; for whilſt that is <hi>polluted</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98246:97"/>
Lord regardeth not the <hi>Worſhip</hi>: It is he that <hi>ſearcheth the heart,</hi> and tryeth the <hi>inward parts</hi>; you cannot <hi>hide</hi> any thing from him; For he beholdeth all your <hi>goings,</hi> and <hi>actings,</hi> and <hi>thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I know many of you will oft make <hi>large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> of your ſins; but <hi>Friends,</hi> there is a further thing to be <hi>minded,</hi> (Mark) you muſt alſo come to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them,</hi> or elſe you cannot find the <hi>mercy.</hi> Therefore hearken <hi>diligently</hi> unto the <hi>call</hi> of the Lord, and believe and wait in that which makes <hi>manifeſt</hi> ſin, and calleth you out of the <hi>ſame,</hi> for this is <hi>holy,</hi> and conſenteth not unto <hi>ſin,</hi> it hath no <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with <hi>darkneſs,</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> with the <hi>Devil.</hi> Now this is the <hi>living Truth</hi>; by this you may know it, (mark) it is contrary to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and it oppoſeth evil in the <hi>very appearance thereof.</hi> Oh that you would <hi>hearken</hi> unto this! and receive this in the <hi>love</hi> of it, when it appeareth in you, that ſo by the <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> of it, you might be <hi>ſaved</hi> and <hi>cleanſed</hi> from your <hi>ſins.</hi> Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> if you ever come truly to be made <hi>free,</hi> it muſt be by the <hi>Truth</hi>; if ever you come to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> it muſt be with <hi>the Truth</hi>: Now the <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> is very nigh you, even <hi>in your mouths,</hi> to ſhew you your <hi>evil words,</hi> and alſo <hi>in your hearts,</hi> to ſhew you the <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> thereof; yea, its <hi>Vertue</hi> goeth through all things, and its <hi>Power</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things, in it is <hi>Life,</hi> and that <hi>Life is the Light of men.</hi> Oh that you would believe in it! that you might be made the <hi>children</hi> of it: This <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>Immortal,</hi> and it is able to deſtroy the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> and to ſave your <hi>Immortal Souls.</hi> Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> though its appearance in you be in <hi>judgement,</hi> yet reſiſt it not, neither turn from it in any wiſe; but when it <hi>convinceth</hi> you of any <hi>evil,</hi> and begetteth any <hi>love</hi> in you towards its <hi>judgement.</hi> Oh then abide in that <hi>love,</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:98246:97"/>
and then you will ſee how Chriſt comes for <hi>judgement</hi> into the <hi>World</hi> to judge the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and to caſt him <hi>out,</hi> and to make <hi>blind</hi> that eye which hath been open, and hath ſeen in the worldly <hi>carnal Spirit,</hi> and to open that eye which hath been kept <hi>blind</hi> by the <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of the World. Yea, as you wait in the <hi>righteous Judgements</hi> of Chriſt, you will feel him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eye of the <hi>underſtanding part,</hi> with his <hi>Inviſible Light,</hi> whereby you will come to ſee into the <hi>Inviſible things of God.</hi> Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> you muſt own Chriſt the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in the way and miniſtration of his <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; yea, you muſt own him in the Spirit of <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Burning,</hi> before you can truly witneſs that you are <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God. Oh! wait to hear the Voice of Chriſt in your <hi>inward man,</hi> and be content to bear his <hi>yoak,</hi> and wait in <hi>ſtilneſs,</hi> that <hi>patience</hi> in you may have its perfect <hi>work</hi>; and if any of you ſee with the <hi>Life of the Word,</hi> that your hearts are hard and rocky, keep but in <hi>patience,</hi> and wait in that <hi>Life</hi> which maketh you <hi>ſenſible</hi> of your <hi>condition,</hi> and you will feel the <hi>pure operation of the Word,</hi> ſmiting as a <hi>hammer,</hi> which will break your hard hearts into <hi>tenderneſs</hi>; Yea, you will feel them <hi>diſſolved, melted,</hi> and <hi>changed,</hi> by the <hi>Power of the Word,</hi> as <hi>ye</hi> believe and wait in the ſame; and then you will know <hi>experimentally,</hi> that the Word of the Lord is as a <hi>Hammer,</hi> and as a <hi>Sword,</hi> and as a <hi>fire,</hi> and as <hi>Fuller's ſope</hi>; for you will feel it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cutting down, burning up, and waſhing out all the hard, fruitleſs, defiling nature; and then you will come to know Chriſt's <hi>Fan in his hand,</hi> for you will feel him <hi>Purging the Floor,</hi> by ſeparating the Chaffy dirty nature from the tender <hi>Seed,</hi> which delighteth to do the will of God: Now as you come to feel this within, you come to witneſs his <hi>Baptiſm, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and with Fire</hi>; yea, here <hi>the waſhing in the

Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>the renewing in the Holy Spirit,</hi> comes to be witneſſed: And here Chriſt's work comes truly to be felt and known, which is to deſtroy the Devil and his Works, to blot out Tranſgreſſion, to take away Sin, to cauſe the old things to paſs away, and to make all things new. Oh Friends! wait to feel and witneſs this work, and think not that your ſaying, <hi>Chriſt hath done all for you</hi> will profit you, while you live in the old fleſhly Birth; for verily, verily, I ſay unto you, <hi>That except you be born again, you can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Therefore wait to feel this inward work, that ſo you may know Chriſt formed in you, his Mind, his Spirit, his Diſpoſition, his Nature, and then you will come to the new Creature, and to witneſs the Election which avails and obtains. And here the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion without hands you will come to know, which is <hi>the putting off of the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt</hi>; And this brings to be the <hi>Jew inward,</hi> whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God; and here's the true <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> upon which the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comes; and here's the true Elect Seed, unto which the Promiſe is; and they that come to this, are born from above, and are Members of Chriſt's Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones; and they are come to the Riches of the Myſtery which hath been hid from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Generations, which is <hi>Chriſt in them the hope of Glory.</hi>

            <p>Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> Theſe things are not written unto you, that you ſhould feed upon the words, and ſeek to get a Reſt there; but theſe things are written in tender bowels of Love, unto ſuch of you as truly hunger and thirſt after the new Life; That ſo as the Lord's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſeth in any of you to witneſs unto the Truth of them, and to give you any underſtanding in the ſame, you may joyn to his witneſs, and believe and wait in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98246:98"/>
the ſame, to <hi>feel</hi> theſe things fulfilled in you. So as you <hi>wait</hi> in the <hi>Inviſible meaſure of God,</hi> you will come to be ſenſible how far you are changed, in which <hi>Birth</hi> you live, in which <hi>Birth</hi> your <hi>minds</hi> are centered, and ſo of which <hi>Birth</hi> you are; for as it is written, even ſo will you ſee it to be that, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</hi>; And they that are after (or of) <hi>the fleſh do mind the things of the fleſh; But they that are after the ſpirit do mind the things of the Spirit; And that they that live in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> And as you <hi>mind</hi> that <hi>Life</hi> which oft-times ariſeth in you, and makes you <hi>ſenſible</hi> of your <hi>Conditions,</hi> you will plainly come to know it in your ſelves, <hi>that to be carnally minded, it is death, but to be Spiritually minded it is Life and Peace</hi>; For you will ſee if the enemy of your <hi>Souls</hi> can get your <hi>minds</hi> into <hi>Carnal things</hi> at any time, that then <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>death</hi> cometh over you, and you become <hi>dead</hi> as unto God; until his <hi>witneſs</hi> ariſeth in you to <hi>quicken</hi> you again; But as your <hi>minds</hi> are kept in <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, &amp; you minding the things of it, which it openeth unto you, ye will <hi>feel Life</hi> and <hi>Peace ſpringing</hi> in your <hi>Souls,</hi> and that from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Therefore be <hi>diligent</hi> in this the day of your <hi>Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (which yet in <hi>mercy</hi> is continued unto you) &amp; as the Lord maketh <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto you, that any of the <hi>Forms,</hi> that you have been, or are yet in, are <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> and then appear in <hi>ſpirit</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> and <hi>lead</hi> you out of them; O be not like ſtubborn, <hi>Rebellious,</hi> wilful <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that will not follow their father any further then may pleaſe their own <hi>wills,</hi> but hang back &amp; murmure; I ſay take heed of giving way to ſuch a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> leaſt the Lord leave <hi>ſtriving</hi> with you, and give you up wholly to follow the <hi>deceit</hi> of your own <hi>hearts,</hi> for the Lord will not alwayes <hi>ſtrive</hi> with <hi>man</hi>; But the day ſhall

come, wherein the Lord will withdraw himſelf from the <hi>Rebellious,</hi> and <hi>he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Friends!</hi> I ſee a day which will be terrible unto the <hi>Diſobedient</hi>; For when the Lord hath tryed his <hi>People,</hi> and gathered the ſincere hearted out of all <hi>Forms</hi> unto himſelf, he will then ſweep away the refuge (that will not be gathered in the day of their <hi>Viſitation</hi>) with a mighty <hi>Deſtruction</hi>; And the day haſtens in which this ſhall be accompliſht by the mighty <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the Lord, which is now working in ſecret. Therefore <hi>wait</hi> to be led and taught of him, and heed not the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> neither bow to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> will, but know that the Lord hath given bounds to the <hi>Sea,</hi> that although it <hi>roar, Rage</hi> and <hi>ſwell,</hi> and caſt up <hi>mire</hi> and <hi>dirt,</hi> yet it cannot go beyond its bounds.</p>
            <p>Therefore be <hi>Patient</hi> and commit your <hi>Cauſe</hi> unto the Lord, and ſeek not to <hi>avenge</hi> your ſelves, but leave it unto <hi>him,</hi> who will <hi>avenge</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And wait in the <hi>feeling</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> in your ſelves, that ſo you may feel the <hi>pure Life of Chriſt</hi> to be a ſtay to <hi>your minds,</hi> in all your <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>Temptations.</hi> Oh <hi>poor hearts!</hi> this is a <hi>precious thing</hi> to come to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>true ſtay</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> to the mind. O keep to that which maketh your <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>thoughts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> in that, and then you will feel that to be <hi>a ſtay</hi> to your <hi>minds,</hi> and you will <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>Lord's ſecret ſtrength</hi> revealed in you, <hi>enabling</hi> you to <hi>ſtand</hi> in whatſoever <hi>Tryal</hi> or <hi>Temptation</hi> he ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to <hi>come upon you,</hi> or to be <hi>preſented</hi> unto you; yea, as you are faithful to the <hi>Power</hi> that he <hi>commits</hi> unto you, you ſhall not be tryed beyond your <hi>ſtrength,</hi> but you ſhall <hi>feel</hi> the Lord <hi>ſupporting</hi> you; and by <hi>his Power</hi> he will work your minds into <hi>contentedneſs</hi> with his <hi>will</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:98246:99"/>
in all <hi>things</hi>; And if you will follow the <hi>Power of the Lamb,</hi> which is that which <hi>moves</hi> againſt Sin, and taketh it <hi>away,</hi> you will come to <hi>feel</hi> your <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>minds</hi> drawn, and <hi>Redeemed</hi> out of the Earth thereby; and you will be made <hi>willing</hi> to give up, and to part <hi>with all,</hi> and to follow the <hi>Lamb whitherſoever he goeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if your <hi>ſpirits</hi> come to be brought into <hi>this frame,</hi> then whatſoever <hi>man</hi> can <hi>do</hi> unto you, it will not be <hi>able</hi> to move <hi>you.</hi> Oh! that you would wholly give up your ſelves to <hi>wait</hi> upon the Lord, in the <hi>pure manifeſtation of his Spirit,</hi> and ceaſe <hi>contending</hi> and <hi>pleading</hi> for thoſe things which the Spirit of the Lord requireth not at <hi>your hands.</hi> Oh! that you would now mind to obey the pure <hi>requirings</hi> of the <hi>Life of Jeſus</hi> in your <hi>ſelves,</hi> and that would bring you into <hi>lowlineſs</hi> of <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> &amp; into true <hi>love</hi> to God, and one towards <hi>another</hi>; and not only to love your <hi>friends,</hi> but even to love your <hi>enemies</hi> alſo, and to <hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for them that <hi>deſpightfuly uſe you</hi>; and then you would indeed bear the <hi>Image of the Lamb,</hi> and <hi>witneſs</hi> his <hi>Kingdom ſet up in you</hi>; and this would bring you in <hi>patience</hi> to <hi>wait,</hi> until he <hi>ariſe to plead the cauſe of his People,</hi> and to <hi>avenge</hi> himſelf on <hi>his</hi> and <hi>their enemies,</hi> and to make the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this <hi>world</hi> his, and the People <hi>ſubject</hi> to his <hi>Government</hi>; which ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be <hi>aceompliſhed</hi> in its <hi>Seaſon,</hi> and the <hi>day draweth nigh.</hi>

            <p>IN the Year 1656, it was ſo ordered of the Lord, that there came unto the Town of <hi>HARWICH</hi> ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and one of them ſpoke a few words to the People as they were coming from the <hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> and ſo they paſſed into an <hi>Inn</hi>; but the then <hi>MAYOR</hi> hearing thereof ſent unto them, commanding that they ſhould depart the Town, which they had not freedom in the Lord preſently to do, but after a ſhort ſpace they went out; And it being upon them to return again, they did ſo and lodged at <hi>that Inn</hi> all night, and the next day they peaceably paſſed away; ſo not long after, the Woman that kept <hi>the Inn,</hi> was commanded to come before the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98246:102"/>
               <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of the Town, who appeared to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with her for lodging of thoſe People, and made her to promiſe them, that ſhe would lodge no more ſuch Perſons, by threatning to take away her <hi>Licenſe,</hi> if ſhe did; ſo great was their envy at the appearance of the Truth in that Town: But it pleaſed the Lord, that ſhortly after, ſome of the Inhabitants thereof were convinced of the Truth; and ſo a way was made for Meetings there, and ſeveral received the Truth in the Love of it, in and about that Town; ſo that they could not for Conſcience ſake pay to the repairing of the <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> any longer; and therefore had not freedom to Bury their dead in the ground belonging thereunto; but they joyned together, and bought a parcel of ground to Bury their dead in (<hi>as did Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the Father of the Faithful.</hi>) So in the Year, 1659. it was ſo ordered of the Lord, that one who lived a little out of that Town died, and ſeveral People were accompanying the dead Body to bury it in the place purchaſed for that end; but one of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> hearing of it, ſent the <hi>Conſtables</hi> with a Guard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them not to ſuffer the dead Body to be laid in that place (<hi>though the grave was made</hi>) and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the dead Body was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force, and buried in the <hi>Steeple-houſe Yard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in the eleventh Month of the ſame Year, there dyed another Friend near the ſame Town, and ſeveral Friends came along with the dead Body, to have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it in the place afore-mentioned; a Grave alſo being made, but <hi>Miles Hubburd,</hi> the now <hi>MAYOR,</hi> and the other <hi>Rulers,</hi> would not ſuffer the dead Body to be laid therein, but cauſed it to be taken away by force, and ſo they carried it and ſet it by the Sea-ſide, where it lay <hi>above ground,</hi> part of two dayes and one night, and then it was covered over with ſmall ſtones;

carried them before the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>; who commanded that they ſhould forthwith be ſet in the Stocks, and they were ſo; and there were kept for ſome hours.</p>

            <p>And about a Month before, on the <hi>firſt Day of the Week,</hi> the <hi>MAYOR</hi> being informed that ſome of our Friends were coming over, he with ſome other <hi>Officers</hi> of the Town, went down to the water-ſide, being bent againſt the <hi>Innocent</hi>; but when the <hi>Boat</hi> came on ſhore, it appeared that they were other People, who were going about their occaſions; and when they ſaw the <hi>Mayor,</hi> they ſaid unto him, <hi>We made bold to come over</hi>; he anſwered them, —<hi>It was well enough, I thought</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you had been QUAKERS</hi>; —and thus did he <hi>manifeſt</hi> his <hi>partiality</hi> in the ſight of many in that Town; ſo notwithſtanding the <hi>Rulers cruelty,</hi> in cauſing about forty of our Friends to be <hi>forced back,</hi> and ſetting two in the <hi>Stocks,</hi> as afore-mentioned; we that were in the Town peaceably aſſembled our ſelves together <hi>in the fear of the Lord,</hi> to wait upon him; and for near about the ſpace of two hours I had liberty to <hi>Preach the Goſpel</hi> to the People, being filled with the <hi>Power of the Lord</hi>; but within a ſhort time after the ſpace afore-mentioned, there came a great company of <hi>rude Sea-men,</hi> with others of the Town, and the houſe being filled before with <hi>peaceable People,</hi> theſe <hi>rude ones</hi> could not eaſily <hi>get in</hi>; but when they ſaw that they could not get well to me, becauſe of the <hi>preſs of People,</hi> ſome of them then curſed me bitterly, biding that they call <hi>the Pox and Plague upon me</hi>; others crying
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98246:103"/>
out—<hi>hang him Rogue, hang him</hi>; — and another conſpiringly ſaid, —<hi>Let us get a Halter</hi> (which is a long Rope) <hi>and therewith pull down the Houſe upon the Rogues</hi>; — others cryed out, —<hi>The King is coming now, who will hang or baniſh you all,</hi> —(it being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his coming.) Now when I heard and ſaw this great <hi>ungodlineſs,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> came migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon me, and I was filled with his <hi>unreſiſtable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> in which I was made to utter theſe words, ſaying, <hi>Wo, wo, unto the Rulers and Teachers of this Nation, who ſuffer ſuch ungodlineſs as this, and do not ſeek to ſuppreſs it</hi>; then went ſome of the multitude and accuſed me to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who preſently came and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>chief Conſtable (and ſome others)</hi> to fetch me out, who forthwith <hi>preſſed in,</hi> and in the <hi>King's Name</hi> commanded me to go with him; and ſo he brought me out of the Houſe into the Street, where the <hi>Rulers</hi> ſtood amongſt the <hi>rude multitude,</hi> then he that was <hi>MAYOR</hi> ſaid haſtily, —<hi>Which is he, which is he</hi>? —ſome anſwered, —<hi>This is he,</hi> — (pointing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me) then ſaid the <hi>MAYOR</hi> to the <hi>Conſtables,</hi> —<hi>Take him and put him into Priſon</hi>;— then ſaid I to him, if I have done any thing worthy of death or bonds, I ſhall not refuſe either, but I deſire Thee to ſhew me what Law I have tranſgreſſed (<hi>if thou be able</hi>) which thou oughteſt to do before thou ſendeſt me to Priſon, that I may know for what thou ſendeſt me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he ſaid, <hi>I ſhould know that afterward</hi>; but he would neither let me know my <hi>Accuſers,</hi> nor could he ſhew me any Law I had broken; neither would he tell me for what cauſe he ſent me to Priſon, nor did he at all examine me, but commanded the <hi>Conſtables</hi> to take me away; ſo I was forthwith haled to Priſon, without a <hi>Mittimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Robert Graſſingham,</hi> whoſe outward being was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98246:104"/>
at <hi>Harwich,</hi> being at the <hi>Meeting</hi> out of which I was haled, he innocently in tender love went along with me to Priſon; and as he went in the ſtreet, he ſeeing the <hi>rude multitude</hi> thronging me, ſaid to the Conſtables, <hi>You ought to ſee the Peace kept, and not to ſuffer the rude People to abuſe the Priſoner</hi> (or words to this effect.)</p>
            <p>So ſome time after I was impriſoned, there was a <hi>Mittimus</hi> ſent to the <hi>Goalor,</hi> ſigned by <hi>Miles Hubburd Mayor, Anthony Woolward,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Smith</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was falſly charged, <hi>with cauſing a tumult in that Burrough, and diſturbing the Peace thereof</hi>; and thus they ſought to cover their <hi>Perſecution,</hi> by <hi>falſe accuſing of the Innocent,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>acquits</hi>; but the rude, curſing, tumultuous, Peace-breaking People (<hi>whom they had let up and ſtrengthned by their unlawful proceedings</hi>) had nothing done unto them, but were let go free; yet all this did not ſatisfie their <hi>perſecuting Spirit,</hi> but they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeded in their <hi>cruelty,</hi> and accuſed <hi>both me</hi> and <hi>Robert Graſſingham</hi> to the <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi>; Now as for <hi>R. G.</hi> I know nothing that they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt him, except they were diſpleaſed with his going with me to the Priſon, as afore-mentioned; nor did they in the leaſt charge him to his face with any thing; but the <hi>MAYOR</hi> ſome time before that, did ſay unto him, in the hearing of ſeveral Friends; —<hi>If I could but get you out of the Town, then could I deal well enough with the reſt of the QUAKERS</hi>; — but the Lord hath a Seed in <hi>that Town,</hi> which fears not the <hi>rage of man,</hi> though one of <hi>their Brethren,</hi> (through the <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>unlawful proceedings</hi> of thoſe <hi>Rulers</hi>) be taken. From them <hi>at preſent:</hi> So the <hi>PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> upon the receiving of their falſe Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iſſued forth an Order for the bringing up of <hi>R.G.</hi> and <hi>Me</hi>: A true Copy thereof, is as followeth.</p>

               <p>Now let the Reader conſider, how unreaſonably and contrary to Law we have been uſed, who have been kept <hi>ſeventeen Weeks in this Priſon,</hi> and never brought to any examination, <hi>Beſides the time that I was kept in</hi> Harwich.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> AS concerning <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that was ſuppoſed to be <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Carpenter's Son,</hi> who as concerning the <hi>Fleſh</hi> was <hi>Crucified,</hi> and put to <hi>Death</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> between <hi>two Thieves,</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> at <hi>Mount
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98246:109"/>
Calvary,</hi> I do believe he was <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and that <hi>that very Body</hi> that the <hi>Souldier pierced,</hi> was the <hi>very Body</hi> that was <hi>prepared</hi> by the <hi>Father</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>true Saviour</hi> to come <hi>in,</hi> to <hi>do</hi> the <hi>Will of the Father</hi> that ſent <hi>Him:</hi> And I do <hi>believe</hi> that by the Grace of God <hi>he</hi> taſted <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>every man,</hi> that as <hi>many</hi> as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>in</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>no man</hi> can be <hi>Iuſtified</hi> by the <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> nor by <hi>any VVork</hi> of <hi>his own</hi>; but <hi>He</hi> or <hi>She</hi> that is <hi>Iuſtified</hi> in the ſight of God, it is <hi>freely</hi> by <hi>his Grace,</hi> through <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who <hi>creates</hi> ſuch unto <hi>Good VVorks,</hi> which God hath <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> that are <hi>juſtified</hi> ſhould walk <hi>in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God through his <hi>Free Love</hi> hath made <hi>Me</hi> a <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>true <hi>Iuſtification</hi>
               </hi>; And I <hi>teſtifie</hi> in the <hi>Lord,</hi> That it is not <hi>my Works</hi> that <hi>Iuſtifie</hi> me; but it is the <hi>LORD</hi> alone, who <hi>worketh</hi> my <hi>Works in</hi> me, and <hi>for</hi> me, according to his own <hi>good pleaſure</hi>; who <hi>loved</hi> me, before I <hi>loved</hi> him, and manifeſted <hi>his Love</hi> to me in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> whereby he <hi>drew me</hi> after <hi>himſelf,</hi> and gave <hi>me</hi> ſtrength to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> him in the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> and drawings of his <hi>Love</hi>; which whilſt I did <hi>reject,</hi> I was <hi>juſtly condemned</hi> of the Lord, and could not witneſs <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in <hi>that State,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſought <hi>it,</hi> and <hi>talked</hi> much of <hi>it,</hi> as many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> now do: but <hi>GOD,</hi> who is <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> ſhewed me how he had given me <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to receive his <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Love of it,</hi> through which I am now <hi>Saved</hi> and <hi>Iuſtified.</hi>

which is <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life; they</hi> in his <hi>Light</hi> may come to <hi>perceive</hi> the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi>; but if <hi>Truth</hi> can be <hi>received</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> then it will <hi>appear</hi> and be <hi>manifeſted</hi> to <hi>ſuch,</hi> that I <hi>do not <hi>deny the Reſurrection</hi>
               </hi>: For I do verily <hi>believe,</hi> that the <hi>hour</hi> is coming, in which <hi>all</hi> that are in the <hi>Graves,</hi> ſhall <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and ſhall <hi>come forth; <hi>They</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Truly, if I did <hi>not believe</hi> that there was a <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> more than what is <hi>here,</hi> ſurely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>good Preſence, Peace</hi> and <hi>Conſolation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>in me,</hi> and his <hi>Glory</hi> reſts <hi>richly</hi> upon me, yet I ſhould <hi>think my ſelf</hi> to be in a <hi>more miſerable condition</hi> than very <hi>many</hi>; but for the <hi>Glory</hi> that is ſet before <hi>me,</hi> which Chriſt [<hi>in me</hi>] is the <hi>hope</hi> of, (which anchors and ſtayes my ſoul) I am <hi>content</hi> to <hi>endure</hi> the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>patiently</hi> to bear the <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> of <hi>this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life,</hi> not counting them <hi>worthy</hi> (though ever ſo great) to be <hi>compared</hi> to that <hi>Eternal Weight of <hi>Glory</hi>,</hi> which I do <hi>believe</hi> ſhall be <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>given unto me, <hi>in the World to come</hi>.</hi>

            <p>Oh <hi>England, England</hi>!

Oh! Ye <hi>Idolatrous People,</hi> Do you think, that the Lord God of Pitty and Patience, ſuffered your King to hide himſelf from his Enemies <hi>in an Oak,</hi> for that end, that ye might <hi>Devour</hi> his Creatures in making an <hi>Idol of it</hi>?

You <hi>Wicked Workers,</hi> How dare you make <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Deſtruction</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi>? How dare you make a Sport of ſuch things? Verily, <hi>your Provocations</hi> are great, wherewith <hi>you provoke</hi> the <hi>Juſt God</hi>; And it will be Juſt with him to bring <hi>Ruine, Deſolation,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> upon <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>City</hi>; Verily, great is the Judgement that is nigh you, and your ſins draw it on you apace. Do you think that the Lord caſt out <hi>Back-ſliders, Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>Vnfaithful men,</hi> to ſet up and eſtabliſh <hi>Idolaters</hi> and open <hi>Prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>?

            <p>Therefore ye People of <hi>Enland</hi> (that yet live in wickedneſs) who have not wholly ſinned out the day of your <hi>Viſitation,</hi> To you I now ſpeak; You that feel the Lord yet ſtriving with you; O <hi>Return, Return</hi> ſpeedily unto the Manifeſtation of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby he ſtrives with you, to ſhew you your <hi>abominations,</hi> and to draw and lead you out of the ſame; O be not ſtill <hi>Stiff-necked,</hi> but hearken to the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, which ſheweth you the thoughts and Intents of your Hearts, and hearken and be obedient to the Call thereof, that ſo by its Power you may <hi>Haſten</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> both <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Old, Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor, High</hi> and

            <p>Oh <hi>England, England</hi>! The Lord hath a <hi>Precious</hi> and <hi>Holy Seed</hi> in thee; Yea, He hath a <hi>Remnant,</hi> which he hath Raiſed by his Power to, and for himſelf, which are exceeding precious in his ſight; and theſe a great part of thine Inhabitants have <hi>Shamefully entreated,</hi> and <hi>grievouſly Oppreſſed,</hi> and <hi>Perſecuted</hi>; And they have <hi>Patiently</hi> born the ſame, and have laboured in the Life of <hi>Innocency,</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> to Inform thy <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the Things that are <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>True,</hi> and have ſhewn them the <hi>Wayes</hi> which have, and do <hi>Diſpleaſe</hi> the Lord, and have Exhorted and Warned thy Inhabitants, Time after Time: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

their <hi>Doctrine, Lives,</hi> and <hi>Converſations</hi> have manifeſted their <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi> before God and Man; Yet have many of thy <hi>Rulers, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>People, Oppreſſed</hi> them <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi>; Some <hi>Spoiling their Goods,</hi> others <hi>Impriſoning their Bodies,</hi> in filthy <hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Dungeons,</hi> till ſeveral of them have Sealed their Teſtimony for the Lord with <hi>their Blood,</hi> which cryeth <hi>for <hi>Vengeance</hi>
               </hi> in the Ears of the Almighty, and the Lord hath heard the Cry thereof, and hath looked down and beheld the <hi>Actings</hi> of the ſons of men, and he is near to Viſit; Yea, the Lord hath <hi>beheld,</hi> and doth <hi>behold,</hi> the Snares that have been, and are laid for the <hi>Innocent,</hi> who have no other Helper but him alone; and therefore they have Committed their Cauſe unto Him who ſhall bring it to paſs: Yea, he hath taken Notice, how ſeveral of thy <hi>Rulers</hi> have combin'd together, and endeavoured <hi>to Force</hi> His <hi>Babes</hi> to Violate his Royal Law, and to Break his Command (who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>) to Uphold and Obey theirs, which is Contrary to his; Yea, He hath taken Notice of the <hi>Cruel Sufferings,</hi> and great <hi>Temptations</hi> of his People, who, many of them, are <hi>yet Impriſoned,</hi> and both their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> threatned to be Deſtroyed (by ſome evil men) if they will not break the Royal Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, which he hath placed in their hearts to Obey and Do. Oh!

People, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> as he ſaid to his Diſciples formerly) and for <hi>meeting together,</hi> and <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> in his Name, for the <hi>Edifying, Comforting</hi> and <hi>Building up one another in their moſt holy Faith.</hi> The Lord hath alſo taken notice, that when ſome of the <hi>Rulers</hi> might Relieve <hi>the Innocent,</hi> and let <hi>the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed go free,</hi> they will not; and then to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will ſay, <hi>They cannot act contrary to the Law:</hi> But when a <hi>Ruler</hi> will act that which he hath no Law for, he can then plead <hi>a Prerogative Royal for that:</hi> and thus are the <hi>Innocent Lambs</hi> of Chriſt made a Prey upon.</p>
            <p>Oh! the <hi>Oppreſsions</hi> of his People, and others, are great this day in thee, O Land; and the Crying of the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> the <hi>Widows</hi> and the <hi>Needy</hi> is come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord God of Compaſſion, who will thorowly plead the Cauſe of his People, and the Poor and Needy of the Land.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England, England</hi>! I have oft heard and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up what the Lord hath ſaid in me, concerning thy Inhabitants; but now muſt I declare it in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Seaſon: Thus hath the Lord ſpoken in me for a long time, concerning thy Inhabitants, ſaying, <hi>The People are <hi>too many,</hi> the People are <hi>too many</hi>; I will <hi>thin them,</hi> I will <hi>thin them</hi>
               </hi>: [Mark] that is, <hi>He will make them <hi>fewer</hi>,</hi> for they cumber the Ground. And the Spirit of the Lord hath oft ſignified unto me, for a long time, <hi>That an <hi>Over-flowing Scourge</hi>,</hi> yea, <hi>even an exceeding <hi>great</hi> and <hi>terrible Iudgement</hi> is to come upon thee, O Land</hi>! and that many in thee <hi>ſhall fall</hi> and be <hi>taken away</hi> in the Judgement; and the Spirit of the Lord ſignifieth unto me, that the <hi>time draweth nigh,</hi> and that the <hi>Decree</hi> of the Lord is ſo firm, that though ſome of the Lords Children and Prophets could appear ſo, as to ſtand in the <hi>Gap,</hi> yet ſhould not that alter
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98246:116"/>
his <hi>Decree,</hi> onely in the Righteouſneſs of the Lamb they ſhall be hid and ſaved from his Wrath, whatever may be done to any of their <hi>Bodies</hi>; but his fierce Wrath and Indignation ſhall be poured forth upon the Ungodly, and a <hi>great Deſolation</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> ſhall there be; for he will <hi>overturn</hi> and <hi>overturn,</hi> till he hath <hi>diſ-throned</hi> and <hi>thrown down</hi> the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> the Kingdom of his <hi>Dear Son,</hi> over all the Kingdoms of the World; and the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> and the Greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the Holy People, the Saints of the Moſt High, <hi>whoſe Kingdom is an Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him, who is King of Saints.</p>
            <p>Behold, ye <hi>Deſpiſers,</hi> and <hi>Wonder!</hi> This is the Work which the Lord will accompliſh by his own Power, though you will in no wiſe believe it; but you ſhall feel, even both <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi> that the Lord is able to bring to paſs the thing that is in his heart.</p>
            <p>And you now think <hi>to ſet up</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> your <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and to live in <hi>Prophaneſs</hi> without <hi>controul</hi>; and you who appear <hi>ſo hot</hi> againſt ſome of theſe things, and labour to ſtop and pull them down (mark) that you might ſet up and eſtabliſh your own <hi>Hypocritical <hi>Will-worſhip</hi>
               </hi> in another <hi>dark dead Form; I will fruſtrate <hi>you both</hi>,</hi> ſaith the Lord God, and <hi>you ſhall grind and waſte <hi>one</hi> againſt <hi>another,</hi> as the</hi> upper <hi>and</hi> nether <hi>Milſtone; And I will pluck out from you, and preſerve a holy Seed, beyond expectation</hi>; and I will <hi>be avenged on you</hi> for that which you have already <hi>bruiſed,</hi> or ſhall yet <hi>bruiſe,</hi> [mark] And I will <hi>hurry</hi> and <hi>hurl <hi>you round</hi>
               </hi> with a mighty <hi>Stream</hi>; for the Waters ſhall <hi>roar</hi> and <hi>ſwell:</hi> And after I have executed <hi>my vengeance</hi> upon the <hi>Rebellious</hi> and <hi>Treacherous Dealers,</hi> I will then bring
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98246:116"/>
forth the <hi>Remnant</hi> of my Holy Seed, which ſhall be <hi>preſerved</hi> from their <hi>Fury,</hi> and they ſhall ſpread over all, in my Life, Power, Knowledge and Wiſdom, wherein they ſhall ſtand in Dominion; Yea, and they ſhall rule the Earth in <hi>Mercy, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>true Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and they ſhall <hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>love their Enemies</hi> (as they do at this day) and do the thing that is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>good</hi> unto all, without <hi>reſpect of Perſons</hi>; yea, they ſhall ſeek the good of the whole Creation in the <hi>true love</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial</hi>; for the Spirit of <hi>Love, Meekneſs, Healing</hi> and <hi>Reſtoring</hi> ſhall mightily fill their tender Bowels, and my Bleſſings ſhall fill their Dwelling-place, and the Earth, for their ſakes: theſe things will I accompliſh by my own Power, and in my own time, ſaith the Lord God.</p>
            <p>But although theſe things, touching the holy <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> ſhall certainly be fulfilled in their Seaſon? Yet before they be fully accompliſhed, great will be the Tryals of many of the Righteous, &amp; there will be <hi>great Judgements</hi> executed in thee, O Land, by him who oft-times maketh <hi>a fruitful Land barren,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of them that dwell therein; and Juſt will it be with Him to deal ſo with thee, becauſe of the <hi>great wickedneſs</hi> of the greateſt part of thy Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who are departed and ſeparated from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Mercy, Love, Compaſſion and Healing, and are labouring to <hi>Devour, Oppreſs,</hi> and <hi>Deſtroy</hi> one another, and the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England, England</hi>! There is alſo a People in thee who are come to ſee <hi>the Great <hi>Idolatry</hi>

Prieſts,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Popiſt ſtuff,</hi> that theſe things are <hi>Idolatry, Folly</hi> and <hi>Vanity, <hi>and but a mocking of God</hi>,</hi> and yet ſome of theſe People will run after this <hi>Vain Worſhip,</hi> for <hi>ſelf-ends, flaviſh-fear,</hi> and to keep themſelves in eſteem with, or amongſt thoſe who plead for it: And others there are in thee, who inſtead of being ſorrowful for ſuch Abomination and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, or reproving the Practicers thereof in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ſeaſoned, ſavoury Life and holy Dread of the Lord God, they write and ſpeak <hi>ſcoſſingly</hi> of thoſe things, even to the ſtirring up one of another into <hi>Vain Laughter,</hi> and ſo make a Sport of others <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>; and this grieveth the Spirit of the Lord alſo, and doth not convince, but exaſperate and harden thoſe that are zealous for their <hi>blind Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo a great number of <hi>brittle, fiery, raſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied People,</hi> in thee, O Land, who are as <hi>unſtable</hi> as water; and theſe rebelling againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of it, becauſe they abide not in the Path thereof, they are <hi>reſtleſs, rouling,</hi> and <hi>raging</hi> oft-times like the Sea; One time they will have a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and cry out, <hi>They ſhall govern</hi> and <hi>heal them</hi>; and when they have gotten them, in a ſhort time they grow weary of them; And then another time, they will cry out <hi>for a King,</hi> and ſay, <hi>He ſhall heal them,</hi> and <hi>make up their Breaches:</hi> But theſe people are not long of one mind, for they are much like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who ſpent their time in little elſe but either <hi>to tell</hi> or <hi>to hear of ſome New thing</hi>· Theſe People alſo are like mighty Tydes in thy Channels, <hi>O England,</hi> which one while run with <hi>Violence,</hi> driving all <hi>unſetled, light, unfixed</hi> things <hi>one way,</hi> and ſhortly after run with as much violence the contrary way: Therefore in a miſerable condition are thoſe <hi>Rulers</hi> whoſe ſtrength is in ſuch a People! And
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98246:117"/>
until <hi>Rulers</hi> come to be ſettled, and fixed in Him who is the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> and ſingly to rule in, and for Him, whom the Winds and the Seas obey; who maketh the Waters to ſtand on heaps, and divideth them hither and thither, and altereth the natural courſe of <hi>Tydes</hi> as he pleaſeth (as he hath done thine of late, to ſhew thee the Figure of the People) they can never be ſafe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the People be ſtill'd long together; but there will be <hi>Swellings, Ragings, Overflowings, ſore Breakings, and Ruines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! that the <hi>foregoings Rulers</hi> would have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to have Received him for their Teacher, who ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, then ſhould they not onely have ſeen, what the Lord caſt out others before them for, but they ſhould have been taught how to have denyed all thoſe things which the Lord was angry with others for, and they ſhould have received Power to have abſtained from the ſame; but they would not hear and obey the Lord, nor his Prophets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were they caſt out alſo.</p>
            <p>And therefore, Oh! that the <hi>Rulers</hi> that now are, would be perſwaded (whilſt they have their Day) by the Lord and his Servants, to receive the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> and then they ſhould not onely ſee for <hi>what cauſe</hi> the Lord caſt them out, and <hi>others</hi> in their Age, but they ſhould be taught to <hi>deny</hi> and <hi>forſake</hi> all thoſe <hi>things</hi> which God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and others for, and they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Power to do thoſe things, which they and others before them left undone: But alas! How few are there that will <hi>Hear, Regard,</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi> the Prince of Life and his Followers, and therefore is Deſolation coming as a mighty Flood, which none ſhall be able to ſtop.</p>
            <p>Now all People, in what Sect or Opinion ſoever, in whom there are any true <hi>Breathings</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> after

have <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> done to them and for them, by ſuch as you have had thoughts to put in <hi>Authority,</hi> which would do <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equal things</hi> between <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> without reſpect to perſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe things the <hi>Lords witneſs</hi> (in you) hath ſhewed unto you, that they ought to be done by you, and ſome of you have breathed and deſired much to do theſe things, when ye have owned the pure movings and ſtirrings of the meaſure of the Life and Power God (in you) which hath ſtirred and moved (in you) towards <hi>Righteouſneſs, Equity, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi>; But hitherto ye have been much hindred in this work.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>Friends,</hi> there are many things yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in and among you (mark that) which hinder and ſtop you in this work of <hi>true Reformation,</hi> and they will ſtop you therein (mark that) ſo long as they bear rule in and among you, and are conſented to (and regarded) by you; many of thoſe things are as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are many that <hi>pretend</hi> that they are <hi>of you</hi> (mark that) which have joyned unto you in ſome outward appearance, but it is more for fear of <hi>looſing</hi> their <hi>places,</hi> and the <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of this world, than for to the Cauſe of <hi>Equity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>true Liberty</hi>; And theſe are in the Prieſts nature, who for covetouſneſs and ſelf ends, can change with the times and Governments, and pretend they are for them (ſo long as they will hold them up) and ſuch are neither true to God nor their Country, for they can lay down their Religion which they have pretended to ſtand for, and deny <hi>the Cauſe</hi> of their Country, if it will make moſt for their own Gain, and then ſay it was the Lords doing, and they are ſatisfied in it, though it be quite contrary to that, which they have formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for: and of this ſort there are many among you, which ſtop the work you ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:98246:142"/>And ſeveral of you alſo, in whom the Truth of God hath ſtirred againſt <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> verily your minds are yet ſo much in your <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> that this ſtops you in the work ye ought to do. And ſome of you have ſo <hi>many relations</hi> (mark that) that have ſuch a great gain in thoſe very things, which greatly <hi>Oppreſſe the People</hi> of this Nation; and alſo <hi>ſome of your ſelves</hi> are concerned in <hi>theſe things</hi>; that ſo ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to take away <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> wholly, without taking away <hi>their</hi> and <hi>your own gain</hi>; and theſe things being looked at by you, they exceedingly ſtop you in the work you ought to do, becauſe herein <hi>private ſelf ends,</hi> and <hi>reſpect to Perſons</hi> by you are preferred before the <hi>general good of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Friends,</hi> whilſt your <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> run into or after any of <hi>theſe things</hi>; They (with the Enemy of your Souls) will not ſuffer you to do <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>equal,</hi> no further (to be ſure) then it will ſtand ſafe for the <hi>upholding</hi> and <hi>preferring</hi> of yout <hi>relations,</hi> and your own private particular <hi>ſelf ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all wait in <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>pure</hi> and living of God <hi>in you,</hi> which will ſhew you <hi>all Deceit,</hi> if ye keep to it, that ſo by <hi>it</hi> your minds may be <hi>redeemed</hi> out of all <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>reſpect to Perſons,</hi> that ſo all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular private <hi>ſelf ends</hi> and <hi>reſpects to Perſons,</hi> may be <hi>denyed</hi> and utterly <hi>trampled upon</hi> by you, and that the <hi>general good</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> of all, without reſpect of Perſons may be minded and acted for by you, that ſo ye may ſerve the Lord God and your Generation <hi>in ſingleneſs</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of heart, and then the Lord will honour you, and he will be your ſufficient reward.</p>
            <p>Verily it is a mighty thing, and it is highly to be prized by you, eſpecially ye of the Army, that ever the Lord God ſhould make uſe of you again, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98246:142"/>
again put an opportunity into your hands to do that which you <hi>formerly promiſed</hi> and <hi>vowed</hi> unto the Lord (and your Nation) to do, ſeeing ye ſo ſlighted (mark that) the <hi>former opportunities,</hi> which the Lord God gave you, and acted ſo <hi>Treacherouſly</hi> and <hi>Deceitfully</hi> as ye did in your <hi>back-ſlidings</hi>; and if ye ſhould ſlight <hi>this opportunity alſo,</hi> do not expect another (be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived God will not be mocked) therefore conſider theſe things and mind to anſwer the Lords love yet continued unto you.</p>
            <p>But if ye look out at or ſuffer your minds to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (mark) the <hi>greatneſs of your Places,</hi> or after <hi>your gain,</hi> or the <hi>honour of the World,</hi> or if ye look out at <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> of your <hi>Friends</hi> or known <hi>Enemies,</hi> or at any particular <hi>ſelf end</hi> whatſoever; Theſe things will ſtrangle the Principle of God in you, which moves to do that which is <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> unto all, and then the tender Seed in you, which feels the weight and burden of <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> that will be <hi>murdered,</hi> and then the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardneſs of heart will come upon you more and more, and ye will ſettle deeper and deeper in the death; and verily if ye ſhould do thus, ye would become even as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> unto the Lord, and he would <hi>overturn you</hi> with a great and mighty deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as he did them) therefore remember you have been warned.</p>
            <p>So look at none of <hi>theſe things,</hi> but look ye to the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and mind the movings of his Life <hi>(in you)</hi> and be obedient thereto, and as <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Tiranny</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is made manifeſt unto you (by the Light of the Lord in you) in the Power of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto you, <hi>break it down</hi> and <hi>overturn it,</hi> and ſet up and eſtabliſh <hi>Righteous Laws, Equity, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>true Liberty</hi> in its Place, and then you nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

not fear what Man can do unto you, for the Lord will then be your preſerver.</p>
            <p>So the Lord God hath once more tryed you; Now if you love <hi>Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Houſes, Lands, Commiſſions, Honours of the World,</hi> or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>ſelf end</hi> whatſoever, more then the <hi>work of the Lord</hi>; or if ye prefer any of them ſo as thereby to ſtop the Lords work, or if you do the Lords work negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently (which he hath once more put into your hands) verily ye ſhall not be counted worthy to be the Lords workmen.</p>
            <p>So remember <hi>Saul</hi> (who was made an example that others might take warning) who ſlew but <hi>part</hi> (of that which was to be diſtroyed) and ſaved <hi>a part</hi> alive, and therein he was ſtubborn and diſobedient; Now if ye ſhould deſtroy but <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Trranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> which is utterly to be diſtroyed (mark that) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>part</hi> of it, take heed leſt the Lord rent you from your places for your <hi>ſtubborneſs</hi> and <hi>diſobedience,</hi> as he rent <hi>Saul</hi> from his Kingdom for his.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Awake, Awake,</hi> and wait in the Light, to feel the Lord's ſtrength, that therein your zeal and courage for him may be renewed and linger not in things as ye have done, but dwell in the Power of the Lord (ye who have felt it, and do not abuſe it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it any longer) and in his Power act for the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>juſt Liberty</hi> of all his Creatures, &amp; this will bring honour unto the Lord, that ſo ye in whoſe hearts there is a <hi>ſingleneſs,</hi> an <hi>honeſty,</hi> an <hi>uprightneſs</hi> unto the Lord, (may keep your ſelves from being <hi>defiled</hi> with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs of others) and ſo be preſerved in his Wiſdom and Power, in the <hi>Breakings, Overturnings,</hi> or <hi>Purging,</hi>

            <p>Now if this Spirit lead you, then ſelf denyal will be manifeſted in you indeed, and they that called you a mercenary Army, then ſhould be aſhamed; for if <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> were deſtroyed, and <hi>Equity, true outward Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> were eſtabliſhed, and the Enemies of it ſo brought to nought, that ſo there were no need of you, this Spirit if it ruled you would make you as freely willing then, to lay down your Places and Swords, as ever any of you were made free to take them up, and then to fall upon improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creation in the fear and Wiſdom of the Lord, and to be content to enjoy an equal proportion and ſhare of the Liberty (with your fellow Creatures) which you have fought for; and if it were thus, then ye might truly be called the Common-wealths Men, or ſervants.</p>
            <p>But if ye carry a Sword &amp; expect and deſire ſtill to carry or uphold a ſword to make a Trade of (mark that) then I know you will not utterly bring down <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and firmly eſtabliſh outward Liberty though ye could, leſt your Trade ſhould fall: Now if you do not act ſingly for your Nations good (ſtand

            <p>And Friends, there are many things done lately in the name of the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England</hi>; Now (mark) ye ſhould firſt make <hi>England</hi> a free Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſet it at Liberty from all its <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and bondage that it is in (befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
