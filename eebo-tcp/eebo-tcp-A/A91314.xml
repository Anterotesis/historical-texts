            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt my Antagoniſts publikely charge me, That</hi> I ſpeak untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to the</hi> great offence of godly people, againſt all Christs Ministers and Eccleſiastical Rulers, in this conditionall clauſe, <hi>[If it fall into indiſcreet, over-ſevere, ambitious, paſſionate, or revengefull hands]</hi> In which I ſuppoſe, that ordinarily the hands of Miniſters &amp; Elders of Chriſts Church are ſuch, and therfore they ought not to be truſted with ſuch power of Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Excommunication; or elſe that I ſuppoſe, ſome of them may act with ſuch hands, and therefore that all of that calling are to be abridged of that power.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that no ſuch uncharitable incoherent inference can any way follow from this Clauſe; the whole ſcope of my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions diametrally contradicting it, which tend only to an orderly regular ſettlement of Presbyteriall power in the originall inſtitution of our new Presbyteries, not to take from them all Eccleſiaſticall Jurisdiction due by divine right to them, but to confine it within certain definite limits, to prevent all exorbitant abuſes of it, into
<pb facs="tcp:123446:4"/>
whoſe hands ſoever it ſhould ſall. There is no man ſo unskilfull in Politicks, but will acknowledge, it is the duty and ought to be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of Lawgivers, in the creation of new Iurisdictions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of new Lawes, to look, not only to preſent, but future In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which may poſſibly ſpring up in after-ages; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not what ſome, or moſt men are which ſhall execute ſuch Lawes or Iurisdictions at preſent, but what any of them may poſſibly prove to be in after-times, and thereupon to preſcribe ſet bounds to all alike, and leave nothing meerly arbitrary to any, how good or juſt ſoever, to prevent all poſſible, all probable abuſes by any intruſted with ſuch Lawes and Iurisdictions. And there are none ſo ignorant of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of our Engliſh Church &amp; Miniſtery, but muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1. That many of our godly Miniſters and people are very paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, indiſcreet, and over-rigorous; having more zeale, then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or diſcretion how to manage ſuch a power. 2. That the beſt and juſteſt men we can ſelect to conſtitute Presbyteries of, if left at large, to an arbitrary kind of proceeding, and not bounded by ſtrict or punctuall Lawes and Penalties, will be very apt now and then (through naturall infirmities, and the remainder of corruptions in them) to abuſe or exceed their power, and run into extravagancies to the oppreſſion of the people, of which we have divers experiments in many Counties, if the complaints againſt their Committees may be credited, as many of them are too true. 3. That though there be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient choice of prudent, diſcreet, learned, conſcientions, upright Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Chriſtians in and about <hi>London,</hi> fit to be united into Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, Claſſes, and truſted with Eccleſiaſticall cenſures; yet in moſt places elſe throughout our three Kingdomes (except here and there a City or country Town) there are very few, if any ſuch Miniſters or Lay-Elders to be found for the preſent, and none can certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine when or where to provide or cull out ſuch for the future. 4. That, let the Parliament make the beſt preſent choice they can of Miniſters and Lay-Elders to execute Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, yet there may and will be a <hi>Judas</hi> among the twelve Apoſtles, at leaſt one or more indiſcreet, paſſionate, ambitious, or ſpleenatick perſons, who upon occaſion offered wilbe apt to abuſe or exceed their power, to the prejudice of others. 5. That into whoſe hands ſoever this power ſhall <note place="margin">

That
<pb facs="tcp:123446:5"/>
ſince we intend to ſettle the ſelf-ſame Eccleſiaſticall Government and Diſcipline in all three Kingdomes, at leaſtwiſe throughout our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh territories; there ought to be the ſelf-ſame rules, bounds, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits preſcribed unto all Presbyteries and Claſſes, to regulate their proceedings by, and prevent exorbitances in every of them; and none of them left more arbitrary then others, leſt their proceedings ſhould vary from others. Theſe undeniable principles were the grounds of my Suppoſition ſo much excepted againſt, <hi>If it fall into indiſcreet, over-ſevere, paſsionate, or revengefull hands:</hi> Yea, the true reaſon why the Parliament takes ſo much deliberation and advice in ſetling of the intended Presbyteriall Church-Government and Diſcipline, in which more difficulties ariſe then ordinary capacities are able to apprehend. Wherefore for any to inferre from thence, as my Antagoniſts do, <hi>That the hands of all the Elders and Miniſters of Chriſts Church, are ſuch, and therefore ought not to be truſted with the power of Church-cenſures; or that all of them are to be abridged of this power, becauſe ſome of them are ſuch;</hi> is ſuch a malicious and uncharitable perverting both of my words and meaning, as nought but prejudice or malice it ſelfe could invent.</p>

            <p>Certainly there is not one ſyllable in theſe 4 Queſtions from whence any ſuch malignant accuſation can be ſtrained: and my former Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to vindicate the <hi>Reverend Aſſembly</hi> (whom I love and honour with my ſoule) from the libellous, venomous, intolerable aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caſt upon them, in many late ſeditious ſchiſmaticall printed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, (publiſhed by Anabaptiſts and other Sectaries, to defame them, and vilifie all their proceedings;) with the grounds in the preceding Anſwer (which occaſioned all the Paſſages unjuſtly wreſted by theſe uncharitable Anſwerers, to warrant this falſe charge) will (I hope) ſufficiently purge me from theſe ſcandalous accuſations, and all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of my <hi>Queries,</hi> or this <hi>Vindication</hi> of them; the ſcope of both being only this, to reduce the Power of Miniſters and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, in the originall erection of their Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, (now in agitation in the Parliament,) to as great a conformity to the
<pb facs="tcp:123446:5"/>
Word of God, and as punctuall certainty in all particulars as poſſible may be; and to ſettle it with ſuch neceſſary Cautions &amp; Limitations as may prevent all abuſes of it, into whoſe hands ſoever it ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either for the preſent, or in future ages: ſince a ſmal error, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of a meer arbitrary power in ſom things in the beginning of this New Government, may ſoon degenerate into a grand inconvenience and grievance in concluſion, which is eaſier prevented then redreſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus having fully cleared the ſincerity of my own intentions, againſt theſe ſcandalous inferences, I have onely this to adde in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments behalfe; That the ſettlement of Church-diſcipline being a matter of great difficulty and concernment, wherein many new doubts and ſcruples daily ariſe, requiring much debate, they cannot be juſtly blamed (in the middeſt of their other preſsing publike occaſions to preſerve our Kingdomes, themſelves and us from eminent ruine) for proceeding deliberately in this weighty work, which hath taken upthe <hi>Aſſembly</hi> themſelves ſo many moneths debate, and wherein there are ſuch differences of Opinions. Many there are, who deny any Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication at all to be of divine inſtitution, producing ſundry ſtrong arguments to juſtifie their opinions, and anſwering all objections to the contrary: In maintenance of which opinion, <hi>Tho. Eraſtus</hi> (a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitian) long ſince wrote a large Volume in Latine, intituled, <hi>Explicatio graviſsimae quaestionis de Excommunicatione</hi> printed <hi>An.</hi> 1589. who is ſeconded by many learned men. Others, who admit Excommunication to be introduced, and exerciſed in the Apoſtles times, and ſomwhat after; yet hold it to be but a temporary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, taken up by Chriſtians out of meer neceſsity, for want of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates to reſtrain and puniſh ſcandalous ſinners; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſſe, or ſeldome or never to be put in execution in ſuch places, Churches, where Chriſtian Magiſtrates are ſetled, <hi>whoſe office and duty it is, to puniſh all obſtinate, impenitent, ſcandalous ſinners, with the temporall ſword of justice, and to cut off all evil doers from the City of God,</hi> Pſal. 101. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Rom. 13. 3, 4, 5. without whoſe aſsiſtance <hi>Church cenſures</hi> will become altogether uſeleſſe, invalid, &amp; contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: whence the Church hath always been inforced to pray in aid from the Secular arme, and Civil Magiſtrate, by Writs <hi>De Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> and the like, to force obedience and ſubmiſsion to her cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which elſe would prove meer <hi>Bruta fulmina.</hi> Others, who admit of Excommunication, deny ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, as no divine ſtep or degree to it, nor to be inflicted upon any but perſons actually excommunicated from all other Ordinances.
<pb facs="tcp:123446:6"/>
Others who plead moſt for Excommunication and ſuſpention from the Lords Supper, are yet divided into theſe circumſtances which concern them. 1. Who ſhall inflict thoſe cenſures? Whether the Miniſters only? Or the Presbytery and Claſſis only? Or the whole Congregation? 2. For what ſins and Offences? which is now the grand doubt and debate: Whether for Inceſt, and Hereſie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for which they pretend examples of Excommunication in Scripture; or for any other ſins, for which we finde no pattern of any Excommunication or Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion in the Word? 3. In what manner, and by what ſteps and degrees the Presbytery or Claſſis ought to proceed in inflicting theſe cenſures? What reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be given by way of Appeal, to the parties grieved? And, to whom they ſhall appeal? 4. How, and by whom ſuch who contemn thoſe cenſures ſhall be proceeded againſt? How long thoſe cenſures ſhall continue, and how and when reverſed? 5. Whether excommunicated perſons ought to be admitted to hear the Word, or to any other Ordinance? and in what ſort; with what publike badges of infamy and diſtinction, the more to ſhame themſelves, and deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? All theſe, with ſundry other difficult controverſies ariſing in the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Church-diſcipline (in which the very Aſſembly-men are divided in opinion, as well as the Members of Parliament) it muſt needs require much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and deliberation to ſettle Church-diſcipline in a due and ſolid manner.</p>
            <p>It is a received Maxime, approved by prudent men, and God himſelf; <hi>Diu deliberandum quod ſemel ſtatuendum;</hi> We muſt deliberate long of that which is to be ſetled but once. We know that the materiall Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was <hi>neere</hi>

How many yeares, I pray you, have our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Brethren been in hammering and compleating their New Church-Model, long ſince promiſed, and yet are not agreed on it, or elſe afraid, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, leſt all ſhould diſcern its manifold flawes?

Wherefore be perſwaded to wait a while longer on the Parliament for the accompliſhment of our longing deſires in the ſetling of Church Diſcipline, and pray earneſtly to God to ſteere their hearts and judgements aright in this work of higheſt concernment to us; for fear they ſhould now ſettle any thing in haſte, which they and we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after repent of by leiſure.

            <p>Secondly, theſe foure Queſtions have been conceived and reported to be, <hi>a grand obstruction to the work of Reformation and ſettlement of Church-Diſcipline, yea purpoſely publiſhed to obstruct it:</hi> When as intentionally and really they doe (by moderating irreconcilable extreames) tend onely to facilitate and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite this much deſired work; which he cordially deſired might be ſpeedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, to prevent the dangerous encreaſe of Errours and Sciſmes, which multiply daily in our Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they are apprehended to ſtrike at the very root of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and abſolutely to deny it, in caſe of groſſe and ſcandalous ſinnes; when as it onely tends to remove thoſe ſandy foundations whereon ſome would build it, to prevent and regulate all probable abuſes of it in its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſtabliſhment, and confine it to its due bounds, <hi>to prevent,</hi> as farre as poſſible might be, <hi>al juſt ſcandall and prophanation of holy things in the people, and Arbitrary Government, Tyranny, Oppreſſion, and Lording it over Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Heritage and mens conſciences, in the Ministers and Presbitery,</hi> as the expreſſe words thereof demonſtrate.</p>

            <p>Theſe Agreements on both ſides premiſed, which will in a manner deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the greateſt controverſie, and rectifie the miſtakes between us; I proceed to the matters in difference; which are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether there he any precept or preſident in Scripture, for the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of any Member of a particular Church or Congregation, from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper only, who is not at the ſame time excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and utterly ſequeſtred from the Church, the ſociety of the faithfull, and all other publike Ordinances there uſed, as Prayer, Preaching, Faſting, Catechizing, ſinging of Pſalmes, and the like? And whether the <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 21. 14 15. Deut. 23. 1 2, 3. 1 Cor. 5. 7 to 13. Joh. 9. 22 32, 3. 3. ch: 12. 42. c. 16. 2. 2 Theſ. 3. 14. 2 John 10. 11. 3 John 10. Rom. 16. 17.

               <hi>Texts</hi> of the old or new Teſtament, quoted in the firſt Queſtion, and in the Margin here, warrant any ſuch partiall excommunication or ſuſpenſion from the Lords Table, but not from preaching the Word, and other publike Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? This I poſitively deny, from the pregnancy and words of theſe Texts of Scripture, backed by the judgement and practice of Antiquity in the pureſt times, as I ſhall prove at large anon: Neither hath the Author of the <hi>Antidote againſt four dangerous Questions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor the Reverend <hi>Preacher</hi> in his Sermon at St. <hi>Margarets before the Commons Houſe</hi> (who undertook to refute them) produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one dram of Scripture or ſolid reaſon to refute it, the latter not ſo much as taking notice of this Queſtion (the onely thing there controverted) but utterly miſtaking it, whiles he charged the Queſtioniſt with miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether Matth. 18. 16, 17. <hi>If thy brother trespaſſe againſt thee, &amp;c. tell it to the Church,</hi> &amp;c. be properly meant of excommunication of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion from the Sacrament? The Oppoſites affirme; I deny it.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon they have rendred in Preſſe or Pulpit, why this text ſhould and muſt be intended of a ſentence of excommunication given by the Church, is, becauſe the text ſaith, <hi>let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is, as one quite caſt out of the Church, which muſt be only by excomunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby men are caſt out of it; no private chriſtian (as they affirme) having any authority to eſteem his brother, <hi>as a heathen and publican,</hi> if the Church hath not firſt caſt him out; for then he may eſteem one man of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus, and after that another, and ſo all the Membets of it, and at laſt, the whole Church by degrees, by his owne authority; which to doe, ſay they, is a great abſurdity, ſinne and inconvenience: But this reaſon (under correction) is very infirme, inconcludent, if not falſe and abſurd: For firſt, Heathens were no excommunicate perſons, being never Members of the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church, and therefore uncapable of any excomunication out of it: Excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication being peculiar only to Church-members, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Aretius</hi> in his definition of Excomunication, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt Queſtion: And as for <hi>Publicans,</hi> if they were not heathens but

            <p>Some of our Oppoſites peremptorily affirme it, but produce no ſhadow of proofe for it; others ſpeak dubiouſly of theſe Texts, as needing a large debate, and therefore prudently wave them with a rhetoricall preterition, as the late Reverend Preacher did: I for my part humbly conceive, that <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Satan,</hi> is a thing ſomewhat different from excommunication and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion from the Lords Table: My reaſons are theſe:</p>

            <p>The firſt is, either to deliver up a man corporally, by way of puniſhment, into the actuall poſſeſſion of the Devill, onely in reſpect of his body, not ſoule, ſo as the Devill thereby might actually poſſeſſe, macerate, <hi>torment and afflict his fleſh</hi> (as he <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 15 22.

            <p>This kind of delivering men over to ſatan was peculiar onely to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſome others in that age, but ceaſed ſince, and ſo cannot be drawne into practice among us; A godly Chriſtian by way of puniſhment may be for a ſeaſon thus delivered unto ſatan, for the mortifying or deſtruction of his fleſh and carnall corruptions, and yet ſtill continue a true child of God in reſpect of his ſoule and ſpirit, <note n="p" place="margin">John 14. 16. 1 Cor. 6. 19.

            <p>Secondly, there is another ſort of delivering men up to ſatan, ſomewhat different from the former, which ſuits very well with the words and ſenſe of theſe Scriptures; and that is, when a man by Gods immediate permiſſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto ſatan to be tortured, afflicted and vexed by him; either in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by ſickneſſes, botches, diſeaſes; or in his mind, by cares, feares, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and diſcontents; or in his eſtate and family, by loſſes and croſſes of all ſorts, as <note n="q" place="margin">Job c. &amp; 2.

               </note>
               <hi>Job</hi> was, of purpoſe to mortifie his fleſh and carnall members, to humble his ſoule and bodie before God, that his ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord, his ſinfull life reformed, and he hereby leſſoned, no more to blaſpheme or diſhonour God: In this ſenſe God many times delivers over his children (as he did <hi>Job)</hi> into their Adverſary, ſatans hands, to ſcowre away all their droſſe, and crucifie their old man, the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof, without giving their hearts and ſpirits into his power, which he ſtill reſerves intirely to himſelfe, as he did <hi>lob's;</hi> and theirs <hi>whom the Devill caſt into priſon, and into tribulation for ten dayes,</hi> that <hi>they might be purifid, and have their robes of corruption waſhed quite away, and made white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> Revel. 2. 10. chap. 7. 14. And in this ſenſe (no doubt) the Apoſtles by Gods permiſſion, had power to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men over to ſatan, (one of whoſe <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7</note>
               <hi>Meſſengers Paul had ſent to buffet and humble him, leaſt he ſhould be exalted above his due meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> for the deſtruction of the fleſh. But how farre the Church or Miniſters of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123446:10"/>
God have any authority at this day actually to deliver any ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus to ſatan (unleſſe it be by way of prayer or option) I ſubmit to others, who now claime this power, to determine: However, in theſe two laſt ſenſes (which I conceive moſt genuine) theſe Texts are no ſolid proofes at all, either of excommunication from the Church, or ſuſpenſion from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſince a Chriſtian may be delivered over to ſatan in both theſe ſenſes, and yet not actually excommnicated or ſuſpended from the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The fourth difference is this, Whether 1 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some Oppoſites confidently averre; others, with my ſelfe deny it; and that upon theſe grounds:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe there is not one ſillable of receiving the Lords Supper, or eating at the Lords Table ſpoken of in this chapter; and in the 10. and 11. chapters, where the Apoſtle profeſſedly treats of the Lords Supper, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Sacrament, he ſpeakes not one word of ſecluding any members of the Church, or Chriſtians from it, but onely exhorts men carefully to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves before they come to receive it, leaſt they eat and drink their owne damnation, become guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and draw downe ſickneſſes and diſeaſes upon themſelves; affirming expreſly, ch. 10. ver. 16, 17. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? for we being many, are one bread and one body; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>were then partakers of this bread,</hi> certainly none were excluded from it in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; but as the <hi>Iſraelites under the Law, did</hi> ALL <hi>eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and</hi> ALL <hi>drink the ſame ſpirti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all drinke, though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>God were displeaſed with many of them, who were idolaters, tempters of God, fornicators, murmurers, and were destroyed in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 1. to 12. ſo all under the Goſpell who were viſible Members of the Church of Corinth, did eat and drink the Lords Supper, to which ſome <hi>drunkards</hi> whiles <hi>drunken</hi> did then reſort, as is cleere by the 1 Cor. 11. 20, 21. which <hi>Paul</hi> indeed reprehends, verſe 22. Therefore this, <hi>with ſuch a one no not to eat,</hi> cannot be meant of excommunication or ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Sacrameut.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we look upon the catalogue of thoſe with whom the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians were forbidden ſo much as to eat, we ſhall find <hi>railers, covetous perſons,</hi> and <hi>extortioners</hi> therein mentioned, as well as <hi>idolaters, fornicators, drunkards;</hi> and if all ſuch muſt be excommunicated or ſuſpended the Sacrament, what will become of moſt of our Anabaptiſticall and Independent Congregations, who are generally knowne to abound more with <hi>covetous perſons, extortioners, railers,</hi> then our Parochiall or Presbyteriall Congregations do with <hi>idolaters, fornicators, drunkards?</hi> I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feare their Independent Conventicles and chamber Congregations will be diſſolved for want of members, of Miniſters, and their Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tables be left empty without Gueſts, if all <hi>railers, covetous perſons and extortioners</hi> were excommunicated out of them, and this their pretended diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123446:11"/>
put into exact execution; yea, I fear, too <hi>many Presbyterian Miniſters, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who would be very active in excommunicating, ſuſpending others from the Sacrament for <hi>fornication, idolatry, drunkenneſſe,</hi> muſt themſelves be firſt excommunicated from the Lords Table for their owne <hi>covetouſneſſe;</hi> Wherefore <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 7. 3, 4, 5</note>
               <hi>let ſuch pull that beame out of their owne eye,</hi> before they paſſe the ſentence of excommunication and ſuſpenſion <hi>for the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, it is as cleere as the noon-day Sunne, that, <hi>no not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to eat,</hi> in this Text, is no more, then not to keep company, or hold civill familiarity with ſuch: Firſt, by <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11. <hi>I wrote to you in an Epiſtle,</hi> NOT TO KEEPE COMPANY <hi>with fornicators, &amp;c. yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, &amp;c. for then ye muſt goe out of the world; (as thoſe muſt doe who would have unmixt churches and communions without any putred members:) But now have I written unto you,</hi> NOT TO KEEP COMPANY: <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, &amp;c. with ſuch a one</hi> NO NOT TO EAT: By which it is moſt cleer, that, <hi>no not to eat with ſuch,</hi> is nothing elſe, but <note n="*" place="margin">See Primaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But our Oppoſites object, that though this Text be not directly meant of excommunication or ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, yet it warrants ſuch mens ſuſpenſion from tht Lords Supper by neceſſary conſequence: For if we

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that the Argument is meerly ſophiſticall, fallacious, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly any formal Argument from the leſſe to the greater, becauſe itvaries in the kind of eating; the one being civill, the other ſpirituall; the one private in ones own houſe, or anothers, where he hath abſolute freedome or liberty to eat, or not to eat with another; the other pulik in the Church, where he hath a divine command, neceſſitating him to communicate with others of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in the Sacrament, as well as in other Ordinances. Every Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the leſſe to the greater that is concluſive, muſt have ſundry qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications to make it ſolid: I will inſtance but in three. Firſt, it muſt be in the ſame kind of action; Secondly, it muſt fall under the ſame precept; Thirdly, it muſt be within the compaſſe of the ſame power: If either of theſe faile, the Argument is a meere Inconſequent. For inſtance, This is a ſolid Argument; Men ought to abſtaine from the ſmalleſt ſinnes; Ergo, much more from the greateſt ſins; becauſe this holds ſtill to the ſame kind [ſinne] and abſtaining from the greateſt ſins, fals under the ſame precept which forbids the leaſt; So this is a firme Argument; He that can make a little Watch or ball can likewiſe make one ſomewhat greater, becauſe it in the ſame kind of manufacture, and both of them within the virge of the Artificers skil: But on the contrary, theſe <note place="margin">Ro. 12. 18, 19.</note>inferences are unſound and inconcludent: <hi>A man muſt not keep company with an angry man,</hi> Prov. 22. 24.

Therefore it is unlawfull for any Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to recompence evill for evill, or inflict the higheſt degree of Vengeance on Malefactors, even death and capitall puniſhments; is a meet Nonſequitur; becauſe this publike revenge by way of juſtice, fals not under the ſame precept with privat reveng: So, ſuch a workman is able to make a boat or ditch, which is the leſſe; <hi>ergo,</hi> he is able to build a Ship or Fort, which is the greater, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent, becauſe they fal not under the ſelf-ſame degree of art &amp; ability: To apply this to the objected text; Not eating with ſcandalous perſons at meales in private, differs in manner, kind from eating with them at the Lords Table in publike; they fal not both under the ſelf-ſame precept; and we have free power not to eat bread with thoſe at our own Tables, with whom we have no power or liberty left us by Chriſt, to refuſe to eat with them at the Lords Table: Therefore this Argument, in point of Logicke and Divinity, is as infirme and abſurd, as any of the former: Yet how many thouſands, as well Schollers as Ignorants, have been over-reached with it, ſo far as to make them ſeparate, not onely from our Sacraments but Congregations too?</p>

            <p>Firſt, it is cleere, that this Text is ment onely of civill converſation, eating and drinking, not of ſpiritual, as I have already proved: I would then demand theſe two Queſtions of the Objectors: Firſt, whether this Text prohibits all kind of civill communion, and <hi>eating at Table with any Chriſtians who are raylers, fornicators, idolaters, covetous perſons, extortioners or drunkards,</hi> under paine of mortall ſinne? If yea; then it is a damnable ſinne in the Objectors to eat, drink, or converſe in any kind with any ſuch as theſe, which they daily doe without any ſcruple, and cannot avoyd; yea, then it would be a ſin againſt this Text, for a wife, child, kinſman, Maſter, Magiſtrate, Prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to convers or eat with ſuch a ſcandalous husband, parent, kinſman, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, neighbour, Paſtor, fellowſervant, Subject, or they reciprocally with them, if ſcandalous; then if any Member of the Parliament, or of any Corporation, Colledge, Innes of Court, or the like, ſhould but eat together at meales with his fellow-members who are thus ſcandalous, in any Common-Hall, or at any Ordinary or Corporation-feaſt, they ſhould ſin againſt this Text, which I never yet heard any Anabaptiſt, Separatiſt, Independent, Presbyter, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine affirm; neither of which make any conſcience of not repairing to the Lord Majors, or any other publike City-feaſt, where they are ſure of good fare, becauſe they were certaine there to meet and eat with ſome <hi>covetous,</hi> or other ſeandalous perſons; with whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prohibits them, <hi>no not to eat:</hi> Which precept Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles ſhould have tranſgreſſed, <hi>in</hi>

Rev. 22. 17.) in ſuch caſes wherein we may lawfully eat &amp; drink with them at our own, theirs, or other mens Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Secondly, our Objectors themſelves affirme, that it is lawful to hear, pray, read the Scriptures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them; then why not likewiſe in the Lords Supper too? ſince this Text and all others cited for proofe of excommunication or ſuſpenſion by our Oppoſites, prohibit communion in them al alike, or elſ in none. Thirdly, admit Miniſters themſelves be polluted with any of thoſe Vices, ſuppoſe with <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> (as too many are,) yet none of the Objectors dare averre, that it is a ſinne againſt this precept, for any of their Congregations to receive the Sacrament from, or eat the Lords Supper with them, no more then to joyne with them in prayer, faſting, or to heare them read, preach, catechize, expound, or ſing Pſalmes together with them; ſince the goodneſſe or viciouſneſſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (as <note n="t" place="margin">

Fourthly, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors grant, that a Chriſtian may lawfully receive the Sacrament with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſecretly guilty of theſe and other groſſe ſinnes, with cloſe Hypocrits, who guild over their vices; and unregenerate Chriſtians not really ſanctified, who are neither ignorant nor notoriouſly ſcandalous in their lives, without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or offence againſt this Text. Therefore they may lawfully doe it in point of conſcience with ſuch who are notoriouſly ſcandalous, before their actuall conviction &amp; excommunication, eſpecially if they profeſſe ſincere repentance for their ſins paſt, and reformation of their lives for time to come; as all do, at leaſt in their general confeſſions before the Sacrament, if not in their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditations, prayers &amp; preparatory devotions twixt God and their owne ſoules. Fifthly, it is not the meere guilt, but onely the ſcandall, ill example, and contagion of notorious ſinnes that ſubjects men to the cenſure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, in regard of others, <hi>leaſt they ſhould infect and draw them on to imitation of them,</hi> as Paul reſolves, 1 Cor. 5. 6. elſe thoſe very ſins which are not notorious, and thoſe infirmities, of which the beſt Saints themſelves are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guilty, ſhould ſubject them unto excommunication, or ſuſpend them from the Sacrament; and then what mortall man almoſt ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it?

Sixtly, the Objectors will grant, that there is a neceſſity lyes upon Miniſters to adminiſter, and on people to receive the Sacrament at all convenient ſeaſons: That God onely infallibly knowes the hearts and reall preparations of all Communicants, in the very beſt of whom there are many failing and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which make them in themſelves unworthy to communicate: That all who come to receive, doe alwayes make a generall and joynt confeſſion of their ſins before God and the Congregation, acknowledging and bewayling their manifold ſinnes and iniquities, which they from time to time have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in thought, word and deed, againſt the Divine Majeſty; proſeſſing, that they doe earneſtly repent, and are heartily ſorry for all their miſdoings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123446:13"/>
that the remembrance of them is grievous unto them, the burthen of them intolerable; deſiring God to have mercy upon them for his Sonne Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſake, and to for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing Sacrifice acceptable unto God through Jeſus Chriſt: Yea, I dare preſume, there is no Receiver ſo deſperate, that dares profeſſe when he comes to receive, he is not heartily ſorow for his ſinnes paſt, but reſolvs to perſevere impenitently in them for the future, though afterward he relapſe into them (as the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Saints do to their old infirmities) becauſe his heart nature are not truly regenerated by Gods Spirit: All this being granted, no Miniſter ought to refuſe the Sacrament to ſuch an external penitent ſinner (the ſincerity of whoſe heart and repentance, God onely knows) nor may or ought any Chriſtian to abſtaine from communicating with him at it, in caſe he be not actually excommunicated, or not re-admitted to the Church for his prophane, ſcandalous life, ſince they have no warrant from this or any other Scripture elſe to doe it. All which, if ſeriouſly pondered, by Separatiſts and Independents, miſled by the objected inference, would ſpeedily reduce them to the boſome of our Church, and quite allay the heat of the preſent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, in which many now place <hi>The very Kingdome of Chriſt,</hi> who never claimed nor exerciſed ſuch a ſoveraignty as they, under his name and title, would uſurp unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth thing in difference is, Whether the Prieſts under the Law had divine authority to keepe backe any circumciſed perſon from the Paſſeover, who deſired to eat it, for any reall or pretended ignorance, hereſie, or ſcandalous ſinne? My oppoſites affirme they had; for proofe whereof they produce Num. 9. 1. to 12. <hi>Where the Iſraelites being commanded to eat the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth at evening, there were certaine men defiled by the dead body of man, that they could not keep the Paſſeover on that day; and they came before Moſes and Aaron on that day, and ſaid unto Moſes, we are de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>Family where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to eat the Paſſover, as ver. 6, 7. imports. And the true reaſon in this Text, why his uncleanneſſe did ſeclude him from eating the Paſſover, was, <hi>becauſe it quite excluded him out of the Camp for a time,</hi> (not Tabernacle or Temple) and ſo by neceſſary conſequence, from the Houſe wherein he was to eat the Paſſeover, as is evident by Levit. 14. 3. 8. chap. 16. 26, 27, 28. Num. 5. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4. chap. 12. 14, 15. chap. 19. 7. 11. chap. 31. 19. 20. 24. Deut. 23. 10, 11. And by like reaſon it debarred him from all other Ordinances, as well as it; So that all you can probably inferre from this Text, is but this, which none will contradict: that prophane, ſcandalous perſons juſtly excommunicated, and ſhut out of the Church, ought not to receive the Sacrament, nor partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in any other Ordinance, during their excommunication, till their re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Church; as the uncleane Iſraelite could not eat the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, nor be preſent at any other publike Ordinance or ſacrifice, till his re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Camp. Fourthly, here is a direct reſolution of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in poſitive tearmes, preſcribing a ſuſpenſion from the Paſſover in caſe of preſent legall pollution onely, not ſpirituall; yet expreſly enjoyning the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame perſon under the ſevereſt penalty, to eat it the very next moneth after; but there is no ſuch punctuall reſolution in the old or new Teſtament, to warrant a like ſuſpenſion of any from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in caſe of ſcandall or ſpirituall uncleanneſſe, unleſſe he be firſt legally excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, nor can any Miniſter or Claſſis debar him juſtly from it by any colour or inference from this text, if he be deſirous to receive it; any longer then for one moneth. Fifthly, this argument for ſuſpending men from the Lords Table for ſpirituall uncleanneſſe, becauſe ſome were ſuſpended from the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over for legall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uncleanneſſe, but not for ſpirituall, is no way concluſive; Firſt, becauſe the Paſſeover and Lords Supper, ceremoniall and ſpirituall pollution differ in kind: Secondly, becauſe ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123446:14"/>
for ſpirituall uncleanneſſe, fals not at all under this temporary precept, of ſuſpenſion from the Paſſeover, onely for legall uncleanneſſe; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man was kept from the Paſſeover by colour thereof, for any ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pollution, but onely for ceremoniall uncleannes; therefore much leſſe can any be ſuſpended by color of it from the Sacrament, to which it hath no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Thirdly, there is a direct divine warrant for the one, but not for the other; wherefore we may juſtly reject the objected argument as erronious and fallacious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to the latter part of the Objection; that none might offer ſo much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Treſpaſſe-offering for ſinne, without a particular private confeſſion of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſinne (to God, not to the Prieſt;) Ergo, he might not eat the Paſſover (nor any now the Sacrament) if he were a ſcandalous ſinner, without a particular pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeſſion and repentance of his ſcandalous ſinnes.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that it is a meer Non-ſequitur, becauſe, Firſt, directly contradicted by 1 Cor. 10. 1. to 12. as the premiſes manifeſt: Secondly, becauſe a particular examination of the conſcience and repentance for ſin, is no where required in Scripure of ſuch who did eat the Paſover, though all circumſtances &amp; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the worthy eating of it be moſt punctually enumerated, Exod. 12. Num. 9. Deut. 16. Neither was there any ſuch reaſon why God ſhould require ſuch a confeſſion of ſinne in thoſe who were to eat the Paſſeover, as he expreſly exacts from thoſe who came to offer a Sin-offering to him, only of ſet purpoſe <hi>to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſuch a perſon, nor yet any ſuch power from the Church or ſtate. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Communicant is to examine himſelfe and his owne conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God &amp; him, whether he be fit to receive the ſacrament or not, and to be the judge of his owne heart, which no other can ſo truly diſcerne as himſelfe, 1 Cor. 11. 28. 31. 2 Cor. 13. 6. Gal. 6. 4. 5. Jer. 17. 9. 1 Cor. 2. 11. And if he judge himſelfe fitly prepared, joynes with others in the publike confeſſion of his ſinnes, and promiſeth newneſſe of life, the Miniſter ought in point of charity to deem him ſo, and hath no commiſſion from Chriſt to exclude him; When Chriſt himſelfe inſtituted and adminiſtred this ſacrament, we read not of any exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation made by him of his Diſciples fitneſſe or preparedneſſe to receive it; nor yet of <hi>Paul</hi> or any other Apoſtle or Miniſter in the new Teſtament, that made any ſuch particular ſcrutiny into other Communicants conſciences to try their fitneſſe or unfitneſſe, as ſome now magiſterially take upon them to make by way of juriſdiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not advice, derived originally from Popiſh tyranny, and their exploded practice of Auricular confeſſion to a Prieſt, before the receiving of the ſacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: All the power they claimed or exerciſed in this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Councell; <hi>Let a man therefore examine himſelfe,</hi> not others, or others him (ſay all old and new Expoſitors on the Text.)

Fourthly, becauſe he adminiſters the ſacrament to him as to a perſon outwardly fitted and prepared, the inward preparation of whoſe heart, for ought he knowes may be ſincere towards God, &amp; really changed from what it was before. Fifthly, becauſe the adminiſtration of the ſacrament is an holy lawfull action, and Gods Ordinan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Seventhly, becauſe all our Oppoſites accord, that Miniſters may and ought to admiſter the ſacrament to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Hypocrites, and unregenerate civill morall Chriſtians, who live not in open ſcandalous ſinners, though theſe for want of faith and ſincere repentance doe all eat and drink judgement to themſelves as well as ſcandalous open ſinners: Yea, moſt of them acknowledge, that if the Claſſis or Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I would then demand of my Antagoniſts, whether in this caſe the Miniſter be guilty of theſe receivers ſinnes and unworthy receiving? or whether their ſimilitude of a Cup of poyſon holds in ſuch a caſe? If yea then why wil they thus inforce them to commit a ſin againſt their conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ninthly, becauſe the Miniſter in adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, as well in thoſe that periſh by it, as in thoſe that are ſaved and benefitted by it, as he is in preaching the Goſpell; God having appointed it ſecondarily and contingently (as well as his Word) to be a means of aggravating mens ſins and condemnation, to magnifie his juſtice, as well as an inſtrument of grace and ſalvation to magnifie his mercy, 1 Cor. 11. 25. to 30. Finally, the holy Ghoſt himſelfe expreſly reſolves in poſitive tearms, that he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damnation or <hi>judgment</hi> TO HIMSELFE (not to the Miniſter or other Communicants,) and drawes guilt, judgements onely upon himſelfe, <hi>verſe</hi> 27, 30, 31.

            <p>As for the much preſſed ſimilitude of a cup of poyſon, which hath delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many, it is but a meere fallacy, and differs in many particulars from the Cup in the Lords Supper: For firſt, the Cup in the Lords Supper is no poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it ſelfe, neither can any Miniſter certainly determine, that it will prove poyſon to the ſoule of any one par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Heb. 6. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Now whereas they object, that the admiſſion of unexcommunicated wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcandalous perſons to the Sacrament, is more then an arbitrary, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Papall domineering over the conſciences of Miniſters, Elders, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people: it's a meere untruth and ſcandalous aſſertion, as all the premiſes demonſtrate; never affirmed by any Claſſicke Author till this age; and though a real errour in many conſciencious perſons who beleeve it as a truth, yet I fear &amp;p artly know, that many who now object &amp; urge it, do not cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beleev it as a truth, but rather make uſe of it as a received error the more eaſily to uſurp unto themſelves a meere arbitrary, if not tyrannicall authority over their Congregations conſciences, and Gods Ordinances, in admitting to, excluding from them whom they pleaſe: the very extremity of that arbitrary, Epiſcopall, Papall power, which we ſolemnly vow againſt in our Nationall Covenant, and have taken up arms againſt in the field: And ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this grand difference, the importance whereof hath made me more prolix and copious.</p>
            <p>The eighth thing in controverſie is, Whether Miniſters may not as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to preach the Word to ſuch unexcommunicated groſſe impenitent, ſcandalous Chriſtians, whom they would ſuſpend from the Sacrament, for feare of partaking with them in, and being guilty of their ſinnes, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament to them? ſince their unprofitable hearing of the Word, is every wayes as dangerous, as damning a ſinne to their ſoules, as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer to this latter clauſe, wherein the difference is pretended: Firſt, that the Miniſter doth as certainly know, that if he preach the Word to obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſcandalous, impenitent ſinners, he doth but preach damnation to them in his Sermons, as that he doth give damnation to them in the Sacrament <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Thirdly, the very receiving of the Sacrament, even in unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is for the moſt part accompanied with ſuch particulars, as are moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to convert &amp; beget grace in mens hearts: As firſt, with a previous exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerious examination of their own hearts and eſtates, between God &amp; their owne conſciences, for which there are divers pious rules and directions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in printed books of devotion, which moſt Communicants ordinarily read and make uſe of before their reſort to the Lords Table. Secondly, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſearching out of all their open or ſecret ſinnes and corruptions, paſt or preſent, accompanied with a ſerious, particular, private confeſſion of them, a hearty contrition and humiliation for them, private prayers to God for pardon of, yea power and ſtrength againſt them; ſecret purpoſes, Vowes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:123446:27"/>
and reſolutions for ever to relinquiſh, war, ſtrive, fight againſt them, and avoid all occaſions which may enſnare them in them. Thirdly, ſundry pious, ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhing meditations, both in regard of their ſinnes, Gods mercy and juſtice, Chriſts merits, death, paſſion, the end and uſe of the Sacraments, &amp;c. which make deep temporary impreſſions on their hearts, ſpirits, and work an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary change both in their reſolutions, minds, ſpirits, converſations for the preſent, and many times for the future. Fourthly, flexanimous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations; admonitions, comminations, directions, prayers by the Miniſters in the Congregation, before, in, &amp; after this duty, which operate, penetrate more upon Sacrament-dayes, upon Communicants of all ſorts (as experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts) then at other ſeaſons. Now whether the receiving of this Sacrament, uſually accompanied, and ſet on upon mens ſpirits, with ſuch moſt effectuall powerfull, likely meanes of converſion, be not a moſt apt and proper Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to regenerate, reclaime, convert ungodly, ſcandalous ſinners, and more likely to regenerate and change their hearts, lives, then the bare Word preached, or any other Ordinance, at leaſt wiſe more effectuall to convert and amend them, then any rigorous ſuſpenſions of them from the Sacrament, let every mans conſcience and experience judge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, all our Antagoniſts accord, that we have a more immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and communion with God and Chriſt in this Sacrament, then in any other Ordinance whatſoever, where in the outward elements we behold Chriſts death and paſſion viſibly repreſented to our eyes, and by them unto our hearts, and more lively, more particularly applyed, and the remiſſion of our ſins more ſenſibly ſealed to us then in any other Ordinance; from whence I thus infallibly conclude againſt theſe Oppoſites:</p>
            <p>That Ordinance wherein we moſt immediatly converſe with God and Chriſt, and have more intimate viſible, ſenſible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them then in any other, is certainly the moſt powerfull and effectuall Ordinance of all othecs, to humble, regenerate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve t, and beget true grace within us, and moſt probable converting Ordinance of all others; becauſe the manifeſtation, revelation and proximity of God and Chriſt to the ſoule, is that which doth moſt of all humble and convert it, as is evident by <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 38. to 41. compared with chap. 42. 1. to 7. Iſa. 6. 1. to 9. Luke 5. 7, 8, 9. Pſal. 148. 14. Iſa. 55. 6. Zeph. 3. 2. Hab. 10. 21. Eph. 2. 13. 17. James 4. 8.</p>
            <p>But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper by our Antagoniſts own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is ſuch: Ergo, it is a converting, as well as a confirming Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, what is it that makes the Word it ſelfe a converting Ordinance? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it not the particular revelation and application of the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, of Chriſts merits, death and paſſion to the ſoule, by Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not the meere outward voyce or ſound? 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24. chap. 2. 2. to 6.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:123446:27"/>
If ſo, as all muſt grant, then certainly this Sacrament, which by our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts confeſſion, doh moſt particularly, fully, lively, effectually, and ſenſibly apply the promiſes, yea, the death, paſſion and merits of Chriſt unto every Communicants eyes, eares, heart and ſoule, far livelier then the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doth, 1 Cor. 11. 14. to 30. Gal. 3. 2. muſt be a converting Ordinance, and not a meere conſirming ordinance, as they pretend.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, all grant, that God doth as effectually teach, convert &amp; work grace by the eye, as eare; For firſt, the very book of nature and contemplation <hi>of the creatures inſtruct us, that there is an inviſible God, &amp; is enough to leav men without excuſe, and through Gods bleſſing ſufficient to raiſe up excellent meditations tending both to ſanctification and converſion,</hi> Pſal. 8. 3. to 9.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the externall Sacrifices of the old Law, together with the Sacraments of Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, did inſtruct and teach Gods people who participated of them, or were preſent at them, by the eye, and were both edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and converting Ordinances, as well as confirming, as all doe and muſt acknowledge. Thirdly, the ſeverall <hi>Miracles</hi> of the Prophets under the Law, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles <hi>under the Gospell (which converted thouſands</hi> without preaching) <hi>did convert and regenerate men by the eye without the eare; the very ſight of the Miracles being the ground and cauſe of their converſion and beleeving,</hi> John 2. 11. 23. chap. 3. 2. chap. 4. 52, 53, 54. chap. 6. 2. 26. ch. 7. 31. chap. 16. 41. 4. chap. 12. 18. 19. chap. 11. 45, 47, 48.

And yet that ſuch is his ſuparlative goodneſſe, mercy, pity, that forgetting all theſe indignities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, he heales us by thoſe his very wounds which we have made, and waſheth away our ſinnes in that very blood of his, which we have ſhed. No meditation comparable to this, to reclaime ah obſtinate ſinner, mollifie an adamantine heart, humble a proud ſpirit, reforme a ſinfull life, regenerate and convert a carnall heart. And is not this moſt paſſionately, lively, really and effectually repreſented to our eyes, hearts, in this very Sacrament, in a more powerfull prevailing manner then in the Word alone? And can any then deny it, to be as converting, yea a more humbling, regenerating, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance then the Word, which is likewiſe commonly joyned with it? Doubtleſſe if this Sacrament be not a converting Ordinance in this regard, I know not any which can be ſo reputed.</p>

            <p>Ninthly, that Ordinance whoſe unworthy participation is a meanes of our ſpirituall obduration, muſt, by the rule of contraries, when worthily received, be the inſtrument of our mortification, converſion, ſalvation; But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving the Sacrament, is a meanes of our ſpirituall <hi>obduration and damnation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 29.

Now I beſeech my Antagoniſts to informe me, how it is poſſible that a Sacrament ordained for ſuch and ſo many ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ends, (every one of which is moſt powerfull to operate upon the flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeſt heart and obdurateſt ſpirit) ſhould not in all theſe regards, both in Gods intention and Chriſts ordination, be a converting, as well as a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ordinance; ſince that which doth ſeal all theſe particulars to mens ſoules, and repreſent them to their ſaddeſt thoughts, muſt needs more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade, pierce, melt, relent, convert an obdurate heart and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinner, then the Word it ſelf, when but nakedly Preached, which comes not with ſuch advantages upon impenitent hearts, as this Sacrament doth in all theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, I would but demand of the oppoſites, what true converſion is? Is it not a ſincere univerſall turning of the whole frame of a Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward man, from the love and ſervice of the world, fleſh, devill, ſin, unto the cordiall love, ſervice, obedience of God in Chriſt? And is there any Ordinance, engine, inſtrument, ſo probable, ſo prevalent to effect it as this Sacrament, in all the forecited reſpects? certainly none at all.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, (to ſpend no more arguments in ſo cleere a caſe) I appeale to every Chriſtians conſcience; whether their own experience will not aſcertaine them, that the Sacrament is a converting ordinance, turning their hearts from the power and love of ſin, to the ſervice, love of God and Chriſt; and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them againſt their corruptions; temptations, as well, as much as the Word, if not far more. And cannot many thouſands of converted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans experimentally affirme, that their preparations and approaches to this holy Sacrament, were the firſt effectuall meanes of their converſion, yea that they had not been converted, had they beene debarred from it for their former ſcandalous lives? For ſhame therefore diſclaim this abſurd irreligious paradox, for which there is not the leaſt ſhadow of Scripture, or ſolid reaſon.</p>
            <p>If then the Sacrament be a converting as well as a ſealing ordinance; then queſtionleſſe no unexcommunicated ſcandalous perſon, who is fit to heare the Word, and joyne in any other converting ordinances, as Faſting, Prayer, &amp;c. ought to be debarred from this, it being one of the moſt effectuall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall meanes which Chriſt himſelfe <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 11. 28 Iſa. 55. 1, 2.

Will you then adventure to detaine it, nay plead you muſt of neceſſity, under paine of mortall ſin and damnation to your ſelves, deny it unto thoſe who need it moſt and earneſtly cry out for it, becauſe it may poſſibly, through their preſent indiſpoſition of ſpirit (which is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knowne to God, not you) prove dangerous or mortall totheir ſoules, when you deny it not to other civil carnal Chriſtians, to whom it is as deadly, as poyſonous every whit? Is any Parent or Maſter ſo unnatural or ſottiſh, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his children, ſervant wholſome meat, drink, to feed their bodyes, becauſe perhaps they may turne to crudities, diſeaſes (as they doe in many;) or becauſe they may poſſibly abuſe them to exceſſe and riot, and ſo quite ſtarve them for want of nouriſhment? And ſhall any Miniſters be ſo irrationall or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, as to deny the Sacramentall food and nouriſhment of mens ſoules unto them, onely becauſe poſſibly or probably they may receive them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily (as the beſt too often do) to the aggravation of their ſin or preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſo ſtarve their ſoules? Is any Phyſician ſo abſurd, as to deny his Patient the moſt prevailing Potion to recover him, becauſe peradvetture it may prove dangerous, as all other phyſick may and will doe, if the very beſt prove deadly? Suppoſe any ſoules you thus keep back, without good warrant from Chriſt himſelfe, ſhould deſpaire, dye, periſh for want of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall phyſick, cordiall, wilfully detained by you from them when deſired, would not their blood be required at your hands? It was an old generall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror among many in point of phiſick, which murdred thouſands, to deny drink to thoſe who were enflamed with burning-feavers, and earneſtly cried out for it to quench their thirſt, for feare of encreaſing their feavers violence, which in truth it would have allayed, extinguiſhed, if taken; and therefore Phyſicians of late have corrected this deadly miſtake, by ſuffering ſuch to drinke freely when they pleaſe, to extinguiſh the unnaturall heat, that elſe would kill them, which hath ſaved many ſuch ſick perſons lives: I beſeech you ſuffer not this old errour in phyſick and Phyſicians to creep in among Divinity and Divines, in permitting them to deny the Lords Cup to ſuch fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Chriſtians, burning in the flames of ſinnes and luſts, who need it moſt to quench their flames, and cry unto you for it; out of a fond conceit that it will prove poyſon to them; wheras you cannot deny but that it will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and for ought you certainly know, may through Gods bleſſing, eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prove the moſt effectuall meanes for their health and recovery, and not of their deſtruction.

            </p>
            <p>And thus much for their ſeverall evaſions of my third Quere, in which I have been more prolix, becauſe it is the very foundation of all our Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts miſtakes and errours in this controverſie.</p>
            <p>Onely this I ſhall adde for a concluſion; That if all excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought by the law of God to be admitted to the preaching of the Word, but not to Chriſts Supper; as the Antagoniſts determiue: Then by their owne confeſſions and practice it wil inevitably follow, there is no abſolute exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication at all by any divine inſtitution left by Chriſt unto his Church; ſince perſons admitted freely to communicate every day with the Saints and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the ordinary hearing of the Word and prayer, are really unexcommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; it being a flat contradiction, to ſay they are excommunicated, when thus admitted to heare the Word, and to all other ordinances, but this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely. And thus by this very evaſion they yeeld up their cauſe ſo much contended for at this preſent.</p>
            <p>The ninth thing in debate is, Whether <hi>John</hi> 9. 21. 34, 35. The Jewes had agreed already, that if any man did confeſſe that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue: and they caſt him out (or excommunicated him, ſaith the Margin:) And c. 12. 42. Nevetheleſſe, a mong the chiefe Pieſts alſo many beleeved on him; but becauſe of the Phariſes, they did not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue: And c. 16. 2. They ſhall put you out of their Synagogues, &amp;c. be any good proofe at all, that excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or ſuſpention from the Sacrament are of divine inſtitution; or an ordinance of Chriſt which he hath left and perpetuated in his Chuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The doting</hi> Antidote-man <hi>affirmes it, page 1.</hi> And in the dayes of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>(writes he)</hi> excommunication out of the Sinagogue continued among the Jews, and our Saviour did not abrogate it, for the abuſe of it by the Priests, Scribes and Phariſes; but his Apostles under the Gospell did exerciſe it againſt <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when by profeſſed ſacriledge he declared himſelfe in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity <hi>(which I take to be no excommunication nor ſuſpenſion.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: firſt, That this putting men out of the Synagogue pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Jewes, was no divine inſtitution preſcribed or warranted by Gods Word; but onely a humane invention or puniſhment, introduced by the Jewes, or Jewiſh Sanhedrim, as the texts themſelues demonſtrate; and ſo no preſident to binde us Chriſtians. Secondly, this practice uſed by the Jewes in the objected tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, was ſo farre from being an ordinance of Chriſt, or approved by him, that it is a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e diabolicall inſtitution againſt Chriſt, and all who ſhould profeſſe him, who wee adjudged by the Jewes to be put out of the Sinagogue for this very cauſe (and no other that we read of) that they profeſſed Jeſus to be the Chriſt: And is this a fitting patterne of divine inſtitution for Chriſtians to imitate, or a ſufficient warrant to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:123446:30"/>
men from the Sacrament? Certainly if it be ſo, it is but in this reſpect; that as the Jewes would caſt men out of the Sinagogue, only for profeſſing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be the Chriſt; ſo you, in imitation of them, would keep off unexcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſcandalous Chriſtians from the Lords Table, that they might not there receive Chriſt tendred to them in this Sacrament, if they doe but deſire it.

               </note>other learned men; this caſting out of the Sinagogue, was <hi>no proper Eccleſiasticall, but onely a civill cenſure, whereby the party caſt out, was ſeparated from all company or ſociety with any man, or woman for the diſtance of four cubits onely at the pleaſure of the Judge,</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was certainly arbitrary, not divine) <hi>alſo from eating or drinking with any, from the uſe of the Marriage-bed, ſhaving, waſhing, and the like, according to the quality of the offence: It was of force forty dayes yet ſo, as that it might be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon repentance; he that was thus excommunicated, had power to be preſent at divine ſervice, to teach others, and learne of others; he hired ſervants, and was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, but alwayes on condition of keeping off four cubits diſtance from them.</hi> Therefore doubtleſſe it was meerly a civill exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication like to an <hi>oxtlary,</hi> not Eccleſiaſtical or Divine; ſince it ſuſpended none from any divine Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but civil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſation only. Fourthly, <hi>It was preſcribed, inflicted, not by the Prieſts or Eccleſiaſtical Claſſis, but by the temporal Magiſtrate,</hi> Ruler of the Sinagogue, <hi>Sanhedrim, or people,</hi> as the Texts demonſtrate, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (not Prieſts) were <note place="margin">

               </note> the actors in it. Fifthly, In the <hi>Jewiſh Sinagogues, there was neither Paſſeover nor Sacrament, nor ſacrifice celebrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all ſacrifices, Paſſeovers, feſtivals were celebrated in the Temple at Jeruſalem, in the place which God did chooſe, not in their Sinagogues where they had onely reading, expounding, preaching, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, prayer, but no ſacrifice, or ſacrament,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Godwin's</hi> Jewiſh Antiquities, l. 2. c. 1, 2. &amp; l. 3. c. 4. Therefore from this practice you can no wayes prove any ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, becauſe no Sacrament nor Sacrifice was then adminiſtred or offered in them by the Jewes: and if it prove ought for the uſe or divinity of excommunication, it is onely thus much, that excommunicated perſons caſt out of the Church muſt be ſuſpended from preaching, reading, prayer, and ſuch Ordinances then uſed in the Jewiſh Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, not from any Sacrifice or Sacrament which were appropriated to the Temple, to which thoſe who were caſt out of the Sinagogue might reſort: In brief, you may as well juſtifie exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication from <hi>Deotrophe</hi> as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence. <note place="margin">3 John 9, 10, 11.</note>

            <p>The tenth difference is, concerning the Scriptures quoted in the fourth Queſtion; whether I have rightly applied them? My Oppoſites ſay no, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on four miſtakes of theirs. Firſt, that they can infallibly know the hearts and preſent conditions of Communicants who have formerly lived ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly and impenitently in their ſinfull courſes, to be impenitent, obſtinate and wicked even at that very inſtant when they come to receive, though they publikely profeſſe their unfained ſorrow and repentance for all their ſinnes paſt, and ſolemnly promiſe, yea, vow amendment and newneſſe of life for ever after: which I affirme to be meere arogancy, and a uſurpation of Gods owne Tribunall, for any Miniſter or Claſſis peremptorily to determine, ſince
