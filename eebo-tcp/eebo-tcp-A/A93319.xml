            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Being caſt upon the Children of Light, given forth to Print
from one HENRY WALKER, which R: IBITSON
hath Printed, That they Deny the Reſurrection, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Hell, which are Lyes publiſhed to the Nation:
which Lyes R: WOOD hath alſo Printed. Therefore for
the truths ſake, and them that feare God, is this Paper given
forth, that the Lyes returne from whence they came, and
them that are given over to believe Lyes may receive them.
But the honeſt hearted regard them not, knowing the time
is coming, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The wicked ſhall fret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS <hi>Henry Walker</hi> gave in Lyes to the Printer, that two
QUAKERS which came to <hi>White-hall,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That there is no
ſuch place as Heaven and Hell:</hi> Thou <hi>Walker</hi> haſt miniſtred
forth thy Lyes; for hell Thou ſhalt find, which the wicked muſt
be turned into, and all Lyars; and Heaven is Gods Throne, and
the Scriptures in the Old and New Teſtament is a Declaration from the Spirit; and
God is the Word, and Chriſt Jeſus is the Light that lighteth every man that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world; and Thou who haſt made a ſcoffe at this, Thy folly is made manifeſt, and
Thy ſelfe declared to be a falſe Witneſſe, and brought Thy ſelfe upon Record; for <hi>John</hi>
ſaid, that, <hi>Chriſt was the true light that enlightneth every man that comes into the world;</hi>
at whoſe Doctrine Thou ſtumbles; and Thou ſhalt find a <hi>Reſurrection to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for Thy body to goe in, when that the Juſt ſhall witneſſe a raiſing to life: and
thy reward ſhall be according to Thy work, for many Lyes haſt Thou uttered forth in
Thy papers againſt the Children of the Light, and publiſhed to the Nation: But all that
feare God doth not Thee nor them regard. That in Thy Conſcience ſhall us remember
in Thy day of Thy calamity, that we to Thy ſoule are friends, though now to the world
it is thy work to ſpeak evill upon the Children of light, and render them odious to the
world. And <hi>R: Wood</hi> in Thy paper is many unſavoury ſpeeches againſt the Children of
light; who art ſeeking to juſtifie lyes, ſhewing thy ſelf to be one of the world, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h loveth
her owne, whoſe cuſtome is to utter lyes, whoſe Torment is beginning, and whoſe ill
ſmell and favour aſcends, becauſe the Sun is riſen: And Thou declareſt <hi>Walkers</hi> lyes
which he hath given forth againſt the Children of light, in Thy Book which is called
<hi>The Weekly Poſt,</hi> and haſt uttered forth Thy ſlanders and lyes againſt the Children of
light. And thoſe words Printed in thy Book, called, <hi>A Declaration of the Children of
Light,</hi> ſhall ſtand and witneſſe againſt thylyes, and a Hell Thou ſhall witneſſe who ſaid,
<hi>They ſaid there is no ſuch place as Hell. R: Wood.</hi> And ſecondly, Thou ſayeſt they ſay,
<hi>There is no ſuch place as Heaven,</hi> which are lyes; for the wicked ſhall be turned into
Hell, and all that forget God; and Heaven is Gods Throne. Againe, thou ſayeſt, they
ſay, <hi>There is no Reſurrection of the Body;</hi> Reſurrection to condemnation thou ſhalt
witneſſe, which we witneſſe, who doe witneſſe a Reſurrection to life, according to the
Scriptures: And <hi>R: Wood</hi> thou ſayeſt the Judges ſate at <hi>White-hall,</hi> which is another
of thy lyes: The Scriptures the Old and New Teſtament the Children of light do owne,
and the Scriptures ſaith, <hi>God is the Word,</hi> which we witneſſe according to Scripture,
which maketh ſuch lying fellowes as Thee to rage: And <hi>R: Wood</hi> when thou haſt utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
forth thy lyes, thou ſayeſt, <hi>Pure Rogues to roſt.</hi> O Tyranny! here upon Record
to all the Nation thou art, what ſpirit thou art of, and whoſe Servant thou art. And
thou ſets in thy Book, <hi>John Boulton, Simon Dring, William Rayman, Richard Davis,</hi>
whoſe Names thou art not worthy to mention, ſuch as be men fearing God, and their
witneſſe ſtands againſt the deceits and lyes, The light in thy Conſcience ſhall witneſſe it,
We are juſtified by faith in Chriſt, which faith works by love.</p>
