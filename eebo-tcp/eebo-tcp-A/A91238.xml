         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by the Enemies or others, the contrary effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they ever occaſion, both in Peace and War.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In times of open Wars Garriſons bring theſe manifold Evils and Miſeries on the adjacent Countrey Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and contributing Friends and Neighbors near them, inſtead of any real benefit or protection from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they neither do, will nor can afford them in their greateſt needs, though they voluntarily or by co-action (againſt all Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Conſcience largely contribute to their forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſupplying for this end. 1, Upon the approach of any Enemy to beſiege them, theſe very Garriſons (their Friends and Protectors) like profeſſed Enemies, oft fire their adjourning Houſes, cut, pull down their Trees, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Fences, Ditches, Walls, Pales, drive away all their Cattel, carry away all their Goods, Money, Plate, Arms, Houſhold-Stuff, with their very Houſhold Proviſions into their Garriſons; by meer violence againſt their wills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, cryes, tears, without any price or conſideration at all, to victual and furniſh the Garriſons with neceſſaries againſt the Siege, or elſe to preſerve them (before the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approach) from the enemies poſſeſſion or Plunder, who elſe would ſeiſe them to their diſadvantage, when as the Enemies for their own better accommodation, would uſe them more favorably, and not plunder them half ſo much as theſe their pretended Friends and new Protectors. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They are more frequently viſited, Plundred, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, captivated, fined, ranſomed by the Enemy upon all advantages and occaſions, when there is no Siege, then places more remote from Garriſons, and not contributing to them for protection, upon theſe two accompts. 1. To deprive or ſtraiten theſe Garriſons the more of all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, neceſſaries, Supplies and Contributions from them, if not totally to withdraw them from them. 2. Becauſe they accompt them their profeſſed Enemies, for being Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buters, Friends, Neighbors to theſe Garriſons, &amp; ſo all they have is lawful Plunder without diſpute, unleſſe they will redeem it, by Fines or Ranſom s, or by paying as great
<pb facs="tcp:115467:13"/>
or greater conſtant Contributions to them and their nex t adjoyning Garriſons, as they do to thoſe, to live in Peace; being thus made a double prey to both ſides, under colour of Protection by and from both. An intolerable double Preſſure and Impoſition, of which our late Wars afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many experimental Preſidents, in moſt places next to Garriſons; who if the pillaging Enemies be ſtrong at any time, neither will, dare not ought (as they hold by the Laws of War to ſtir out of their Garriſons to encounter or protect their country neighboring contributors from their Plunder, even un er their Walls and view, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, and loſing the Garriſon to them: Such notable uſeful Protectors are they to the adjacent Countrey, as not to ſtir one foot to help them at their greateſt needs, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to their Enemies ſpoil without reſiſtance, if una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to protect themſelves. Thirdly, They are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any others of the Country further of, oppreſſed, vexed, hindred, impoveriſhed, with the ſeiſing impreſting of their Servants, Children, Ploughs, Carts, Horſes, and ſometimes taking them quite away, by both ſides alike, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for publick ſervices or private occaſions, to their vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or undoing. Fourthly, They are more oppreſſed by laboring in, and contributing to theſe Garriſons Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carrying in their Ammunition and other Proviſions coſt-free, or for little pay &amp; that long ere received) conſtant Contributions to their Garriſons; quartering, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quartering, inſolences, outrages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abuſes of the Garriſon Soldiers, of marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing Parties of the Field Army it ſelf, when drawn into Quarters, then any parties more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Garriſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their perſons more oft Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, Beaten, Wounded, their Wives, Children, Servants, more abuſed, their houſes more ranſacked; Goods, Monies, more frequently ſeiſed and taken away upon malice, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, pretences by crafty Knaves, Officers and pillaging Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then others farther off them. Fifthly, When theſe Garriſons are beſieged (as uſually and frequently they are) their Preſſures and Miſeries are beyond expreſſion: The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115467:13"/>
Men, if well affected to the Garriſons, are all forced by fear or otherwiſe from their Houſes into the Garriſons, Woods or other Counties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not their Wives, Children, and whole Families likewiſe, to avoid the Fury, Preſſures, Troubles, Inſolencies of the beſieging Enemies, who fill all their houſes with their free-quartering rude abuſive Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, eating, drinking up all their Beer and other Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever for man or beaſt, both within &amp; without, not leaving them or their Families bread to eat, or beer to drink, nor yet any Bed, Bolſter, Cuſhion, or ought elſe to reſt their heads on, or Straw to lie in: Tread and eat out all their Graſſe, Hay, Corn ſtanding or cut, with their Horſes: kill, devour, drive away all their Stock, Cattel, which the Garriſons have left them, as good booty; burn up all their Pales, Houſes, Wood, Timber-Trees, fruit-Trees, for firing, &amp; ſoon make them all as poor as <hi>Job</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are more frequently then any others of the Countrey further off, oppreſſed, vexed, hindred, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, as aforeſaid; and every new Siege by either party reiterates the ſame or worſe effects as the firſt, to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated beggerie, as many late experiments freſh in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds about <hi>Plimouth, Exceſter, Lime, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In theſe Garriſon'd Leaguers their Gardens, Grounds, Orchards Houſes, are frequentlie deſtroyed, digged up, or pulled down, their Trees and Timber felled, their Men, Women, Children, Ploughs, Carts, Horſes forced day after day, to toile and labour in making Trenches, Sconces, Batteries, Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees, Mines, Redoubts, or carry Timber, Proviſions, Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,

Armes, and other Baggage, which remoter Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes are free from; and themſelves would be ſo too, but for theſe Garriſons, which occaſion and enforce theſe Sieges. 8. If the Oppoſites Field Armie or ſtrong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from them during the Sieges, approach to raiſe them, or to victual or relieve the Garriſons, the oppreſſions of the adjoyning Parts ate then doubled, trebled, and ſpread wider round about theſe Garriſons, till the whole Country, ten, twenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thirty miles about, by the long quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lying of ſo many Armies, Parties upon them, and Marches to and fro to take or relieve the Garriſons, be quite undone and eaten out; and ſo one or both Armies neceſſitated to ſeek out freſh quarters; or the Garriſons taken or relieved. After this the neceſſitated neer-ſtarved Garriſons requiring new ſupplies of all ſorts, if not taken, extort them from the adjacent Countries, if they be to be had above ground, which addes much to all their former afflictions: And then again ſome other new Sieges or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions drawing one or both Armies thither afreſh, ſo ſoon as the miſerable Country People have gotten any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, they are, to their endleſſe vexation, expoſed afreſh to all the fformer miſeries of Wars, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in his famous voyage to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with a ſmall ſquadron of ſhips, entred five of the chiefe Ports the Spaniards there held<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took and fired their ſhips there riding under their Caſtles, Forts, Blockhouſes, and pillaged their Towns themſelves, notwithſtanding all their Cannons and Artiliry playing upon his ſhips, both from their Forts, Caſtles, Blockhouſes and Ships there riding, and that without the loſſe, ſinking or ſpoyling of any one of his Veſsels: And ſome other Engliſh Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Captains then and ſince did the like, as Mr. <hi>Harkluit</hi> in his printed <hi>Voyages</hi> at large relates. 2. Our Engliſh Navy in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, in their expedition againſt <hi>Cadez,</hi> tooke the whole Iland and City in one day, burnt and tooke all their ſhips, treaſure, magazine and ordnance there, notwithſtanding all their forts, block-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, numerous mounted Cannons diſcharged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115467:17"/>
them, without the loſs or ſpoil of any one ſhip, and of very few men, as Mr. <hi>Cambden, Speed,</hi> and others inform us in her life. 3. The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West-Indies</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entred the <hi>Spaniſh Havens</hi> with their ſhips, in deſpite of all their Cannons, Forts and Blockhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, anchored in them, and pillaged, fired, took the Spaniſh Veſsels riding in them under their Caſtles, without the ſinking of any one man of Warre by their Cannons firing, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Purchas</hi> and <hi>Hackluit</hi> in their Voyages, and others record. 4. The Dutch men of Warre, and other Veſsels have ſundry times in a drunken <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado,</hi> at mid-day paſsed in and out of our <hi>Harbors</hi> at <hi>Harwich, Plimouth, Falmouth, &amp; Southampton,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriking ſail to the Forts there, and gone away without any hurt, danger, ſtop, notwithſtanding all their cannon-ſhot to bring them in, as <hi>I</hi> have heard by many credible eye-witneſſes. 5. <hi>Sir Robert Manſel</hi> in his Voyage againſt <hi>Algier,</hi> with his boats fired ſundry of their ſhips, drawn on ſhore under their Caſtle-walls &amp; blockhouſes, without the loſs of one boat or ſhip, and very few men, notwithſtanding many thouſands of cannon and more of musket-ſhot from the caſtle and ſhips, as Captain <hi>George Carteret</hi> who ſaw it, and was active in it, informed mee whiles <hi>I</hi> was priſoner in <hi>Jerſey.</hi> 6. Since our late unhappy wars, two very ſmall ſquadrons of our ſhips ſucceſſively landed the Parliaments forces under the very blockhouſes and forts of <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> without the loſs or hurt of one ſhip or barque by their Cannon ſhot, and with the loſs of very few
<pb facs="tcp:115467:18"/>
men, and reduced the Caſtles and Ilands too with a farre leſſer land-force then the King had there in arms to defend them. Since this, <hi>Sir George Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough</hi> with a ſmal Navy entred into the chief part &amp; harbor at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> took &amp; brought out thence fourteen or more Dutch Veſſels, and others riding therein, paſſing and repaſsing, without the loſs, ſinking, hurt, of any one ſhip, or ſlaughter of one man, within half piſtol ſhot of their caſtle and blockhouſes, which plaid upon his ships all the time with their cannon &amp; musket ſhot; and ſoon after he reduced the whole Iland notwithſtanding all their forts and forces; as the printed <hi>Diurnalls</hi> and <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of its taking, and <hi>Letters</hi> thence inform us. 7. Since this I read in our <hi>Diurnalls,</hi> that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took ſome of our Merchants ſhips riding under the Caſtles and Blockhouſes of our Engliſh Plantations in the Indies, which played upon him with their cannon without hurt, he returning them two cannon ſhot for one, and riding within musket ſhot of them without any fear or hurt. 8. To come home to <hi>Pendennis Castle</hi> and <hi>St. Mawdits,</hi> ſo much cryed up as the moſt uſefull and conſiderable of all other: Whiles they were in the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſince theſe warres, as the inhabitants and ſome ſouldiers aſſure me, a ſingle man of warre of the Parliaments party in the day-time entred the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, boorded, took and carried away thence a rich ſhip there riding in the view of both the Garriſons, notwithſtanding all their cannon ſhot and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, without any harm at all, ſhee ſhooting as faſt at the caſtles as they ſhot at her, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115467:18"/>
with her prize. 9. Since my impriſonment in <hi>Pendennis Caſtle,</hi> a Turkiſh man of Warr at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in the view of all the Garriſon, and my ſelfe, came up to the mouth of the Harbor, and very neer the Blockhouſe, took a great Engliſh Lighter of thirty tun, ſunk the veſſell in the place, and carried away ſome twelve perſons in it priſoners into <hi>Sally</hi> or <hi>Tunis;</hi> after which, she came cloſe up to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor two or three mornings together till chaſed away from thence by a Man of Warre; One ſtout ſhip of Warre being a better guard againſt Pyrates and Sea-enemies then all the Maritine forts and garriſons, being able to purſue, fight and take them, which no forts or garriſons can do.

Captain, Gunners, and ſouldiers told mee, They would warrant mee ſhee would come in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; but I obſerving her courſe, told them, <hi>Shee would no more come in to their lure then a wilde Hawke got looſe;</hi> whereupon both Caſtles diſcharged their cannons in earneſt, to hit, ſink, or bring her back through fear, but ſhee in deſpite of them (though there were two men of warre before, and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her under ſaile) got away from them all without any hurt or ſtop, the whole Garriſon looking on.
