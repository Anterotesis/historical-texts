            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a good Engliſh Proverbe
amongſt us, that <hi>he that neglectes
the occaſion, the occaſion will neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
him. Solomon</hi> wiſely begins
his Proverbes with it: for he
bringeth in the Wiſdome of his Father in
theſe five particulars: firſt, <hi>making a generall
Proclamation</hi> in the 20. verſe, <hi>Wiſdome crieth
without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the ſtreets.</hi> He
compareth God unto a cryer that goeth up and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40602:4"/>
down the Citie from ſtréet to ſtréet, and from
doore to doore, crying his commodity, even the
richeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ever was, which is a Chriſt, a Chriſt
for <hi>redemption,</hi> a Chriſt for <hi>ſanctification,</hi> a
Chriſt to <hi>enlighten</hi> thoſe that walke in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and in the ſhadow of death. <hi>Ho, every one
that thirſteth,</hi> here is a <hi>Chriſt</hi> for you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is a <hi>mercifull reprehenſion,</hi>
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 22. verſe, <hi>O ye fooliſh, how long will you
love fooliſhneſſe, and you ſcornors take pleaſure
in ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orning?</hi> Fooliſh indéed to be without Chriſt
fooliſh to be without grace, fooliſh to chafer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our ſouls for ſin. <hi>How long yee ſcorners
will you take pleaſure in ſcorning?</hi> will you <hi>ſtill</hi>
perſiſt in your wickedneſſ, &amp; never have done
with your ſins? will you never turne back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but damne your ſouls for ever? <hi>O yee
fooliſh, how long will you love fooliſhneſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is <hi>a gracious exhortation</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
23 verſe: <hi>Turne you at my correction: lo, I wil
poure out my mind unto you, and make you to
underſtand my words.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do
you not ſée how you are going a pace to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that the way you take, leadeth unto
deſtruction? turne ye therefore, turn ye back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
for there is a Chriſt behind you; Oturn ye;
for if ye go on in your ſins, you periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, here is <hi>a yearning promiſe</hi> made
unto the world, in the end of the 23. verſe; <hi>Lo,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40602:4"/>
I will poure out my ſpirt upon you, and cauſe
you to underſtand my words.</hi> As if he ſhould
ſay, returne back againe with me, &amp; you ſhall
have better welcom then you can poſſibly have
if you go on in your ſins, the devill wil never
let you gain ſo much by your living in your luſt
as you ſhall do by repentance for them, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of them. For <hi>behold I will poure out
my ſpirit upon you,</hi> whereby you ſhalbe farre
greater gainers, then you ſhal be by your
ſins.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, here is <hi>a grievous threatning</hi> againſt
the world, even all thoſe that have loytered out
the day of grace. As time and tide ſtays for no
man, no more doth the day of grace: <hi>Becauſe I
have called, and you refuſed; I haue exhorted, but
you have not regarded;</hi> I have denounced judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt you for your ſins, but you have
hardned your hearts; now a day of woe and
miſerie ſhall come upon you, a time of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and deſolation ſhall over take you: there
will a day come wherein there wil be wéeping,
and crying Mercie (Lord) mercie, but I tell
you before-hand what you ſhall truſt to: let
this be your leſſon, now I call, &amp; you will not
hear; now I ſtretch out my hands, but you wil
not regard: <hi>you ſhall ſeeke me eraly, but you
ſhall not find me: and ſhall cry, but you ſhall
not be heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40602:5"/>
The words are a thunderclap againſt all
thoſe that procraſtinate their repentance, and
returning home unto God. Wherein <hi>note,</hi> firſt,
<hi>the parties</hi> themſelvs that do prolong this time
of grace, <hi>they:</hi> that is, they who when God
cals on them, will not heare; when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
them by his mercies, patience, &amp; forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
by his Miniſters &amp; ſervants, by his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
&amp; judgements, by all faire means, &amp;
fowl means, yet withſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means of grace:
<hi>they</hi> are the men, <hi>they</hi> ſhall call, but God will
not anſwer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is <hi>there ſeeking after God;</hi>
they ſhall <hi>call upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is their <hi>earneſt &amp; diligent ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d;</hi> they ſhall not only <hi>call,</hi> but ſéek
to, and not onely ſeek, but ſéek as to <hi>labour</hi> to
find: nay they ſhall ſéek me <hi>early,</hi> even ſtrive
to go about it with all haſt, and flie to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>but they ſhall not find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, here is <hi>the unſeaſonableneſſe of the
time</hi> of their ſéeking, <hi>then:</hi> that is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative,
<hi>then:</hi> even a time which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord points
at: as if he ſhould ſay, you ſhall ſée <hi>then</hi> theſe
men will be of an other mind, <hi>then</hi> they will be
glad to be converted, <hi>then</hi> they will be glad to
come out of their ſins, <hi>then</hi> they will be glad to
get grace &amp; ſéek reconciliation with God: but
alas! they ſaw not this <hi>then,</hi> but God foreſaw
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40602:5"/>
it well enough, <hi>then ſhall they call but I will
not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they
ſhall not find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, here is the <hi>fruſtration of their hope,</hi>
which hath <hi>two</hi> things in it. Firſt, <hi>in regard
of their ſelves,</hi> in regard of the flaw of their
ſéeking, it being not aright. Secondly, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the juſtice of God,</hi> who rewards every
man according to his works. <hi>but I will not hear
them.</hi> Whence obſerve this point of Doctrine.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>DOCTRINE. .I</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe that will not heare God when he calleth
them, God will not hear them when they call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</hi> Thoſe that will not heare the Lord
when he calleth upon them by the miniſtery
of his Word, and voice of his Spirit, the Lord
will not heare them, when in their miſery they
call upon him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord dealt with the people in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiels</hi>
dayes; the Lord called them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and obedience: but when they ſtood out, &amp;
neglected the opportunity of grace, and ſeaſons
of converſion, ſée how God deales with them:
<hi>though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,
yet I will not heare them</hi> (ſaith the Lord,)
When men have gone beyond <hi>the time</hi> of Gods
mercy, &amp; out-rowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tide of Gods forbearance &amp;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40602:6"/>
wil not return, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſets it down with him
ſelfe, that his wrath ſhal returne upon them,
he will no longer forbeare: they had <hi>a time</hi>
wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord did pitie them, &amp; offered grac
and mercy unto them, but they <hi>neglecting</hi> this
ſeaſon, and withſtanding this proffer of grace
God reſolves with himſelfe they ſhall never
have it againe. There was a time wherein
God did pittie them, but now he will not pity
them any more; twenty <hi>five</hi> yéers he called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and ſought to bring them home: but
becauſe they ſtood out and refuſed, the Lord
ſaith; <hi>I will love Ephraim no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, there is a <hi>double</hi> day, a <hi>white</hi> day
and a <hi>black</hi> day; there is <hi>a day of ſalvation,
Iſa.</hi> 49. 9. this is the day in which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaid
to the priſoners, <hi>Come foorth:</hi> and to thoſe
that lie in their ſins, <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>beleeve.</hi> Now
if any man will come foorth and humble his
ſoule before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, let him come &amp; welcome,
for it is a day of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day of <hi>damnation,</hi> which is a darke day, a
black &amp; a duskie day, wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord wil viſite
the ſins of the world, and revenge the quarrell
of this Covenant. <hi>Hoſ. 9. 7. The day of viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is come, yea the day of recompence, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall know it; the Prophet is a foole, and the
ſpirituall man is mad.</hi> Beloved, we are fooles
and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall men under heaven are mad
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40602:6"/>
that lay not this day to heart. For the day of
the Lord is a day of viſitation, &amp; all the world
ſhall rue it, though now men ſléepe in ſecurity.
If once mercy be rejected, and God turn away
his eare from a man, then grace ſhalbe no more
the doore of life ſhall for ever be ſhut up againſt
him: and when once this day comes, he hath
loſt his owne peace, and deprived himſelfe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now there are <hi>three Reaſons</hi> of this point;
the firſt is the <hi>law of retaliation,</hi> of rendring
like for like, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> juſtreſt law that can be
made with man, for to give unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his works, to make him take ſuch as
he brings, (as the heathen call it) to give a
man <hi>quid</hi> for <hi>quo.</hi> Now if God call upon thée,
and thou wilt not heare; it is righteouſneſſe
with God, yea equity with God (that is more)

notice of it, &amp; ſets it dowue in his Calender, &amp;
records it in his Memoriall; kéeping a ſtrict

is it ſo? I <hi>now call,</hi> and will not this man or
that woman <hi>anſwer?</hi> Do I now ſtretch out my
hands, and will not they take care to obey me?
Well? let them alone (ſaith God) there is a
day comming that I ſhalbe a hearing of them;
times of ſorrow and miſery will take hold of
them, and then they in their aflictions will
cry unto me, but I will not heare, they will beg

                  <hi>His prayer ſhal be abominable,</hi> he doth not

therefore a greater Puniſhment the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth;
So God doth not ſay he will turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

               <p>Thirdly, it is Gods uſe to do ſo in other

Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>So God tooke <hi>Iſmael</hi> an hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene
yéers before he died: <hi>twenty</hi> years God
offered him grace and repentance, but he would
not take warning; a mocker he was, and a
mocker he would be, for he mocked <hi>Iſaac</hi> when
he was a child <hi>ſix</hi> yeares old; and no meanes
would reclaim him, before he heard the voice,
<hi>Caſt out the bond woman and her ſonne:</hi> Out
with him, (ſaith God) for he ſhall never be
heire with my ſonne: this was an hundred
and ſeventéen years before <hi>Iſmaels</hi> death.</p>
               <p>And ſo God took <hi>Saul,</hi> five and thirty, or ſix
and thirty yeares before he died, according to
<hi>Ioſephus Chronology,</hi> (if it be true;) now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
he tooke him divers yeares before his
death: for ſo the Scripture makes it plaine
1 <hi>Sam. 15. 29. The ſtrength of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not
lie nor repent; for he is not a man that he ſhould
repent. Therefore becauſe thou haſt rejected
the word of the Lord, the Lord alſo hath reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee from being a King.</hi> And doe not think
that thou by thy prayers, and crying God
mercy, canſt ever alter him: for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
is <hi>immutable,</hi> and he is ſtrong in his
decrée, and cannot change. <hi>Hetherto</hi> Orace
and Mercy have béen offered thée, which
if thou hadſt imbraced, thou mighteſt have

ſhould have béen eſtabliſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

the ſtrength of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cannot lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God tooke <hi>Eſau fiftie</hi> years before his
death: for ſo long he lived, after he ſought the
bleſſing with teares: but he was a hunting
when God was a calling: he was following
his prophaineneſſe when God was wooing
him to Repentance. At laſt when he called for
Repentance, and ſought it earneſtly, yea his
Soule was carefull for to get it; yet he could
never obtaine it, though he ſought it earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with teares of fiftie yeares before he died.</p>
               <p>Now if the Lord ſo ſeverely puniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

                  </gap>
puniſh the contempt of proffers of <hi>Grace</hi> and
Salvation! I tell you, God will be more ſtrict
in revenging of this ſinne, then of any other
ſinne: he will come with Martiall law againſt
all thoſe that contemne his Goſpell, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18.
<hi>He that beleeveth not, is condemned already,</hi>
Doth Chriſt preach repentance and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Kingdome of God; and wilt thou
not repent and beléeve? Martiall Law (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved)
martiall Law, hang him up; for he is
condemned already. Even like a Souldier
that revels againſt his Generall, and forſake
his <hi>Colours,</hi> they doe not caſt him into priſon,
and ſtay for the Aſſizes or Seſſions, but give
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40602:10"/>
him <hi>Mattiall</hi> Law, even hang him up: So if
the Lord ſound his Goſpell in thine ears, and
offers thée conditions of peace, knocking at
the doore of thy heart by his Spirit; and thou
refuſe to open to him thou art condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
for <hi>the ſtrength of Iſrael cannot lie, nor
repent.</hi> Oh therefore take héed now whiles
his word ſounds in thine ears, While his
Spirit ſecretly whiſpers in thy heart to thée,
open to him, for elſe thou art condemned
for ever.</p>
               <p>Take notice then, that God doth <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
give men a <hi>day,</hi> and no man or Angel doth
know <hi>how long</hi> this day laſteth. To ſome it
laſteth to their laſh gaſp; to ſome, to their
old age; and to ſome it is cut off in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
God gave the Angels a day, the which
becauſe they neglected, they are reſerved in
chains of darkneſſe untill the great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

all the time of this day, though <hi>Cain</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againe and againe, and went on in his

a ſtill voice, <hi>If thou doe well Cain, ſhalt thou
not be accepted? but if thou doſt ill, ſinne lieth
at the dore,</hi> But when no means will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
but <hi>Cain</hi> will go on adding ſin to ſin, and
murder unto all the reſt of his ſinnes, and ſo
let go the ſeaſon of mercy, the Lord tells him
<pb n="02" facs="tcp:40602:11"/>
from heaven, that the day of grace is paſt, the
gate of mercy is ſhut againſt thée: for <hi>thou art
now accurſed from the earth.</hi> As if the Lord
ſhould ſay; Before I gave thée a day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and offered thée mercie, but thou
wouldſt not accept of it; but now I have clapt
a curſe upon thy ſoule, that thou ſhalt never
claw it off. So God gave <hi>Niniveh</hi> a day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>Ionnah 3. Yet fourty dayes and</hi> Niniveh
<hi>ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> God gave the Fig-trée a
day, even <hi>three</hi> years, before he would have it
cut down. God gave the old world a day of an
hundred and twenty years; during this time
God ſent unto them <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of
Righteouſneſſe, to call upon them to repent,
and ſo ſet it down alſo, that <hi>his Spirit ſhall not
alwaies ſtrive with man, but his time ſhall be
an hundred and twenty yeares:</hi> yet one writs
that the Lord cut off twenty of the hundred
and twenty yeares, becauſe of their iniquities
which were ſo grievous, and provoked him
ſo much, that they haſted him to come before
he would have done. In all this ſpace if they
had Repented, they ſhould have found Mercy
from the Lord: but when his time was gone
and the day of grace was out, the deluge came
in upon them, and God by his judgements o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
the whole World.</p>

and mourne one towards another.</hi> There
is many a ſoule for contemning of God, and
not taking up Repentance while they may
have it, this plague of God is come upon them,
that they are ever repenting, and are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Repent, ever poring upon their ſinnes,
but never able to come out of them: they

               <p>And as there is a <hi>Perſonall</hi> day, ſo there is

find mercy; but if they neglect that day, then
God will hide thoſe things from their eyes
that belong to their peace, as Chriſt ſaith of

you ſhall ſée in the twentieth of <hi>Matthew,</hi>
that they were not called at the firſt houre,
nor at the ſecond nor third houre, nor at the

ſixth and ninth houre. Well, doth God call
thée in thy childhood, in thy youth, or in thy
middle age; now at the firſt or ſixth, or ninth
houre, now come in and labour in Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
<hi>and work out your ſalvation with feare
and trembling,</hi> and make uſe of the ſeaſon of
grace; now whilſt it is upon you: for if thou
be called at the firſt houre, the ſixt is for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not for thée; if thou be called the
ſixt hour, the ninth hour is for others and not
for thée; if thou be called the ninth hour, the
eleventh hour is for others &amp; not for thée; The
text ſaith, <hi>He came &amp; found others ſtanding jdle
in the market place, and ſaid unto them, Why
ſtand ye here jdle? and they ſay unto him, no
man hath hired us;</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, We
never had any means of ſalvation, we have
had no Miniſters to preach unto us; but now
God calls upon thée to come in, this is thy
houre, look unto it. If God call thée, ſée thou
come in, whether it be at the firſt or third
houre, at the ſixth or ninth houre, leſt the
Lord in his wrath clap hardneſſe of heart upon
thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> that the day of
life, and the day of grace are paralleld, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
one to another; and therefore there is
hope ſo long as a man remains in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>2 <hi>In regard of a mans own ſelfe, he is ſo bound

not to be ſinnes, till a man is actually in Hell;
when he is in hell, then they are no ſinnes,
becauſe then he is not commanded to believe,
but are part of the puniſhment of the damnes;
but whilſt a man lives it is a ſin, for men
are now bound to lay hold upon Chriſt and to

               <p>1. Becauſe <hi>God may harden a mans heart,
Jerem,</hi> 13. 10. and deale with them as with

thy Repentance is hypocriticall and nought;

Stay (ſaith his conſcience) no, he would not

this mans ſinne? Was it his offering of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

the Lord commands us to call upon him in
time of diſtreſſe; and being commanded it
was lawfull. Was it his ſinne to meddle
with the Prieſts office? No: for he did but
appoint the ſacrifice, the Prieſt offered it.
What? was it the breaking of one houres
time? No: for he had ſinned more againſt
God, then ſo: but this was his ſinne, that he
<hi>went againſt his own conſcience,</hi> when God
ſtood in the way: when conſcience ſtood in

The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Gods patience is in

Gods ſhoulder, to looke into Gods decrée,

thou art guilty of ten thouſand ſinnes, and

               <p>Fourthly, it is a <hi>forewarning (for:</hi>) rent

               <p>Fiftly, it is a <hi>threatning [for:]</hi> now he is

will end, his patience will end, and then if thou
haſt not rent thy heart before, it will be too late
then. Therefore as ever thou loveſt thine own

God.</p>
               <p>It is Gods own proclamation; <hi>The Lord,

               <p>Let but a ſoule come proſtrate before him,
humbling his ſoule, he will pardon his ſinné.
But as it followeth in the words; <hi>He will

Beloved, men run on in their ſins, as if ſo

if you ever heard the Lord God ſay to any of

patience giveth no marks or inkling of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ends:</hi> commonly when God ſtrikes a
man with death, he giveth ſome ſignes, or
warnings of it before, as ſickneſſe and paines,
and gray hairs, and many ſorrows, &amp;c. Now
becauſe thy life is in Gods hands, thou careſt
not for it, but ventureſt to goe on in thy ſins,
hoping to have ſome warning though thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
be cut off without it; but the day of
grace may come to an end, and yet thou
never have any inkling or warning of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand:
commonly when God ſtrikes a
man with death, he tells him of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
by aches and pains, as if the Lord
ſhould ſay, Now thou ſhalt die, now will I
take thée out of the world, But when the
Lord taketh away the day of grace from a
man, though the ſpirituall man may take
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40602:20"/>
ſome notice of it, yet there is no ſenſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of it, but after the day of grace is ſet
upon a man, he may be as ſtrong and luſtrie as
before, he may come to Church as well after
as before, performe religious duties, and do
many good things, as well after as before;
as <hi>Saul</hi> went on in duties of Religion, as
well after <hi>Samuel</hi> had pronounced the Lords
doome upon him, how many times was he
offering ſacrifice unto the Lord after the
Prophet told him, that he was a man <hi>reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
how many good ſpéeches came from
him? as when <hi>Samuel</hi> met him, he ſalutes
him with theſe words; <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the
Lord, I pray thee turne againe with me, that
I may worſhip the Lord.</hi> A man would have
thought that <hi>Saul</hi> had beene a good convert.
No, no, before al this his judgment and doome
was ſet upon him; God ſteales upon him and
ſaies nothing; he claps his plague upon their
ſouls and holds his peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaiah. 42. 14. I have a long time held my
peace, I have beene ſtill, and refrained my

I will deſtroy, and devoure at once.</hi>
The Lord ſhewes here how he deales with
men, they goe on in their ſinnes, but the
Lord holds his peace; they provoke him
every day, but the Lord refraines his

anger: but now all at once his wrath breat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
foorth upon them, <hi>Pſal. 64. 7. God will
ſhoot an arrow at them ſuddenly,</hi> their
ſtroke ſhalbe at once, The Lord ſuddenly
ſhoots a ſwift arrow at thée? no ſooner
it is ſhot, but it enters into thy bowels.
When the Lord comes upon a man, he
comes ſuddenly; when he ends the day of
grace upon him, he doth it ſuddenly. He
ended the day of grace on the Scribes and
Phariſées even in the very Sermon time,
While Chriſt was preaching unto them,
they were delivered up to hardneſſe of
heart: ſo many were delivered up to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart in the time of <hi>Hoſea's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
<hi>Hoſea 4. 17. Epharim is joyned to
jdols, let him alone</hi> (ſaith God:) as if he
ſhould ſay, Sermou, let him alone; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
let him alone; Spirit, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
Chriſt, let him alone, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
Beloved, if we ſtand out againſt
God, and reject the day of grace, the Lord
may ſay, Word, let ſuch aman alone,
and never convert him; Chriſt, let ſuch a
man alone, and never redéeme him; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
let ſuch a man alone; and never ſanctifie
him; Sacraments, let ſuch a man alone
and never ſeale up any comforts unto him;
a fearefull ſigne that men are come to this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40602:21"/>
hours; do we not ſée that men come to the
Word; and the Word lets them alone in their
ſins? do not men come to the Sacrament,
and the Sacrament leaves them ſtill in their
filthineſſe? men come unto good dtuies,
but good duties let them alone, and do them
no good: and this is the condition of many
thouſands in the world. Therefore oh thinke
upon this you that have made a league with
your ſinns, and an agréement with hell; hear
this delivered to you this day, that the day of
grace may be ended, and God may come
and clap his curſe upon men, and never give
them any inkling of it at all.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>God reckons
upon every houre,</hi> if God kept not a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of time, how many Sermons you have
had, how many mercies you have enjoyed
how many croſſes he hath warned you by:
if God kept not a true talle and account of
every houres time; you might rub on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes, and moneths, and yéeres, and
ſpend much time in fulfilling of your luſts, but
God kéepeth a reckoning of theſe things.
yea of every houre, and of every minute.
<hi>Act. 17. 30. The times of ignorance God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not; but now he admoniſheth all men
to repent.</hi> Alas when men live in their ſins
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40602:21"/>
through blindneſſe and ignorance, and know
not God, the Lord takes no ſuch ſtrict no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, but lets them goe on longer
and longer; but when the Lord ſend them
his Word and Goſpel, and affords them the
meanes of grace, he doth the more ſtrictly
looke unto them, and takes the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
account of them before they had the
meanes of grace, the Lord <hi>winked</hi> at
them, and did not ſo narrowly watch
them, but looked over mens ignorance,
(as the originall hath it) but now God
ſends his Word and Goſpel, he <hi>admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all men to repent,</hi> he winks at never
an houre, but ſets downe how oft thou
haſt had exhortation from thy Miniſter, how
often thou haſt had warning by ſickneſſe
and afflictions, how often thou haſt had
chéeks from thine owne conſcience, how
many admonitions thou haſt had from thy
friends, how many times thou haſt had the
ſound of the Goſpel to ſound in thy eares to
bring thée home unto God, <hi>John</hi> 2. 7. 11.
<hi>This is the firſt beginning of miracles that
Jeſus did, John 4. 58. This is the ſecond
miracle that Ieſus did,</hi> ſaith the Text, God
ſets downe, this is the firſt, this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time: <hi>This is the ſecond Epiſtle I
wrote to you</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> Oh this is <hi>the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40602:22"/>
third time</hi> I wrote unto you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. that
when I come I will not ſpare: ſo God ſets
it downe in his catalogue, this is the firſt
time that I have warned this man, this is
the ſecond time, this is the third time, that
when I come I will not ſpare; the Lord
counts how long he hath ſought unto thée,
and intreated thée by his mercies, how
long he hath allured thée by his Word,
how long he hath warned thée by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how oft he hath ſmote thy heart with
feares, and thy conſcience with terrours.
Now if for all this thou wilt not returne, juſt
is it with God to caſt thée downe to hell for
ever.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon, and laſt: <hi>it is a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the day of grace is not ended already,
and that thou art not now in hell,</hi> When a
thing in this kind is looked for to be done,
it is a wonder that it is not done: it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
mercie of God unto this Kingdome
that yet the day of grace is continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, in regard of our long feare and
expectation of the contrary. For from the
higheſt to the loweſt we have highly revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more and more, and provoked God to
his very face. What contempt of Gods
Word? what neglect of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40602:22"/>
what prophanation of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths?
what ſcoffing aud deriding of Gods
ſervants? how doth wickedneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe
ſtand up into the higheſt roome,
climbe up into the higheſt chambers? But as
a whore condemned to die being with childe
is reprived for a time, untill her childe
be brought foorth: ſo this Land hath gone a
whoring from God, yet ſo long as God hath
ſome children to be brought foorth, which are
not yet come unto the birth, he lets his
grace and Goſpel continue untill theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be brought forth. Therefore now (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
if we ſtick at the birth and come
not foorth, an hundred to one but we ſhall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt comes firſt to thy ſoule,
he witneſſeth grace aud mercy to thée, if
thou wilt repent and amend; yea he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſalvation, if thou wilt beléeve;
but if not, he will be <hi>a ſwift witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee, Malachi.</hi> 3. 5. if thou continue
and goeſt on in thy ſinnes: <hi>Agree with
thine adverſary, while thou art in the way
quickly, Matthew</hi> 5. 25. Now God is in
the <hi>way</hi> with thée,, Chriſt and his Spirit
are in the way with thée; thou néedeſt
not now ſay, <hi>Who ſhall go up to heaven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40602:23"/>
and bring downe the Spirit</hi> to thée; Chriſts
Spirit is now knocking at thy heart, and
now God offers this mercy to thée, now
thou art in the way, now he calls unto
thée to accept of his mercy, now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thée to take Chriſt, now heare him,
calling to thy heart, now he tenders,
grace unto thée imbrace it; now receive
Chriſt and make up thy peace with him:
remember the ſaying of the Apoſtle
2. <hi>Corinthians 13. 5. Examine your ſelves
whether you be in the faith prove your
ſelves. Know you not your owne ſelves,
how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except you
be reprobates?</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay,
I have béene an Apoſtle to you this yeere
and halfe. I have preached thus and thus
long unto you, I have wrote one Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to you to reforme thoſe abuſes that
were among you? and now I write this
ſecond Epiſtle, to declare the whole will
and counſell of God to you. Now caſt
up your reckoning, examine your ſelves,
and make up your account: ſée if you have
gained Chriſt. O! I have Chriſt, (ſaith
one) I have Chriſt, (ſaith another,) I
but <hi>proue it,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and try
your ſelves: know yée not that by this time
<hi>Chriſt in you,</hi> or elſe you be <hi>reprobates?</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40602:23"/>
As if he ſhould ſay, if yet Chriſt bée not
in you, and grace wrought in your hearts,
if yet you lye feſtring in your ſinnes, and
go one in your wicked wayes, it is to be
feared you are reprobates: either you or
we are reprobates, you for not obeying
or wée not for delivering the truth of God
unto you: <hi>But I truſt that yee ſhall know
that we are not reprobates: verſe</hi> 6. God
forbid that this Word ſhould be ever
ſpoken unto any ſoule in this congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but this let me ſay, is there any
man here that goes on in his luſts, and
in his carnall courſe of life, in pride, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
hardneſſe of heart, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,
that hath not the ſoundneſſe of
grace? he hath a fearfull ſigne and brand
of a reprobate, whoſe conſcience is ſtifled:
it is a fearefull ſigne, if he be not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
before God, yet he is one that
is not <hi>approved,</hi> but for the preſent in a
wretched and miſerable condition. <hi>Now</hi>
is the time of grace wherein God hath
ſpoken to your ſoules, remember that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
that is comming towards you, if it
be rejected, now the Lords fatlings are
ready; his Oxen and Shéepe are ſlaine
and laid upon the board; Chriſt is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
and his blood is ſhed, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40602:24"/>
grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you; you that have grace, get more
grace, you that have no grace, get grace
and Chriſt, and take heede of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
any opportunity of grace;
for that may come unto thee
in one houre, that will
never come
againe.</p>
